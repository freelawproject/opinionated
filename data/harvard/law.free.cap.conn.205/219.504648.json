Ecker, as administratrix of the estate of her husband Robert W. Ecker, brought this wrongful death action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 for injuries her deceased husband received when he was struck by a wooden canopy which fell from a Caldor building.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants include: (1) Henry Porter, doing business as Henry Porter Associates, the owner and lessor of the land and building; (2) Consolidated Engineers and Constructors, Inc., the contractors who designed, constructed and installed the canopy; (3) Charles McCarthy, individually and as the building inspector of the town of West Hartford, who issued the certif\u00edcate of occupancy for the Caldor building; and (4) the town of West Hartford, which employed Charles McCarthy. Caldor, Inc., filed an intervening complaint against the plaintiff and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>defendants for monies it had paid in accordance with the provisions of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">After a jury verdict which was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $1,156,000 against McCarthy as building inspector and the town of West Hartford (hereinafter the defendants), the trial court rendered a final judgment thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants took a timely appeal to the Appellate Court, and the appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendants claim the trial court erred: (1) in refusing to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) in submitting the issue of pain and suffering to the jury; (3) in its charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to the jury regarding the duties of a building inspector and the application of governmental immunity; and (4) in allowing Caldor, Inc., the intervening plaintiff, four peremptory challenges. We find error as to the defendants\u2019 first claim and need not address the other claims raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On February 11, 1981, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, while working as a shipping clerk for Caldor, Inc., in its department store located at 983 New Britain Avenue, West Hartford, was injured when a wooden canopy pulled away from the store wall in the area of the loading dock and fell on him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He subsequently was taken to Hartford Hospital while in a coma, where he died the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In the summer of 1973, renovations had been made to the Caldor building under a building permit issued by McCarthy, the chief building inspector for the town of West Hartford, to Henry Porter, doing business as Henry Porter Associates, the owner and lessor of the building at 983 New Britain Avenue. The permit had been signed by Edward Dombrowski, also a town building inspector, after the plans for the renovations had been reviewed and revised by Joseph Callahan, another town bulding inspector. Consolidated Engineers and Constructors, Inc. (Consolidated), was the general contractor in charge of the renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">During the course of the renovations, the West Hartford building department had made both general and specific inspections of the construction site on at least thirty-five recorded occasions, as required by the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>necticut State Building Code \u00a7\u00a7 111.1 and 111.11.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The inspections were conducted by Joseph Callahan, Thomas Kelley, Donald Soccoli and Thomas Bascetta. In addition, McCarthy did a general walk-through inspection on October 9,1973, to check for any \u201cobvious glaring faults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On October 30 and 31, 1973, further inspections of the building were conducted by Callahan and Soccoli for the purpose of determining whether a certificate of occupancy should be issued. Both inspectors had noted a number of items that had to be remedied, but both gave their approval to McCarthy to issue a temporary certificate of occupancy on October 31, 1973. McCarthy had also conducted a general inspection of the premises from his car by driving around the perimeter of the building, \u201cprimarily looking for a finished grade.\u201d Upon completion of this inspection and having conferred with the other inspectors, McCarthy issued the temporary certificate of occupancy on the same day and the store opened to the public on November 1,1973. The only other inspections of the building were done in late November, 1973, by Callahan, Kelley and Soccoli merely to check if the unfinished items listed on the temporary certificate of occupancy had been completed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, McCarthy issued the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>manent certificate of occupancy on November 30,1973. From November 30, 1973, until February 11, 1981, when the plaintiffs decedent was injured, the building department had not received complaints about the Caldor facility and had not conducted a general inspection of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The wooden canopy was unquestionably in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 315.1<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 315.3<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Connecticut State Building Code in that no permit had been issued, it had been constructed of wood, not metal, and it had no vertical supports or braces. Despite the fact that neither the initial nor the final and revised plans for the renovations showed the canopy, it was erected over the loading dock some time prior to the opening of the store on November 1, 1973.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">This action was filed by the plaintiff on February 17, 1982. An amended complaint was filed on July 27,1983, which the municipal defendants answered on October 17, 1983, alleging only the special defense of governmental immunity for McCarthy. On February 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>1986, the first day of trial, the defendants filed a request to amend their answer to raise by way of special defense, for the first time, the three year time limitation contained within General Statutes \u00a7 52-555. The trial court denied the request on the grounds that it was untimely and substantially prejudicial to the plaintiff. On February 19, 1986, the defendants filed a motion to reconsider the denial of the request to amend their answer which was also denied by the trial court on February 20, 1986. Thereafter, on March 7, 1986, the defendants moved for a directed verdict, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 821,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on the ground that, inter alia, the action was time barred under \u00a7 52-555. The trial court denied this motion. On March 26,1986, two days after the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants renewed this claim by way of a motion to dismiss, a motion to set aside the verdict and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On the same day, the trial court denied the motions and rendered judgment upon the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The principal issue in this appeal is whether a trial court has jurisdiction over a wrongful death action brought more than \u201cthree years from the date of the act or omission complained of\u201d as required by \u00a7 52-555. The defendants claim that \u00a7 52-555 created a new statutory cause of action that did not exist at common law in Connecticut, and thus, must be strictly construed and cannot be extended or enlarged by judicial construction. The defendants further argue that because the statute creates the right of action, the time limitation contained therein is a limitation upon the right itself, and as such, is jurisdictional in nature and cannot be waived. Accordingly, the defendants claim the court lacked jurisdiction over this action which was not brought within the three year period of limitation set forth in the statute. We agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Recently in the case of <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>203 Conn. 187,191-92, 523 A.2d 1301 (1987), this court reiterated the one hundred and thirty-one year adherence by the courts of this state to the almost unanimously held principle of law, as first proclaimed by Lord Ellenborough in the case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>1 Camp. 493, 170 Eng.

Jur. 2d 606 n.3, Death \u00a7 1. Although this rule has been subject to some criticism over its long history, this court is not prepared to hold contrary to the long line of Connecticut cases and the overwhelming weight of authority throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The plaintiff cites the four line opinion in the case of <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Guthery, </em>2 Root (Conn.) 90 (1774), in support of her position that a wrongful death action at common law existed in Connecticut. Although the court, in that case, upheld a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff, who sought damages for medical expenditures he incurred and the deprivation of his wife\u2019s company; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>id., 91;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the <em>Cross </em>case has been rejected by every Connecticut decision which has since addressed the issue. Therefore we view the case of <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New Haven R.R. Co., </em>supra, which overruled <em>Cross, </em>not as having made a change in Connecticut law, but rather, as having recognized that the <em>Cross </em>court was in error. See <em>Mickel </em>v. <em>New England Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>132 Conn. 671, 676, 47 A.2d 187 (1946), and authorities cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff also relies on <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 90 S. Ct. 1772, 26 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1970), and the three state court decisions of <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60, 284 N.E.2d 222 (1972), <em>Wilbon </em>v. <em>D. F. Bast Co., </em>73 Ill. 2d 58, 382 N.E.2d 784 (1978), and <em>Haakanson </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>600 P.2d 1087 (Alaska 1979), which were decided in reliance on <em>Moragne, </em>to support her position that a wrongful death action existed at common law. We do not find these cases persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The <em>Moragne </em>case involved a wrongful death action brought by the wife of a seaman, who was killed in Florida state territorial waters. The Florida wrongful death statute did not encompass the unseaworthiness of a vessel as a basis of liability, whereas federal maritime law provided only for a wrongful death action where the death had occurred on the high seas, and not within the three mile area designated as state ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ritorial waters. Thus, in light of this gap that existed between federal maritime law and Florida\u2019s death statute, the <em>Moragne </em>court addressed the limited issue of \u201cwhether <em>The Harrisburg, </em>119 U.S. 199, 7 S. Ct. 140, 30 L. Ed. 358 [1886], in which this court held in 1886 that maritime law does not afford a cause of action for wrongful death, should any longer be regarded as acceptable law.\u201d <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>supra, 375-76. Although Justice Harlan did examine and criticize the common law rationales for denying a recovery for death; id., 381-88; he did not go so far as to hold that a wrongful death action existed or exists today under nonmaritime common law. In fact, in addressing the nonrecovery at common law issue, Justice Harlan stated: \u201cregardless of the viability of the rule in 1886 as applied to American land-based affairs, it is difficult to discern an adequate reason for its extension to admiralty, a system of law then already differentiated in many respects from the common law.\u201d Id., 381. Justice Harlan acknowledged that \u201c[m]aritime law had always, in this country as in England, been a thing apart from the commmon law.\u201d Id., 386. He also acknowledged that recovery for wrongful death had become the general rule in American law, and its denial the exception solely by way of \u201cthe work of the legislatures.\u201d Id., 393. Thus, the <em>Moragne </em>decision only extends the <em>general maritime law </em>to allow the bringing of a wrongful death action where the death was brought about by the unseaworthiness of a vessel and occurred within state territorial waters. Id., 401-402, 405-406; see also <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, </em>477 U.S. 207, 215-16,106 S. Ct. 2485, 91 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1986); <em>Complaint of Patton-Tully Transportation Co. </em>797 F.2d 206, 212 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>Casaceli </em>v. <em>Martech International, Inc., </em>774 F.2d 1322,1328 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>Evich </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>759 F.2d 1432, 1433 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The plaintiff cites decisions from only three states that have held that, on the basis of <em>Moragne, </em>a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of action for wrongful death existed at common law. See <em>Haakanson </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>supra; <em>Wilbon </em>v. <em>D. F. Bast Co., </em>supra; <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra. The Ohio Court of Appeals, on the other hand, has specifically refused to follow the <em>Moragne </em>and <em>Gaudette </em>rationale and has acknowledged the long standing recognition that no wrongful death action existed at common law. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On the basis of the long line of Connecticut cases and the overwhelming weight of authority cited above, we hold that no action for wrongful death existed at common law or exists today in Connecticut except as otherwise provided by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Given the above holding, the issue now becomes: \u201cWhat is the nature of the three year time limitation contained within General Statutes \u00a7 52-555?\u201d In pertinent part General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 provides: \u201cno action shall be brought to recover such damages and disbursements but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d The defendants argue that this time limitation is a substantive element of the right itself, and thus is jurisdictional and cannot be waived. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In deciding whether a time limitation contained within a statute is subject to waiver, we must determine whether the limitation is substantive or procedural in nature. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 22-23, 513 A.2d 660 (1986); <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 15, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985). \u201c \u2018A statute of limitations is generally considered to be procedural, especially where the statute contains only a limitation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>to time with respect to a right of action and does not itself create the right of action. <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 195, 286 A.2d 308 (1971).\u2019 <em>Collucci </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>585 F. Sup. 529, 532 (D. Conn. 1984).\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>supra, 22. Where the limitation is deemed procedural and personal it is subject to being waived unless it is specifically pleaded because the limitation is considered merely to act as a bar to a remedy otherwise available. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>supra; <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra; <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>167 Conn. 509, 511, 356 A.2d 144 (1975); <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 100, 106, 355 A.2d 1 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Where, however, a specific time limitation is contained within a statute that creates a right of action that did not exist at common law, then the remedy exists only during the prescribed period and not thereafter. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>supra, 22-23; <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra; <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wethers-field, </em>supra; <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>supra; <em>Diamond National Corporation </em>v. <em>Dwelle, </em>164 Conn. 540, 547, 325 A.2d 259 (1973). In such cases, the time limitation is not to be treated as an ordinary statute of limitation, but rather is a limitation on the liability itself, and not of the remedy alone. <em>Vecchio </em>v. <em>Sewer Authority, </em>176 Conn. 497, 504-505, 408 A.2d 254 (1979); see <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.

Jur. 2d 633, Death \u00a7 35. The courts of Connecticut have repeatedly held that, under such circumstances, the time limitation is a substantive and jurisdictional prerequisite, which may be raised at any time, even by the court sua sponte, and may not be waived. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>supra, 23; <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra; <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra; <em>L. G.

See <em>Cofrancesco </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 142, 145; <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>3 Conn. App. 598, 602, 490 A.2d 1024, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 807,494 A.2d 904 (1985). Other jurisdictions have also held the statutory time limitation contained within their respective wrongful death statutes to be a precondition of the right to bring a wrongful death action that may not be waived. See <em>Knauer </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corporation, </em>638 F. Sup. 1369,1375-76 (D. Md. 1986); <em>Theberge </em>v. <em>Transportation Systems, </em>611 F.

Since \u00a7 52-555 creates liability where none formerly existed, the statute must be strictly construed and we are not at liberty to extend, modify or enlarge its scope through the mechanics of construction. See <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>190 Conn. 77, 82, 459 A.2d 118 (1983); <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 633, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In light of our holding above, we now address the issue of the applicability of article first, \u00a7 10, of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>necticut constitution which was properly raised by the plaintiff, by way of a preliminary counter statement of issues filed on April 24, 1986, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1). The plaintiff argues that because the three year repose portion of \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-555 abolishes those causes of action for negligence resulting in death which accrue more than three years after the act or omission complained of,\u201d it denies her access to the courts of this state and thus violates article first, \u00a7 10. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 10, provides: \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d Article first, \u00a7 10, has been viewed as a limitation upon the legislature\u2019s ability to abolish common law and statutory rights that existed in 1818, when article first, \u00a7 10, was adopted, and which were \u201cincorporated in that provision by virtue of being established by law as rights the breach of which precipitates a recognized injury . . . .\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 286, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976); see also <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 585, 512 A.2d 893 (1986); <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Leslie-Elliott Constructors, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 129, 133 n.3, 479 A.2d 231 (1984). Therefore, where a right existed at common law or by statute in 1818 and became incorporated into the Connecticut constitution by the adoption of article first, \u00a7 10, the legislature may restrict or abolish such incorporated right only where it provides a reasonable alternative to the enforcement of such right. See <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra; <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>supra, citing <em>Kluger </em>v. <em>White, </em>281 So. 2d 1, 4-5 (Fla. 1973); 16A C.J.S. 509-10, Constitutional Law \u00a7 710; V.

Rev. 44, 46 n.13 (1968); see also <em>Overland Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Sirmons, </em>369 So. 2d 572, 573 (Fla. 1979); <em>Saylor </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>497 S.W.2d 218, 221-24 (Ky. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s article first, \u00a7 10 argument is based upon the premise that an action for wrongful death existed in 1818, and thus cannot be legislatively restricted or abolished without a reasonable alternative remedy being provided. We have already held above that an action for damages for wrongful death did not exist at common law or by statute in Connecticut in 1818. The Connecticut legislature first adopted a wrongful death statute in 1851 that was limited to deaths caused by railroad companies. See Public Acts 1851, c. 43, \u00a7 2. It was not until 1877, that the Connecticut legislature allowed an action for wrongful death against anyone \u201clegally at fault for such injuries.\u201d See Public Acts 1877, c. 78. Thereafter, through a series of amendments and recodifications, including Public Acts 1957, No. 532, which added the three year repose period, and Public Acts 1969, No. 401, which extended the one year period of limitation to two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered, Connecticut\u2019s wrongful death statute has evolved to its present state under \u00a7 52-555. Therefore, \u00a7 52-555 creates a remedy where none previously existed, and the addition of the three year repose period does no more than redefine the time within which that remedy may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The plaintiff cites in support of her argument five decisions of other state courts that have held that statutes of limitation that begin to run before the occurrence of any injury are violative of similar \u201caccess to courts\u201d provisions. Those cases were cited by Chief Justice Speziale in his concurring opinion in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Haynes Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 327, 335, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>471 A.2d 646 (1984). Upon a careful review of those cases, we do not find them controlling. In fact, four of those cases support this court\u2019s conclusion. In each of those cases, the court declared the repose period contained within the respective state statute violative of the state\u2019s \u201caccess to courts\u201d provision. This was done only upon an initial finding by each court that the causes of action set forth in the statute containing the repose period, either (1) existed at common law and prior to the adoption of the state\u2019s \u201caccess to courts\u201d provision, or (2) were recognized as valid causes of action under state law prior to the adoption of the repose period. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Mannesmann Demag Corporation, </em>435 So. 2d 725 (Ala. 1983); <em>Lankford </em>v. <em>Sullivan, Long &amp; Hagerty, </em>416 So. 2d 996 (Ala. 1982); <em>Overland Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Sirmons, </em>supra; <em>Saylor </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra. It must also be noted that none of these four cases or the fifth case of <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>397 So. 2d 671 (Fla. 1981), cited by the plaintiff, involved a repose period contained within a wrongful death statute. Thus, we do not find these cases persuasive of the plaintiff\u2019s position.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We hold, therefore, that \u00a7 52-555 does not violate article first, \u00a7 10, because the repose period does not abrogate common law or statutory rights of action that existed in 1818 when that provision of the Connecticut constitution was first adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The plaintiff further argues that \u00a7 52-555 violates the equal protection clause of article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution by establishing various classifications without a rational basis. The classes identified are (1) persons killed fewer than three years after the act or omission complained of, and (2) persons killed more than three years after the act or omission complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We begin by noting that \u201c \u2018[t]he equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions have the same meaning and limitations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 577; see also <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 66, 444 A.2d 225 (1982); <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 314, 417 A.2d 343 (1979); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>173 Conn. 506, 516-17, 378 A.2d 572 (1977), appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1057, 98 S. Ct. 1226, 55 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978). One who challenges the constitutionality of a statute bears the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of its constitutional validity and of establishing the statute\u2019s invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt.

Otherwise, a statute will stand if the classification bears a reasonable relation to a legitimate state interest. <em>State Management Assn, of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra; <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 597; <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra; see, e.g., <em>G.

Nor does the fact that a statute of limitation distinguishes between personal injury claims and wrongful death actions by extending the discovery of injury rule to the former and not the latter, implicate any suspect classes or fundamental rights. Thus the distinction at issue here need only be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to be upheld against an equal protection challenge. See <em>United States Department of Agriculture </em>v. <em>Moreno, </em>413 U.S. 528, 534, 93 S. Ct. 2821, 37 L.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 117, 100 S. Ct. 352, 62 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 322 n.14, 92 S. Ct. 455, 30 L.

There is no reason, constitutional or otherwise, which prevents the legislature from establishing a three year time period that runs from the date of the act or omission complained of, as was done here, even though at that date no person had sustained damage and therefore no cause of action had come into existence.

Upon reviewing the statutes cited by the plaintiff, this court finds obvious differences that would justify the different treatment afforded by the legislature. We cannot say, for instance, that the inherent nature of the instrumentalities (agent orange, hazardous chemicals, deficient architectural and engineering designs) that are recognized by these statutes as the cause of the death, is an insufficient, unfair or irrational reason for warranting a different repose or period applicable to each. Additionally, this court does not read General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-576 and 42a-2-725 as providing longer periods of time within which a wrongful death action resulting from a breach of contract or of a warranty may be maintained.

After the acceptance of a verdict and within the time stated in Sec. 320 for filing a motion to set a verdict aside, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment rendered thereon set aside and have judgment rendered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict; or if a verdict was not returned such party may move for judgment in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict within the aforesaid time after the jury have been discharged from consideration of the case. If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may set the verdict aside and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.

Although the case involved the death of the plaintiffs wife, the action appears to have sounded in contract. Therefore we do not read the <em>Cross </em>case as having clearly established that a wrongful death action existed at common law in Connecticut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> It must also be noted that the plaintiff, under her equal protection analysis, infra, cites in her brief three Connecticut trial court decisions that allegedly have held similar statutes of repose unconstitutional as contrary to article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution. One of these cases, however, <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Haynes Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 19805 (February 14, 1985), also held that General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 did not violate article first, \u00a7 10, because an action for wrongful death did not exist at common law. The plaintiff failed to address this case under her article first, \u00a7 10 analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> The application of the rational basis test is further warranted based upon the fact that the alleged classifications and disparate treatment asserted here result from the inherent nature of the statute of repose. In a recent equal protection challenge to the repose period contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577a (a), we stated: \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether the classification and disparate treatment inherent in the statute of repose legislation bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state end and is based on reasons related to the accomplishment of that goal. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commissioners, </em>394 U.S. 802, 808-809, 89 S.

Since none of the cases cited decided the constitutionality of a statute of repose contained in a wrongful death statute, we do not find any of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>cases germane. In fact, all of the cases involved state statutes that shielded certain groups of individuals involved with the design and construction of improvements upon realty after a period of time from the completion of the project. The statutes were .held to violate equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions, <em>not </em>because of the periods of limitation contained therein, but rather, on the ground that the statutes did not equally apply the shield to groups similarly situated such as the realty owners, occupiers or possessors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-577a. limitation of action based on product liability claim, (a) No product liability claim as defined in section 52-572m shall be brought but within three years from the date when the injury, death or property damage is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered except that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>subject to subsections (c) and (d), no such action may be brought against any party nor may any party be impleaded pursuant to subsection (b) later than ten years from the date that the party last parted with possession or control of the product.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201c(b) In any such action a product seller may implead any third party who is or may be liable for all or part of the plaintiffs claim, if such third party defendant is served with the third party complaint within one year from the date the cause of action brought under subsection (a) of this section is returned to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201c(c) The ten-year limitation provided for in subsection (a) shall not apply to any product liability claim brought by a claimant who is not entitled to compensation under chapter 568, provided the claimant can prove that the harm occurred during the useful safe life of the product.
