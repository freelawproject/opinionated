The complaint alleged the following: (1) the revocation of the acceptance of commercial goods;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) breach of an implied warranty of merchantability; (3) breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose; (4) breach of express warranties; and (5) unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court, <em>Edelberg, J., </em>found the issues for the defendant on the first, second, third and fifth counts and rendered judgment for the plaintiff to recover $300 on the fourth count. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 525 A.2d 57 (1987), we found no error with respect to the first four counts of the complaint but remanded the matter for an articulation of the factual basis and legal standard employed by the court in rejecting the CUTPA claim. Upon further review of the matter as articulated, we conclude that the trial court correctly found that there was no CUTPA violation and we therefore find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The court found that on July 12, 1984, the plaintiff purchased a used 1980 Ford Bronco from the defendant. The sales price was $7995. It had been driven 37,601 miles. The vehicle was intended for the use of the son of the plaintiff\u2019s president for transportation to his summer job and for his pleasure use. The defendant\u2019s agent represented that the vehicle was in good condition and stated that it was \u201cexcellent,\u201d in \u201cmint\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>condition, and that it was an \u201cunusual\u201d one. The purchase order signed by the plaintiffs treasurer contained a thirty day limited warranty for one half the cost of repairs. It also contained, in bold type, a disclaimer by the defendant of \u201call warranties, either express or implied, including any implied warranty of merchant ability [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Prior to its purchase, the plaintiff\u2019s agents removed the vehicle from the defendant\u2019s premises, had it inspected, and returned it to the defendant with a list of items to be repaired. The defendant\u2019s agents completed the requested work without charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">After the sale, several problems, mostly minor, developed as the vehicle was being used. These included a rear axle malfunction which necessitated the installation of new gears in the rear axle. Again, the defendant\u2019s agents completed the repairs without charge. The rear axle subsequently proved defective and on September 20, 1984, it again malfunctioned. The cost of repairing the axle was found to be $600. The plaintiff\u2019s president thereupon demanded that the defendant take back the vehicle and refund the purchase price. The defendant refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The court also found that the plaintiff wanted a vehicle that the president\u2019s son could drive on sand. The son installed four spotlights on the roof of the vehicle so that at night he could have illumination of the beach for a distance of four miles. The court was \u201cof the opinion that the son was less than candid as to the number of times he drove on the beach . . . .\u201d \u201c[T]he court was [further] of the opinion that the plaintiff made some contribution to the mechanical problems of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the statements made by the defendant\u2019s agent coupled with its subsequent failure to return the purchase price constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>deceptive acts or practices in violation of CUTPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cFor guidance in determining what may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices, [the enabling Connecticut legislation] directs us to the \u2018interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to Section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 45 (a) (l))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ... as from time to time amended.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b).\u201d <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 528, 533, 461 A.2d 1369 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972), the United States Supreme Court construed the Federal Trade Commission Act. In so doing, it cited three factors adopted by the Federal Trade Commission itself in determining whether a practice, while not deceptive, is nonetheless unfair. These factors were \u201c \u2018(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).\u2019 \u201d Id., 244-45 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In its articulation, the trial court considered the three factors set forth in <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>supra, and concluded that the defendant\u2019s representations did not offend public policy nor were they immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>substance of the first two factors). As predicate findings, the trial court determined that the representations were not significant ones, that favorable comments by sellers with respect to their products are universally accepted and expected in the market place, and that the representations here were mere \u201cpuffing.\u201d <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>supra, 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Although these predicate findings are themselves conclusory, they are also factual in character and must be viewed within the context of the totality of circumstances so uniquely available to the trial court. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391, 441 A.2d 629 (1982). \u201cA factual finding may be rejected by this court only if it is \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.\u201d Id., 392; see <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). A clearly erroneous finding is one \u201cthat as a matter of law . . . is \u2018 \u201cunsupported by the record, incorrect, or otherwise mistaken.\u201d . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>190 Conn. 173, 176, 460 A.2d 945 (1983), quoting <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We have observed previously that the representations made in this case that the vehicle was \u201cexcellent,\u201d in \u201cmint\u201d condition and that it was an \u201cunusual\u201d one, were oral and nonspecific. <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>supra, 352. Furthermore, the buyer was encouraged and allowed to remove, drive and inspect the vehicle to be purchased. Id. In view of these circumstances, we cannot say that the court\u2019s conclusion is \u201c \u2018 \u201cunsupported by the record, incorrect, or otherwise mistaken.\u201d . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The court next examined the third factor set out in <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>supra, and concluded that there was no \u201csubstantial injury to consumers\u201d because the plaintiff <em>had not relied </em>on the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>representations. Such a conclusion based on a lack of consumer reliance is in error for \u201c[t]he CUTPA plaintiff <em>need not prove reliance </em>or that the representation became part of the basis of the bargain.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 617, 440 A.2d 810 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Despite its erroneous factual underpinning, the court\u2019s conclusion was nevertheless correct. The \u201csubstantial injury\u201d factor is itself subject to a three part test. \u201c \u2018The independent nature of the consumer injury criterion does not mean that every consumer injury is legally \u201cunfair,\u201d however. To justify a finding of unfairness the injury must satisfy three tests. [1] It must be substantial; [2] it must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that the practice produces; and [3] it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.\u2019 \u201d <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 569-70, 473 A.2d 1185 (1984), citing a letter from the Federal Trade Commission to Senators Wendell H. Ford and John C. Danforth (Dec. 17, 1980), reprinted in N. Averitt, \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Unfair Acts or Practices\u2019 in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\u201d 70 Geo. L.J. 225, 291 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In this case it is clear from the facts as found by the trial court that the plaintiff cannot satisfy the first test of the \u201csubstantial injury\u201d factor for the plain reason that the consumer injury here is not substantial. The plaintiff sought the refund of $7995 by reason of a defect that had injured the plaintiff to the extent of $300 or 3.7 percent of the cost of the vehicle. This demand for a refund was made within the context of circumstances wherein the defendant had undertaken all corrections, both before and after the sale, promptly and without charge. The court rendered judgment for the'plaintiff to recover one half of the $600 cost of the rear axle repairs in accordance with the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>limited warranty set forth in the purchase order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This being the case, the court\u2019s conclusion that there was not a substantial injury within the meaning of the third criterion is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In this opinion Healey, Shea and Callahan, Js., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Peters, C. J., concurred in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] 42a-2-608. revocation of acceptance in whole or in part.
