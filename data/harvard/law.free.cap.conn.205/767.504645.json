The final order required the city of New Haven to provide Susan Stone \u201cwith copies of invoices for services rendered by the law firm of Beveridge and Diamond and by any other law firm or attorney retained for the purpose of litigating claims pertaining to the East Shore waste-water treatment plant.\u201d The two issues raised in these appeals are (1) whether the trial court exceeded the permissible scope of judicial review of the final order of the commission, and, if not, (2) whether invoices that bear only the name of the firm and the amount billed from law firms that rendered legal services to the city of New Haven in connection with the East Shore waste-water treatment plant are exempt from disclosure under Connecticut\u2019s Freedom of Information Act as \u201crecords pertaining to strategy and negotiations\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. In the mid-1970s the named plaintiff, the city of New Haven, entered into a series of contracts for the construction of the East Shore wastewater treatment plant. When the construction of the plant had been substantially completed in 1982, the city took possession of it and began operations. The plant did not function properly and shortly thereafter the city entered into a series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>arbitrations with the general contractor. Upon the unfavorable termination of the arbitration proceedings, the city brought separate federal actions against Camp, Dresser and McKee, Inc., the consulting engineer of the project, and Zimpro, Inc., a chief supplier of component parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In February, 1986, Stone sent a letter to the public information/public advocacy office of the city and town of New Haven, and in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requested the following: \u201cAs the result of constructing the East Shore sewage treatment plant, the City of New Haven has been, and continues to be, involved in legal proceedings relating to the construction of that facility. I hereby request that you provide copies of all invoices from any attorney or law firm retained or consulted by the city in conjunction with any legal proceeding, whether an arbitration or litigation, connected with the construction of that facility. This request includes, but is not limited to, invoices from the law firm of Beveridge and Diamond.\u201d The letter went on specifically to limit the information requested to only the name of the attorney or law firm submitting the invoice, and the total amount of the invoice. The city did not respond to Stone\u2019s letter, whereupon she filed a letter of complaint with the commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the time Stone sent the letter of request to the city, she was employed as an associate with the law firm which has been representing Zimpro, Inc., in the federal actions filed by the city and which represents her in connection with the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">At the administrative hearing conducted by Commissioner E. Bartlett Barnes as the hearing officer, the city argued that the information was exempt from disclosure as: (1) attorney-client communications within General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (10);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) attorney work product; and (3) records pertaining to strategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims and litigation under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Barnes rejected all of the city\u2019s arguments and in a proposed written decision he found that the city had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 1-19 (a) by refusing to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>close the invoices. The freedom of information commission adopted Barnes\u2019 findings and conclusions and issued a \u201cNotice of Final Decision\u201d that ordered the city to provide Stone with the requested information from the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The city and the public information/public advocacy office of the city and town of New Haven took timely appeals from the final order of the commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 l-21i (d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Schaller, J., </em>held that, while the requested invoices are not exempt from disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>as attorney-client communications or attorney work product, they are exempt from disclosure as \u201crecords pertaining to strategy and negotiations\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4). The trial court found: \u201cThe plaintiff[s] [are] correct in stating that access to the requested information would allow [the city\u2019s] adversaries to \u2018balance the amounts spent, the rate of expenditure and the course and posture of litigation proceedings against the amount of exposure in damages supported by the evidence revealed in discovery.\u2019 This process would result in a \u2018highly informed judgment about the negotiating posture and strategy of the City.\u2019 That type of advantage is what the exemption under section 1-19 (b) (4) was designed to prevent.\u201d The trial court also balanced the public\u2019s interest in its right to know against the need for confidentiality during the pendency of litigation and held that \u201cthe public interest is best served by preventing the public\u2019s legal adversaries from obtaining an advantage in the ongoing litigations.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals and reversed the final decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The appeals of the commission and Stone from the decision of the trial court were transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. The defendants argue that the trial court erred in reversing the final decision of the commission because it (1) exceeded the permissible scope of judicial review and (2) expanded the narrow scope of the exemption under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4) by holding that the invoices requested pertained to strategy and negotiations. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The defendants first argue that the trial court exceeded the scope of judicial review as set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. Specifically, they argue that the commission\u2019s decision was supported by substantial and competent evidence on the record as a whole, and thus, the trial court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the commission as to a question of fact. The city, however, argues that the trial court properly concluded that the commission\u2019s decision was affected by an error in statutory interpretation which is a question of law and a matter for the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\u201c \u2018Judicial review of [an administrative agency\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (General Statutes, c. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. <em>Lawrence v. Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, [707-708,] 372 A.2d 110 (1976) [cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977)]. Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the defendant.\u2019 <em>C &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>176 Conn. 11, 12, 404 A.2d 864 (1978); <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975); see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g). \u2018The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of [its] discretion.\u2019 <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 322, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 441, 423 A.2d 87 (1979); see also <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983).\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In reversing the final decision of the commission, the trial court found that the decision was affected by an error of law in that the commission misinterpreted \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4). Ordinarily, the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts where the administrative decision is not entitled to spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>cial deference, particularly where, as here, the statute has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny or time-tested agency interpretations. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 423, 521 A.2d 569 (1987); see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>201 Conn. 685, 698-99, 519 A.2d 41 (1986); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018[\u00a1Judicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited. The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, <em>in light of the evidence, </em>the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 322. Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104,112-13, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 5, 434 A.2d 293 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">While the trial court here properly balanced the competing interests as intended by the legislature when applying the exemption under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4), the trial court improperly substituted its own conclusion for the commission\u2019s by applying the law to facts not reasonably supported by the record. The limited record before the trial court consisted of the following: (a) the eight page transcript of the administrative hearing before the hearing officer; (b) the three trial briefs of the parties; (c) the exhibits before the hearing officer; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>(d) the oral arguments of counsel. This record fails to contain any evidence from which one could reasonably conclude that the invoices in question pertained to or, as \u201cpertain\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, had any \u201cconnection with or relation to\u201d either strategy or negotiations in the pending lawsuits. The only references to such a connection were made by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in arguments before the hearing officer, in their trial and appellate briefs, and before the trial court and this court at oral arguments. Arguments, however, are not evidence upon which findings can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The city argues: \u201cStrong evidence that the information requested has potential value to Zimpro ... in countering the City\u2019s strategy and negotiations is the very fact that the request comes from the attorneys representing Zimpro.\u201d We are unpersuaded. It is undisputed that Stone has been a member of the law firm representing Zimpro, Inc., in the city\u2019s suit against Zimpro, Inc. While this fact raises questions and eyebrows regarding the motives behind Stone\u2019s request for the invoices, we do not find it, <em>in and of itself, </em>to be sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the requested invoices in fact \u201cpertain to\u201d strategy and negotiations in the pending litigations. To draw a conclusion either way from this single fact would be nothing more than speculation and conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We note that the general rule under the Freedom of Information Act is disclosure with the exceptions to this rule being narrowly construed. The burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption clearly rests upon the party claiming the exemption. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 431, 518 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984); <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 183,188, 470 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>1209 (1984); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>328-29, 341; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 170-71, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). This burden requires the claimant of the exemption to provide more than conclusory language, generalized allegations or mere arguments of counsel. Rather, a sufficiently detailed record must reflect the reasons why an exemption applies to the materials requested. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 341; <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>4 Conn. App. 216, 219-21, 493 A.2d 283 (1985); see also <em>Lykins </em>v. <em>United States Department of Justice, </em>725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C. Cir. 1984), on remand sub nom. <em>Lykins </em>v. <em>Assistant Attorney General Rose, </em>608 F. Sup. 693 (D.D.C. 1984); <em>Yeager </em>v. <em>Drug Enforcement Administration, </em>678 F.2d 315, 320 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <em>Coastal States Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Energy, </em>617 F.2d 854, 861 (D.C. Cir. 1980); <em>Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>United States Department of Defense, </em>611 F.2d 738, 742 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Department of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">It is clear from the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision that its conclusion that the invoices in question pertained to strategy and negotiations was founded primarily upon the arguments of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 pretrial brief. As previously stated, unsupported conclusory allegations of counsel are not evidence and are insufficent for the application of an exemption from disclosure. Neither the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>trative record nor the record on appeal before this court contains any evidence, either by way of expert testimony, testimony of a city representative, a relatively specific affidavit, a transcript of deposition testimony, or precedent, to support the court\u2019s conclusion that the invoices in question pertain to strategy and negotiations in the pending litigations. The transcript before the hearing officer consists of eight pages of arguments and dialogue between the hearing officer and the attorneys for the parties. No testimony was taken nor were any exhibits presented that provided a premise for a correlation between the invoices and strategy and negotiations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Under these circumstances, therefore, the trial court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the commission without a factual basis for doing so. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in applying its interpretation of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4) to thwart disclosure when there were no facts in the record to support such an application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We note that our decision does not reach the substantive merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 exemption claim under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4). We need not, nor can we decide, on the basis of the state of the record before this court, whether invoices for legal services that bear only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>name of the attorney or law firm and the amount of the billing might, under other circumstances, pertain to strategy and negotiations in pending litigation. While the commission may have erroneously reasoned that such invoices never pertain to strategy and negotiations, it correctly concluded that the city failed to demonstrate that the requested records are exempt from disclosure under any state or federal statute. Where, as here, one of the stated reasons is sufficient to support the action of the commission, then that action should be sustained by the court. See <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>189 Conn. 261, 265, 455 A.2d 339 (1983); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 25, 376 A.2d 385 (1977). Accordingly, we hold that the commission\u2019s order of disclosure was proper because the city failed to establish on the record that the requested information falls within any exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction that judgment be rendered dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201caccess to public records, exempt records, (a) Except as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency, whether or not such records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records promptly during regular office or business hours or to receive a copy of such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15.
