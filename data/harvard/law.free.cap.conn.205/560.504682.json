We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The affidavit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in support of the search warrant sets forth the following facts: On January 26,1985, the affi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ant, Lieutenant Nicholas C. Riccio of the Windsor police department, contacted Detective James Lavery of the Newington police department, at the request of Ric-cio\u2019s shift commander. Lavery informed Riccio that he was \u201cpresently working with an extremely credible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>reliable and confidential informant who is very knowledgable in the area of drug activity and sales and trafficking and has in the past given [him] information on drug activities that have resulted in arrests and convictions including a seizure of 32 pounds of marihuana.\u201d Lavery told Riccio that sometime during the three day period of January 24 through January 26, 1985, the informant told Lavery that he had been present in an unattached garage behind 70-72 Wilson Avenue, Windsor, with the defendant who used the upper area of the garage as a loft residence. The informant told Lavery that while at the loft residence he had seen the defendant sell a high grade type of marihuana and during the transaction he heard the defendant state that he had ten pounds of marihuana to sell. Lavery told Riccio that he had corroborated the informant\u2019s description of the premises by going to the address. Thereafter, Riccio went to the area of 70-72 Wilson Avenue, verified the existence of the unattached garage, and observed lights in the upper area of the garage which indicated to him that someone was using it as a residence. On January 26, 1985, a search warrant was issued for the Wilson Avenue garage loft premises. On January 27, 1985, officers of the Windsor police department, acting pursuant to the search warrant, searched the garage, seized what was later determined to be marihuana and arrested the defendant who was present during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in finding that the search warrant was based on sufficient probable cause under the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Initially, we recognize that \u201c[p]robable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>criminal activity or will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction; <em>State </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>115 N.H. 682, 685, 371 A.2d 167 (1975); 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (1978) \u00a7\u00a73.1 (b) and 3.7; cf. <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 87 S. Ct. 1642, 18 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1967); (\u2018mere\u2019 evidentiary materials may be validly seized as well as instrumentalities, prints, weapons and contraband); <em>and </em>(2) there is probable cause to believe that the items sought to be seized will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 528-29,427 A.2d 1338 (1980). We note that \u201cin a doubtful or marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would fall.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 106, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, we recently reviewed probable cause under article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution, as contrasted with the test for probable cause set forth in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, which reflects the federal constitutional standard for determining probable cause. In <em>Kimbro </em>we recognized that the probable cause determination under the \u201ctotality of circumstances analysis set out in <em>[Gates </em>was less strict than the] two-prong analysis of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cases which predated <em>Gates.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 221. Consequently, we concluded that article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution \u201caffords more substantive protection to citizens than does the fourth amendment to the federal constitution in the determination of probable cause.\u201d Id., 233. Accordingly, if the allegations in the affidavit meet the standards for determining probable cause that we applied in <em>Kimbro, </em>it will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>necessary for us to determine if the trial court erred in applying the \u201c \u2018fluid\u2019 concept of [probable cause] as set out in <em>Gates </em>. . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 235-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test for reviewing a magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause consists of two prongs: \u201c \u2018The issuing [judge] must be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances relied on by the person providing the information to the affiant; and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded (a) that the informant, whose identity need not even be disclosed, was credible, or (b) that his information was reliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonaco, </em>194 Conn. 331, 338, 481 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036, 105 S. Ct. 511, 83 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 446, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972). The defendant claims that the affidavit in this case failed to satisfy both prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The first prong of the test, often referred to as the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong, examines the information provided by the informant to determine if it \u201crelate[s] sufficient facts from which a judge reasonably could conclude that the informants based their allegations of criminal activity on sufficient underlying circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonaco, </em>supra, 339. Upon careful examination of the affidavit we conclude that it adequately supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d requirement was satisfied. The affidavit states that the informant personally observed the defendant sell marihuana and he heard the defendant state that he had ten pounds to sell. From these statements the magistrate could reasonably have inferred that the defendant was engaged in the ongoing criminal activity of selling marihuana. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 632, 362 A.2d 813 (1975). Furthermore, the informant accurately described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>premises in question, which were unique in that an unattached garage behind a house was being used as a residence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 439 A.2d 387 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The affidavit also satisfied the second prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, known as the \u201creliability\u201d prong. \u201c \u2018An affiant need not recite the precise factors on which he judged his informant credible or reliable. ... If they are apparent to the common-sense reader of the affidavit\u2014whether by necessary implication or recital\u2014it is enough.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 452-53.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Telesca, </em>199 Conn. 591, 603, 508 A.2d 1367 (1986). Although it is only necessary that either part (a) or part (b) of this prong be satisfied, we find that both parts of the reliability prong were met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Part (a) of the second prong tests the credibility of the informant. The affidavit described the informant as \u201cextremely credible, reliable and confidential,\u201d and stated that he was \u201cknowledgable in the area of drug activity and sales and trafficking and has in the past given . . . information on drug activities that have resulted in arrests and convictions including a seizure of 32 pounds of marihuana.\u201d We have held that when an informant has a track record of providing reliable information, the \u201cprevious reliability of an informant, though not constitutionally required, is a basis for crediting his information.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>165 Conn. 239, 244, 332 A.2d 64 (1973). Therefore, this information in the affidavit satisfied the credibility portion of the second prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, thus permitting a finding of probable cause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Del-monaco, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Part (b) of the second prong tests the reliability of the informant\u2019s information. We have held that \u201c[o]ne of the most common factors used to evaluate the relia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>bility of an informants information is the corroboration of the information by the police .... \u2018The theory of corroboration is that a statement which has been shown true in some respects is reasonably likely to be true in the remaining respects. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 447.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 361, 441 A.2d 98 (1981). The informant accurately described the premises at 70-72 Wilson Avenue, Windsor. This description was corroborated by Lavery of the Newington police department and affiant Riccio of the Windsor police department. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>185 Conn. 104, 440 A.2d 841 (1981). We find that a common sense reading of the facts relating to part (b) also satisfied the \u201creliability\u201d prong of. the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. Because the affidavit contains sufficient evidentiary allegations to permit the issuing judge to make a finding of probable cause under the standards of <em>Kimbro, </em>it is not necessary for us to consider the probable cause determination under the less strict standards of <em>Gates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The defendant also claims that the affidavit in support of the search warrant should be invalidated because it contains \u201cdouble hearsay.\u201d We agree with the defendant that when the informant\u2019s information is based on hearsay, the magistrate should not credit that information unless an independent basis for its reliability is established. See <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 425, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d. 637 (1969). In this situation, however, the information received by the affiant was not based on double hearsay from the informant; rather, the defendant claims that there is double hearsay because the informant\u2019s information was relayed from Lavery to Riccio. A law enforcement officer, like the general public, \u201cis generally presumed to be reliable, and thus no special showing of such reliabilty ... is necessary\u201d to establish probable cause. 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (1987) \u00a7 3.5 (a); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>110-11; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Asselin, </em>775 F.2d 445 (1st Cir. 1985). Thus, the fact that Riccio received the informant\u2019s information from Lavery does not affect the validity of the affidavit, and this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra. Specifically, he claims that the affidavit in support of the search warrant which led to his arrest contained omissions and misstatements of material facts, entitling him to a further evidentiary hearing as to the truthfulness of the warrant, and that the trial court erred when it found that he did not make a sufficient offer of proof pursuant to <em>Franks. </em>We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, 155-56, the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant may challenge the truthfulness of an affidavit supporting a search warrant, provided the defendant has made a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit . . . .\u2019\u2019If this statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d Id. The court also stated that \u201c[t]o mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challanger\u2019s attack must be more than conclusory and . . . [tjhere must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof .... Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence satisfactorily explained .... The deliberate falsity or reckless disregard whose impeachment is permitted today is only that of the affiant, not of any nongovernmental informant.\u201d Id., 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The evidence in support of the defendant\u2019s claim that he was improperly denied a <em>Franks </em>hearing is the affidavit of his attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find this affidavit insufficient to mandate an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks. </em>First, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not witness the events he avers to; rather, he states that \u201cupon information and belief [he] determined that Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the affidavit [submitted with this] application for the search warrant [are] false and misleading as to assertions made therein concerning the credibility and reliability of the informer.\u201d There is no explanation why proper witnesses and affidavits were not obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Moreover, examination of this affidavit reveals that the allegations made by the defendant\u2019s attorney are at best conclusory. For example, he attempts to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>that the affiants misled the issuing magistrate regarding the informant\u2019s track record with the police. In so doing, he suggests that the affiant Riccio\u2019s statement that the informant had given the police \u201cinformation on drug activities that [has] resulted in arrests and convictions including a seizure of 32 pounds of marihuana,\u201d was inaccurate. Instead, he avers that the informant here was the defendant in the thirty-two pound marihuana arrest. In support of this argument, he makes bald assertions such as \u201c[t]here was only one seizure of 32 pounds of marijuana in Newington in anyone\u2019s memory.\u201d Finally, there is no offer of proof that the statements objected to in the affidavit were made by the Windsor officer with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth. As noted above, such a showing is required under <em>Franks. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 239, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984). We find that this offer of proof is insufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s right to an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In this opinion Healey, Covello and Hull, Js., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Callahan, J., concurred in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-94a. conditional nolo contendere plea, appeal of denial of motion to suppress or dismiss.

Both these affiants are also thoroughly trained and are familiar and have worked numerous cases involving narcotics and controlled drugs. These affiants are familiar with drug trafficking methods and have conducted numerous narcotic and drug investigations which have resulted in the issuance of search and seizure warrants which have resulted in arrests and convictions. \u201cThat: On the date of Saturday, January 26,1985, at approzimately 6:30 P.M., affiant Lt.

There was only one seizure of 32 pounds of marijuana in Newington in anyone\u2019s memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-16\">\u201cb. Arrested were the informer in this case and another person named [C].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-17\">\u201cc. [The informer] thereupon implicated a number of other persons in the conspiracy to possess the 32 pounds. [The informer] had approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>5 pounds of marijuana in his automobile and had sold still another 5 pounds to an informer for the East Hartford police shortly before (or had made arrangements for the sale).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201cd. Some charges against [the informer] were not prosecuted and he ultimately received a suspended sentence while [C] was incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201ce. [The informer] was never in the home of the defendant and they had never met but [the informer] was outside the defendant\u2019s home sitting in an automobile while an acquaintance and fellow worker of the defendant\u2019s stopped by defendant\u2019s home a few days before the search in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201cf. Thus [the informer] had no \u2018track record\u2019 of reliability as an informer except in regard to implicating others involved in his own arrest or people who he had dealt drugs to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cg. It is clear that the informer in [the informer and C\u2019s] arrest is not the informer in this case as the informer\u2019s identity in [the arrest of the informer and C] became known in the course of that case. That informer is absolutely unknown to the defendant in this case; they have never seen or spoken to each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">\u201ch. The affiants knew or could have known the true facts and status of [the informer] including that he had serious charges pending against him when he provided the information. Thus the affiants intentionally or recklessly set forth misleading and errroneous information in the affidavit in support of the warrant. The false and misleading information and omitted information was material to the issuance of the warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201ci. The undersigned counsel has in his possession and will make available to the court copies of the police reports and search warrant application in [the informer and C\u2019s] case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
