Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">After a jury trial, the defendant, Lester M. Allen, was found guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), assault on a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1), attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-49, and having a weapon in a motor vehicle in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>lation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. The defendant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than twenty years and not more than thirty years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court which affirmed the convictions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>9 Conn. App. 169, 517 A.2d 1043 (1986). This court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The sole question presented by this appeal is whether the Appellate Court erred in failing to find an abuse of discretion when the trial court permitted the state to reopen its case after it had rested and after the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal had been denied. We reverse the Appellate Court and remand to that court to remand to the trial court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal on the charge of having a weapon in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On September 20,1980, officer Thomas Master-son of the Stratford police department observed a car with an expired registration. After the officer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>stopped the defendant\u2019s ear and as the officer was exiting his patrol car, the defendant took a gun from his pocket and fired a total of four shots before fleeing the scene. The defendant was found and arrested in Georgia three years after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The following background facts that occurred at trial are not in dispute. In the substitute information, the state charged that the defendant \u201cdid knowingly have in a motor vehicle occupied by him, a certain pistol, without a legal permit therefore [sic]\u201d in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. After the state had rested its case, the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on the charge of having a weapon in a motor vehicle, claiming that the state had not established a prima facie case under \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant at that time argued that the state had failed to establish that the weapon was a pistol within the meaning of the statute by failing to offer any evidence on the length of its barrel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>173 Conn. 254, 260, 377 A.2d 268 (1977). Under General Statutes \u00a7 29-27,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which controls \u00a7 29-38, a pistol or revolver is a firearm having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>a barrel of less than twelve inches in length. The defendant was apparently confused about the applicable statute, claiming that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (18)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> governed the definition of a pistol for violations of \u00a7 29-38. This apparent confusion makes no real difference because the definition of a pistol or revolver is exactly the same under both statutes: it is a firearm with a barrel less than twelve inches in length. Thus, although the defendant did not cite the applicable statute, he correctly stated the law on that issue. The state also had overlooked the applicability of \u00a7 29-27 but argued that no definition of a pistol or revolver applied and asserted that having any weapon in a motor vehicle without a permit violated \u00a7 29-38. The court agreed with the state and denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">On the next court day, before the defendant had begun to present his case, the state moved to reopen its case-in-chief in order to present evidence on the length of the barrel of the firearm. In its argument to reopen, the state claimed that although the defendant\u2019s argument was incorrect, the state nevertheless was \u201chedging [its] bet\u201d because \u201c[the state was] afraid the Supreme Court may determine that the penal code definition of pistol should be grafted on to the weapon in a motor vehicle statute . . . and [it would] rather be safe than be sorry.\u201d Accepting this argument, the court granted the motion over the defendant\u2019s objection and Masterson, the victim of the shooting who had testified earlier, then testified that the barrel length was approximately two inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the reopening of the state\u2019s case-in-chief vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>lated the double jeopardy provision of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and was an abuse of its discretion. Although the defendant claimed in his brief that the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal implicated the prohibition against double jeopardy, he conceded at oral argument before us that the entire issue was better analyzed as a claim of an abuse of discretion. The defendant maintains that to permit the state to reopen its case-in-chief after the defendant has pointed out in his motion for judgment of acquittal the specific particulars why the state had failed to present a prima facie case rewards the state for its \u201claxity\u201d and in practical effect turns the defendant\u2019s attorney into a prosecutorial arm of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The state, on the other hand, although it agrees that a defendant might be penalized by a timely and meritorious motion for judgment of acquittal, asserts that the reopening in this case filled an evidentiary gap which contributed to \u201cthe search for facts and truth\u201d and is, thus, perfectly proper. <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that the state had the burden to prove that the firearm met the statutory definition of a pistol. Id., 172, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 260. Noting that the pistol itself was not in evidence, the Appellate Court held that \u201cinitially \u2018[t]he state failed to introduce any evidence upon which the jury could find that the barrel of the firearm was in fact less than twelve inches in length.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The Appellate Court recognized that the defendant was \u201cin a sense penalize[d]\u201d by making such a motion and that a reopening could discourage him from doing so and could encourage him to wait to make such a motion until the last available moment in hopes that the missing evidence became unavailable. Id., 174. The court, however, also maintained that \u201c \u2018 \u201ca trial is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>a game of technicalities, but one in which the facts and truth are sought.\u201d <em>Eskridge </em>v. <em>State, </em>258 Ind. 363, 369, 281 N.E.2d 490 (1972).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 623, 490 A.2d 68 (1985) <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Balancing these two competing concerns, the Appellate Court relied on the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d that either party may present omitted or further evidence \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhen <em>mere inadvertence or some other compelling circumstance </em>. . . justifies a reopening and no substantial prejudice will occur.\u201d \u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>[State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 546, 442 A.2d 927 (1982)], quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinderman, </em>625 F.2d 994, 996 (10th Cir. 1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 175. The Appellate Court attributed the state\u2019s failure to introduce evidence of the length of the gun barrel to the state\u2019s own misperception, compounded by a different misper-ception by the defendant. Id., 176. That court concluded that these circumstances demonstrated that the state\u2019s evidentiary failure was inadvertent and that this case presented a compelling circumstance for granting the motion to reopen. Id. The Appellate Court also ruled that the defendant suffered no \u201clegal prejudice.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We begin our analysis by recognizing the fundamental concept that the state has the burden of proving every element of an alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>175 Conn. 155,162, 397 A.2d 89 (1978). The defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence until proven guilty is an \u201caxiomatic and elementary\u201d principle whose \u201cenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u201d <em>Coffin </em>v, <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453,15 S. Ct. 394, 39 L. Ed. 481 (1895). A criminal defendant has the right to put the state to its burden and need not defend until and unless the state has presented a prima facie case. \u201cThe defendant, under our Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>need not do anything at all to defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78,112, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 26 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting). \u201c \u2018One of the greatest safeguards for the individual under our system of criminal justice is the requirement that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case by its own evidence before the defendant may be put to his defense. \u201cOurs is the accusatorial as opposed to the inquisitorial system. . . . Under our system society carries the burden of proving its charge against the accused not out of his own mouth. It must establish its case, not by interrogation of the accused even under judicial safeguards, but by evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.\u201d \u2019 <em>Cephas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 F.2d 893, 895 (D.C. Cir. 1963), quoting <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49, 54, 69 S. Ct. 1347, 93 L. Ed. 1801 (1949) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>194 Conn. 438, 443, 479 A.2d 1209 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In this case, the state failed to introduce any evidence as to the length of the barrel of the pistol, admittedly an essential element of the crime of having a weapon in a motor vehicle. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra. As the state conceded at oral argument before us, had the defendant remained silent until after the verdict had been rendered, the omission of this evidence would have required a judgment of acquittal either in the trial court or on appeal. With the review of an alleged deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right permitted under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), together with the federal constitutional requirements of <em>In re Winship, </em>supra, the defendant would have been entitled to prevail on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The defendant, instead, made a motion for judgment of acquittal under Practice Book \u00a7 883.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ant even cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, as governing the outcome of the issue in this case. Having specifically brought this evidentiary gap to the attention of the state, the defendant was effectively victimized by his own diligence as the state used the reopening to supply the missing element of the crime, thus assuring the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 883 permits the defendant to make a motion for judgment of acquittal and thus avoid presenting a defense if the state has not made out a prima facie case. If the evidence would not reasonably permit a finding of guilty, \u00a7 883 provides that the \u201cjudicial authority <em>shall </em>order the entry of a judgment of acquittal . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) In testing whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict on a \u00a7 883 motion, this court has held that, \u201c[ejach essential element of the crime charged must be established by such proof . . . . \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>178 Conn. 416, 419, 423 A.2d 102 (1979). This case was an appropriate one for such a motion to be granted as the state had not made out a prima facie case that the defendant had violated General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 because no evidence concerning the length of the gun barrel had been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">An important concern in this case is the viability of Practice Book \u00a7 883 in circumstances such as this. If we hold that it is not an abuse of discretion to allow the state to supply evidence of a missing element of a crime identified by the defendant in his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>judgment of acquittal after the state has rested, would any competent defense attorney ever make such a motion again? As the state conceded at oral argument, \u00a7 883 would become a \u201cdead letter\u201d if the subject matter of the motion clearly concerned an element of the crime. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[tjhat any judicial system should encourage litigants to raise objections at the earliest rather than the last possible time seems self-evident.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tateo, </em>377 U.S. 463, 468 n.4, 84 S. Ct. 1587, 12 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1964). In this type of case, however, the latter would occur if we sustained the action of the Appellate Court. Rather than make this motion at the close of the state\u2019s case or even at any time before the jury has rendered a verdict, the defendant would be well advised to wait to make his constitutional claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Although we agree that an important function of a trial is a \u201csearch for facts and truth\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 174; a trial must also be fair. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 459, 512 A.2d 183 (1986) (\u201cdiscretion to be exercised must be informed and guided by considerations of fundamental fairness that are ingrained in the concept of due process of law\u201d). \u201c \u2018Every accused is entitled to a fair trial . . . at which the legal rights of the accused are safeguarded and respected.\u2019 <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>143 Conn. 624, 632-33,124 A.2d 886 (1956).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lovelace, </em>191 Conn. 545, 553, 469 A.2d 391 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1107, 104 S. Ct. 1613, 80 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1984). The time when the state rests its case-in-chief marks an important juncture in a criminal trial. It is \u201c \u2018[t]o bring to an end voluntarily the introduction of evidence, the right to introduce fresh evidence, except in rebuttal, being thereupon lost.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>53 N.M. 413, 417, 209 P.2d 525 (1949). The state, which has the burden to prove every element of the crimes charged beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a reasonable doubt, is required to present enough evidence so that a jury, could reasonably find the defendant guilty; failing such an evidentiary showing, it risks a successful motion for judgment of acquittal. Practice Book \u00a7 883. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinderman, </em>supra, 996, the court warned that \u201cthe government\u2019s case-in-chief should not be treated as an experiment that can be cured after the defendant has, by motion, identified the failures.\u201d The California Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cto require a defendant to state specific grounds in support of the motion for acquittal would place the burden upon him to point out to the prosecutor, as well as to the court, the gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case. Such a requirement would come perilously close to compelling a defendant to aid in his own prosecution and would lessen the prosecutor\u2019s burden to prove each and every element of the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>23 Cal. 3d 516, 522, 591 P.2d 485, 153 Cal. Rptr. 195 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We recognize the wide discretion enjoyed by the trial court to permit the reopening of a case after either side has rested. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>90 Conn. 147, 152, 96 A. 941 (1916). \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe reopening of a criminal case either to present omitted evidence or to add further testimony after either of the parties has rested is within the sound discretion of the Trial Court. [Citations omitted].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>450 F.2d 1131,1143 (5th Cir. 1971).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sisack, </em>527 F.2d 917, 919 (9th Cir. 1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 545-46, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). \u201c \u2018[T]he trial court must be vested with discretion to permit reopening when mere inadvertence or some other compelling circumstance . . . justifies a reopening and no substantial prejudice will occur.\u2019 \u201d Id., 546, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinderman, </em>supra. Although this discretion has been used in the past with this court\u2019s approval, a careful examination of the precedents will reveal that the precise facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>procedural posture of this case are significantly different. We reach the result in this case without interfering with a trial court\u2019s discretion to permit a reopening under appropriate circumstances in a future case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The state, in its brief, refers to numerous precedents in Connecticut which it claims support its argument that the reopening was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. We agree that earlier Connecticut cases have permitted reopenings but there were different circumstances from those in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It has been held not to be an abuse of discretion for the trial court to permit a reopening when a witness is recalled to elaborate or explain the testimony he has already given. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>supra, 153. Both the Appellate Court and the state rely heavily on the language in <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 579, 469 A.2d 397 (1983), that a reopening during a jury\u2019s deliberations is permitted \u201cwhere an essential element has been overlooked.\u201d <em>McKnight </em>is inapposite; it did not involve a reopening going to an essential element of the crime charged but discussed the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>request to reopen to permit a late-appearing witness to testify. The holding in that case was an affirmance of the denial to reopen on that <em>defendant\u2019s </em>motion. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140, 151-52, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>125 Conn. 399, 405, 6 A.2d 359 (1939). Obviously, when a defendant moves to reopen, he is not concerned with supplying a missing element of a crime. Thus, the language of <em>McKnight </em>is not supportive of the state\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 960, 94 S. Ct. 1977, 40 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1974), is another case heavily relied upon by the state. There the state reopened its case to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>evidence that a codefendant had not possessed a permit for a gun, a fact that would have relieved the four codefendants of the crime of having weapons in a motor vehicle. In that case, however, the defendant did not file a motion for judgment of acquittal and thus the defendant was not the one responsible for pointing out the potential evidentiary gap in the state\u2019s case. In addition, the court\u2019s discussion of the reopening of the case was essentially dictum, since the court determined that a remand for a new trial was required because of a constitutional infirmity in the underlying statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>supra, 623 n.4 <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>supra, the trial court permitted the state to reopen its case to introduce the time of sunset after a motion for judgment of acquittal by the defendant had pointed out that the state had failed to introduce any evidence that an alleged burglary had taken place at night. Although this court affirmed the conviction, it found that reopening the case was unnecessary because the court had the power to take judicial notice of the time of sunset. Id., 615. Since judicial notice can be taken at any stage of the proceedings including on appeal; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>126 Conn. 614, 620-21, 13 A.2d 591 (1940); Fed. R. Evid. 201 (f); it did not matter whether or when the defendant pointed out the evidentiary gap. The fact that the time of sunset could be recognized by the court at any stage of the proceedings means that the defendant would never have been able to prevail on that issue, either at trial or on appeal. Thus, the issue of judicial notice makes <em>Zayas </em>significantly different from the facts of the present case. The state conceded at oral argument that <em>Zayas </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The only case in our jurisdiction that comes close to the facts of the present case is <em>State </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>103 Conn. 138, 145, 130 A. 96 (1925). There, after the state had rested, the defendant made a motion to dismiss on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>grounds that no evidence was presented on whether the beer was made from hops, malt or barley, a necessary element of the crime of illegally transporting intoxicating liquor. The trial court then permitted the state to reopen its case and present such evidence. We note that the state in <em>Levy, </em>unlike the state in this case, in resisting Levy\u2019s claim, maintained that it <em>had not </em>failed to prove the alleged missing element. The state argued both that enough evidence was present and that the reopening was appropriate. In contrast, the state in the present case has conceded that the evidence presented in its case-in-chief was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We also point out that in the present case the state offered new evidence on reopening and did not merely offer cumulative evidence or clarify previous testimony. An examination of the transcript shows that when Masterson originally testified on direct examination, he was unable to identify the weapon that was used against him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was only after the reopening and after the state had been unable to establish adequately a prima facie case that Masterson testified about the length of the gun barrel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These facts strengthen our conclusion that allowing the state to reopen its case<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in-chief after the defendant has identified its shortcomings was fundamentally unfair to the defendant and an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>People </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra, 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The notion that the defendant somehow induced this error by overlooking the applicable statute should also be dispelled. Both the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 175-76, and the state in its brief intimate that the defendant\u2019s citation of the incorrect statute (although identical to the proper statutory provision) led the trial court to overlook the correct statute. The transcript clearly shows, however, that the defendant never mentioned the incorrect statute at issue until <em>after </em>the state had rested. Thus, it is the state that is solely responsible for its failure to produce evidence on the length of the gun\u2019s barrel, concededly an element of the crime under General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. It can hardly be said that the state or the court was led to an incorrect decision by the defendant\u2019s ipcorrect citation. Rather than considering the applicable statute on the length of the barrel, the trial court agreed with the state that having <em>any </em>weapon in a motor vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>cle contravened the statute charged in the information. We cannot conclude that the defendant misled either the state or the court to their detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Our holding in this case does not preclude a trial court from exercising its discretion to reopen a case. We only hold that when the state has failed to make out a prima facie case because insufficient evidence has been introduced concerning an essential element of a crime and the defendant has specifically identified this evidentiary gap in a motion for judgment of acquittal, it is an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to permit a reopening of the case to supply the missing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court to remand the case to the trial court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal on the charge of having a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Shea and Glass, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> The defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years and not more than twenty years on the charge of attempted murder. On the charge of assault in the first degree, the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years and not more than twenty years, this sentence to run concurrently to the attempted murder sentence. On the charge of assault of a peace officer, the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five years and not more than ten years, this sentence to run consecutively to the attempted murder and assault in the first degree sentences. On the charge of having a weapon in a motor vehicle, the defendant was sentenced to a five year term of imprisonment to run consecutively to the other sentences. The defendant will not commence serving his sentence in Connecticut until he completes a Georgia sentence which he is currently serving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> This court limited its grant of certification to the following question: \u201cOn the charge of having a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes section 29-38, did the Appellate Court err in upholding the ruling of the trial court permitting the state to reopen its case-in-chief in order to present evidence of the length of the barrel of the firearm after the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal based upon the lack of such evidence had been denied?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 29-38 provides: \u201cweapons in vehicles.

I respectfully dissent. I do not believe that the trial court abused its broad discretion in this area by allowing the state to reopen its casein-chief and present additional evidence regarding the length of the gun barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Although it is, perhaps, unfortunate for this defendant that he brought the deficiency in the state\u2019s case to its attention, I fail to see that he has suffered any legal prejudice. The additional evidence was no more detrimental to him when offered than it would have been if offered on the state\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 F.2d 1, 3 (8th Cir. 1965). Further, he had a full opportunity to meet and rebut the additional evidence presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>90 Conn. 147, 152-53, 96 A. 941 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>I agree with the Appellate Court that <em>\u201c \u2018 \u201ca </em>trial is not a game of technicalities, but one in which the facts and truth are sought.\u201d . . . \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>9 Conn. App. 169, 174, 517 A.2d 1043 (1986). That means to me that an obviously guilty defendant should not be acquitted because of inadvertence or mistake, no matter how brought to light, when any lapse or error can be corrected. In this particular case our holding is, perhaps, of no great significance because this defendant was convicted of more serious crimes. I fear, however, that limiting the discretion of the trial court in the manner we have will result in serious and regrettable consequences down the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">I also do not believe that the spectre, raised by the majority, of possibly eliminating the usefulness of Practice Book \u00a7 883 is real. If the state does not present evidence of all the elements of a crime on its case-in-chief, the usual reason is that the evidence is not available. It is that situation that I think a motion for acquittal under Practice Book \u00a7 883 was intended to address and would continue to be used to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
