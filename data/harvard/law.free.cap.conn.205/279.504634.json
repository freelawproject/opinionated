The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court erred in: (1) failing to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (2);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) admitting testimony concerning a rope allegedly used in the murder; (3) admitting evidence relative to the state of mind of the victim and her daughter; (4) admitting evidence of two acts of violence committed by the defendant; and (5) denying the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial on the ground that improper cross-examination of former counsel impaired the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>and constituted prosecutorial misconduct. We disagree with each of these claims and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant lived with the victim, Sara Rose, and her twelve year old daughter in a New Haven apartment. Because of her deteriorating relationship with the defendant, the victim moved out of that apartment on or about March 31,1982. She and her daughter lived temporarily with her parents while they prepared to move to a new apartment in West Haven. On several occasions the defendant attempted to effect a reconciliation, but the victim rejected his efforts. On Palm Sunday, April 4,1982, the day the victim was last seen alive, witnesses observed the defendant in the early morning standing behind a pillar near the entrance to the telephone company where the victim was employed. He also was seen that day at the 11 a.m. church service the victim attended, and again in the telephone company parking lot when the victim left work at 7 p.m. A security guard saw the defendant drive the victim\u2019s car recklessly out of the parking lot with the victim as his passenger. The victim was not seen again until her body was found floating in the Quinnipiac River in New Haven on May 8, 1982. The victim\u2019s hands were bound behind her back, her legs were bound together at the ankles, and a bucket was attached to her feet, all with the type of rope used for clothesline.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The defendant first claims error in the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. A manslaughter instruction is appropriate when the evidence is legally sufficient to justify a conclusion that a murder has been committed \u201cunder the influence of extreme emotional disturbance.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (2). \u201c[A]n extreme emotional disturbance is one where self-control and reason are overborne by intense feelings such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 9, 411 A.2d 3 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A lesser included offense instruction is \u201cpurely a matter of our common law\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155,158, 506 A.2d 104 (1986); rather than a constitutional right. Such an instruction is required when \u201cthere is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). In this case, neither did the defendant specifically assert the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor was there sufficient evidence put forth at trial to require a charge on extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 732, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 419-22, 441 A.2d 846 (1982). Indeed, the defendant did not admit that he killed the victim, let alone that he did so under mitigating circumstances. The principal facts on this issue related to the defendant\u2019s allegedly distraught condition <em>after </em>the victim\u2019s disappearance. We conclude that, under these circumstances, the trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning a rope allegedly used in the crime. The victim\u2019s sister, Joanne Thompson, testified that on Friday, April 2,1982, she helped the victim move her belongings from the apartment she had shared with the defendant. While there, Thompson observed a clothesline hung with clothes in the basement. On Monday, April 5,1982, the day after the victim disappeared, Thompson returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment to look for the victim and noticed that the clothesline had been cut. At trial, Thompson identified the rope which had been used to bind the victim\u2019s hands and feet as similar to the clothesline rope she had observed, first intact and later cut, in the defendant\u2019s basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in admitting this testimony without first establishing that the rope removed from the victim was indeed the rope hung as the defendant\u2019s clothesline. We disagree. Evidence is relevant if it \u201c \u2018tends to establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 168, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987). Determinations of relevancy are within the broad discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned in the absence of clear abuse of that discretion. Id., 167-68. In making such determinations, a trial court is not required to find as a prerequisite to admissibility that evidence is conclusively linked to other evidence. \u201cEvidence is not rendered inadmissible simply because it is not conclusive. It is admissible if it tends to support a relevant fact even in a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative. . . . The defendant\u2019s objection goes essentially to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 548-49, 498 A.2d 76 (1985). In analogous factual settings, this court has explicitly found admissible evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>dence tending to show that an accused had access to the means to commit the crime charged. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987) (evidence that handcuffs were used at defendant\u2019s place of work admissible to show defendant\u2019s access to handcuffs); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147, 157, 502 A.2d 874 (1985) (evidence of knife in defendant\u2019s possession admissible despite lack of proof establishing it as the knife used in the crime). We find no error in the admission of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The defendant next claims error in the admission of testimony concerning the state of mind of the victim and her daughter, from which the jury could have inferred that they feared the defendant. Evidence in this regard consisted of testimony from four witnesses centering on two events. Kevin Moore, a frequent visitor to the home of the victim\u2019s parents, and Patricia Rose, the victim\u2019s sister, both testified as to certain events of April 1,1982. Both witnesses stated that on that date, while the victim was staying at her parents\u2019 apartment, the defendant came to look for her there. Both witnesses testified that when the victim was told that the defendant was at the door, she ran into a bedroom to hide.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Two other witnesses were Shirley Wright and Sherry Springer, neighbors of the victim and the defendant during the time they lived together. The women testified concerning arguments between the victim and the defendant, and their effect on the victim\u2019s twelve year old daughter, Nicole. The witnesses testified that, in one of these incidents shortly before the victim moved out, the defendant had held a knife to the victim\u2019s throat. Nicole had sought the neighbors\u2019 intervention and had been \u201cshaking,\u201d \u201ctrembling\u201d and \u201cafraid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The defendant objected to this evidence at trial and continues to challenge it on appeal on grounds of hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>say and prejudice. The state introduced the testimony that the victim hid from the defendant to support its theory that the motive for the murder was the deteriorating relationship between the victim and the defendant. The trial court expressly instructed the jury that the purpose of the evidence was to show that the relationship had broken down, and that, consistent with the state\u2019s theory of the case, the victim\u2019s estrangement from the defendant supplied the motive for him to commit murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the neighbors\u2019 testimony relative to the argument and the defendant\u2019s knife wielding was admitted to show that the defendant had threatened the victim and, further, to support the state\u2019s theory as to motive and intent. Testimony describing Nicole\u2019s observable distress as a consequence of the domestic arguments was introduced as further evidence of the deteriorating and stormy relationship between the victim and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Nonassertive conduct such as running to hide, or shaking and trembling, is not hearsay. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 166,173, 496 A.2d 190 (1985). The trial court correctly determined that the contested testimony was reliable circumstantial evidence of a deteriorated relationship. As such, it was relevant and probative because it tended to support the state\u2019s claim that the relationship had broken down, and from that circumstance the jury could infer motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>While the testimony concerning these episodes was adverse to the defendant, we find no unfair prejudice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 12, 509 A.2d 493 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>180 Conn. 481, 490, 429 A.2d 931 (1980). Because we hold that the disputed testimony was relevant, not hearsay, and not unfairly prejudicial to the defendant, we find no error on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of two acts of violence involving him. The first such instance was the argument with the victim, during which the defendant held a knife to the victim\u2019s throat. The second such incident involved an argument with the victim\u2019s father a few days after her disappearance, which developed into an altercation in which the defendant cut the victim\u2019s father\u2019s hand with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">With respect to the first incident, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted this evidence as probative of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent. Evidence of the violent argument clearly bore on the deteriorated relationship which, the state theorized, supplied the motive for the murder. While \u201cevidence of prior acts of misconduct is inadmissible merely to show a defendant\u2019s bad character or tendency to commit criminal acts . . .\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4,15, 526 A.2d 1311 (1987); such evidence \u201cmay be allowed for the purpose of proving . . . <em>intent </em>[or] <em>motive </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). The trial court, furthermore, instructed the jury on the limited ground of admissibility of this evidence. The defendant did not object to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">As to the second incident, part of the state\u2019s proof in this case included the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt as manifested by his sudden reluctance to communicate with the victim\u2019s family following her disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>pearance. After the victim had terminated their relationship and abruptly moved out of the apartment they had shared, the defendant had made efforts to effect a reconciliation. He had attempted to visit her at her parents\u2019 home, had engaged her in conversation at church on Palm Sunday, and was seen waiting outside her place of employment, and in the parking lot there on the last day she was known to be alive. Thereafter, the defendant was unwilling to cooperate with the victim\u2019s family in their frantic efforts to locate their daughter. On the sixth day of her unexplained absence, the defendant argued with the victim\u2019s father when they encountered each other in the street, knocked the father\u2019s hat off, and ran away. The defendant\u2019s efforts to secure a reconciliation with the victim prior to her disappearance, contrasted with his avoidance of and hostility toward her family afterward, was relevant evidence from which the jury could infer a guilty state of mind. Such \u201c 'consciousness of guilt\u2019 is strong evidence that the person is indeed guilty . . . .\u201d <em>State v.Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 596, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The defendant claims that the incident with the victim\u2019s father constitutes evidence of prior misconduct and, as such, is inadmissible. This is not the case. The victim\u2019s father was permitted to testify only as to the defendant knocking his hat off and running away when they met each other on the street. Significantly, he was <em>not </em>allowed to testify beyond that to the scuffle that ensued and the resulting knife wound inflicted by the defendant. The jury learned that a knife had been used in the encounter only from the defendant\u2019s own account of it. Tape recordings of the defendant\u2019s April 10,1982 telephone calls to the victim\u2019s sister and to a police detective were played for the jury as part of the state\u2019s case. In those conversations, the defendant characterized the episode as an unprovoked attack, in which he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>as an innocent victim, was acting in self-defense by deflecting the knife wielded by the aggressor, the victim\u2019s father, who was thereby cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The incident, so portrayed and uncontradicted, can hardly be said to constitute evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct. \u201cBecause the admission of such evidence involves judicial discretion, \u2018[o]ur review is limited to whether [the] ruling exceeded the latitude accorded to the exercise of [such] discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147,158, 502 A.2d 874 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). In this case, the trial court excised irrelevant portions of the tapes, and stated its intention to instruct the jury as to the limited grounds for admissibility of the tape recordings. The defendant, in response, expressly declined the court\u2019s offer of such a limiting instruction. \u201cIf the trial judge, in the exercise of his judicial discretion, determines that the evidence is relevant and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect, his decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 157; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 549, 461 A.2d 981 (1983). Under these circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of these two acts of violence by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Finally, the defendant claims error in the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s prior counsel. The defendant called his former attorney as his own witness, to testify that he had advised the defendant not to make statements to anyone and thus to explain the defendant\u2019s uncooperative attitude toward the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In the absence of the jury, a colloquy took place between counsel and the court. Defense counsel expressed concern about minimizing questions from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>prosecutor upon cross-examination which would require invocation of the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mindful of the fact that the defendant himself had produced this witness and thereby created the situation in which possible unfair inferences might arise, the trial court sought to balance the state\u2019s right to full cross-examination with the defendant\u2019s right to invoke a privilege free from resulting negative inferences. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115,126-27, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The court advised counsel, before examination of the witness began, that the state might be placed in an untenable position if the prosecutor was absolutely forbidden to pursue any line of questioning which might conceivably touch on the issue of attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant, who persisted in calling the attorney witness, cannot now be heard to complain on appeal that he was \u201cforced\u201d to invoke the privilege in front of the jury. Moreover, any harm that may have been caused by the state\u2019s cross-examination was cured by the court\u2019s limiting instruction immediately following the conclusion of the attorney witness\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>instruction which was thereafter reinforced at the time of the charge to the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in pertinent part: \u201cmurder DEFINED.
