Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alg\">The defendant, Daniel Jones, was found guilty on July 2,1984, after a jury trial, of the crime of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c and 53a-54a (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">On April 2, 1982, seventy-five year old Theodore Mclnnis reported for his job as a boiler attendant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the 3 to 11 p.m. shift at St. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral in Hartford. During that shift, Mclnnis was encountered and attacked by the defendant, Floyd Simms and Waymon Mohagel. During that attack, his key ring, watch and ring were stolen. Mclnnis\u2019 body was discovered on the morning of April 3, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On April 26, 1982, Jones was already in custody on unrelated charges.when he was arraigned on the felony murder charge in Superior Court, geographical area No. 14. While in custody and before the case was transferred to part A of the Hartford Superior Court, he gave statements to the police on three separate occasions\u2014April 20, April 21 and April 28, 1982. Thereafter, the defendant was presented before a grand jury, which returned an indictment against him on June 30,1982, charging him with felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c and 53a-54a (c). At the defendant\u2019s trial, Mohagel testified for the state<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> providing crucial evidence against the defendant. A jury found the defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting his April 28, 1982 statement, which was allegedly obtained in violation of his fifth and sixth amendment rights under the federal constitution, as well as his state constitutional rights; (2) admitting inflammatory \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence on common scheme grounds, thus prejudicing the jury because that evidence did not manifest a \u201cunique pattern\u201d or bear \u201cstriking similarity\u201d to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>charged; (3) abusing its discretion by permitting the state on redirect examination to examine Mohagel in detail about four additional criminal acts that the defendant committed; and (4) denying his constitutional right of confrontation by refusing to permit him to impeach Mohagel concerning an undisclosed felony underlying an earlier youthful offender adjudication of Mohagel. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that his federal and state constitutional rights<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to counsel and to remain silent were violated when, after the initiation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>of adversarial judicial criminal proceedings, a police officer, with the permission of the prosecuting attorney, met with him and interrogated him. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">This claim of error is addressed to the trial court\u2019s admission into evidence, after a midtrial suppression hearing, of the defendant\u2019s statement made in jail to Detective James Malcolm of the Hartford police department on April 28,1982. The defendant claims that the evidence at that hearing does not support the finding that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his sixth amendment right to counsel following the initiation of adversarial judicial criminal proceedings. He also makes a distinct claim that the record does not demonstrate such a waiver of his fifth amendment right to remain silent. Arguing that the presumption against waiver of constitutional rights applies \u201cdiscretely\u201d to his sixth amendment right to counsel and to his <em>Miranda </em>rights; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 463-65, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); he claims that Malcolm met with him in jail on April 28, 1982, in order to interrogate him concerning this crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The defendant also claims that Malcolm did so without clarifying for him the consequences of what he maintains was the invocation of his constitutional rights to silence and counsel. Sensing some problem about whether he or Malcolm was the one who \u201cinitiated\u201d the discussions leading to his incriminatory statements of April 28, 1982, the defendant claims that while he may have \u201cinvited the [jail] meeting\u201d with Malcolm \u201cin a general sense\u201d by having telephoned Malcolm on April 27,1982, and asking to see Malcolm, he, nevertheless, did not invite Malcolm\u2019s interrogation at their meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The state, on the other hand, claims that the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his fifth and sixth amendment rights so that the defendant\u2019s statements to Malcolm on April 28,1982, were properly admitted at the trial. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In order properly to pass upon the claims of the parties and the action of the trial court at the suppression hearing concerning the April 28,1982 statement of the defendant, certain circumstances should first be set out. On that date, the defendant was nineteen years of age, could read and write and had completed the eleventh grade. He had been in jail since April 20,1982,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the charge of burglary in the first degree and assault. On April 20,1982, he had given a written statement concerning that incident after having waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights in writing, and he subsequently gave a second written statement on April 21, 1982, concerning the same incident after again executing a written waiver of newly administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Hartford detectives James Malcolm and Paul Vanderheiden were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the officers who obtained the April 21,1982 statement from the defendant and they ascertained at that time that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights when he waived them. On April 21, 1982, the defendant admitted to these detectives that he had lied in his statement of the previous day as to who was responsible for the robberies in the cathedral, that he was involved in the April 8, 1982 mugging in the cathedral of a ninety year old man and that he \u201cbelieved\u201d that Simms and Mohagel were responsible for the Mclnnis homicide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The evidence at the suppression hearing also disclosed that the defendant had been arraigned before the Superior Court, <em>Tamborra, J., </em>on April 26, 1982, on the charge of felony murder. At that time, the state requested that the court give a \u201cspecial advisement on a lawyer.\u201d The court proceeded to do so, advising the defendant of his fifth and sixth amendment rights, including his right to be \u201crepresented by [his] own attorney while [being questioned] by the police and at all other times.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On that occasion, the court appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>a public defender to represent the defendant for bond purposes only because of certain representations made to the court by the defendant\u2019s mother, who was present. She said that she was attempting to obtain private counsel for her son, and, because she had been unsuccessful, she requested, and was given, a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On the morning of April 27, 1982, the defendant telephoned Malcolm from the jail and asked him to come to see him that night after the defendant had returned from a scheduled court appearance that day. At that time, Malcolm informed the defendant that \u201che [the defendant] did not have to speak with [Malcolm] and if wanted, he [the defendant] could have his lawyer there during the questioning or the interview.\u201d The defendant responded, according to Malcolm, by saying, \u201cI still want to talk to you.\u201d Malcolm indicated to the defendant that he \u201cwould be willing to talk to him.\u201d Malcolm then telephoned an assistant state\u2019s attorney, discussed the defendant\u2019s request and asked if it was \u201cokay to go over and see [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On the morning of April 28, 1982, Malcolm did go to the jail alone to see the defendant. Upon his arrival, Malcolm had to sign a form requesting to see the defendant, which then had to be taken to the defendant for his consent to the interview. When the defendant came to the interview room, Malcolm advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights from the same card that was used previously and ascertained that the defendant understood them. The defendant, however, refused to sign a written waiver of those rights. Asked if he would give a written statement, the defendant said that he would not. Malcolm said that the defendant told him that his mother was going to get an attorney from New Haven. Malcolm, who knew that the defendant had been arraigned, presumed that he had the services of a public defender. He told the defendant that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201ccould have him here with us during this interview.\u201d The defendant understood that and said that his \u201cattorney had told [him] not to sign anything and not to talk to any police officer.\u201d Once the defendant said that to Malcolm, the detective \u201cgot up and attempted to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">At that point, the defendant asked Malcolm to sit down and stated that he \u201cwanted to talk to [Malcolm] about the homicide.\u201d Once again, he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights from the same card and he again stated that he understood them. Upon being asked if he would waive those rights and give a written statement, the defendant said that his \u201clawyer had told [him] not to sign anything and not to talk to any police officer.\u201d Malcolm then folded up the notebook that he had in his hand and started for a second time to go toward the door of the interview room. Without any inquiry from Malcolm, Jones asked \u201cwhich <em>one </em>of them put the blame on [me]?\u201d (Emphasis added.) In replying to the defendant, Malcolm said that only two parties had been arrested for felony murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After telling the defendant that, Malcolm then read to the defendant those parts of Simms\u2019 statement \u201cinvolving [the defendant].\u201d When he finished, the defendant asked to read the statement himself, whereupon Malcolm handed it to him and the defendant read it himself. Simms\u2019 statement not only implicated the defendant in other crimes but implicated him in the felony murder of Mclnnis.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>When the defendant had completed reading the statement, he volunteered certain observations concerning its contents. He said that it was Simms, not he, who, on a different occasion, had been the one who had hit an old man (William McGee) who had been praying in the cathedral, although he did admit that he and Mohagel had been present at the time. He admitted that he, Simms and Mohagel had begun \u201cdoing the muggings\u201d about the first week of April, 1982. In addition, he denied Simms\u2019 statement that he had worn Simms\u2019 vest on the night of the homicide and that he had borrowed Simms\u2019 black suede sneakers with orange laces.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, he said that Simms had given him a pair of blue sneakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">After the defendant had made these statements, Malcolm then asked him if he had ever seen Simms with a large key ring. The defendant responded that Simms \u201calways had a large key ring . . . a lot of keys with him.\u201d He then asked the defendant \u201cto describe how they killed the old man.\u201d The defendant responded that he could not tell Malcolm his involvement at that time in the homicide, but that he would contact his lawyer. Then, without any intervening question of him by Malcolm, the defendant stated that \u201cFloyd [Simms], Raymond [sic] [Mohagel] and [himself] were involved and were present during the time the homicide went down.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At that juncture, the defendant said that he \u201cwanted to contact [his] lawyer,\u201d the interview ended and Malcolm left.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The right to counsel is guaranteed by both the fifth and sixth amendments to the United States constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tion. The sixth amendment accords the right of an \u201caccused\u201d to the assistance of counsel in \u201call criminal prosecutions\u201d; this right attaches \u201conly at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated . . . . \u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 688, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 190, 104 S. Ct. 2292, 81 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1984); <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 401, 97 S. Ct. 1232, 51 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 726 n.1, 508 A.2d 748 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>196 Conn. 557, 560-61, 494 A.2d 1190 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 44 n.10, 463 A.2d 573 (1983). \u201cIt is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the \u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Elinois, </em>supra, 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The state in this case acknowledges, as it must, that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel attached at the time of his April 26,1982 arraignment on the charge of felony murder. The state also recognizes that, because the defendant did assert his desire for counsel at this arraignment hearing, the sixth amendment prohibited the state from initiating interrogation or intentionally creating a situation likely to induce the defendant to make incriminating statements without the assistance of his counsel. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 635, 106 S. Ct. 1404, 89 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1986); see <em>Henry </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 264, 275, 100 S. Ct. 2183, 65 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1980). On the other hand, the fifth amendment, unlike the sixth amendment, contains no explicit language providing for the right to counsel. The United States Supreme Court, however, held in <em>Miranda </em>that such a right was necessary to protect an accused\u2019s fifth amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination during custodial interrogation. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 469-70; see <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 629; <em>Edwards </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 485-86, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981). Thus, \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel is analytically distinct from the Fifth Amendment right created by <em>Miranda. Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300 n.4, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 1689 n.4, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karr, </em>742 F.2d 493, 495 (9th Cir. 1984). The defendant\u2019s request for an attorney at the arraignment was an invocation of only his sixth amendment right to counsel and not of his fifth amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, was a fifth amendment case. In <em>Edwards, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that an accused in custody who has \u201cexpressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 484-85; see <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 104 S. Ct. 1338, 79 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1984). In <em>Edwards, </em>the request for counsel was made to the police during custodial interrogation and the basis for the holding was the fifth amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Several years later, drawing on <em>Edwards, </em>the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, set out a new test to be used in determining the validity of a defendant\u2019s waiver of his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel. <em>Jackson </em>held that if the police initiate interrogation after a defendant asserts, \u201cat an arraignment or similar proceeding,\u201d his sixth amendment right to counsel, any waiver of that right for that \u201cpolice-initiated\u201d interrogation is invalid. Id., 636. In applying the rule of <em>Edwards </em>to the sixth amendment right, the <em>Jackson </em>majority said that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a postarraign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ment interrogation requires <em>at least as much protection </em>as the Fifth Amendment right to counsel at any custodial interrogation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On the issue of waiver, the <em>Jackson </em>majority, after reiterating the indulgence of every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights rule of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938), with its attendant burden of establishing waiver on the prosecution; see <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 404; addressed the nature of the interpretation of a defendant\u2019s request for counsel. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 633. The \u201csettled approach,\u201d illustrated by the references to <em>Zerbst </em>and <em>Brewer, </em>\u201crequire[dj\u201d the <em>Jackson </em>court to \u201cgive a broad, rather than a narrow, interpretation to a defendant\u2019s request for counsel\u2014we presume that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at every critical stage of the prosecution.\u201d Id. Moreover, in <em>Jackson, </em>the state of Michigan maintained that the defendants had made a valid waiver of their sixth amendment rights by signing a postarraignment confession after again being advised of their constitutional rights. In refusing to accept this argument, the <em>Jackson </em>court pointed out that in <em>Edwards, </em>\u201cwe rejected the notion that, after a suspect\u2019s request for counsel, advice of rights and acquiescence in police-initiated questioning could establish a valid waiver.\u201d Id., 635. It went on to say: \u201cJust as written waivers are insufficient to justify police-initiated interrogations after the request for counsel in a Fifth Amendment analysis, so too they are insufficient to justify police-initiated interrogations after the request for counsel in a Sixth Amendment analysis.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Turning to the sixth amendment context of this case, we agree that the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the defendant was the one who requested that Malcolm come to the jail to see him on April 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>1982. We also agree with its conclusion that, at the jail, the defendant \u201cinitiated\u201d further communications, exchanges or conversations with the police and validly waived his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">It is evident from what we have already set out that this defendant had received and waived <em>Miranda </em>warnings more than once. Moreover, he had received the \u201cspecial advisement on a lawyer\u201d at his arraignment only two days earlier. There can be no question that he solicited and requested that Malcolm come to the jail to see him. Malcolm, with the knowledge he had, promptly and correctly told the defendant that he did not have to talk to him and that he could have his lawyer with him during the questioning at the interview. The defendant, nevertheless, said that he still wanted to talk to him. Malcolm\u2019s call to the state\u2019s attorney, as the result of the defendant\u2019s call to him, indicates Malcolm\u2019s sensitivity, not only to moving cautiously, but also to the recognition that undertaking a jail visit generated by a person arraigned on the charge of felony murder implicated that person\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. It would be illusory to say that Malcolm was not interested in obtaining information about this crime from the defendant, but this record bears out that Malcolm carefully endeavored to insulate his police activity from illegal taint. That the defendant remained intent on seeing and talking to Malcolm is further indicated by the fact that when Malcolm arrived at the jail, the defendant still had to sign a form consenting to see Malcolm when the latter arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">When the defendant first appeared in the interview room, Malcolm promptly again advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and ascertained that the defendant understood them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When Malcolm asked the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ant if he would give a written statement, the defendant said that his attorney had told him not to sign anything and not to talk to any police officer. The defendant was aware of his rights and obviously knew when to invoke them. Malcolm made no further inquiry to dissuade the defendant, but, rather, he attempted to leave because, as a police officer, he knew that the interview was being terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The defendant, at his own instance, then asked Malcolm to sit down and said that he \u201cwanted to talk to [Malcolm] about the homicide.\u201d Malcolm prudentially then again informed the defendant of his rights and again ascertained that he understood them. The defendant once again displayed that he knew how to invoke his rights when he again refused to sign a written statement upon Malcolm\u2019s request, stating again that his lawyer had told him not to sign anything and not to talk to any police officer. Malcolm then folded up his notebook and started to go toward the door of the interview room. Without, more, the defendant asked Malcolm \u201cwhich one\u201d put the blame on him. There can be no question about what the defendant meant and what he wanted to find out. This direct question was the initiation by him of \u201cfurther communicationfs], exchanges or conversation with the police,\u201d about the homicide with which he was charged, after he had invoked his right to counsel and to remain silent. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra; <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1044, 103 S. Ct. 2830, 77 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1983); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 485; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>203 Conn. 212, 224, 523 A.2d 1306 (1987). This was no inquiry \u201crelating to routine incidents of the custodial relationship\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>which will generally not \u201cinitiate\u201d a conversation as that term was used in <em>Edwards. Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>supra, 1045. Malcolm could reasonably have interpreted that unambiguous question to relate directly to the investigation of the felony murder of Mclnnis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. This was no unfocused and ambiguous inquiry by an uncounseled defendant. Given all the circumstances, Malcolm did not have to clarify the defendant\u2019s comprehension of his rights including their waiver before proceeding any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We are aware that waiver presents a factual issue. Despite this, \u201c \u2018our usual deference to the finding of the trial court on questions of this nature is qualified by the necessity for a scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain whether such a finding is supported by substantial evidence. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 580, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986). The trial court\u2019s ruling satisfies this standard. The totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the defendant voluntarily waived his sixth amendment right to deal with the police through counsel and that he made that waiver \u201c \u2018with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of [his] decision to abandon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 573, 107 S. Ct. 851, 93 L. Ed. 2d 954 (1987); <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra, 464. His decision to relinquish this protection was, on this record, voluntary; i.e., it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion or deception. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra. Only last year, the United States Supreme Court said that it had \u201cnever read the Constitution to require that the police supply a suspect with a flow of information to help him calibrate his self interest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights. See, e.g., <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>[470 U.S. 298, 316-17, 105 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Ct. 1285, 84 L.

Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived. <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>[442 U.S. 707, 725, 99 S.

If a suspect indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u2018the interrogation must cease\u2019 and if he requests counsel, \u2018the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 474; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 482. <em>Miranda </em>also holds that \u2018[t]he defendant may waive effectuation\u2019 of the rights conveyed in the warnings, \u2018provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 444; see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>[supra]. Once a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, he is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made available to him \u2018unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police\u2019; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 484-85; <em>and </em>he has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel that he has previously invoked. <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 107 S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1987); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra. Waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights must, of course, be voluntary. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>supra, 421.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 223-24; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 48-50, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987) .</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Many of the circumstances already discussed with reference to the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment claim apply to our determination of his fifth amendment claims. We have described his receipt and awareness of his rights given to him on a number of occasions, his solicitation of the visit from Malcolm, the careful attention of Malcolm in advising him of his rights before proceeding at various stages of the April 28,1982 interview, his unambiguous requests for Malcolm not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>leave on two occasions, his unmistakable query for specific information from Malcolm and his posture in deciding to invoke his rights when he chose to do so. His informed decision and his free choice to relinquish his fifth amendment rights must stand. There was no intimidation, coercion or deception on the part of Malcolm. There was, despite his claim to the contrary, nothing ambiguous about the defendant\u2019s comprehension of his rights or his position. He made no request for counsel that was equivocal and that reasonably called for clarification from Malcolm. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 443, 513 A.2d 620 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>187 Conn. 647, 674-75, 448 A.2d 163, cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1224,103 S. Ct. 3570, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1411 (1983). His argument that his refusal to put anything in writing was an expression of his desire to have counsel there that somehow invoked his right to counsel must fail for two reasons. First, the evaluation of the evidence touching this matter which is the fairest to the defendant does not justify any such inference. Second, each time the defendant refused to give a signed statement, coupled as the refusal was with his relating what his lawyer had told him, Malcolm scrupulously treated the interview as over. The defendant, at his own instance, \u201cinitiated,\u201d in the <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>sense, the communication that culminated in his admissible statement of April 28, 1982. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. With this sufficient waiver, there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the introduction of evidence of other crimes committed by the defendant was highly inflammatory and prejudiced the jury. The defendant argues that evidence of these other crimes neither demonstrated a unique pattern nor indicated a striking similarity to the charged offense, and therefore was inadmissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The state made an offer of proof on two crimes, both of which had resulted in guilty pleas entered by the defendant after his indictment on the felony murder charge at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The first incident introduced into evidence was a burglary committed at a home for the retarded on April 10, 1982. Mohagel, the defendant\u2019s accomplice in this burglary, testified at the offer of proof that he and the defendant had gone to the home for the retarded on that evening for the purpose of breaking in and \u201ctaking valuables.\u201d The pair entered a bedroom occupied by a man and a woman. While Mohagel took items from the room, the defendant was \u201cbeating up\u201d the occupants. After taking items from an unoccupied bedroom, they proceeded to a third room where a woman was listening to a stereo through earphones. The defendant pulled the plug on the stereo and put a pillow over the woman\u2019s head. After Mohagel removed numerous items from the room, he finally had to pull the defendant \u201coff the lady\u201d who had been struggling with the defendant. The two proceeded to a fourth room, where screaming by the home\u2019s occupants forced them to flee the home. The state offered into evidence an exhibit that was a stipulation that on July 6,1983, the defendant had pleaded guilty to first degree burglary at the home for the retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The state maintained that this incident showed a common design or mode of operation indicating that the defendant would take personal property from vulnerable victims and use \u201cexcessive force.\u201d The state also emphasized the close proximity in time to the charged offense (eight days). The defendant argued that the probative value of that incident was greatly outweighed by its prejudice to the defendant. The trial court, noting the proximity in time and the similarity of the incidents including the beating up of the victims, determined that the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The second incident introduced into evidence concerned a robbery at St. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral on April 8, 1982. William McGee, aged ninety, testified at the offer of proof that he was praying at 4 p.m. that afternoon in a pew at St. Joseph\u2019s in Hartford. Simms, who participated in this robbery with Mohegal and the defendant, attempted to shove McGee under the pew, ripped his pants and removed his wallet. Simms tried to kick McGee but the victim temporarily halted the assault by grabbing Simms\u2019 leg. As McGee attempted to escape, the three assailants surrounded him and the defendant struck him in the face, breaking three bones in the jaw and cheek. Malcolm testified that, approximately two weeks after the incident, McGee had identified the defendant from photographs as one of the perpetrators of the robbery. The state also introduced into evidence an exhibit that indicated that on July 6, 1983, the defendant had pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine to the first degree robbery of McGee.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The state argued that the McGee robbery was relevant to issues of \u201cintent or identity or modus operandi\u201d because it occurred at the same location as the present crime, the victim was vulnerable and \u201cexcessive or gratuitous violence\u201d was used. The defendant maintained that there is a distinction between a robbery and felony murder, and again asserted that the robbery\u2019s prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value. The trial court determined that the evidence was admissible because the robbery was committed within six days of the felony murder at the same location, each crime involved a physical beating, each victim was elderly and, lastly, that its probative value outweighed its pre-judical impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\u201c \u2018As a general rule, evidence of guilt of other crimes is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged against him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>147 Conn. 589, 599,164 A.2d 399 [1960].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Freder-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>icks, </em>149 Conn. 121, 124, 176 A.2d 581 (1961).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 675, 469 A.2d 760 (1983); C. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 190; 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Evidence (13th Ed.) \u00a7 170. The rationale of this rule is to guard against the use of such evidence to show the defendant\u2019s bad character or to suggest that the defendant has a propensity for criminal behavior. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>200 Conn. 440, 442, 512 A.2d 175 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>190 Conn. 104, 107-108, 459 A.2d 510 (1982). Such evidence, however, may be admissible for other purposes, such as \u201cto prove knowledge, intent, motive, and common scheme or design, if the trial court determines, in the exercise of judicial discretion, that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial tendency.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizzi, </em>199 Conn. 462, 468, 508 A.2d 16 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The analysis on the issue of other crimes evidence is two-pronged. \u201cFirst, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crimes evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>supra, 676. \u201cBecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>[181 Conn. 406, 416,435 A.2d 986 (1980)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>[178 Conn. 116, 129, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>[172 Conn. 140, 144, 374 A.2d 150 (1976)]. On review by this court, therefore, \u2018every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>[182 Conn. 335,337,438 A.2d 107 (1980)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>187 Conn. 681, 685, 447 A.2d 1167 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The trial court admitted the evidence of the burglary at the home for the retarded and the robbery of McGee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>at St. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral because it demonstrated a common scheme or design. When evidence of other crimes is offered to show a common design, \u201cthe marks which the [other] and the charged offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 172, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). \u201cIt is not enough that the two offenses are similar. To establish a common design, the characteristics of the two offenses must be sufficiently distinctive and unique \u2018as to be like a signature.\u2019 McCormick, Evidence, supra, p. 560.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>supra, 443. \u201c \u2018On the other hand, the inference need not depend upon one or more unique features common [to both offenses], for features of substantial but lesser distinctiveness, although insufficient to raise the inference if considered separately, may yield a distinctive combination if considered together.\u2019 . . . <em>People </em>v. <em>Haston, </em>69 Cal. 2d 233, 245-46, 444 P.2d 91, 70 Cal. Rptr. 419 (1968).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra. In order to assess the defendant\u2019s claim, we must examine the other crimes evidence and compare it to the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The burglary at the home for the retarded occurred in the same general neighborhood as the alleged felony murder and occurred only eight days later. The robbery of McGee took place at the exact location as the charged offense and occurred only six days later. Proximity in time and place are often probative of a common scheme or design. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>199 Conn. 146, 152, 506 A.2d 100 (1986) (liquor store robberies were located near each other, on same street); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>196 Conn. 185, 191, 491 A.2d 1092 (1985) (burglaries occurred three weeks apart); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 170 (crimes occurred five weeks apart); <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 684 (incidents occurred within five minute walk of each other). In all three inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>dents the same perpetrators were involved. The defendant was accompanied by both Simms and Mohagel in the charged offense and the robbery at St. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral. The defendant and Mohagel were involved in the burglary of the home for the retarded. Participation in various offenses by the same parties can be significant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>supra. The victims in all three cases were highly vulnerable: McGee and Mclnnis were both elderly, and the victims of the burglary were retarded. Although vulnerable persons such as the elderly and retarded are disproportionately victims of crime and this evidence should not by itself rise to a level of a \u201csignature crime,\u201d the fact that this trio often preyed on highly vulnerable persons was probative of a common scheme or design. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 170; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, 187 Conn. </em>6, 24, 444 A.2d 213 (1982) (attacks on young girls).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The most significant similarity of the other crimes evidence is the excessive and unnecessary violence perpetrated by the defendant in all three incidents. The testimony revealed that in the burglary of the home for the retarded, the defendant had to be \u201cpulled off\u201d a retarded woman whom he was beating, that in the robbery, the defendant broke three bones in the victim\u2019s face, and that in the alleged felony murder, the defendant stomped, punched and kicked the victim. In all three cases, the violence was unnecessary to the underlying larceny. All the force necessary to accomplish the taking of the personal property was utilized before the defendant used excessive violence in all three cases: Mohagel had completed his larceny in the room before he had to pull the defendant off the woman; .Simms had taken McGee\u2019s wallet when the defendant struck McGee; the key ring, watch and ring had already been taken from Mclnnis when the defendant repeatedly struck him. We agree with the trial court that the amount of force and the timing of the violence were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>probative of a common scheme and identity in this case. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra (defendant displayed violent and aggressive behavior); <em>Cook </em>v. <em>State, </em>158 Ga. App. 389, 280 S.E.2d 409 (1981) (nightclub security officer similarly attacked and inflicted serious head wounds on patrons).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Taking the circumstances of the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence as a whole and comparing them to the charged offense justifies the inference that the individual who committed the first two offenses also committed the second. <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 171. We conclude that the trial court correctly held that the circumstances of the other crimes were sufficiently similar to the charged offense to be probative of identity or a common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Having determined that the evidence of other crimes was relevant and material, we must now review the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>supra, 445-46; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn, 128, 136, 486 A.2d 637 (1985). The trial court, while noting that the similarity of the incident at the home for the retarded made the evidence probative, also recognized that there was \u201ca prejudicial effect.\u201d The trial court, however, specifically found that the probative value of the evidence outweighed this prejudice. It made a similar finding for the robbery of McGee. Thus, it is apparent that the trial court realized the potential prejudice to the defendant but made a careful determination that it was outweighed by the significant probative value of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In addition, the trial court lessened the potential prejudice to the defendant by giving a number of limiting instructions. The first was given following Mohagel\u2019s testimony concerning the incident at the home for the retarded. The second limiting instruction was given following the presentation of evidence concerning the rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>bery of McGee. Another instruction on both incidents was included in the final charge to the jury. This court has recognized the significance of limiting instructions in order to minimize the potential prejudice in cases where evidence of other crimes is admitted. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 47, 58, 505 A.2d 1225 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>supra, 147; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>10 Conn. App. 176, 180, 522 A.2d 299 (1987). The trial court\u2019s instructions also emphasized that the jury independently assess the similarity between the various offenses and that if it found that the crimes were not similar, it should not credit this evidence at all. Thus, the instructions focused the jury\u2019s attention on the precise factors that the trial court had considered when it made its threshold finding of admissibility. The jury was free to attach as much weight to the evidence of other crimes as it thought the evidence merited. In view of the \u201cinherently imprecise nature of the balancing process\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>supra, 447; and the numerous limiting instructions given to the jury, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court erred in permitting the state, on its redirect examination of Mohagel, to introduce evidence of prior crimes committed by the defendant at the cathedral. The trial court concluded that defense counsel had \u201copened the door\u201d during the cross-examination of Mohagel by asking questions that implied that Simms and Mohagel but not the defendant had previously committed crimes at the cathedral. We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Mohagel testified on direct examination that he and Simms had attempted to discourage the defendant from stopping at the cathedral on the night of the homicide. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Mohagel explained that, having robbed there before, they knew there was no money to be made. On cross-examination, the defendant asked Mohagel if he knew there was no money to be made at the cathedral because he previously had robbed people there. In testimony both previous and subsequent to this passage, the defendant asked Mohagel numerous questions that implied that he and Simms were participants in numerous criminal activities but that the defendant was not. Following the cross-examination of Mohagel, the state asked the trial court\u2019s permission to ask questions on redirect concerning the defendant\u2019s involvement in those incidents referred to by Mohagel. The trial court agreed with the state, holding that \u201c[a]ll these little questions lead up to one tendency. Through your cross-examination, there\u2019s been a definite tendency to indicate that the participation in the various activities was with Simms and the witness, excluding the defendant. So, there\u2019s no question in the Court\u2019s mind that that has opened up the door as to whether or not Mr. Jones was ever with them on any of these occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The state proceeded to elicit testimony from Mohagel that the defendant had committed \u201c[ajbout three\u201d other robberies at the cathedral with Mohagel. Mohagel testified that he and the defendant had robbed two men who were praying, that Mohagel was a lookout while the defendant had stolen a woman\u2019s pocketbook and that the defendant had robbed money from a man whom he shoved into a closet while Mohagel was stealing a woman\u2019s purse. Mohagel also testified that in addition to participating in these three robberies, he and the defendant had stolen money from the poor boxes at the cathedral. The trial court, during the trial, instructed the jury that this redirect testimony by Mohagel was offered only for the purpose of correcting the inference that Simms and Mohagel, but not the defendant, had considerable prior experience commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ting crimes at the cathedral. In its final charge to the jury, the trial court repeated the limiting instruction, reminding the jury that this evidence was admitted to rebut the suggestion that the defendant had not participated in other crimes at the cathedral and had no knowledge of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u201cThe basic purpose of redirect examination is to enable a witness to explain and clarify relevant matters in his testimony which have been weakened or obscured by his cross-examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 301, 386 A.2d 243 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>186 Conn. 437, 448, 441 A.2d 857 (1982); C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 32, pp. 69-71. The scope of redirect examination, however, is limited by the subject matter of cross-examination. C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 57; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (1976) \u00a7 3.3. \u201cGenerally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 50, 376 A.2d 391 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986). The litigant who initially elicits testimony on a certain issue is said to have \u201copened the door\u201d to rebuttal by the opposing party. Although the doctrine of opening the door cannot be \u201csubverted into a rule for injection of prejudice\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lum, </em>466 F. Sup. 328, 334-35 (D. Del. 1979), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>447 F.2d 1236, 1240-41 (D.C. Cir. 1971); such testimony may be allowed \u201cwhere the party initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986). The trial court should permit it \u201c \u2018 \u201conly to the extent necessary to remove any unfair prejudice which might otherwise have ensued from the original evidence.\u201d <em>California Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>235 F.2d 178, 180 (5th Cir. 1956).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>supra.\u201d Id., 14. The trial court, however, has broad discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>tion to rule on the relevancy of evidence and its decision will not be reversed unless it has abused that discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>180 Conn. 589, 599, 430 A.2d 1306 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>supra, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In this case, the defendant pursued an extensive line of questioning suggesting that Mohagel and Simms knew that there was no money at the cathedral because they had committed numerous crimes there. It raised the inference that the defendant was told this by Mohagel because the defendant had not participated in those crimes. The testimony suggested that Simms and Mohagel were the main perpetrators of crimes in the cathedral area and that perhaps the defendant was not involved in any of those crimes. It was permissible to rebut these inferences with testimony that demonstrated that the defendant knew all about the prospects for crime at the cathedral because he had also participated extensively in such activities. Although evidence of these other crimes may not have been admissible under a different theory, once the defendant raised that inference to the jury, the redirect examination permitted by the trial court was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that his sixth amendment right to confrontation was violated when the trial court prohibited the impeachment of Mohagel by the use of a felony underlying Mohagel\u2019s youthful offender status. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">At the trial, the state made a motion in limine asking for a ruling that the defendant be unable to use, for impeachment purposes, the earlier felony committed by Mohagel for which he had been adjudicated a youthful offender. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-76b et seq. The state freely admitted that, but for Mohagel\u2019s youthful offender determination, the underlying crime would have been a felony had Mohagel been convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of it as an adult. The state refused to disclose the nature of the underlying felony. The defendant, in opposing the state\u2019s motion, argued that to do so would deny him his constitutional right to confrontation and he cited <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974), to support his claim. The trial court ruled against the defendant, pointing out that youthful offender \u201ctreatment\u201d is not a \u201ccrime\u201d or \u201ca criminal conviction\u201d in Connecticut. In doing so, it also rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he should be able to impeach Mohagel with the underlying felony on the ground that he was entitled to cross-examine on it as \u201ca prior act of misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In this court, the defendant, citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, maintains that the trial court abused its discretion by finding Mohagel\u2019s youthful offender status <em>\u201cabsolutely </em>inadmissible\u201d for impeachment purposes without weighing the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation and that, in so doing, the court imposed a per se rule of exclusion. The state, therefore, he contends, has the burden of proving that this violation is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state, on the other hand, argues that there was no denial of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right and that the record discloses exhaustive impeachment inquiries during an extensive cross-examination of Mohagel by the defendant. It also disputes the reliance on <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, arguing that here the defendant is contending that the conduct underlying the youthful offender status was perhaps admissible as general impeachment evidence and not to expose bias, interest or motive that was explored at great length at the trial. In any event, the state asserts, if there was error in the ruling, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with the state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201c \u2018The main and essential purpose of confrontation [under the sixth amendment] is <em>to secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination. . . </em>. \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Davis v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 315-16, quoting 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed. 1940) \u00a7 1395, p. 123; <em>see Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). The defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is preserved, if, through cross-examination, defense counsel is \u201cpermitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318; see <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673,106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof </em>205 Conn. 262, 270, 533 A.2d 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>(1987). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination . . . is not absolute and is subject to reasonable limitation by the court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>191 Conn. 146, 148, 463 A.2d 611 (1983). \u201cEvery evidentiary ruling which denies a defendant a line of inquiry to which he thinks he is entitled is not constitutional error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). Only last year, the United States Supreme Court specifically reiterated that \u201c \u2018the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to what extent the defense might wish.\u2019 <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20 [106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985)] (per curiam) (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>supra, 679. \u201c \u2018The general rule is that restrictions on the scope of cross-examination are within the sound discretion of the trial judge . . . but this discretion comes into play only after the defendant has been permitted cross-examination sufficient to satisfy the sixth amendment.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 424, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 508, 438 A.2d 749 (1980). This involves a two-step analysis, determining first whether the cross-examination of Mohagel that was permitted to defense counsel comported with sixth amendment standards; see <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra; and second, whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit the defendant to cross-examine on Mohagel\u2019s youthful offender determination and, specifically, the underlying felony conduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>supra, 424-25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>supra, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the challenged ruling. The record discloses that the required constitutional standard was abundantly satisfied in this case: the defendant was given sufficient opportunity to cross-examine Mohagel and to expose his credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ity to the jury, and defense counsel ably availed himself of that opportunity to show bias, interest, motivation and the like. For example, the jury knew that Mohagel himself had been indicted for this felony murder, that he was testifying for the state because of a plea bargain under which the state had promised to reduce the charge to conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree and that the state had agreed to recommend a ten year prison sentence. In this connection, Mohagel admitted that there were three other crimes for which the state was not going to prosecute him, as well as a number of \u201cother ones.\u201d The jury also knew that he would not be charged with any further crimes relating to his testimony. The jury was told that although Mohagel had been indicted for the felony murder in June, 1982, he never gave the police any statement concerning this crime until October, 1983, after he had learned that Simms had been convicted of the same crime. Mohagel did not testify at Simms\u2019 trial. Mohagel said that prior to Simms\u2019 trial he had talked to Simms in jail and that Mohagel had agreed that he would not talk to anybody about the case, but that he had changed his mind after Simms was convicted and he then realized that he, too, had some \u201cexposure.\u201d Mohagel\u2019s testimony also included many admissions of prior misconduct, a number of which put his veracity into sharp focus. For example, on April 10, 1982, he and the defendant had broken into a home for the retarded on Marshall Street in Hartford and he had stolen such things as a television, a stereo and a jewelry box. He admitted his involvement in other robberies in St. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral. He had also stolen money from the poor boxes in that cathedral. Mohagel also said that he had stolen a ten-speed bicycle from \u201ca college\u201d a few weeks before the Mclnnis murder. In addition, he had stolen a gun from a car and kept it with him in the half-way house in which he resided at the time of the cathedral murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>There were other admissions of Mohagel during his testimony that demonstrated other misconduct. He admitted that on the night of the Mclnnis homicide, he had originally intended, after planning it with Simms, to break into the Old Stage Company in downtown Hartford to steal some radios. He told the jury that, during the burglary of the home for the retarded, he had threatened some of the residents with a sword he owned. Mohagel also said that he had threatened \u201cpeople on the street\u201d with his gun. Defense counsel also questioned Mohagel on certain claimed prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Davis </em>held that \u201c[cjross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 316; <em>see State v.Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 533, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). \u201cCross-examination regarding motive, bias, interest and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>197 Conn. 602, 609, 500 A.2d 555 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 482, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzzi, </em>147 Conn. 40, 46,156 A.2d 505 (1959). There are times when the denial or undue restriction of the right of confrontation can constitute constitutional error. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 101, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The challenged ruling clearly is not any basis in this case for claiming the denial of the constitutional right of confrontation with its primary weapon of cross-examination. The far-ranging disclosure of Mohagel\u2019s motive in testifying and his interest, bias and prejudice were laid bare for the jury to assess. The right of cross-examination was constitutionally accorded and skillfully exercised. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, entitled \u201cFelony Murder,\u201d provides: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the first degree with a firearm, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants, except that in any prosecution under this section, in which the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant: (A) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (B) was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any dangerous instrument; and (C) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon or instrument; and (D) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (c) provides: \u201cMurder is punishable as a class A felony in accordance with subdivision (2) of section 53a-35a unless it is a capital felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> In October, 1983, Simms was convicted, after a jury trial, of felony murder for his part in the Mclnnis homicide. This court later upheld that conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 518 A.2d 35 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">After Simms\u2019 conviction, Mohagel, who had also been indicted for felony murder, gave a statement to the police and agreed to testify against the defendant in exchange for his guilty plea to a reduced charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, with a ten year recommended sentence and the dismissal of other charges also pending against him. Mohagel gave his statement to the police and \u201cgot\u201d a plea bargain in October, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The defendant also asserts the denial of his state constitutional right to counsel and denies having waived that right. In doing so, he refers, in his main brief, to the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 9. The defendant\u2019s brief provides no analysis as to why the rights afforded him by the federal and state constitutions are meaningfully distinguishable with respect to the substantive issues he has raised and asserted on those claims. The state, in its brief, understandably does not discuss the meager assertion of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional rights in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The defendant, however, does, in his reply brief, endeavor to address his claim under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. He makes no reference at all to his earlier asserted claims under the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, and, so, these are clearly abandoned. There is no question that \u201cwe recognize that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 463-65, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); have come to have an independent significance under our state constitution; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 11 n.1, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 45 n.7, 519 A.2d 1175(1987) . . . . <em>\"State v. Evans, </em>203 Conn. 212, 218 n.6, 523 A.2d 1306 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>(1987). This is in keeping with our view of our state constitution. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 496 A.2d 498 (1985); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641-42, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We make only two observations about the defendant\u2019s discussion of the state constitutional issue in his reply brief. First, he seems to claim that we ought to require a higher standard of waiver for <em>Miranda </em>rights than heretofore. Yet, he elucidates no analysis in that regard except to say that \u201c[i]deally,\u201d waiver should be in the presence of a neutral magistrate or the defendant\u2019s lawyer and that \u201c[minimally,\u201d it should be executed unambiguously and preserved on tape, videotape or in writing. We decline to take that step in this case. Second, the circumstances of this case, including the conduct of the defendant and the police, are such that the rights claimed to have been violated were \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d under even a more liberal standard than that required by the United States constitution. The defendant\u2019s discussion of Connecticut\u2019s long record of according counsel to indigent criminal defendants, upon which he premises his claimed state constitutional violations, is not apposite insofar as that affects the substantive issues he raises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> His arrest on April 20, 1982, was for his participation in the burglary of a home for retarded persons on Marshall Street in Hartford on April 10, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> At the trial, Malcolm testified before the jury as to these admissions of the defendant on April 21, 1982.

In oral argument before us, the defendant asserted that this was factually incorrect, claiming that on April 28,1982, the day that Malcolm visited the defendant in the jail, the state\u2019s witness, Mohagel had been presented in court on the charge of felony murder. Even if this is assumed to be true, it is hardly critical with respect to the suppression issue. Malcolm was never asked at the suppression hearing whether he actually knew that Mohagel had also been arrested on the felony murder charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\"> Forensic evidence at the trial indicated that an expert had found \u201cmicroscopic consistency\u201d between fibers taken from the shirt of the victim and fibers on the bottom of one of Simms\u2019 sneakers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\"> During the suppression hearing, Malcolm was asked if the defendant used the word \u201chomicide\u201d at this point.

That fact alone does not prevent a finding that an accused did prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>erly waive such rights if all the circumstances justify such a finding. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 732, 508 A.2d 748 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S.

Ed. 2d 1375 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\"> The defendant argues that we should recognize \u201ca higher standard of waiver\u201d for the waiver of the sixth amendment right to counsel than for the waiver of the fifth amendment right to counsel. Here, he argues that <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 632,106 S. Ct. 1404, 89 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1986), indicates that the sixth amendment right \u201crequires at least as much protection as the Fifth Amendment right\u201d and that the <em>Edwards </em>court noted that it has \u201cstrongly indicated that additional safeguards are necessary when the accused asks for counsel.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484,101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378, reh. denied, 452 U.S. 973,101 S. Ct. 3128, 69 L. Ed. 2d 984 (1981). In doing so, he refers to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mohabir, </em>624 F.2d 1140 (2d Cir. 1980), a case that predates both <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Edwards. </em>We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to follow <em>Mohabir.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The circuits have split regarding what warnings are required before a defendant can validly waive his sixth amendment right to counsel. The Second Circuit, as set out in <em>Mohabir, </em>takes the strictest approach and is clearly the minority view. In <em>Mohabir, </em>it held that a waiver of this right before trial requires \u201ca clear and explicit explanation of the Sixth Amendment rights the defendant is giving up.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>wamirgs, alone, are not sufficient. Id., 1146,1150. In addition, it has not only held that the rights must be explained by a neutral judicial officer and not by the prosecutor or the police agent seeking the waiver, but also that the judicial officer must show the indictment to the defendant, explain its significance and describe the \u2018 \u2018seriousness of his situation, in the event he should decide to answer questions of any law enforcement officers in the absence of counsel.\u201d Id., 1153. The Fifth Circuit has found informed waiver where the defendant has received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and has indicated a willingness to talk. See, e.g., <em>Felder </em>v. <em>McCotter, </em>765 F.2d 1245, 1250 (5th Cir. 1985). The Third, Sixth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits appear to have adopted the most lenient approach, holding that <em>Miranda </em>warnings alone are enough to find a valid waiver of the sixth amendment right to counsel. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>481 F.2d 196,199 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 980, 94 S. Ct. 298,38 L.

The Seventh Circuit apparently takes a case-by-case approach. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Percy, </em>738 F.2d 214, 222 (7th Cir. 1984). Other circuits take an intermediate approach.

Stating that the record does not clearly show one way or the other, counsel for the state said that she was not in a position to say whether Mohagel did or did not, in fact, have ayouthful offender \u201cconviction..\u201d Counsel for the state also said that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, the state believed that Mohagel had been accorded youthful offender status. Our examination of the trial transcript reveals that the state\u2019s attorney believed that youthful offender status was granted as he urged the trial court to grant his motion in limine to proscribe defense counsel from inquiring into Mohagel\u2019s youthful offender status, including the underlying felony involved. While the defendant excepted to the trial court\u2019s ruling, no record was sought to be made at trial of any documents relevant to that issue, and so we have nothing before us in that regard. No explanation for this exists in the record, the briefs or the exhibits. We have taken the position in cases of this general nature that \u201c[w]e must decide the issue present on the record [we have].\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>177 Conn. 487, 495, 418 A.2d 870 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Heyward, </em>152 Conn. 426, 429, 207 A.2d 730 (1965). Under all the circumstances, including the disclosure by the record of the sweeping exposure to the jury of the believability of Mohagel as he testified, especially on cross-examination, we have decided to review this claim on the record we have. In doing so, we are persuaded that no injustice is being done the defendant who fully and at length was given the opportunity, which he skillfully employed, to attack Mohagel\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">There is no question that the issue of whether the right of confrontation in a criminal case includes the right to inquire of a witness concerning his earlier adjudication as a youthful offender, including the underlying crime, is an important issue. This record, however, is not adequate for us to have to decide that issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
