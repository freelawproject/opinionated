We agree with the trial court that the defendant Crescent Lake Tax District (district) is a de facto quasi-municipal corporation whose validity may only be challenged by the state in a quo warranto proceeding, and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">On April 15, 1982, a petition was submitted to the town of Enfield requesting that a meeting be held for the purpose of voting on a proposal to form a special tax district pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-325.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>accordance with the petition the function of the district was to construct, maintain and regulate the use of recreational facilities including the maintenance of Crescent Lake. The formation of the Crescent Lake Tax District was approved at a meeting held in accordance with the statute on May 13,1982. On January 13, 1983, the plaintiffs, thirty-two electors residing within the adopted boundaries of the district or persons owning property assessed at no less than $1000 in value within said boundaries, brought suit against the district, the officers and directors of the district, the town of Enfield and the moderator of the organization meeting. The first count claimed that certain statutory and procedural irregularities in the formation of the district rendered it illegal. It also claimed certain violations of both the state and federal constitutions. The second count mirrored the first and claimed irreparable loss with no adequate remedy at law. The third count also repeated the claim of illegality made in the first count and claimed a violation of \u00a7 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claim for relief sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction and damages. The trial court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, declaring that the district had been illegally formed because neither page of the petition seeking a vote on the formation of the district contained the requisite circulator\u2019s statement required by General Statutes \u00a7 7-9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The defendants appealed, claiming error in the trial court\u2019s holding that the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 7-9 apply to the formation of a tax district under General Statutes \u00a7 7-325. This court in <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 86, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985), concluding that a summary judgment granting only declaratory relief, but failing to dispose of claims for an injunction and for damages, was not a final judgment, sua sponte dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We specifically noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs have not withdrawn or abandoned their claims for relief that have not yet been adjudicated.\u201d Id., 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the district is a de facto municipal corporation and the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the action. Although the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, did not specifically find the district to be a de facto municipal corporation, it included such a conclusion in the judgment that it rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Having determined that the district was a de facto municipal corporation, the trial court concluded that its validity could be challenged only by the state in a quo warranto proceeding and not by private parties. <em>Rothkopf v. Danbury, </em>156 Conn. 347, 356-58, 242 A.2d 771 (1968). The court then determined that since each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of the three counts of the complaint attacks the legality of the Crescent Lake Tax District\u2019s existence on the ground that incorporation under General Statutes \u00a7 7-324 et seq. was defective, the plaintiffs had no standing to bring this action. The court granted the motion to dismiss and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Standing concerns the legal right of an individual to set the machinery of the courts in operation. <em>Belford </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>170 Conn. 46, 52-53, 364 A.2d 194 (1975). Standing goes to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Local </em>1161,1 Conn. App. 154,157, 468 A.2d 1251, cert. denied, 192 Conn. 802, 471 A.2d 244 (1984). A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be made at any time. Practice Book \u00a7 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Certain fundamental principles underlie this dispute. If legally created, the Crescent Lake Tax District is a quasi-municipal corporation. <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>179 Conn. 541, 547, 427 A.2d 822 (1980); <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Bontatibus, </em>145 Conn. 570, 576,145 A.2d 133 (1958); 1 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed.) \u00a7 2.29. Quasi-municipal corporations are governed by the law applicable to municipal corporations. <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>supra. A de facto municipal corporation\u2019s existence cannot be attacked by an individual but only by the state through quo warranto proceedings. <em>Tulare Irrigation District </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>185 U.S. 1, 14, 22 S. Ct. 531, 46 L. Ed. 773 (1902); <em>Rothkopf </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>supra, 357-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Both parties briefed the question of whether the district was a de jure quasi-municipal corporation. The court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action was based solely on the status of the district as a de facto municipal corporation. The question of the district\u2019s de jure status and the application of General Statutes \u00a7 7-9 to Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 7-325 was not involved in the trial court\u2019s consideration of the motion to dismiss. Since we agree with the trial court that the district was a de facto quasi-municipal corporation we need not reach the issues determinative of the district\u2019s de jure status and leave them for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">There are three requisites to constitute a de facto municipal corporation: (1) A charter or general law under which such a corporation as it purports to be might lawfully be organized; (2) an attempt in good faith to organize thereunder; and (3) an actual user of the corporate franchise. <em>Tulare Irrigation District </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>supra, 13; <em>Rothkopf v. Danbury, </em>supra, 356; 1 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 3.48; C. Tooke, \u201cDeFacto Municipal Corporations Under Unconstitutional Statutes,\u201d 37 Yale L.J. 935 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We consider this case in an unusual procedural posture. No evidentiary hearing was held by the trial court nor, so far as we can determine, was such a hearing requested by either party. The court made no factual findings. The appellants made no motion in the trial court or in this court for an articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4051, 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u201cOrdinarily we do not \u2018 \u201cresort to matters extraneous to the formal record, to facts which have not been found and which are not admitted in the pleadings or exhibits which are not part of the record.\u201d \u2019 <em>Grunschlag </em>v. <em>Ethel Walker School, Inc., </em>189 Conn. 316, 320, 455 A.2d 1332 (1983). References in the \u2018statement of facts\u2019 in a brief or references to testimony in the transcript, even if uncontradicted, do not constitute facts in the case. Where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is unclear, \u2018proper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal. \u201cIt remains the appellant\u2019s responsibility to secure an adequate appellate record, and under normal circumstances we will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the appellant should have remedied.\u201d \u2019 <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 494, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983). \u2018Since the [plaintiff] has failed to supply a record presenting the trial court\u2019s rationale, as is his burden, we are disinclined to view as clearly erroneous the trial court\u2019s determination .... Nor under these circumstances will we remand the decision for articulation.\u2019 <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 714, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983).\u201d <em>Pointina Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>1 Conn. App. 341, 343, 471 A.2d 970 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, however, we will not uphold the trial court\u2019s decision merely because of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to secure an adequate appellate record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor will we remand the decision for articulation. We will look to the plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations which constitute judicial admissions to determine whether there is an adequate factual basis for the court\u2019s decision. We will not consider the factual claims of the parties which lack support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">That the three requisite criteria were clearly met is shown by the paragraphs of the complaint, contained in the footnote below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIn brief, if anything can con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>stitute a de facto corporation, the defendant herein constitutes one.\u201d <em>Tulare Irrigation District </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>supra, 14. Chapter 105 of the General Statutes, concerning fire, sewer and other districts, clearly satisfies the requirement of a charter or general law under which the Crescent Lake Tax District purported to be lawfully organized. The organizers attempted in good faith to organize thereunder. The plaintiffs claim that the failure of the circulators of the organizing petitions to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 7-9 shows lack of good faith. The failure to comply with \u00a7 7-9 was not raised at the organization meeting but appears to have first been brought to the attention of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>when the plaintiffs brought suit eight months later. The plaintiffs do not claim that, for the first eight months of its existence, the district acted in anything other than good faith. Thereafter, the defendants could in good faith continue to operate pending the final legal resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges. This has not occurred until today. During the interim between the organization meeting and the granting of the motion for summary judgment, the fundamental steps for organization of the district had already been undertaken. The user of the corporate franchise is more than sufficiently shown by adoption of a budget, fixing of a mill rate, collection of taxes and placing of tax liens upon some of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, events which had occurred prior to the commencement of this action as alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u201cIt cannot be said that this corporation was created without warrant of law. There was a valid law and there was a bona fide attempt to organize under it, and the most that can be said is that there was a failure to comply with all the directions of the statute by which a corporation de jure might be organized.\u201d <em>Tulare Irrigation District </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>supra, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 7-325. organization, boundary changes, annual report, (a) Upon the petition of twenty or more voters, as defined by section 7-6, of any town, not residing within the territorial limits of any city or borough in such town, specifying the limits of a proposed district for any or all of the purposes set forth in section 7-326, and not including within such limits any part of any city or borough in such town, the selectmen of such town shall call a meeting of the voters residing within such specified limits to act upon such petition, which meeting shall be held at such place within such town and such hour as the selectmen designate, within thirty days after such petition has been received by such selectmen. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-5\"> The plaintiffs did not raise in their trial brief or on appeal any issue concerning their claims that the alleged illegal formation of the district violated their state and federal constitutional rights and their rights under \u00a7 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code.
