William Burns, commissioner of transportation of the state of Connecticut. The jury could reasonably have found that the plaintiff was driving her car on Route 64 in Middlebury on the night of December 23, 1981. The plaintiff, the sole occupant of the vehicle, lost control and ran off the road after skidding on a patch of ice. The plaintiff in her complaint asserted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>defendant failed in various respects to maintain Route 64 in a reasonably safe condition. On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the jury\u2019s finding that he did not properly maintain this section of Route 64 on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The defendant does dispute in this appeal the amount of the damages awarded to the plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $35,000. Aside from the testimony of the defendant, the only evidence concerning the extent of her damages consisted of medical reports and bills from several out-of-state medical practitioners. During the trial the defendant objected to, and now challenges the admission of medical reports and bills from three chiropractors and two dentists, who resided in Florida, Georgia and New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. On January 17, 1984, the plaintiff filed an offer of judgment in the amount of $14,250. Practice Book \u00a7 345. Following the verdict, the court awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of $13,716.47 under the authority of General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a. The defendant on appeal claims that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest to the plaintiff because the state is not included within the general interest statute, and because the legislature has not otherwise agreed to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity in this regard. We conclude that the trial court erred in assessing prejudgment interest against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in interpreting the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b) which provides: \u201cIn all actions for the recovery of damages for personal injuries or death, pending on October 1,1977, or brought thereafter, any party offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>in evidence a signed report and bill for treatment of any treating physician, dentist, chiropractor, osteopath, natureopath or podiatrist may have the report and bill admitted into evidence as a business entry and it shall be presumed that the signature on the report is that of the treating physician, dentist, chiropractor, osteopath, natureopath or podiatrist and that the report and bill were made in the ordinary course of business.\u201d The defendant maintains that the statute applies only to the reports and bills of medical practitioners residing in this state, who are within the subpoena power of our courts, but not to those of nonresident medical practitioners who cannot be compelled to testify at a trial in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In support of his argument, the defendant cites subsection (c) of the statute, which provides as follows: \u201cThis section shall not be construed as prohibiting either party or the court from calling the treating physician, dentist, chiropractor, osteopath, natureopath or podiatrist as a witness.\u201d The defendant maintains that subsection (c) indicates that subsection (b) was meant to apply only to resident medical practitioners who are within our court\u2019s subpoena authority. The defendant contends that subsection (b) must be read in light of subsection (c) because this court is obligated to read a statute as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161-62, 496 A.2d 186 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The language of the statute does not restrict it to resident medical practitioners. Rather, it applies \u201c[i]n all actions\u201d and to \u201cany treating physician.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b). This court does not have to look further than the statute for the legislative intent. \u201cIf the words of a statute are clear, the duty of a reviewing court is to apply the legislature\u2019s directive since where the wording is plain, courts will not speculate as to any supposed intention because the question before a court then is not what the legislature actually intended, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>what intention it expressed by the words that it used. <em>P.X. Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>189 Conn. 153,159, 454 A.2d 1258 (1983); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 220, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980).\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 228, 464 A.2d 45 (1983). If the General Assembly intended to require the actual availability of the treating physician in the jurisdiction as a prerequisite to the admissibility of his medical report and bill for treatment, it could have explicitly so stated. Courts may not \u201c \u2018read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words.' \u201d <em>Brunswick Corporation </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>184 Conn. 75,81, 440 A.2d 792 (1981), quoting <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d 236 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">We agree with the defendant that a statute should be read as a whole. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-174 allows medical reports and bills to be admitted even if the medical practitioner or engineer who prepared them is beyond the effective subpoena power of our courts and is unable to testify at trial where that person is deceased, or is disabled, either mentally or physically.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In light of subsection (a) it cannot be said that subsection (c) necessarily requires us to construe subsection (b) as excluding nonresident medical practitioners simply because they are not subject to a subpoena in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The defendant also argues that the legislature clearly intended when it passed No. 77-226 of the 1977 Public Acts, which created General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b) in its present form, to give defendants or the court a right to subpoena the treating medical practitioner under subsection (c). Representative Ernest Abate stated: \u201cIn no event, however, if the report is in fact admitted without testimony of the physician, is the attorney precluded in fact from calling the physician in a different stage in the trial.\u201d 20 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1977 Sess., p. 2994.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Immediately after Representative Abate made this statement, however, Representative Vincent Villano clarified how this bill would apply to medical practitioners who no longer resided in the state. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of miscarriage of justice [that] occurs in civil action cases where the doctors who have treated a patient, move out of the state or move out of the town. Some are staff doctors in hospitals. They spend two or three years and they\u2019re gone, and their personal reports, while the hospital record is there, their personal reports are not, not . . . to be introduced in evidence. And I say this will remedy a great deal of injustice that occurs when the doctor moves and his testimony cannot be introduced in the trial.\u201d Id. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>clear implication of Representative Villano\u2019s remarks was that the reports and bills of a medical practitioner would be admissible even if the medical practitioner had moved outside of the state and, therefore, was beyond the subpoena power of our courts. No one in the legislature raised any objection to Representative Villano\u2019s remarks, and the house voted immediately thereafter in favor of the bill. The legislative history of subsection (b) supports the conclusion that it was meant to apply to nonresident medical practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">There is additional evidence that \u00a7 52-174 (b) is meant to include nonresident treating medical practitioners. The General Assembly by enacting Public Acts 1978, No. 78-140, removed from an earlier version of \u00a7 52-174 (b) a provision which required the clerk of the court upon motion of a party or the court to subpoena the medical expert whose written report was being offered under the terms of the statute. Further, \u00a7 52-174 (b) characterizes such medical reports as \u201cbusiness entries\u201d and the legislature in General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (b) has provided that such business entries ought not be rendered inadmissible either by a party\u2019s failure to produce the person or persons making the writing or by a party\u2019s failure to show that such persons are unavailable as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In view of its legislative history and wording, we hold that \u00a7 52-174 (b) permits the admission of the medical reports and bills of nonresident treating medical practitioners even if they are beyond the subpoena power of our courts, and cannot be called to testify at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The defendant contends that if General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b) allows plaintiffs to submit into evidence the medical reports and bills of nonresident medical practitioners then the statute violates the defendant\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of cross-examination under the United States and Connecticut constitutions. We find no violation of either our federal or state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">As the defendant maintains, the right of cross-examination does have a constitutional basis in the confrontation clauses of our federal and state constitutions. U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const.; art. I, \u00a7 8. These provisions, however, are expressly limited to criminal prosecutions. U.S. Const., amend.- VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. In the context of a civil case this court has said: \u201cThe right of cross-examination is not a privilege but is an absolute right and if one is deprived of a complete cross-examination he has a right to have the direct testimony stricken.\u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indusco Management Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 262, 271, 320 A.2d 811 (1973). The court in <em>Gordon, </em>however, appears to have been referring to a common law right rather than a constitutional right. We need not decide in this case, however, whether the provisions of our federal and state constitutions against depriving a person of his property without due process of law afford some protection against legislative restriction of cross-examination in civil cases. U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10. Without reaching the constitutional issue, we conclude that \u00a7 52-174 (b) does not significantly curtail the right of cross-examination because it does not preclude taking the deposition of a nonresident medical practitioner whose report or bill may be offered into evidence at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In enacting \u00a7 52-174 (b), the legislature undoubtedly considered the prevailing evidentiary treatment of hospital records. Hospital records have been considered business records for many years in Connecticut and are admissible when the three requirements for business records under General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 are satisfied. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>158 Conn. 281, 284-85, 259 A.2d 605 (1969); D'Amato v. <em>Johnston, </em>140 Conn. 54, 58-62, 97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>A.2d 893 (1953). The records of hospitals receiving state aid may be admitted into evidence under General Statutes \u00a7 4-104 upon certification of three requirements by the record-keeper. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>172 Conn. 275, 280-81, 374 A.2d 209 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Both of these statutes allow hospital records containing expert opinions concerning diagnosis to be admitted without the in-court testimony of the treating medical practitioner. Section 4-104 provides in part: \u201cAny and all parts of any such record or copy, if not otherwise inadmissible, shall be admitted in evidence without any preliminary testimony, if there is attached thereto the certification in affidavit form of the person in charge of the record room of the hospital or his authorized assistant indicating that such record or copy is the original record or a copy thereof, made in the regular course of the business of the hospital, and that it was the regular course of such business to make such record at the time of the transactions, occurrences or events recorded therein or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d Section 52-180 (b) provides: \u201cThe writing or record shall not be rendered inadmissible by (1) a party\u2019s faitee to produce as witnesses the person or persons who made the writing or record, or who have personal knowledge of the act, transaction, occurrence or event recorded or (2) the party\u2019s failure to show that such persons are unavailable as witnesses. Either of such facts and all other circumstances of the making of the writing or record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to affect the weight of the evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.\u201d We have held that hospital records, including medical opinions contained therein relevant to diagnosis; <em>D\u2019Amato </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>supra, 61; may be admitted into evidence without the testimony of the persons who made the entries even in a criminal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ceeding, and have held that this procedure does not violate a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The defendant contends that there is a significant difference between the procedures we have approved pursuant to \u00a7 4-104 and \u00a7 52-180 compared to those set forth in \u00a7 52-174 (b). Section 52-180 has been interpreted to require the proponent to show: (1) that the document was made in the regular course of business; (2) that it was the regular course of business to make such a record; and (3) that the record was made when the act, transaction or event occurred or shortly thereafter. C. Tait <em>&amp; </em>J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (1976) \u00a7 11:14, p. 227. Section 4-104 imposes the same three requirements. Section 52-174 (b) permits medical reports and bills to be \u201cadmitted into evidence as a business entry,\u201d but does not require that these three prerequisites be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant argues that \u00a7 52-174 (b) violates his right of cross-examination because the statute does not require that a foundation be established for the reliability of the evidence in the medical reports and bills. He maintains that \u00a7 4-104 and \u00a7 52-180 do not infringe upon a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination because the reliability of the evidence in hospital records is guaranteed by the three-pronged requirement. He concedes that the bills admitted as exhibits would qualify as business records. The defendant, nonetheless, contends that the medical reports were not prepared in the ordinary course of business, but for litigation. The same objection could be raised with respect to \u00a7 52-174 (a), however, which allows the report of a deceased or disabled physician or engineer to be admitted into evidence even when a party is unable to call the person who wrote the report into court to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 731-33,419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). Despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the impossibility of cross-examining dead or disabled witnesses to whom the statute applies; the statute permits their reports to be introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Section 52-174 (b) does not deprive a defendant of his right of cross-examination. While it is true that the defendant does not have the power by subpoena to force an out-of-state witness to travel to Connecticut for trial, General Statutes \u00a7 52-148c allows a party to apply to the court for a commission to take the deposition of an out-ofrstate witness. Once the commission is granted by the court in this state, a subpoena can be obtained in the proposed deponent\u2019s state to force the deponent to attend a deposition in his state.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The defendant recognizes that his right of cross-examination may be implemented by the use of a deposition, but is concerned with the costs associated with deposing an out-of-state witness. If the plaintiff had chosen to depose the nonresident medical practioners rather than introduce their reports at trial, the defendant could hardly have objected on the ground that he would be obliged to incur additional expenses for travel in order to exercise his right of cross-examination. At least for one in the position of the defendant, to whom as an agent of the state its ample resources are available, the additional expense involved in taking a deposition is not a matter of constitutional concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The defendant argues that even if the reports of nonresident medical practitioners are admissible, the trial court erred in this case by admitting such reports where it had no evidence that the persons whose opinions the reports contained were in fact competent experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Ordinarily a trial court must determine the qualifications of a proposed expert before he may testify. See <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164,167-68,438 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>A.2d 865 (1981). The legislature, however, may allow the introduction of the opinion of an expert without the need to lay a detailed foundation as to qualifications. Hospital records can be admitted into evidence without any live testimony about whether the persons who prepared or signed the records were qualified to render the expert opinions therein if the three requirements for business records are met. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-180 and 4-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The medical reports at issue were on the letterhead of each medical practitioner or had some other identifying mark and were each signed by a medical practitioner. Section 52-174 (b) states: \u201c[I]t shall be presumed that the signature on the report is that of the treating [medical practitioner] . . . and that the report and bill were made in the ordinary course of business.\u201d The legislature has determined that all that is needed to comply with the statute is the signature of the treating medical practitioner. No requirement exists concerning qualifications. A defendant may, however, challenge the qualifications of an out-of-state medical practitioner at a pretrial deposition, and, therefore, his right of cross-examination is not abridged by this provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The defendant argues that even if the reports of nonresident medical practitioners can be admitted, the trial court erred in this case by admitting these reports when they contain expert opinions that are not stated with the requisite standard of reasonable medical probability. In his brief, the defendant focused on the reports of two medical practitioners, Milo E. Hermann and Keith D. Werner. Hermann, a Florida dentist, stated in his report: \u201cIn my opinion, although not all the disease presently found in this patient\u2019s dentition is a direct result of the car accident, it was the predispos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ing factor in the resultant inability to provide the necessary care needed for prevention of what has occurred dentally.\u201d Werner, a New Jersey chiropractor, gave the following opinion: \u201cMrs. Struckman received cervical and lumbosacral myofascitis from the accident and with her long history of back surgery, etc. there is no way of telling the extent of the damage but I certainly believe that there is some permanent ligamentous damage in her back.\u201d In a subsequent medical report, Werner wrote: \u201cHer back was still giving her pain in the areas that were injured at the time of the automobile accident. Unfortunately, there has been very little improvement which <em>could </em>indicate this problem <em>could </em>be one that <em>could </em>continue for the duration of her life.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Section 52-174 (b) in no way eliminates a plaintiffs burden of establishing the relevancy of the expert opinions expressed therein. \u201cTo be entitled to damages a plaintiff must establish a causal relation between the injury and the physical condition which he claims resulted from it. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>99 Conn. 677, 679, 122 A. 562 [1923]. This causal connection must rest upon more than surmise or conjecture. <em>Witkowski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>115 Conn. 693, 696,163 A. 413 [1932]; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>119 Conn. 300, 306,176 A. 123 [1934]. A trier is not concerned with possibilities but with reasonable probabilities. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Mfg. Co., </em>129 Conn. 669, 672, 30 A.2d 919 [1943]. The causal relation between an injury and its later physical effects may be established by the direct opinion of a physician, by his deduction by the process of eliminating causes other than the traumatic agency, or by his opinion based upon a hypothetical question. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>supra, 679.\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>140 Conn. 520, 525, 102 A.2d 362 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Expert opinions must be based upon reasonable probabilities rather than mere speculation or conjecture if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>they are to be admissible in establishing causation. <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 443-46, 378 A.2d 540 (1977). To be reasonably probable, a conclusion must be more likely than not. Id., 444. Whether an expert\u2019s testimony is expressed in terms of a reasonable probability that an event has occurred does not depend upon the semantics of the expert or his use of any particular term or phrase, but rather, is determined by looking at the entire substance of the expert\u2019s testimony. <em>Aurora </em>v. <em>Miami Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>6 Conn. App. 45,46, 502 A.2d 952 (1986); see also <em>Ralph </em>v. <em>Mr. Paul\u2019s Shoes, Inc., </em>572 S.W.2d 812, 814 (Tex. 1978). When reports are the substitute for testimony, the entire report should be examined, not only certain phrases or words. <em>Aurora </em>v. <em>Miami Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The defendant contends that an expert in his testimony or in a report must employ the \u201cmagic words\u201d that his opinion was \u201creasonably probable.\u201d We reject the proposition that certain formulaic words are essential when an expert renders an opinion. Id. \u201cA word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.\u201d <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Eisner, </em>245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S. Ct. 158, 62 L. Ed. 372 (1918). As long as it is clear that the opinion of the expert is expressed in terms of probabilities, the opinion should be submitted into evidence for a jury\u2019s consideration. See <em>Slep-ski </em>v. <em>Williams Ford, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 18, 22-23, 364 A.2d 175 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">It is not necessary for this court to determine whether the disputed portions of the reports met the standard of reasonable probability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>trial simply objected to all but one of the reports offered by the plaintiff and'failed to make more specific objections. The party opposing the admission of a medical report must make a specific objection to exclude a particular portion of that report. \u201cThe defendants also press their claim that it was error to admit the entire record without excluding those parts which were irrelevant to a determination of the issues in the case. Though this court has recognized that it may be necessary to exclude parts of an otherwise admissible record; <em>Marko </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 550, 561, 364 A.2d 217 [1975]; <em>Temple </em>v. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>167 Conn. 631, 633,356 A.2d 880 [1975]; <em>Ianni </em>v. <em>Daily, </em>153 Conn. 445, 217 A.2d 707 [1966]; the principle is not relevant to this case since counsel failed, at trial, to designate the portions of the record he found objectionable. For this court now to rule parts of the record inadmissible would require us to lay down a rule that the trial court is under a duty to sift through the record and, acting on its own, exclude objectionable evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>supra, 279-80.

Id.; <em>Ianni </em>v. <em>Daily, </em>supra, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiff prejudgment interest. The defendant argues that our statute, allowing inter-\u00e9st where a defendant has failed to accept an offer of judgment equal to or less than the amount recovered; General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a; does not apply to the state because the legislature has not expressly waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity in this area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144 allows \u201c[a]ny person injured in person or property through the neglect or default of the state or any of its employees by means of any defective highway . . . to recover damages sustained thereby against the commissioner in the superior court.\u201d The statute specifically excludes the imposition of \u201ccosts or judgment fee[s]\u201d against the state. The plaintiff argues that the legislature has waived its sovereign immunity in this variety of civil action for all types of damages except costs or judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ment fees. The plaintiff contends that the legislature would have expressly mentioned interest along with costs and judgment fees if it meant to exclude that type of damages from its waiver of sovereign immunity. Section 52-192a allows an offer of judgment to be filed \u201c[ajfter the commencement of any civil action.\u201d The plaintiff argues that when these two statutes are read together the clear implication is that the legislature has waived its sovereign immunity to exempt the state from interest awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">It is a matter for the legislature, not this court, to determine when our state\u2019s sovereign immunity should be waived. \u201cThe question whether the principles of governmental immunity from suit and liability are waived is a matter for legislative, not judicial, determination. <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>178 Conn. 579, 582, 424 A.2d 274 (1979); <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 286-87,130 A.2d 293 (1957).\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 228, 464 A.2d 45 (1983). Sovereign immunity may be waived only through a statute. Id. Any statutory waiver of immunity must be narrowly construed. Id. \u201cThe state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued may be waived by the legislature, provided clear intention to that effect is disclosed \u2018by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u2019 <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>[162 Conn. 295, 298,294 A.2d 290 (1972)]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>[151 Conn. 259, 262-63, 196 A.2d 596 (1963)].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">At best, the plaintiff has shown that there is some ambiguity concerning whether the \u201cdamages\u201d referred to in \u00a7 13a-144 include interest. The fact that the legislature specifically excluded costs and judgment fees but not interest may suggest that it meant to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity for interest under this statute. It is also quite possible that the legislature thought that interest could be awarded only if it were specifically mentioned in the statute, or that the legislature simply failed to consider whether interest should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>awarded. In the absence of clear legislative intent, this court will not interpret a statute as waiving the state\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Section 52-192a permits an offer of judgment in \u201cany civil action.\u201d A literal reading of this statute might suggest that any plaintiff may collect prejudgment interest from the state. When a generalized statute allows plaintiffs to collect certain varieties of damages in particular types of civil actions, however, it does not waive a state\u2019s sovereign immunity in that area unless there is an express waiver. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 366, 407 A.2d 987 (1978), the issue was whether General Statutes \u00a7 52-257, which allows costs to be taxed against civil parties, applied to the state. We said: \u201cIn the absence of a specific statutory provision allowing the taxation of costs against the state, this court is required to adhere to the widely recognized principle that statutes relating to costs and authorizing the imposition of costs in various kinds of actions or proceedings, or under various prescribed circumstances, which do not in express terms mention the state, are not enough to authorize imposing costs against the state. <em>State ex rel. Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>111 Conn. 427,150 A. 308 [1930]; annot., 72 A.L.R.2d 1399, \u00a7 9. We conclude that the general language of \u00a7 52-257 governing taxable costs does not apply to the state.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Courts in many other jurisdictions have held that a statute that generally allows interest awards does not waive a state\u2019s sovereign immunity unless there is an express provision to that effect in the statute. <em>McKee-Berger-Mansueto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>626 F.2d 559, 566 (7th Cir. 1980) (applying Illinois law); <em>Department of Health &amp; Social Services </em>v. <em>Crossan, </em>424 A.2d 3, 5 (Del. 1980); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State Highway Commission, </em>206 Kan. 49, 51-52, 476 P.2d 233 (1970); 81A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>C.J.S., States \u00a7 268 (1977); 72 Am.
