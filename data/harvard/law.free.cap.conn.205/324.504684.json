If the complainant was such a party, the failure to follow the statutory mandate to serve her was a jurisdictional defect warranting dismissal of the appeal. We have held that \u201c[a] statutory right to appeal may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created.\u201d <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 587, 418 A.2d 939 (1979). \u201cThe appeal provisions of the statute are jurisdictional in nature, and, if not complied with, render the appeal petition subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 324,497 A.2d 48 (1985); <em>Minichino </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>6 Conn. App. 148,149, 503 A.2d 1189 (1986); <em>Newtown </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>3 Conn. App. 416, 419, 488 A.2d 1286 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The term \u201cparty\u201d is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (5)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the UAPA to mean \u201ceach person or agency named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking <em>and </em>entitled as of right to be admitted as a party . . . .\u201d We consider first the last definitional alternative, \u201cproperly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party.\u201d The record in this case discloses no attempt by the complainant to be admitted as a party, whether or not she may have been entitled to that status. As a recipient of a financial benefit by virtue of the CHRO order, Schifini may well have been \u201centitled as of right to be admitted as a party\u201d and thus to notice of an appeal contesting that award. See <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>143 Conn. 182, 183,120 A.2d 550 (1956); <em>Devaney </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>132 Conn. 218, 220, 43 A.2d 304 (1945). Because the absence of notice to one having a substantial interest in a legal proceeding raises constitutional concerns, the CHRO argues that we should construe \u00a7 4-183 (b) to require service upon a person \u201centitled as of right to be admitted as a party\u201d even though he has never sought that status. The failure to join one who is even an indispensable party, however, does not warrant dismissal of a statutory appeal where the statute does not specify that such a person must be served. \u201cNew parties may be added and summoned in . . . by order of the court, at any stage of the cause, as it deems the interests of justice require.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 100. This court has remanded a statutory appeal for the purpose of joining an indispensable party omitted from the service requirements of the statute authorizing the appeal even when the defect has been noticed by us sua sponte. <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>supra, 183-84. The contention advanced by the CHRO that \u00a7 4-183 (b) must be construed to require service upon the complainant as a necessary party in order to satisfy the constitutional requirement of an opportunity to be heard; see <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>195 Conn. 543, 548-49, 489 A.2d 368 (1985); therefore, does not persuade us to ignore the use of the conjunctive in the definitional phrase, \u201cor properly seeking <em>and </em>entitled as of right to be admitted as a party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We conclude, however, that the record sufficiently establishes that the complainant was \u201cnamed\u201d as a party during the CHRO proceeding and thus became a party of record under the first alternative of the definition contained in \u00a7 4-166 (5). The first letters sent by the CHRO to each plaintiff bore references to docket numbers of proceedings entitled \u201cMargaret M. Schifini v. Hillcroft Partners\u201d and \u201cMargaret M. Schifini v. Schlesinger Management Corp.\u201d Copies of the sworn complaints enclosed with the letters bore a caption as follows: \u201cCommission on Human Rights and Opportunities on the Complaint of Margaret M. Schifini, Complainant vs. (each plaintiff) Respondent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A letter of the plaintiffs responding to the complaints as well as the affidavits submitted therewith had the reference or caption \u201cMargaret M. Schifini vs. (each plaintiff).\u201d The notice of public hearing referred to the complaints by the same title. The brief filed with the hearing officer by the attorney general, as well as that of the plaintiffs, bore the caption, \u201cC.H.R.O. ex rel. Margaret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Schifini, Complainant v. Hillcroft Partners and Schlesinger Management Corp., Respondents.\u201d The same caption appears on the final decision issued by the CHRO. The record of the proceeding, therefore, indicates that the complainant was named in the pleadings and other documents filed either as the sole party pursuing the claim against the plaintiffs or as a relator at whose behest the CHRO had instituted the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In mandamus actions at common law, where there is a private right to have a public duty performed, the suit is ordinarily brought in the name of the state or its attorney, designating the aggrieved person seeking performance of such duty as the relator. <em>State ex rel. Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>103 Conn. 607, 618,132 A. 30 (1925); <em>State </em>v. <em>Towers, </em>71 Conn. 657, 663, 42 A. 1083 (1899). The same practice of naming the person who has instigated the proceeding as the relator has usually been followed in mandamus actions for the enforcement of a public duty, where \u201cthe people are regarded as the real party in interest\u201d and the relator \u201cneed not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Eastern Color Printing Co. </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>150 Conn. 444, 449,190 A.2d 591 (1963); <em>State ex rel. Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>supra. Where the relator has no interest distinguishable from that of other members of the public, of course, a mandamus action for performance of a public duty may be instituted by the state without naming a relator. <em>State\u2019s Attorney </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Branford, </em>59 Conn. 402, 408-409, 22 A. 336 (1890). If, however, the relator is specially aggrieved by failure to perform a public duty, his interest must be taken into account in a decision as to whether mandamus is warranted in view of other possible remedies. <em>State </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>104 Conn. 542, 549, 133 A. 683 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The designation of Schifini as a relator in the final decision from which the appeal was taken, as well as in other documents during the course of the proceeding, indicated that she was \u201c[a] person beneficially interested on whose behalf an action is maintained by the state or sovereign power.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.) p. 1084. \u201cA relator is a party in interest who is permitted to institute a proceeding in the name of the people or the attorney general when the right to sue resides solely in that official.\u201d 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Parties \u00a7 7. Upon the issuance of the final decision awarding her financial relief, the complainant unquestionably had a sufficient interest to qualify as a relator and the caption of the decision clearly indicated that she had been given that status by the CHRO. She had thus been \u201cnamed ... as a party\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4-166 (5). No more formal christening as a party was needed. Her designation as the relator in the final decision together with her evident interest in that decision provided reasonable notice to the plaintiffs that she had become a party of record upon whom service of any appeal therefrom was mandated by \u00a7 4-183 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The plaintiffs, contend that the Human Rights and Opportunities Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 through \u00a7 46a-99, makes no provision for a complainant to assume the role of a party. They rely upon the absence of any provision for giving notice of the hearing to the complainant, in contrast to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-84 (b), which requires such notice to a respondent. Similarly, they point to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-84 (d), which provides that \u201c[t]he case in support of the complaint shall be presented at the hearing by the attorney general, who shall be counsel for the commission, or by the commission counsel,\u201d and the omission of any express statutory authority for participation of the complainant as a party in the proceeding. The failure of the statutes to describe the role of the complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>however, did not preclude the CHRO from naming her as a party so long as she had a substantial interest in the proceeding. Furthermore, we have held that, where the commission prosecutes a discriminatory practice upon the complaint of an individual seeking redress only for himself, \u201cthe tribunal may fashion a remedy only within the confines of the complaint and afford relief only to the individual complainant\u201d and that upon the complainant\u2019s death \u201cthe tribunal is rendered powerless to issue an award in conformity with the decedent\u2019s personal complaint.\u201d <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>169 Conn. 89, 100-101, 362 A.2d 1359 (1975). We have also decided that, where an \u201cexecutor has <em>entered </em>the administrative proceeding by filing an amended complaint seeking any remedy to which the deceased complainant may have been entitled,\u201d the provision of General Statutes \u00a7 52-599 (b) that \u201c[a] civil action or <em>proceeding </em>shall not abate by reason of the death of any <em>party </em>thereto\u201d is applicable. (Emphasis added.) <em>CHRO </em>v. <em>Greenwich Catholic Elementary School System, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 609, 613-14, 522 A.2d 785 (1987). In these cases we have implicitly regarded the continued presence of the complainant as a party to a CHRO proceeding to be essential where the complaint initiating the agency proceeding, like that in the present case, seeks relief only for the wrongs the complainant has allegedly suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The plaintiffs also stress the absence of any provision for giving notice of the decision of the hearing officer to a complainant, such as that provided for a respondent by General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (a), (d) and (e), whether or not a discriminatory practice is found. This omission does create an incongruity in this statute, especially in view of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA which provides a right of appeal to \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>decision in a contested case.\u201d The deficiency, however, does not affect the right of a party, as defined by \u00a7 4-166 (5) to include a \u201cnamed\u201d party, to notice of the final decision of the agency, because General Statutes \u00a7 4-180 (c) requires that \u201c[pjarties shall be notified . . . of any decision or order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We conclude that no statutory provision precluded the CHRO from naming Schifini as a party to the proceeding, as it did by designating her in the various documents comprising the record previously referred to, and, indeed, that according her such status was necessary in view of the limited scope of the complaint. Accordingly, she was a party of record whom the plaintiffs were obliged to serve in bringing their appeal. We agree with the trial court that the failure to serve her necessitated dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46a-64a.
