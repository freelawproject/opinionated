The plaintiff, board of education of the city of Hartford (board of education), and the city of Hartford (city), are employers within the meaning of the Municipal Employee Relations Act (act). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-467 through 7-477. The defendants, the Hartford Federation of Dental Hygienists, the Hartford Federation of School Nurses and the Hartford Federation of School Secretaries (unions), are employee organizations within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Prior to June, 1980, when the unions were affiliated with the Hartford Federation of Teachers, each of the defendants represented its respective group, as an independent organization, in collective bargaining with the board of education. In February, 1981, the unions began negotiations with the board of education for successor agreements to their expired contracts. Upon the conclusion of the negotiations, each union ratified its respective contract. After the unions\u2019 ratifications, the board of education submitted the three contracts to the city\u2019s office of corporation counsel on June 16, 1982, and, on June 22,1982, approved the agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>pending approval by the corporation counsel\u2019s office. The corporation counsel determined that the contracts should be submitted to the city\u2019s Court of Common Council (common council)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for approval, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-474. The contracts were referred back to the corporation counsel for review, and during this review process several changes were recommended. After the recommendations were discussed with the unions, several of those changes were incorporated into the contracts. On July 12, 1982, the contracts were approved by the common council.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Shortly thereafter, the unions filed separate complaints with the named defendant, Connecticut board of labor relations (labor board), alleging that the board of education had engaged in practices prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7 7-470 because the board of education: (1) had abrogated the unions\u2019 authority to enter into binding collective bargaining agreements with the board of education directly; (2) had failed to implement the terms of their contracts by claiming that the agreements were not binding until the contracts had been approved by the common council; and (3) had submitted the contracts in their entirety to the common council for approval even though only a limited number of provisions may have required council approval. These cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The question before the labor board, in essence, was whether the board of education had committed a practice prohibited by the Municipal Employee Relations Act by refusing to implement the contracts, which had been ratified, when it had submitted those agreements to the common council for approval. Relying primarily on General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-474 (b) and (d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>10-220,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the labor board initially reasoned that the board of education did not have to submit for approval those contract provisions over which the board of edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>cation had sole and exclusive control, but only those provisions over which it lacked such control. After examining the Hartford city charter, the labor board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>determined that the board of education did not have sole and exclusive control over pension benefits, and thus the contract provisions concerning those benefits had to be submitted to the common council for approval. The labor board, however, opined that the board of education did have sole and exclusive control over insurance benefits and therefore did not have to submit those provisions for approval before implementation. The labor board concluded that: (1) collective bargaining agreements need not be submitted <em>in their entirety </em>for approval where only part of the contracts concern subject matter over which the board of education lacks sole and exclusive control; rather, only those parts of the agreements over which the board of education lacked control had to be submitted for approval; and (2) the board of education had committed a refusal to bargain and a prohibited practice when it so conditioned implementation of the entire contracts upon the approval of the common council. Accordingly, the labor board ordered the board of education to \u201c[cjease and desist from conditioning implementation of a collective bargaining agreement previously negotiated and agreed to, upon the submission and approval of the collective bargaining agreement to the legislative body of the municipality, where only a portion of the collective bargaining agreement concerned a subject matter of which the [board of education] lacked sole and exclusive control (i.e. pensions).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The board of education appealed the labor board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 4-183, claiming, inter alia, that the labor board incorrectly decided that: (1) the contracts between the board of education and the unions did not have to be submitted in their entirety to the common council, but only those provisions over which the board of education lacked sole and exclusive control; and (2) the board of education had sole and exclusive control over insurance benefits, and therefore did not have to submit the provisions concerning those benefits to the common council for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">After reviewing the labor board\u2019s decision, the trial court concluded that the labor board had correctly decided that the board of education had committed a prohibited practice by submitting the contracts in their entirety to the common council for approval. Additionally, the court held that the labor board had been correct in determining that the board of education had sole and exclusive control over insurance benefits, and thus did not have to submit the provisions concerning those benefits to the common council for approval. Consequently, the court dismissed the board of education\u2019s administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The board of education appealed the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the case to itself pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. On appeal, the board of education claims that the trial court erred in dismissing the appeal because the labor board\u2019s decision violated the relevant statutory and charter provisions and was clearly erroneous in view of the evidence. Specifically, it argues that the decision of the labor board that the board of education had sole and exclusive control over insurance benefits, and that therefore those provisions did not have to be submitted to the common council for approval, violated the Hartford city charter. The board of education, however, does <em>not </em>challenge the labor board\u2019s ultimate determination that the board of education committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>a prohibited practice by conditioning the implementation of all three contracts upon the common council\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Initially, we note that the original contracts which underlie this appeal have since expired and the board of education and the defendant unions have negotiated and implemented another set of successor agreements, apparently without incident. We therefore must, as a threshold matter, determine whether the present appeal is moot. See <em>Hartford Principals \u2019 &amp; Supervisors \u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>202 Conn. 492, 496, 522 A.2d 264 (1987); <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17, 19, 411 A.2d 1 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u201c \u2018It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. <em>Connecticut State Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>188 Conn. 196,199, 448 A.2d 1341 (1982); <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 440 A.2d 310 (1982).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Macri, </em>189 Conn. 568, 569, 456 A.2d 1203 (1983); see also <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>197 Conn. 566, 571-74, 499 A.2d 1158 (1985).\u201d <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>supra, 496-97; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Vroom, </em>130 Conn. 512, 515, 36 A.2d 22 (1944). \u201cIn the absence of an actual and existing controversy for us to adjudicate in any sense of the term, the courts of this state may not be used as a vehicle to obtain judicial opinions on points of law . . . and where the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The contracts that are the subject of this appeal were ratified by the unions and the board of education, imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>mented and have since expired. Any decision this court might render would have no effect on those contracts. Moreover, the issue pursued on appeal by the board of education is of no moment to the ultimate holding of the labor board. The labor board concluded that the board of education had committed a prohibited practice and a refusal to bargain by submitting the contracts in their entirety to the common council for approval. Even if we were to agree with the board of education that the insurance benefits are not under its sole and exclusive control, such a determination would have no effect on the labor board\u2019s order to \u201c[c]ease and desist from conditioning the implementation of [the entire] collective bargaining agreements], previously negotiated and agreed to, upon the submission and approval of the collective bargaining agreements] to the [common council] . . . .\u2019\u2019Rather, we would be addressing a point of law from which no actual or practical relief could follow.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The board of education contends, however, that this case should not be dismissed as moot because the issue of whether it had sole and exclusive control of insurance benefits, and thus whether the provisions concerning those benefits had to be submitted to the common council for approval, is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S. Ct. 279, 55 L. Ed. 310 (1911); see <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S. Ct. 347, 46 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1975); <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>supra, 20-21. In so claiming, the board of education relies on <em>Board of Education </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>v. <em>Board, of Labor Relations, </em>201 Conn. 685, 519 A.2d 41 (1986), and <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In <em>Shedd, </em>we stated that \u201cthe \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 doctrine was limited to the situation where two elements combined: (1) the challenged action was in duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\u201d <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>supra, 499, quoting <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>supra. Accordingly, because we determined the issue presented was likely to arise again and the challenged action was too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to its expiration, we declined to dismiss the appeal as moot. <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>supra.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">While we have based several decisions to hear appeals on the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d doctrine, we have held that \u201cin determining whether to rely on this mitigating principle we would consider a number of relevant factors. Among the factors we have identified are: (1) the public importance of the question presented; (2) the potential effect of the ruling on an ongoing program of the state\u2019s penal or civil system; and (3) the possibility of a similar effect on the plaintiff himself in the future.\u201d <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 572-73; cf. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>205 Conn. 27, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987). In <em>Waterbury Hospitals. Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>supra, 253 n.5, we noted that \u201cthe \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 principle was not, in and of itself, a justification for reviewing an admittedly moot case but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>was merely one factor to be considered when faced with a potentially moot matter.\u201d See also <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 437 n.2,439 A.2d 1055 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In determining that the appeal in <em>Shedd </em>was not moot, we held that the issue in that case presented a situation that was \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d Although not expressly mentioned in that determination, the factors enumerated above were nonetheless relevant in deciding not to dismiss the appeal as moot.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue in <em>Shedd </em>was whether the mediation and arbitration procedures set forth in the Teacher Negotiation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd, were available to resolve contractual disputes between an employees\u2019 union and a school board during the term of an existing contract. That issue presented a question of public importance potentially affecting an ongoing program in the state\u2019s civil dispute resolution system. The construction of the Teacher Negotiation Act not only was important to the parties in <em>Shedd </em>but also conceivably could have affected every midterm dispute which arose between any one of the state\u2019s local or regional boards of education and the exclusive representative of a teachers\u2019 or administrators\u2019 unit. Moreover, while there was a reasonable expectation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>midterm disputes might arise between the same parties and be of such a duration as to avoid being fully litigated, there was also a reasonable expectation that a similar dispute might arise between another board of education and a teachers\u2019 or administrators\u2019 union. Thus, in finding the appeal in <em>Shedd </em>not moot, other considerations were relevant to our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Similarly, in <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 686, 686-87 n.2, we found that the issue on appeal, i.e., whether proposals for teacher evaluations pursuant to the Teacher Evaluation Act in General Statutes \u00a7 10-151b were a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, was not moot because the case raised <em>an important question of statutory construction </em>capable of repetition, yet evading review. We further reasoned that the issue of collective bargaining <em>not only affects an ongoing part of the state\u2019s program for education </em>but is likely to arise again in future labor negotiations between the parties. (Emphasis added.) Id., 686-87 n.2. Therefore, we addressed the merits of the appeal, even though the collective bargaining agreement which gave rise to the dispute had since expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">After considering the above mentioned factors, we conclude that this case does not merit review. The sole issue pressed by the board of education concerns the interpretation of local charter provisions. The case does not present a question of far reaching public importance. Nor would a ruling on the question potentially affect an ongoing program of the <em>state\u2019s </em>civil system, as was the case in <em>Hartford Principals\u2019&amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>supra, and <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Additionally, while there is a possibility that the same complaining parties, namely the unions, might be subject to the same action in the future, we find it significant that the unions have each entered into a successor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>contract with the board of education without incident. At oral argument, the board of education asserted that, after negotiating a successor agreement with each of the unions, it again submitted the provisions concerning insurance benefits to the common council for approval. There is nothing on the record, however, to indicate that the unions had challenged this course of conduct. We have recognized that the actions of the parties themselves can cause a case to become moot. <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>supra, 497; <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>supra, 251. Thus, we find the unions\u2019 apparent acquiescence to the actions of the board of education to be of consequence in determining whether the appeal is moot. We also note parenthetically that, in previous collective bargaining with the unions prior to the present case, the board of education had never submitted the contracts to the common council for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Moreover, even if we were to address the merits of the board of education\u2019s appeal, we could not offer any actual or practical relief from the labor board\u2019s ultimate determination and order. The board of education, in essence, seeks an opinion on an academic point of law. \u201cIn these circumstances, discretionary prudential concerns counsel against our undertaking to render an opinion that would, in effect, be merely advisory.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>203 Conn. 420, 425, 524 A.2d 1148 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Therefore we addressed the merits of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> In <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 437, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981), we recognized four factors to be considered when determining whether an appeal was moot; namely, whether the issues: (1) were capable of repetition, yet evaded review; (2) affected an ongoing program of the state\u2019s penal system; (3) could affect the plaintiffs in the future; and (4) presented questions of public importance which made it desireable to decide the points.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> In <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 437 n.2,434,439 A.2d 1055 (1981), we explicitly noted that a divergent standard for determining whether a labor dispute appeal was moot had not been established. There is nothing in <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>202 Conn. 492, 522 A.2d 264 (1987), which purports to establish a divergent mootness standard for labor cases. Accordingly, the considerations set forth in <em>Delevieleuse </em>and in <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>197 Conn. 566, 572-73, 499 A.2d 1158 (1985), are still pertinent in determining whether an appeal involving a labor dispute is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b143-8\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">dissenting. I disagree with the conclusion that the appeal is moot for two reasons: (1) the analysis is inconsistent with that we applied in our recent decision in <em>Hartford Principals \u2019 &amp; Supervisors \u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>202 Conn. 492, 496, 522 A.2d 264 (1987); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>(2) it is inconsistent with our policy of following the decisions of the federal courts concerning provisions of the National Labor Relations Act analogous to those of our state Labor Relations Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-101 through 31-111b. <em>Imperial Laundry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>142 Conn. 457, 460, 115 A.2d 439 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn., </em>we concluded that the criteria for the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d doctrine were met where the collective bargaining agreements under which the dispute arose had expired because of the likelihood that disputes between the same parties over the same statutory construction issues would arise again. The probability in the present case of renewed disputes over the necessity of submitting for council approval the provisions of future contracts concerning employee insurance benefits between the city and the unions is equally great. Such provisions are a standard part of collective bargaining agreements between the unions and the city, which continues to adhere to the view that its charter requires that these provisions be approved by the legislative body in spite of the contrary rulings of the state labor board and the court below. The fact that the unions acquiesced in this practice when successor contracts were last entered into, when the parties expected a resolution of the issue in this pending case, hardly indicates an abandonment of their position that the board of education has exclusive authority over the subject matter of the dispute. Their failure to file another unfair labor practice complaint under these circumstances hardly indicates acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The opinion attempts to distinguish <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019Assn, </em>on the ground of the relative public importance of the issues involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>dispute, concluding that the present case \u201cdoes not present a question of far reaching public importance\u201d but deals merely \u201cwith the interpretation of a local charter provision,\u201d that would \u201cnot affect an ongoing program of the state\u2019s civil system,\u201d as in <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>I think this distinction in the degree of public importance is too flimsy to serve as a useful criterion in deciding whether an appeal is moot. The implication is left that where the issue concerns only a municipal charter it is too insignificant to warrant resolution by this court regardless of the likelihood of its repetition as a source of controversy between the same parties. After all, the city\u2019s \u201clocal charter\u201d is a statute of this state, though it pertains to only one municipality. The degree of public concern criterion that the opinion seeks to add to the standard set forth in <em>Hartford Principals \u2019 &amp; Supervisors \u2019 Assn, </em>for review of issues \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d appears to preclude our consideration of any dispute not having a substantial public impact, regardless of its importance to the parties or the probability of its repetition under circumstances where a definitive resolution of the issue cannot be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Because our Labor Relations Act has been patterned after the National Labor Relations Act, \u201cthe judicial interpretation frequently accorded the federal act is of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own act.\u201d <em>Imperial Laundry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 460. The federal courts have frequently rejected the notion that the propriety of a cease and desist order prohibiting an unfair labor practice, such as that ordering the city in this case not to require council approval of employee insurance provisions in future collective bargaining agreements, becomes moot once the particular dispute resulting in the order has been resolved. \u201cA Board order imposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>a continuing obligation; and the Board is entitled to have the resumption of the unfair practice barred by an enforcement decree.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Mexia Textile Mills, Inc., </em>339 U.S. 563, 567, 70 S. Ct. 826, 94 L. Ed. 1067 (1950); see also <em>Local 74, Carpenters Union </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>341 U.S. 707, 715, 71 S. Ct. 966, 95 L. Ed. 1309 (1951); <em>Solo Cup Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>332 F.2d 447, 449 (4th Cir. 1964); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Denver Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, </em>192 F.2d 577 (10th Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">If our review of the merits should result in the affir-mance of the position of the state labor relations board that employee insurance benefits are not excluded by the Hartford charter from the general authority of the board of education over the working conditions of school employees, the cease and desist order of the state labor board should be enforceable directly in the courts through contempt proceedings, if it is violated. If our review should invalidate the order, this continuing dispute over the authority of the board will have been set to rest. The dismissal of the appeal for mootness, of course, leaves the dispute over this legal question still open, thus frustrating the legitimate desires of the city, the unions, and the board for a final determination of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
