Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyB8\">The plaintiff, Carlos Aspiazu, brought this action for damages against the defendant, Mario Orgera, alleging an intentional assault and/or a negligent contact. The jury found for the plaintiff on the intentional assault count and awarded $28,000 in damages. The defendant has appealed to this court, alleging that the trial court improperly admitted a medical report and that the court erred in its instruction to the jury regarding unemployment compensation benefits award\u00e9d to the plaintiff. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: The plaintiff had worked for one year as an assistant engineer and superintendent under the supervision of the defendant. The two parties had been at odds in the year previous to the alleged assault. On March 18, 1980, the plaintiff reported for work and was using a heavy broom to sweep water off the roof of a building under construction in Stamford. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>approached the plaintiff, told him in a loud voice that he was fired, and then struck him in the mouth with his fist. The defendant continued to throw punches, hit the plaintiff with the broom, and then tried to push him off the roof. The plaintiff managed to run away and call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The police took the plaintiff to St. Joseph Hospital where he was treated and released. The hospital record indicates that the plaintiff suffered a lacerated lower lip, a lump on his forehead and two loosened front teeth. The plaintiff later had to have those two teeth removed and had a bridge inserted by Dr. Herbert Kweskin, a dentist. He also saw Dr. Simon Goldfarb, a psychiatrist, during the months immediately following the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The defendant raises two claims on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in admitting the doctor\u2019s report of Goldfarb because the report contained inadmissible hearsay and it failed to establish causation; and (2) the trial court erred by instructing the jury that the evidence of the receipt of unemployment compensation by the plaintiff was to be used by the jury only for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The record reveals that Goldfarb treated the plaintiff from March 24, 1980, to August 25, 1980. On March 14, 1981, Goldfarb prepared a written report that described the history and treatment of the plaintiff. At the time of trial, Goldfarb had retired and was living in New Mexico and neither the plaintiff nor the defendant attempted to procure his attendance at the trial or to take his deposition. Instead, the plaintiff sought to introduce the doctor\u2019s report under General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which permits the admission into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>evidence of any \u201ctreating\u201d physician\u2019s report as a business entry. The defendant objected to the report in its entirety and also made objections to various portions of the report that resulted in numerous redactions by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant first objects to the admission into evidence of certain hearsay testimony contained in Gold-farb\u2019s report. The defendant asserts that Goldfarb had not met the plaintiff prior to the assault and therefore all of his report \u201cmust necessarily have been based upon information provided by the plaintiff or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Before specifically addressing the defendant\u2019s first argument, it is instructive to examine General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b). That statute permits a signed doctor\u2019s report to be admitted as a business entry. The business records statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-180,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>admission of any writing as evidence of the act or event it describes provided the record was made in the regular course of business and that it was the regular course of business to make such a writing within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the event in question. Section 52-174 (b) creates a presumption that the doctor\u2019s signature is genuine and that the report was made in the ordinary course of business. See <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 534 A.2d 888 (1987). Thus, once the statutory requirement that the report be signed by a treating physician is met, the evidence in that report is admissible and has the same effect as a business entry. This does not mean, however, that the entire report is automatically admitted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels. </em>180 Conn. 101, 105, 429 A.2d 813 (1980). In the area of hospital records, this court has held that since the business of a hospital is treating patients, information that is not relevant to the medical treatment of the patient is inadmissible. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>158 Conn. 281, 285, 259 A.2d 605 (1969) (identity of driver who struck patient is not admissible); <em>Maggi </em>v. <em>Mendillo, </em>147 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>663, 667, 165 A.2d 603 (1960); <em>D\u2019Amato </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>140 Conn. 54, 61, 97 A.2d 893 (1953). Information that is relevant to the treatment of the patient, however, is admissible. See, e.g., <em>D'Amato </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>supra, 61-62 (drunkenness is medically germane to treatment and therefore admissible). \u201cSection 52-174 (b) in no way eliminates a plaintiffs burden of establishing the relevancy , of the expert opinions expressed [in the report].\u201d <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 554. We hold that doctors\u2019 reports should be treated similarly to hospital records regarding relevancy problems. Once the report is ruled admissible under the statute, any information that is not relevant to medical treatment is subject to redaction by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Turning to the defendant\u2019s claim of hearsay, we first recognize that once a report qualifies as a business record, its proponent is not required to show the source of information for each item contained in the record. The burden is on the objecting party to specify objections to the inadmissible parts of the report. <em>Mucci </em>v. <em>LeMonte, </em>157 Conn. 566, 570, 254 A.2d 879 (1969); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (1976) \u00a7 11.14 (f). The defendant made an initial objection to the admission of the report as a whole. In response, the trial court indicated that it was going to admit the report on the basis of the statute but that it would consider any of the defendant\u2019s objections to specific portions of the report. The defendant made numerous suggestions to the court with the result that the court redacted a number of irrelevant sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u201cIt is the general rule that an expert\u2019s opinion is inadmissible if it is based on hearsay evidence. See cases such as <em>Vigliotti </em>v. <em>Campano, </em>104 Conn. 464, 465,133 A. 579 [1926]. One exception to this rule, and the only one bearing on this appeal, is the exception which allows a physician to testify to his opinion even though it is based, in whole or in part, on statements made to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>by a patient for the purpose of obtaining from him professional medical treatment or advice incidental thereto. And, of course, he may also testify to such statements.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Blauvelt, </em>152 Conn. 272, 274, 205 A.2d 773 (1964); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166,175, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). In <em>Brown, </em>we also said: \u201cMost exceptions to the hearsay rule are permitted because it is believed that safeguards are present which at least approach those given by the opportunity for cross-examination existing where hearsay testimony is not involved. See cases such as <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Smazer, </em>151 Conn. 226, 231, 196 A.2d 432 [1963], In the case of the exception we are considering, the safeguard is the patient\u2019s desire to recover his health, which it is considered will restrain him from giving inaccurate statements to a physician employed to advise or treat him.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Blauvelt, </em>supra, 275. Goldfarb\u2019s report satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 52-174 (b): it is the signed report of a treating physician in an action for personal injuries. The information in the report is relevant on the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s damages and the information falls under the hearsay exception for statements of bodily condition made to a treating physician. <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Blauvelt, </em>supra, 274; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 11.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The defendant renewed his objection to the report in its entirety but that objection was overruled by the trial court. On appeal, the defendant does not identify in his brief any specific hearsay statements that he claims were improperly admitted. Moreover, at oral argument he neither identified them nor asserted any reasons why they were inadmissible. We note that the trial court redacted a number of statements dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s past history. The remainder of the report concerns general background information about the plaintiff, a description of the course of treatment, and a diagnosis. All of this information was pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>to Goldfarb's treatment of the plaintiff. The trial court's actions were correct and the defendant\u2019s claim that hearsay statements were improperly admitted into evidence has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The defendant next asserts that Goldfarb\u2019s report failed to establish the necessary causal relationship between the alleged assault and the subsequent treatment and damage sustained by the plaintiff. This argument also has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">\u201cTo be entitled to damages a plaintiff must establish a causal relationship between the injury and the physical condition which he claims resulted from it. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>99 Conn. 677, 679,122 A. 562 [1932].\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>140 Conn. 520, 525, 102 A.2d 362 (1953). This causal connection must rest upon more than surmise or conjecture. Id. \u201cA trier is not concerned with possibilities but with reasonable probabilities. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Mfg. Co., </em>129 Conn. 669, 672, 30 A.2d 919 [1943].\u201d Id. The compensation must not be \u201ca matter of guesswork or speculation but must be based upon results which would reasonably and probably flow from the injuries the plaintiff received at the time of the accident.\u201d Id., 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Expert testimony is often used to establish the existence, extent or cause of an injury or disease. See, e.g., <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438,445,378 A.2d 540 (1977) (epilepsy and brain damage); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>150 Conn. 457, 460, 191 A.2d 124 (1963) (wounds inflicted by human); <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>supra (cerebral thrombosis); <em>Sickmund </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co. </em>122 Conn. 375, 379-80,189 A. 876 (1937) (fall caused by diabetic upset). Under some circumstances, this court has held that expert testimony is required to establish causation. See <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>177 Conn. 465, 471, 418 A.2d 891 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>(1979) (miscarriage); but see <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Kresge Co., </em>114 Conn. 36,38,157 A. 541 (1931). One area where expert medical testimony is regarded as essential is medical malpractice. <em>Levett </em>v. <em>Etkind, </em>158 Conn. 567, 574, 265 A.2d 70 (1969); <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>143 Conn. 290, 294-95,122 A.2d 21 (1956). \u201c[T]he medieal effect upon the human system of the infliction of injuries, is generally not within the sphere of the common knowledge of a lay witness . . . . \u201d <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>supra. The expert testimony can be presented in a number of ways: \u201cby the direct opinion of a physician, by his deduction by the process of eliminating causes other than the traumatic agency, or by his opinion based on a hypothetical question.\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>supra, 525. Although useful, expert testimony is not always mandatory if the medical condition is obvious or common in everyday life. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>155 Conn. 367, 372, 232 A.2d 907 (1967). This is especially true if one is testifying about his own physical condition. Id. (complainant testified to the fact that she was pregnant). Expert testimony may also not be necessary to establish causation if the plaintiff\u2019s evidence creates a probability so strong that a jury can form a reasonable belief without the aid of any expert opinion. <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Kresge Co., </em>supra; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 7.16 (c). One area where expert testimony is not always required is mental suffering. <em>Leabo </em>v. <em>Leninski, </em>2 Conn. App. 715, 727, 484 A.2d 239 (1984); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Lovallo, </em>2 Conn. App. 579, 589, 481 A.2d 1286 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We now turn to the issue of whether Goldfarb\u2019s report should have been excluded because it failed to establish causation. The report relates in detail the feelings of the plaintiff toward the defendant after the incident. The report shows, inter alia, that the plaintiff first sought psychiatric help six days after the alleged assault, that he was obsessed with getting revenge against the defendant, that he both feared and hated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the defendant, that he displayed anger, depression, irritability, insomnia and anxiety, and that the diagnosis was characterized as \u201c[p]ost-traumatic neurosis.\u201d Although the defendant\u2019s brief does not articulate his claim in any more detail than a conclusory assertion, the apparent thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the medical report does not explicitly articulate the \u201creasonable medical probability\u201d standard that is relied upon so often in direct testimony by medical experts. See <em>Ulma </em>v. <em>Yonkers General Hospital, </em>53 App. Div. 2d 626, 384 N.Y.S.2d 201 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">An expert opinion cannot be based on conjecture or surmise but must be \u201creasonably probable.\u201d <em>Witkowski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>115 Conn. 693, 696,163 A. 413 (1932). Any expert opinion that describes a \u201ccondition\u201d as possible or merely fifty-fifty is based on pure speculation: <em>Davis </em>v. P. <em>Gambardella &amp; Son Cheese Corporation, </em>147 Conn. 365, 373,161 A.2d 583 (1960). The problem with Goldfarb\u2019s report is not that it is expressed in terms of possibilities rather than probabilities but that it makes no statement expressly concluding that the alleged assault was responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s treatment for mental distress. Although we approve generally of the \u201creasonable medical probability\u201d standard, we also note that no \u201ctalismanic words\u201d are mandatory. See <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 444 (testifying to odds and percentages is acceptable); <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>supra; 31 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7 44 (1967 and 1987 Sup.).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">While we do not believe that it is mandatory to use \u201ctalismanic words\u201d or \u201cthe particular combination of magical words represented by the phrase \u2018reasonable degree of medical certainty [or probability]\u2019 \u201d; <em>Matott </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>48 N.Y.2d 455, 463, 399 N.E.2d 532, 423 N.Y.S.2d 645 (1979); there is no question that, to be entitled to damages, a plaintiff must establish the necessary causal relationship between the injury and the physical or mental condition that he claims resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>from it. <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>supra. Before the trial court could permit the jury to consider the Goldfarb report as probative on the issue of causation, the court had to be persuaded that the report gave reliable evidence that the doctor was reasonably confident of the relationship between the plaintiffs injury and his psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. We are satisfied that the Goldfarb report meets this standard. See <em>Matott </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 459-60. We think the Goldfarb report, signed by him as a physician and on his letterhead as a physician, could reasonably have been interpreted by the jury, under instructions that we observe have not been challenged, to meet that acceptable standard of reliability typified by the \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty [or probability]\u201d demanded in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Goldfarb\u2019s report characterized the plaintiffs condition as \u201c[p]ost-traumatic neurosis.\u201d A jury could reasonably have found that the trauma referred to is the alleged assault. The report also described the incident when the defendant allegedly struck the plaintiff and how the plaintiff feared, hated and sought revenge against the defendant. The plaintiff, on direct examination, made it clear that the reason that he sought psychiatric help was the alleged assault by the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A fair reading of the report as a whole makes it clear that the alleged assault was the precipitating event that created the condition for which Goldfarb treated the plaintiff for approximately five months thereafter. Goldfarb was the treating medical physician throughout. He had the advantage of a relatively prompt postattack opportunity for his treatment, observations and evaluation of his patient. He prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>medication for him. The plaintiff appeared to Goldfarb \u201cto have been an active, well adjusted and secure young man.\u201d The report notes that there were some symptoms of nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness and fear \u201cfor more than three months\u201d prior to the attack by the defendant and while this could be claimed to have preexisted the attack, the plaintiff himself was cross-examined on this at the trial and denied he ever told that to Goldfarb. The defendant, had he chosen, could have had the plaintiff examined, deposed Goldfarb or produced his own expert; he did none of these. Again, while the report is not a model of clarity and while it lacks the \u201csingle verbal straightjacket\u201d formulation; see <em>Matott </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 460; that the defendant espouses, it passes muster under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence. <em>Delott </em>v. <em>Roraback, </em>179 Conn. 406,414, 426 A.2d 791 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>168 Conn. 309, 317, 362 A.2d 893 (1975). Its ruling will only be overturned if there is an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>180 Conn. 182, 183, 429 A.2d 462 (1980). We hold that the report satisfies any threshold question of relevance and that the requisite causal connection was sufficient to submit that issue to the jury. Once the report is determined to be relevant, the weight of that report is a question for the jury. Expert testimony is considered, weighed and tested like any other evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>77 Conn. 266, 275, 58 A. 705 (1904); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 7.16 (e). The trier is not bound by the opinions of experts and \u201c \u2018the fact that a witness testifies as an expert does not compel the acceptance of his testimony as true.' <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Gniazdowski, </em>145 Conn. 46, 48,138 A.2d 796 [1958].\u201d <em>Pischitto </em>v. <em>Waldron, </em>147 Conn. 171, 177, 158 A.2d 168 (1960). The jury was free to credit the medical report of Goldfarb with whatever weight it desired. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>court reminded the jury that the doctor was not present for cross-examination. The defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly admitted Goldfarb\u2019s medical report is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s application for and receipt of unemployment compensation was only to be used by the jury for purposes of impeachment, and not for mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The plaintiff testified that he applied for and received unemployment compensation from March 24,1980, to November 1,1980. Under the unemployment compensation law in Connecticut; General Statutes \u00a7 31-235;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>an applicant must be available and looking for work in order to collect unemployment benefits. The plaintiff also testified that he was mentally unable to work during that period. The defendant asserts that the plaintiffs testimony that he was unable to work was inconsistent with his receipt of unemployment benefits and that this circumstance creates an exception to the \u201cCollateral Source Rule.\u201d That rule proscribes the use of payments from a collateral source to an injured plaintiff to mitigate damages. <em>Apuzzo </em>v. <em>Seneco, </em>178 Conn. 230, 233, 423 A.2d 866 (1979); see also <em>Kurta </em>v. <em>Probelske, </em>324 Mich. 179,188, 36 N.W.2d 889 (1949). The defendant also claims that the trial court erroneously restricted the defendant\u2019s submission of evidence as to the amount of unemployment compensation received by the plaintiff and also that the instruction that the benefits should not be considered by the jury in its determination of damages was erroneous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The defendant, at oral argument before us, conceded that unemployment benefits are properly considered a collateral source,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> yet he maintained that <em>no </em>instruction whatsoever should have been given about the receipt of unemployment benefits. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument. Although the defendant asserted one claim in his brief and another at oral argument, the record shows that no exception to the jury charge was made at the trial to alert the trial court to either of the claims now made on appeal. The defendant at trial excepted to the charge to the jury because the trial court refused to charge that the jury could use the receipt of unemployment benefits to assess the plaintiff\u2019s mental and physical ability to work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, since the defendant did not raise his current objections in the trial court, we decline to entertain those claims. <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 186 n.1, 501 A.2d 745 (1985).

The plaintiff testified that he was unable to work in the months following the accident. When he applied for unemployment compensation benefits, the plaintiff, under General Statutes \u00a7 31-235, had to state that he was available and looking for work throughout the eight months that he received benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> The defendant excepted to the charge as follows: \u201cThe third exception pertains to the use <em>of </em>the evidence pertaining to a claim made for umemployment compensation, the fact that compensation benefits of that type were received by the plaintiff. The Court indicated that it can be used to impeach the claim of availability or unavailability of the plaintiff. The defendant feels that it can also be used to show that the plaintiff was mentally and physically able to work during that period of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
