The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>case arises out of a New Britain municipal election for aldermen at large. The petitioners, James Scheyd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>et al.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed an action pursuant to \u00a7 9-328 to prevent the certification of the respondents, Peter J. Bezrucik et al.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as duly elected municipal aldermen. They alleged that the respondent Richard T. Murphy, the town clerk of the city of New Britain, was intending to make such a certification in reliance on the provisions of \u00a7 9-167a, which the petitioners alleged to be violative of various provisions of the state and federal constitutions. In order to invoke the special appeal procedures of General Statutes \u00a7 9-325,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the parties agreed upon a stip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ulated finding of facts, and the trial court thereupon certified to this court its decision on five disputed issues of law. The trial court concluded that it had jurisdiction to proceed under \u00a7 9-328 but determined that, on the merits, the plaintiffs could not prevail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9-328 and therefore, without reaching the merits, conclude that the case must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The underlying facts and applicable statutory principles are undisputed. The city of New Britain elects its fifteen aldermen in an election at large. For the aldermanic election held on November 3, 1987, the Democratic party nominated fifteen candidates, all of whom outpolled the ten Republican party candidates, the five Independent party candidates and the one petitioning candidate. Under applicable provisions of \u00a7 9-167a, no more than ten aldermen selected in an at-large election may be members of the same political party. The petitioners are the five lowest ranking Democratic nominees, who would have been elected but for \u00a7 9-167a. Conversely, the respondents are the five Republican nominees who, because they received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>next highest number of votes, will be deemed to have been elected by the terms of \u00a7 9-167a.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Recognizing that, in compliance with \u00a7 9-167a, the town clerk would certify the five respondents to the Secretary of the state of Connecticut as having been elected to the office of alderman, the petitioners initiated the present litigation. The sole substantive allegation in their complaint was that the town clerk proposed to implement a statute that, in their view, deprived them of fundamental state and federal constitutional rights. The trial court concluded that such a complaint stated a proper cause of action under \u00a7 9-328. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In order to take advantage of the expedited procedures that \u00a7 9-328 prescribes for the correction of errors in municipal elections, an elector or a candidate must state one of the limited types of claims that the statute makes cognizable. Absent an allegation of a violation of a specific election statute referred to in the text of \u00a7 9-328, \u00a7 9-328 applies only when an elector or a candidate claims to have been \u201caggrieved by any ruling of any election official in connection with an election for any municipal office . . . or . . . [claims] that there has been a mistake in the count of votes cast for any such office at such election . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In the present case, the parties have stipulated that the petitioners were electors and candidates and that the town clerk has the status of an election official for the purpose of certifying election results to the secretary of the state. The petitioners have neither alleged a violation of one of the statutes specially referenced in \u00a7 9-328 nor do they claim that the town clerk made a \u201cmistake\u201d in the vote count. The parties agree, therefore, that the crucial dispute, for jurisdictional purposes under \u00a7 9-328, is whether the petitioners\u2019 constitutional challenge to \u00a7 9-167a constitutes a claim that they are \u201caggrieved by any ruling of any election official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The question of what constitutes a \u201cruling\u201d by an election official was addressed by this court in <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>186 Conn. 125, 440 A.2d 261 (1982). In a footnote squarely on point, we stated: \u201cThe expedited review provided by \u00a7 9-325 may be invoked to obtain review of decisions on complaints brought under \u00a7\u00a7 9-324, 9-328, and 9-329a. It is not sufficient, however, that the plaintiff allege or even that the parties agree that the complaint is brought pursuant to one of these sections, because the review provided by \u00a7 9-325 is available only when the original complaint actually states a cause of action cognizable under \u00a7\u00a7 9-324, 9-328, or 9-329a. Such a complaint must concern a ruling of an election official or a mistake in the count of votes. Id. A plaintiff may not use these sections to challenge a law or regulation under which the election or primary election is held by claiming aggrievement in the election official\u2019s obedience to the law. In such a case the plaintiff may well be aggrieved by the law or regulation, but he or she is not aggrieved by the election official\u2019s rulings which are in conformity with the law.\u201d Id., 134 n.10. Relying on <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>we subsequently dismissed an appeal under \u00a7 9-325 of a judgment upholding the constitutionality of a local charter provision for minority representation in a complaint filed under \u00a7 9-328. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kotecki, </em>(Supreme Court Docket No. 11126) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">If we adhere to <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 9-328, the petitioners clearly cannot prevail. They offer two reasons why we should depart from this precedent. As a matter of interpretation, they claim that they were aggrieved by the town clerk\u2019s ruling, because the town clerk had to make a choice whether he would comply with \u00a7 9-167a, the minority representation statute, or with \u00a7 9-169c,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the statute govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ing elections at large. As a matter of policy, they maintain that a narrow construction of \u00a7 9-828 is illogical because expedited judicial review is at least as important for matters of potential constitutional significance as it is for technical violations of election rules. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The petitioners\u2019 argument of aggrievement by the town clerk\u2019s ruling rests on a perceived incompatibility between the mandate of the minority representation statute, which permits no more than ten aldermen to be members of the same political party, and the provisions of \u00a7 1141 of the New Britain charter, as modified by \u00a7 9-169c, which permit a political party to nominate, and New Britain electors to vote for, as many as fifteen candidates for the position of alderman.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petitioners maintain that the statutes put the town clerk in the position of choosing between two presumptively valid constitutional enactments and therefore require him to make a \u00a7 9-828 \u201cruling.\u201d We do not agree. Whatever the manner in which the city of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Britain, guided by \u00a7 9-169c, chooses to operate the process of nominating and voting for candidates for aider-men, the outcome of such an election is governed by \u00a7 9-167a, which limits the representation of a majority party. For the purposes of \u00a7 9-328, it does not matter whether a municipality has recourse to a primary or to a general election to decide how to allocate the permissible number of aldermen to any one political party. In either case, the local election official can obey the mandate of \u00a7 9-167a. We therefore conclude that the town clerk in this case did not make a \u00a7 9-328 \u201cruling.\u201d Cf. <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>164 Conn. 126,132-33, 318 A.2d 109 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The petitioners\u2019 argument of policy stands on a different footing. In essence, the petitioners urge us to reconsider the merits of our footnote in <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>supra, on the ground that our construction of \u00a7 9-328 unduly narrowed a remedial statute designed to facilitate the prompt resolution of election disputes. They argue that the legislature intended to provide an expedited review not only for minor technical violations of election processes but also for serious constitutional impairment of election rights. They maintain that their claims require a speedier adjudication than they would be able to obtain through an action in quo warranto, or for a declaratory judgment, in order to avoid uncertainty about the validity of interim legislative actions by a board of aldermen whose rightful composition may be in doubt. These arguments are not, however, incontrovertible. The legislature might reasonably have opted for speedy adjudication of disputes about technical violations of election laws on the theory that identification and rectification of such mistakes is ordinarily not a matter of great complexity. Constitutional adjudication, by contrast, requires study and reflection and may therefore, as a general matter, be deemed less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>appropriate for accelerated disposition. Furthermore, the respondent aldermen, once their election is certified in accordance with the mandate of \u00a7 9-167a, would have at least de facto status; <em>State ex rel. Comstock </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>83 Conn. 554, 557-59, 78 A. 442 (1910); which would give legal effect to their public acts, done under color of law, even if they were not then officers de jure. <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 203, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>38 Conn. 449, 471-79 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 9-328, while not extensive, supports our construction in <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy. </em>In 1978, prior to our decision, the statute had been amended to narrow those who might avail themselves of its expedited procedures. The 1978 amendment, designed to conform the language of \u00a7 9-328 with that of \u00a7\u00a7 9-324 and 9-329, deleted from the class of eligible litigants any person \u201cclaiming to have been elected\u201d to any municipal office. This year, the legislature, in Public Acts 1987, No. 87-545, \u00a7 3, expanded the substantive claims that an aggrieved candidate may make to include alleged violations of specified statutes governing election fraud and absentee balloting. Notably, this most recent revision does not purport to include constitutional claims within the ambit of \u00a7 9-328. We take the failure of the legislature to amend \u00a7 9-328 in this regard as acquiescence in <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy. </em>The legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation that courts have placed on existing legislation and of the implications that we will draw from its inaction. <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 123, 434 A.2d 949 (1980); <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 63, 111 A.2d 4 (1955). Whether the remedy provided in \u00a7 9-328 is to be fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ther expanded is a question for the legislature to resolve. See <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>203 Conn. 187, 197, 523 A.2d 1301 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">There is error in the trial court\u2019s decision to entertain this action and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 9-167a, as amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-498, provides: \u201c(a) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the maximum number of members of any board, commission, legislative body, committee or similar body of the state or any political subdivision thereof, whether elective or appointive, who may be members of the same political party, shall be as specified in the following table:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">\u201cCOLUMN I COLUMN II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">Total Membership Maximum from one Party</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-15\">3 --------------------------------------------2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-16\">4 --------------------------------------------3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-17\">5 ----=----------------------------------------4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-18\">6 ---------------------------- 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-19\">7 --------------------------------------------5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-20\">8 --------------------------------------------5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-21\">9 --------------------------------------------6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-22\">More than 9 ---------------Two-thirds of total membership \u201c(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply (A) to any such board, commission, committee or body whose members are elected wholly or partially on the basis of a geographical division of the state or political subdi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>vision, (B) to a legislative body of a municipality (i) having a town meeting as its legislative body or (ii) for which the charter or a special act, on January 1,1987, provided otherwise or (C) to the city council of an unconsolidated city within a town and the town council of such town if the town has a town council and a representative town meeting, the town charter provides for some form of minority representation in the election of members of the representative town meeting, and the city has a city council and a body having the attributes of a town meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c(b) Prior to any election for or appointment to any such body, the municipal clerk, in cases of elections, and the appointing authority, in cases of appointments, shall determine the maximum number of members of any political party who may be elected or appointed to such body at such election or appointment.

Under a charter revision of \u00a7 1141 enacted by No. 204 of the 1969 Special Acts and approved by a 1969 referendum, New Britain electors were entitled to vote for \u201ctwo aldermen from each assembly district within the city as defined in the general statutes and five aldermen-at-large.\u201d As a result of subsequent legislative reapportionment, the city of New Britain now shares one assembly district with the town of Plainville and another assembly district with the town of Newington. For towns in which members of the local legislative body are elected on the basis of assembly districts that, as a result of redistricting, are shared with another town, General Statutes \u00a7 9-169e provides that \u201cmembers may be elected on an at-large basis . . . unless and until such town changes its charter.\u201d Section 1141 of the New Britain charter has not been amended since 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
