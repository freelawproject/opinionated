J.</author>\n<p id=\"APh\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the incriminatory statements that the defendant made during a custodial interrogation. The defendant, Daniel Weidenhof II, was charged in a three count informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tion with the crimes of kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes .\u00a7 53a-92a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and having a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a jury verdict finding him guilty on all counts, the defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of ten years imprisonment, to be suspended after two and one-half years and followed by five years of probation. The defendant appeals from this judgment. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. About 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, November 9,1985, the victim, a nineteen year old man, was hitchhiking on Route 195 in Willimantic in order to go to work at a convenience store on the University of Connecticut campus at Storrs. He got a ride in a car driven by a lone white male in his late thirties, later identified as the defendant. On the passenger seat of the car there were several magazines, one of which was an explicitly homosexual publication bearing the title \u201cBlue Boy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">During the ride to Storrs, the defendant placed his hand on the victim\u2019s knee, called him a \u201cpretty boy,\u201d and indicated his interest in homosexual relations. The victim declined and asked to be dropped off at the next traffic light. When the victim sought to leave the car as it approached the Storrs campus, the defendant objected, pulled out a gun and threatened to \u201cblow [the victim\u2019s] head off.\u201d As the car slowed for a traffic light, the victim managed nonetheless to jump out and make his way to his place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The victim reported the incident to the state police later that evening. Several days later, as the result of a further interview, with the assistance of Sergeant Frank Griffin, the victim put together a composite rendering of the operator of the car. The victim selected the defendant\u2019s photograph out of a photo array presented to him on January 24, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">On the basis of this information, the police obtained search and arrest warrants that were simultaneously served upon the defendant outside his apartment in the late afternoon of February 4,1986. Pursuant to these warrants, the police arrested the defendant, searched his apartment and seized his car. In the apartment, they found and seized an automatic pistol, a revolver, an ammunition clip and several homosexual magazines including an issue of \u201cBlue Boy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Immediately upon the defendant\u2019s arrest, the police advised him of his constitutional rights and the defendant initialed a card attesting to that fact. The defendant was then taken for questioning to Troop C headquarters in Stafford Springs. During the subsequent interrogation, the defendant acknowledged that he was a homosexual, that he kept homosexual magazines in his car, and that, on the previous November 9, he had picked up a hitchhiker on Route 195 and had driven him to Storrs. The defendant denied, however, having had a gun in his car or in any other way having committed the crimes with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In appealing from the judgment of conviction, the defendant has raised seven claims of error. He alleges that the trial court erroneously: (1) admitted the defendant\u2019s incriminatory statements into evidence; (2) limited the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Sergeant Griffin; (3) admitted the defendant\u2019s uncharged prior acts of misconduct into evidence; (4) admitted hearsay testimony of out-of-court identifications of the defendant into evidence; (5) admitted a composite drawing into evidence; (6) admitted a weapon seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment into evidence; and (7) admitted a homosexual magazine seized from the defendant\u2019s house into evidence. We may conveniently consider jointly the defendant\u2019s first two claims, which have constitutional implications, and then his remaining evidentiary claims. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The defendant\u2019s first two claims of error relate to his challenge of the voluntariness of the incriminatory statements that he made to the state police. He first claims that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the oral statements that he had made to Sergeant Griffin during the custodial interrogation that immediately followed his arrest on February 4,1986. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>statements were inadmissible, according to the defendant, because, although he had been warned of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in accordance with the rules laid down in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he had not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his constitutional privilege. His second claim is that the trial court unduly limited his cross-examination of Griffin concerning his alleged waiver of his constitutional rights. We find no error in either of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The state bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant has knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the rights that inhere in the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 743, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 395, 528 A.2d 794 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>200 Conn. 523, 533, 512 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940,107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). By admitting the defendant\u2019s custodial statements into evidence, the trial court implicitly determined, as a finding of fact, not only that the defendant had been adequately warned about his <em>Miranda </em>rights but also that he had properly waived these rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>waiver implicates important constitutional rights, our review of this finding of fact requires us to undertake \u201ca scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain whether such a finding is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 219, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112,102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 580, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The record in this case demonstrates that, before beginning the interrogation at Troop C headquarters, Griffin reminded the defendant that he had previously been informed of his constitutional rights. The defendant had indeed earlier initialed a card containing <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and had orally indicated his understanding of those warnings. After the reminder, Griffin asked the defendant whether he would be willing to answer questions without an attorney present. The defendant replied affirmatively and proceeded to respond in detail to the questions that Griffin put to him. The defendant, however, neither gave the police a written statement nor did he execute a written waiver of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The testimony of the police concerning the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s interrogation depicts a literate adult, with an adequate command of the English language, who was \u201ccalm, cooperative, [and] competent,\u201d who participated willingly in their dialogue, and who was not under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. There is no evidence to the contrary. Significantly, there is neither allegation nor evidence that the police resorted to threats, promises or other improper tactics to induce the defendant to make incriminatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The defendant advances two related arguments in support of his contention that this record is insufficient to establish waiver. As a general matter, he characterizes the record that we have summarized above as \u201cvirtually barren\u201d with respect to proof of waiver. This claim is unsustainable on its face. The unchallenged testimony of the police officers, coupled with the absence of any allegations of fact that cast doubt upon the knowing and voluntary nature of the defendant\u2019s waiver, suffice to support the trial court\u2019s factual finding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Aversa, </em>197 Conn. 685, 697, 501 A.2d 370 (1985). As a further, more specific, claim of error, the defendant would have us draw an inference against waiver from the failure of the police to ask the defendant, in so many words, whether he wished to waive or give up his constitutional rights. Despite the adequacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that he received and understood, it was not enough, according to the defendant, to ask him whether he was willing to answer questions without an attorney present. In effect, the defendant would have us condition the validity of a waiver on the utterance of talismanic words. We decline to do so. Apart from the absence of any authority for so rigid a principle, we doubt that a mandatory reference to \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d would be more likely to communicate to lay persons the essence of the privilege against self-incrimination than the question that was put to the defendant in this case. Cf. <em>State </em>v. Suggs, 194 Conn. 223, 227-28, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984). As did the trial court, we conclude that the state has met its burden of proving, in light of the totality of the circumstances, that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The defendant\u2019s related constitutional claim on the issue of waiver challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings limiting his cross-examination of Griffin to preclude inquiry into the failure of the police to secure a written waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. From the outset of the trial, the state had acknowledged that the defendant had never been asked to execute such a written waiver. In voir dire proceedings outside the presence of the jury concerning the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements, the court had correctly ruled that a written waiver was not essential. <em>North Carolina </em>v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aversa, </em>supra, 696; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 580. In the presence of the jury, the defendant sought nonetheless to cross-examine Griffin about the contents of a written rights waiver form and the decision of the police not to use such a form in this case. Although the court permitted other questioning about the circumstances surrounding Griffin\u2019s interrogation of the defendant, the court ruled that the proffered inquiry into the waiver form was inadmissible. In the course of sustaining the state\u2019s objection to this line of questioning, the court expressly instructed the jury that it was unnecessary for the state to obtain a written waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. Conceding the propriety of this instruction, the defendant nevertheless maintains that the court impermissibly restricted his constitutional right to cross-examine Griffin, who was, on the waiver issue, one of the principal witnesses against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The sixth amendment to the United States constitution confers upon a defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A significant aspect of the right of confrontation is the cross-examination of adverse witnesses \u201c \u2018to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the [witnesses].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>George, </em>194 Conn. 361, 365, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984), cert. denied, 469 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 963, 83 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1985); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). Because the core value protected by the confrontation clause is the enhancement of the truth-seeking process; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 692-93, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987); \u201c[cjross-examin-ation to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, 188 </em>Conn. 715, 720, 453 A.2d 765 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corley, </em>177 Conn. 243, 246, 413 A.2d 826 (1979). Where reliability is not directly implicated, however, the scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 402-403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 510-11, 438 A.2d 749 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In this case, we agree with the state that the acknowledged failure of the police to request a written waiver form had no significant implication for the reliability of Griffin\u2019s testimony concerning his interrogation of the defendant. The jury had to decide whether to believe Griffin\u2019s account of what had transpired during the interrogation and what weight to give the statements it found credible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>171 Conn. 454, 460-61, 370 A.2d 1002 (1976). The trial court could reasonably have determined that an inquiry into written waivers would not appreciably have assisted the jury in its task. We reiterate that, except with regard to the waiver form, the court freely permitted cross-examination of the witness concerning the circumstances of the interrogation. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error challenge the validity of a number of evidentiary rulings by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>trial court. The defendant maintains that the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence: (1) testimony concerning prior acts of misconduct by the defendant; (2) testimony concerning the victim\u2019s out-of-court identification of the defendant; (3) a composite drawing allegedly depicting the person who had threatened the victim; (4) a revolver found in the defendant\u2019s apartment; and (5) a homosexual magazine also found in the apartment. We find no error in any of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Under the rubric of \u201cuncharged prior acts of misconduct,\u201d the defendant challenges the admissibility of testimony concerning two incidents that occurred in the fall of 1985 at a Mobil gasoline station in Tolland some eight miles from the Storrs campus of the University of Connecticut. One involved the station\u2019s owner, Jeffrey Waterhouse, and the other involved its service manager, Charles Markunas. Both of these witnesses testified to seeing homosexual literature openly displayed in the defendant\u2019s car while they were selling him gasoline at times proximately related to the alleged crimes in this case. That testimony is not at issue. Both also testified to seeing a gun in the defendant\u2019s car, and the defendant contends that this evidence should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">At trial, the state offered this evidence both to establish the identity of the defendant\u2019s vehicle as the one allegedly used to commit the crimes charged and to rebut the defendant\u2019s alleged statement to Griffin that he had never had a gun in his car. The defendant disagreed, claiming that the evidence was irrelevant and could not be used to impeach a nontestifying defendant. With respect to the Waterhouse testimony, the record contains no reference whatsoever to any claim of admissibility or exclusion grounded in the rules pertaining to evidence of alleged prior misconduct. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>respect to the Markunas testimony, while the defendant adverted to the grounds \u201cpreviously stated with respect to the prior witness, [Waterhouse],\u201d the record is clouded by the trial court\u2019s subsequent sua sponte interjection of \u201cbad act\u201d as the basis for admissibility. The defendant, although not overtly acquiescing in this characterization, which resulted in a limiting instruction to the jury, resisted the court\u2019s request for clarification of his position, stating merely: \u201cIn terms of what I\u2019m requesting, at this point I am objecting to the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d In our judgment, with respect to the testimony of both of these witnesses, the record fails to manifest the defendant\u2019s compliance with the Practice Book requirement that appealable claims of error should have been \u201cdistinctly raised at the trial.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We perceive in this case no manifest injustice in declining to engage in a plenary review of the claims concerning prior misconduct evidence that the defendant failed to pursue in the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no error in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of evidentiary error arises out of third party testimony offered by the state to cor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>rob\u00f3rate identifications made by the victim. At trial, the victim made an in-court identification of the defendant and identified the automatic weapon seized from the defendant\u2019s home as similar to the one displayed at the time of the crime. When Griffin was asked to testify to two corroborating out-of-court identifications by the victim, one a selection of the defendant\u2019s picture from a photo array, and one identifying the automatic gun, the defendant objected that such testimony was inadmissible because it was hearsay. The trial court overruled these objections because the victim was in court and available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling was correct. In <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5,11, 505 A.2d 685 (1986), we held that an exception to the hearsay rule was warranted for out-of-court identifications that are reliable and can be tested by cross-examination of the relevant witnesses. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>105 Conn. 326, 341, 135 A. 446 (1926). The defendant has not challenged the underlying reliability of the victim\u2019s out-of-court identifications and had ample opportunity to cross-examine both the victim and Griffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of evidentiary error challenges the admission of a composite drawing that the victim, with the assistance of Griffin, assembled from the victim\u2019s description of the person who had kidnapped and threatened him. When the victim testified about the composite drawing during his direct examination, the state offered the drawing into evidence, but withdrew that offer because of the defendant\u2019s objection. The victim did, however, testify about how the drawing had been prepared and that he was satisfied with the likeness it depicted. Griffin subsequently gave a further demonstration about the preparation of composite drawings and specifically testified to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>cooperation with the victim in putting an appropriate composite together. The defendant nevertheless objected to having the composite made an exhibit on the basis of Griffin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s objection was properly overruled by the trial court. Admissibility of a composite drawing requires a proper foundation. The moving party must present witnesses with firsthand knowledge of how the composite was prepared and of how accurately it portrays that which it is intended to depict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>184 Conn. 258, 275, 439 A.2d 983 (1981). In this case, such testimony was provided by the victim and by Griffin. The necessity for a proper foundation is substantive and not formal. If the court is provided with the information needed for a proper ruling, it matters not whether that information comes from one witness or two. If, arguendo, the victim would have been the preferable witness through whom to offer the drawing into evidence, this defendant, who insisted on an alternate procedure, cannot be heard to complain. \u201cAction induced by an appellant cannot ordinarily be a ground of error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>202 Conn. 18, 25, 519 A.2d 607 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 135-36, 502 A.2d 381 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 769, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>164 Conn. 402, 424, 324 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 861, 94 S. Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant\u2019s last two claims of evidentiary error concern two items seized from his apartment, in accordance with a search warrant, at the time of his arrest. The defendant challenges neither the validity of the search warrant, nor the propriety of introducing into evidence the automatic pistol that the police found in their search. He maintains, however, that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>failed to establish a sufficient evidentiary basis for introducing a revolver and a homosexual magazine as exhibits against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The revolver was admitted through the testimony of Charles Markunas, the service manager of the Mobil gasoline station in Tolland. As part of his testimony concerning his observation of the defendant in a car in which homosexual literature was openly displayed, Markunas, as previously discussed, properly testified to seeing the butt end of a gun under the front seat of the defendant\u2019s car. Markunas identified the gun he had seen as resembling the revolver found in the defendant\u2019s apartment, whereas both the victim and Waterhouse had identified the handgun that they had observed as an automatic pistol.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We note that, although the information charging the defendant with the crimes of which he was convicted failed to specify the type of handgun that had been used, the defendant never requested a bill of particulars by way of clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The record at trial does not clearly establish the grounds on which the defendant objected to the admission of the revolver. Initially, the defendant objected that there was \u201cno connection\u201d between the weapon used in the incident on November 9, 1985, and the weapon identified by Markunas, and that the revolver should therefore be excluded as immaterial and irrelevant. When the court pointed out the latent ambiguity about the weapon designated in the complaint, defense counsel retreated and acknowledged: \u201cWith respect to your Honor\u2019s recitation of the prior testimony, that would tend to indicate some, some probative value to this case, I will concede that.\u201d He then urged the court to consider that the probative effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of the testimony was much less than its prejudicial effect. The court did not pursue that argument but suggested instead that the revolver was admissible for the limited purpose of proving identity by showing a \u201cbad act,\u201d i.e., that on a prior occasion the defendant had had a handgun in his car. The defendant did not offer any ground for objection to the admission for this limited purpose, but, when pressed by the court, merely reiterated that, \u201cIn terms of what I\u2019m requesting, at this point I am objecting to the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d The court, when it admitted the revolver into evidence, expressly cautioned the jury that the revolver was not probative of the defendant\u2019s guilt of any of the crimes with which he was being charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On appeal, the defendant has returned to his initial argument concerning the lack of relevance of the revolver to the crimes charged. We are unpersuaded. First, that argument, in effect having been abandoned at trial, cannot now be revived. Second, that argument does not address the limited purpose for which the revolver was admitted at trial. In conjunction, these reasons persuade us to sustain the ruling of the trial court. As with the underlying testimony leading to the introduction of the revolver into evidence, given the inadequacy of the record below, the defendant has failed to comply with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 4185. \u201cAll of the claims involve allegations of abuse of the trial court\u2019s broad discretion to determine the relevance and admissibility of evidence at trial. <em>State </em>v. Gold, 180 Conn. 619, 646, 431 A.2d 501 (1980). In the absence of any demonstration that these eviden-tiary rulings constitute plain error, or that enforcement of our rule will cause injustice; Practice book \u00a7 3164 [now \u00a7 4187]; we decline to consider these claims.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 621,469 A.2d 767 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim with respect to the homosexual magazine \u201cBlue Boy\u201d asks us to overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling that the magazine had sufficient probative value, despite its potentially prejudicial nature, to warrant its introduction into evidence. According to the victim\u2019s testimony, on the day of the alleged crimes he saw a magazine with such a title in the defendant\u2019s car and recognized it as a homosexual publication, but did not open it to examine its contents. Over the defendant\u2019s objection on grounds of irrelevance and prejudice, the court admitted the magazine into evidence as an exhibit because it corroborated the victim\u2019s identification of the car and the car\u2019s operator. As it had done on a previous occasion, the court expressly instructed the jury not to draw adverse inferences as to guilt from evidence implicating homosexuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On appeal, the defendant acknowledges that the discovery of the magazine in the defendant\u2019s apartment had probative value, because he concedes that if the magazine had been Time or Newsweek, the trial court\u2019s ruling would have been correct. The sole issue therefore is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the magazine\u2019s probative value outweighed its prejudicial impact. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 660, 491 A.2d 345 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 656, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). In our review of such discretionary evidentiary determinations, \u201c[w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>200 Conn. 440, 446, 512 A.2d 175 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 549, 461 A.2d 981 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case. The defendant has not challenged, on grounds of undue prejudice, the admissibility of his statements to Sergeant Griffin concerning his homosexual lifestyle. Further, the trial court repeatedly warned the jury that evidence of homosexuality did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>prove that the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which he had been charged. Regardless of its homosexual orientation, the magazine was highly probative to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony. In these circumstances, the court\u2019s ruling was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-92a. kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm: class a felony: one year not suspendable.
