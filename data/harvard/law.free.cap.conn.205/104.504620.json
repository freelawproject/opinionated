Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0B\">In this action, which comes to us by way of reservation from the Superior Court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>parties seek advice on the following questions: (1) \u201cDoes Section 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 407, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, preclude the State of Connecticut from using legal process to require the defendant representative payee of social security benefits belonging to Charles Amore, a patient confined at a state mental hospital, to pay over any of those benefits received during the period June 13, 1978, through October 29, 1983, to satisfy the institutional support charges assessed under Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 17-295 (c) for that period?\u201d (2) \u201cDoes Section 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 407, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, preclude the State of Connecticut from attaching the individually owned assets of the defendant representative payee to recover the costs of the confined beneficiary\u2019s care and treatment at a state humane institution pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 17-295 (c)?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts: From June 13,1978, through October 29,1983, Charles Amore a/k/a Cataldo Amore was a patient at the Connecticut Valley Hospital, a state humane institution for the care of mentally ill persons. During this time period, the defendant, Enrica Amore, was the representative payee of his social security benefits and, on his behalf, received social security benefits totaling $32,765.10. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-295 (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>billed the defendant in her capacity as representative payee of the social security benefits belonging to Charles Amore in the sum of $14,707.71 for the support and maintenance it had provided to Charles Amore while he resided as a confined patient at the Connecticut Valley Hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No payments have been received by the state from the defendant against her account as representative payee of social security benefits belonging to Charles Amore.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In an attempt to collect the $14,707.71 in outstanding charges, the state filed suit against the defendant. On June 7, 1984, the court, <em>O\u2019Brien, J., </em>granted the state\u2019s application for an ex parte prejudgment real estate attachment upon the defendant\u2019s real property in the amount of $17,000. On October 5, 1984, the defendant moved to strike the state\u2019s complaint on the ground that \u00a7 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, \u201cbars the use of any legal process against the only funds for which the defendant, as representative payee, may be liable.\u201d On April 22, 1985, the court, <em>Hon. Harold M. Mulvey, </em>state trial referee, denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The parties then requested that the court reserve the aforementioned questions for the advice of the Appellate Court. On April 25, 1986, the court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>granted that request. On June 16, 1986, this court transferred the reservation to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The first question reserved to this court presents the issue of whether, under the facts of this case, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 prohibits the state from using legal process to require the defendant, the representative payee of social security benefits of Charles Amore, a confined patient at a state humane institution, to pay over any of those benefits to satisfy the institutional support charges assessed by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">It is clear that General Statutes \u00a7 17-295 (c) provides the state with a cause of action against a representative payee for the support of a patient confined to a state humane institution. Section 17-295 (c) provides in part: \u201cThe guardian, conservator and payee of Social Security or other benefits on behalf of any [patient confined to a state humane institution] shall be [legally liable from the date of admission] for the support of such patient, but shall be liable in such capacity only in accordance with the amount of the patient\u2019s estate or the benefits received, or both, as the case may be.\u201d The question presented here is whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, by virtue of the supremacy clause, precludes the state from asserting such a cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The relevant portion of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, provides that \u201c[t]he right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The defendant maintains that the state is precluded from asserting its claim under \u00a7 17-295 (c) because \u201c[o]n its face . . . the federal Social Security Act shields the disability benefits it generates from the legal grasp of creditors,\u201d including the state, and that by virtue of the supremacy clause the Connecticut statute cannot be used as a vehicle for attaching those funds. Specifically, the defendant argues that \u00a7 407\u2019s prohibition of the use of \u201clegal process\u201d to reach social security payments bars the state from recouping any part of the support costs. In support of this interpretation of \u00a7 407, the defendant points to the decision of the United States Supeme Court in <em>Philpott </em>v. <em>Essex County Welfare Board, </em>409 U.S. 413, 93 S. Ct. 590, 34 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1973). In opposition to the defendant\u2019s argument that the federal statute and the <em>Philpott </em>case clearly prohibit the state from pursuing its claim against the defendant in this case, the state argues that <em>Philpott </em>is distinguishable from this case and that both federal and state case law subsequent to <em>Philpott, </em>as well as the pertinent federal regulations, make it \u201cevident that the bar created by Section 407 is not absolute and may be defeated if the legislative intent is not frustrated in the process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In <em>Philpott </em>v. <em>Essex County Welfare Board, </em>supra, Wilkes, a disabled person who was capable in part of providing his own care, applied for and received welfare assistance from the Essex County welfare board in the state of New Jersey. The county determined monthly maintenance needs by taking into consideration \u201cany other benefits.\u201d Because at the time Wilkes applied for the welfare benefits he was not receiving \u201cany other\u201d benefits, full welfare benefits were awarded to him. As a precondition to receiving such aid, Wilkes executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>an agreement to reimburse the county welfare board if and when he later received assets. Thereafter, Wilkes applied for disability benefits under the Social Security Act and was awarded benefits retroactively in one lump sum. This money was deposited in a bank account Philpott held as trustee for Wilkes. Pursuant to the agreement to reimburse, the county sued for repayment. The United States Supreme Court rejected the county\u2019s claim and held that the \u201call inclusive\u201d language of the Social Security Act barred the state of New Jersey from reaching the federal disability payments paid to Wilkes.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The state argues that the critical difference between this case and <em>Philpott </em>v. <em>Essex County Welfare Board, </em>supra, is that in <em>Philpott </em>the state sought to attach social security funds which were in a bank account of a welfare beneficiary who was a <em>noneonfined </em>patient then living independently in the community at large. The state argues that \u201cunlike the fact pattern extant in <em>Philpott </em>[v. <em>Essex County Welfare Board], </em>supra, the case at bar involves not the recovery of public welfare assistance from the Social Security beneficiary himself, but rather involves the payment of the customary charges assessed for the support and maintenance of an <em>institutionalized </em>patient from the representative payee of his Social Security benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state argues that this distinction is \u201ccrucial\u201d because the scope of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 has been refined by certain provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations as well as by federal case law. We agree with the position advocated by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The language of the pertinent federal regulations provides that the general proscription of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 does not necessarily prohibit the state from seeking reimbursement in a situation where the state is providing for the current maintenance needs of an institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tionalized social security beneficiary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1606 (1978), which is entitled \u201cUse of benefits for beneficiary in institution,\u201d provides in part: \u201cWhere a beneficiary is confined in a Federal, State or private institution because of mental or physical incapacity, the relative or other person to whom payments are certified on behalf of the beneficiary, <em>shall give highest priority </em>to expenditure of the payments for the current maintenance needs of the beneficiary, <em>including the customary charges made by the institution </em>(see \u00a7 404.1604) in providing care and maintenance. It is considered in the best interests of the beneficiary for the relative or other person to whom payments are certified on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf to allocate expenditure of the payments so certified in a manner which will facilitate the beneficiary\u2019s earliest possible rehabilitation or release from the institution . . . . \u201d The defendant argues that the second sentence of this regulation supports his position that a representative payee is <em>not </em>required to reimburse the state for the current maintenance charges. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of this regulation. The fact that under the regulation \u201c[i]t is considered in the best interests of the beneficiary for the [representative payee] to allocate . . . the payments . . . in a manner which will facilitate the beneficiary\u2019s earliest possible rehabilitation or release\u201d does not undercut the fact that the representative payee must \u201cgive <em>highest priority\u201d </em>to the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Additionally, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1604 (1978), which is entitled \u201cUse of benefits for current maintenance,\u201d pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>vides: \u201cPayments certified to a relative or other person on behalf of a beneficiary shall be considered as having been applied for the use and benefit of the beneficiary when they are used for the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance .... Where a beneficiary is receiving care in an institution (see \u00a7 404.1606) current maintenance <em>shall include the customary charges </em>made by the institution to individuals it provides with care and services. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1608 (1978), which is entitled \u201cClaims of creditors,\u201d provides in part: A \u201crepresentative payee on behalf of a beneficiary may not be required to use such payments to discharge an indebtedness of the beneficiary which was incurred before the first month for which payments are certified to a relative or other person on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf. ...\u201d The conclusion to be drawn from these regulations is that in situations where the social security beneficiary is confined in an institution because of mental or physical incapacity, the representative payee may be required to pay the current maintenance charges which were incurred during the representative payee\u2019s tenure as representative payee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In further support of its position, the state cites the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Department of Health </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>616 F.2d 828 (5th Cir. 1980). In Davis, a case virtually identical to the present case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals distinguished the holding in <em>Philpott </em>and demonstrated that <em>Philpott </em>does not apply to a situation, such as the present case, where the state is seeking reimbursement for the current maintenance needs of a confined patient. In <em>Davis, </em>the court stated: <em>\u201cPhilpott </em>is different from this case, however, since there the welfare recipient was capable, at least in part, of providing for his own care, and the state was not acting in loco parentis, as it is here. The beneficiary in <em>Philpott </em>was merely receiving assistance in providing for himself. [This beneficiary], however, determined to be incompetent by the Veteran\u2019s Administration since February 21, 1952, has been in confinement until the present because he is apparently incapable of caring for himself to any degree. [This beneficiary] has had no needs during the period he has been in the Florida State Hospital that were not met by the state. Accordingly, the state is seeking to have the guardian, who is responsible for overseeing her ward\u2019s care and maintenance, do what is required by Florida law: apply the benefits received by the ward for care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and maintenance to reimburse Florida for undertaking his care and maintenance. Thus, contrary to the guardian\u2019s argument, <em>Philpott </em>does not control the outcome of this case.\u201d <em>Department of Health </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 830.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In cases closely analogous to the present case, other courts have relied on the rationale set forth by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Davis. </em>See, e.g., <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>State, </em>290 Ark. 47, 716 S.W.2d 755 (1986); <em>Conservatorship of Estate of Lambert, </em>143 Cal. App. 3d 239, 191 Cal. Rptr. 725 (1983); <em>State Treasurer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>125 Mich. App. 620, 337 N.W.2d 23 (1983); <em>Sharlot </em>v. <em>Sharlot, </em>110 App. Div. 2d 299, 494 N.Y.S.2d 238 (1985); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Devall, </em>704 F.2d 1513, reh. denied, 714 F.2d 1068 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>Matter of Treadwell, </em>699 F.2d 1050 (11th Cir. 1983). Similarly, we agree with the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and conclude that <em>Philpott </em>does not control the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Davis </em>is explicitly grounded upon the recognition that the purpose of the \u00a7 407 exemption for social security payments from legal process is to preclude beneficiaries from directing their social security payments away from the \u201cseminal goal\u201d of the social security system itself: \u201cfurnishing financial, medical, rehabilitative and other resources to needy individuals.\u201d <em>Department of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Health v. Davis, </em>supra, 831; see <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Conservatorship of Estate of Lambert, </em>supra, 243; <em>State Treasurer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 624; see also <em>United States v.Devall, </em>supra, 1516; <em>Matter of Treadwell, </em>supra, 1053. As the court held in <em>Davis: </em>In situations where the state is providing for the current maintenance needs of a confined person, \u201c[njeither the purpose of the benefits, nor the purpose of the exemption is accomplished by barring [the state] from reimbursement.\u201d <em>Department of Health </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Conservatorship of Estate of Lambert, </em>supra; <em>State Treasurer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>Department of Treasury </em>v. <em>Ivy, </em>65 Mich. App. 447, 452, 237 N.W.2d 498 (1975), aff'd sub nom. <em>In re Vary Estate, </em>401 Mich. 340, 258 N.W.2d 11 (1977), cert, denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 98 S. Ct. 1283, 55 L. Ed. 2d 793 (1978); see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>32 Ohio App. 2d 139, 288 N.E.2d 852 (1972); <em>Texas Baptist Children\u2019s Home </em>v. <em>Corbitt, </em>321 S.W.2d 610 (Tex. Civ. App. 1959) (guardian compelled to apply social security benefits received by minor childen to their maintenance costs in a welfare home).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The defendant argues that we should not follow the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Davis </em>because that case was \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d is an \u201caberration\u201d and is \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with <em>Philpott. </em>We are unpersuaded. In this respect, we note that just as federal courts will find guidance in an interpretation of a state statute made by the courts of the enacting state, we think it appropriate that, under the circumstances of this case, we look to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 to guide our interpretation of that federal statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Benitez, </em>157 Conn. 384, 391, 254 A.2d 564 (1969); <em>International Unions. General Electric Co., </em>148 Conn. 693, 702,174 A.2d 298 (1961); <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Newtown, </em>147 Conn. 374, 380, 161 A.2d 770 (1960), appeal dismissed, 365 U.S. 299, 81 S. Ct. 692, 5 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1961); <em>Brownell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>143 Conn. 662, 669, 124 A.2d 901 (1956); see also <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Lester, </em>382 So. 2d 1019,1027-29 (La. App.), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 1045,101 S. Ct. 1767, 68 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ersinger Mill &amp; Lumber Co., </em>202 Md. 613, 618, 98 A.2d 81 (1953); <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>608 P.2d 1131 (Okla.), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Shabezz </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>449 U.S. 860, 101 S. Ct. 162, 66 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1980); cf. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Scissor-Tail, Inc., </em>28 Cal. 3d 807, 830, 623 P.2d 165, 171 Cal. Rptr. 604 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In cases presenting this issue or an analogous issue, at least five other courts have followed the rationale set forth in <em>Davis. Bennett </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Conservator-ship of Estate of Lambert, </em>supra; <em>State Treasurer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>Sharlot </em>v. <em>Sharlot, </em>supra; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Devall, </em>supra; <em>Matter of Treadwell, </em>supra. These cases undercut the defendant\u2019s argument that Davis is an \u201caberration.\u201d Additionally, we do not agree with the defendant that <em>Davis </em>is \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with <em>Philpott </em>in that <em>Davis, </em>like the present case, presents a factual situation different from that presented in <em>Philpott. </em>We believe that <em>Davis </em>was soundly decided and we adopt its reasoning. \u201cThe purpose of social security benefits for the disabled is to provide for their care and maintenance.\u201d <em>Department of Health </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra. Our disposition of this reservation does not frustrate that purpose. Because, under the circumstances of this case, there is no conflict between General Statutes \u00a7 17-295 (c) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, the state is not precluded, by virtue of the supremacy clause, from using legal process to require the defendant to pay the institutional support charges assessed by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The second question reserved to this court is does \u201c42 U.S.C. Sec. 407, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause . . . preclude the State of Connecticut from attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ing the individually owned assets of the defendant representative payee to recover the costs of the confined beneficiary\u2019s care and treatment at a state humane institution . . . ?\u201d We conclude that our disposition of the first question reserved to this court requires that we answer the second question reserved in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The answer to each of the questions reserved is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-295 (c) provides: \u201cEach patient, the husband or wife of such patient and the father and mother of a patient under the age of eighteen years each shall be legally liable from the date of admission for the support of such patient in such institution in accordance with his ability to pay; except that the maximum liability of legally liable relatives as such for a patient in a state humane institution, except a state training school for mentally retarded persons, shall not exceed that amount of support which has been charged by the commissioner, for a period or periods amounting to sixteen years unless earlier terminated as to a parent by attainment by the patient of eighteen. The guardian, conservator and payee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Social Security or other beneifts on behalf of any such patient shall be similarly responsible for the support of such patient, but shall be liable in such capacity only in accordance with the amount of the patient\u2019s estate or the benefits received, or both, as the case may be. Said commissioner may bill and accept payment from any other person or agency willing to assume any portion of the cost of support of a person in a state humane institution at such rate as such person or agency is willing to pay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> In her brief and at oral argument, the defendant pointed out that, contrary to the stipulation, her marriage to Charles Amore had been dissolved on September 23, 1970. This fact is not crucial to our disposition of this reservation because the state\u2019s claim against the defendant is not brought against her as a \u201clegally liable relative.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 17-295 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> Article VI of the constitution of the United States provides in part: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\"> Section 405 (a) of title 42 of the United States Cods grants the secretary of health and human services the power to adopt rules and regulations which are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Social Security Act. Despite the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary, we perceive no conflict between the statute and the regulations which would require a different disposition of this reservation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b125-5\"> We note that in 1983, these regulations were amended and are now codified in 20 C.F.R. 404.2040, which provides: \u201cuse of benefit payments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201c(a) Current maintenance. We will consider that payments we certify to a representative payee have been used for the use and benefit of the beneficiary if they are used for the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance.

If the debt arose prior to this time, a payee may satisfy it only if the current and reasonably foreseeable needs of the beneficiary are met. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We also note that regulations spelling out the particular duties and obligations of representative payees to pay the support charges of an institutionalized beneficiary do not exist in the field of public welfare assistance, and thus such a regulatory refinement from the general proscription of 42 U.S.C \u00a7 407 was not available to the court in <em>Philpott </em>v. <em>Essex County Welfare Board, </em>409 U.S. 413, 93 S. Ct. 590, 34 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1973), because that case did not deal with confined patients and their relationship to social security benefits paid to a representative payee, but rather, involved a beneficiary living independently in the community at large who had the responsibility of providing for his own needs from the social security benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> The court also held that Florida was not precluded by the analogous statute for veteran\u2019s benefits, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (a), which provides that \u201c[p]ayments . . . shall be exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Department of Health </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>616 F.2d 828, 831-32 (5th Cir. 1980).
