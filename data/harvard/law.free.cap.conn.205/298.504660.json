He now appeals that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The victim was discovered dead in her New Brit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ain apartment on the morning of September 8, 1982. She was found naked from the waist down with bloody garments pulled over her head and with a white fluid-like substance around her vaginal area. The police had been notified by a neighbor, Peter Melinoskas, who had become concerned after observing an open window with a metal folding chair placed below it and noticing that the victim\u2019s car was parked in the driveway. After yelling through the open window and receiving no response, Melinoskas entered the building through an open basement door, and entered the victim\u2019s apartment through the door which was slightly ajar. He found the victim\u2019s body and left the house to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Both the New Britain police department and the state police conducted the investigation. A videotape was taken of the crime scene and both latent and patent fingerprints were found. Some of these prints were identified to be those of the defendant. The cause of the victim\u2019s death was determined to be depressed compound skull fractures. A brick was found at the scene which was consistent with the type of instrument that caused the victim\u2019s injuries. Forensic testing indicated that sexual intercourse had occurred at a time close to the victim\u2019s death, and body fluid tests indicated that intercourse had occurred between a man with type A blood and a woman with either type 0 or type A blood. The victim\u2019s blood type was 0, and it was later learned that the defendant\u2019s blood type was A. A combing of pubic hair from the victim, a Caucasian, revealed the presence of negroid pubic hair. The defendant is black. A warrant was issued for the defendant\u2019s arrest and he was arrested on October 22, 1982, and taken into custody. Prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest the police learned from New Britain High School officials that he was a special education student. While in custody the defendant made inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The defendant appeals, claiming that: (1) the trial court erred in failing to suppress the inculpatory statements made to the police; (2) the trial court\u2019s instructions pertaining to capital felony were erroneous; and (3) the trial court erred in rendering judgment on the murder conviction after the jury returned guilty verdicts on both the capital felony and felony murder counts of the indictment. We find no error as to the first claim, harmless error as to the second claim, and error as to the third claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements obtained in violation of his rights under the fourth, fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) his statements were obtained without a proper waiver of the rights afforded him under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); (2) the police failed to honor his invocation of his right to remain silent; (3) the statements were involuntary; and (4) the statements were the fruit of an illegal arrest because the arrest warrant was insufficient on its face in that it was not supported by probable cause. We conclude that the trial court did not err in allowing the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements to be admitted into evidence at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to our consideration of the motion to suppress. The defendant was arrested at his home on October 22,1982, by members of the New Britain police department. He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights inside the house and again in the police car. The defendant indicated at both times that he understood his rights. The defendant was transported to the police station where he was booked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>placed in an interview room and once again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The police officers read the defendant a standard waiver form, handed the form to him to read and asked him if he understood the form. The defendant replied, \u201cI know all that shit,\u201d and signed the waiver portion of the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendant was questioned as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder. He was noncommittal and said that the only information he had was what he read in the newspaper. At some point during this interview, the defendant requested to make a telephone call to his mother and this request was granted. When asked if he wished to make a statement, the defendant replied that \u201che had nothing to make a statement about.\u201d The officers asked the defendant to consider the situation and concluded the interview and exited the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The officers reentered the interview room one hour later, and asked the defendant if he wished to use the toilet or have something to eat. The defendant said he did not. The officers also asked whether he remembered his rights, which he said he did, and again the officers read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After some general questioning, and denial of involvement by the defendant, an officer asked him if he thought the police believed that \u201cthe tooth fairy picked him up, flew him around New Britain and placed his hands all over my crime scene.\u201d The defendant responded with exculpatory statements. He stated that he was walking on Park Street on the night of the murder, heard a woman scream, went to investigate, climbed a chair to look through a window and saw a man and a woman fighting. The defendant next stated that the man saw him and threw something at him, causing him to fall off the chair and lose consciousness. He then volunteered that \u201csomeone must have put my fingerprints on the brick.\u201d The defendant had not yet been informed that a brick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>had been used in the assault. At this point the defendant agreed to make a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The defendant next indicated that he wished to speak with Robert Smith, who previously had been his public defender. After having been informed by the police that Smith was no longer a public defender, the defendant agreed to make a statement without Smith\u2019s presence. The officers again informed the defendant of his rights, read him the waiver form and began the process of taking a formal statement. At the end of the interview the officer who took the statement asked the defendant to read it and asked whether he wanted to make any changes. The defendant responded that the statement was \u201call right the way it was.\u201d When asked to sign a second waiver form and the statement, however, he refused. The defendant stated that he was a special education student and indicated for the first time that he did not understand his constitutional rights and that he had trouble reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court should have suppressed his incriminating statements because the police failed to obtain a knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant bases this claim on the following assertions: (1) that although he signed a waiver form prior to the first interview, he was uncooperative and was mentally incompetent to waive those rights knowingly and intelligently; and (2) that the incriminating statement was given in a subsequent interview, without a new waiver having been signed. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u201cThe state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 395, 528 A.2d 794 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 48, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 579-80, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986). The waiver must be made voluntarily and \u2018with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u2019 <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421,106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 743, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987). \u201c \u2018[T]he question of waiver must be determined on \u201cthe particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 [58 S.

App. 1978); his level of education; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>384 U.S. 737, 742, 86 S. Ct. 1761,16 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 581, 452 A.2d 634, cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1982); his vocabulary and ability to read and write in the language in which the warnings were given; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>[185 Conn. 211, 226, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>1112,102 S.

Ed. 2d 588 (1981); his emotional state; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 582; and the existence of any mental disease, disorder or retardation. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Dees, </em>658 F.2d 406, 411 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>75 Cal. App. 3d 384, 397, 142 Cal. Rptr. 134 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 580-81; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 396-97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>supra, 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In support of his argument that he was incompetent to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant argues that in light of his uncooperativeness with the police after signing the waiver, coupled with his age, and his level of intelligence, the court should have found that he had not knowingly and intelligently waived his rights. The record, however, reveals that the defendant had previously been exposed to the criminal justice system, which indicates that despite his young age and low IQ, he had experience upon which to base his decision to sign the waiver form. The defendant also exercised his constitutional rights by requesting a specific attorney and by requesting permission to make a telephone call, which indicates that he understood his rights and invoked them when he chose to do so. Furthermore, the defendant appeared able to read the waiver form and a written copy of the <em>Miranda </em>rights during interrogation and used his finger to follow the words on the page in one instance while reading. A police officer testified that the defendant \u201captly read\u201d the documents placed before him. When asked in the first instance what he knew about the homicide, the defendant replied that he only knew \u201cwhat he had read in the papers.\u201d It was only when asked to sign the statement that the defendant claimed he had difficulty reading and that he did not understand his constitutional rights because he was a special education student. Moreover, at all times prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>to his refusal to sign the second waiver form, when asked if he understood his rights the defendant responded that he did. At one point he even responded, \u201cyeah, I know all that shit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Finally, the fact that the defendant refused to sign the statement or a second waiver form does not render his statement inadmissible. We have recently stated that \u201c[w]hile the refusal to sign a written waiver or written statement is a \u2018relevant factor in determining whether an individual knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his privilege\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>[181 Conn. 151, 165, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064,101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980)]; it is not controlling and \u2018may be outweighed by affirmative conduct indicative of a knowingly and intelligently made decision not to remain silent.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 581.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 733, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). The defendant offered statements indicating that he understood his rights and expressly agreed to make an oral, although not written statement. This constitutes \u201caffirmative conduct\u201d evidencing waiver, which we find persuasive despite the defendant\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The defendant next claims that the written waiver is inapplicable to the statements made by him because the waiver applies only to statements made in the first interview. The defendant, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>190 Conn. 104, 459 A.2d 510 (1983), argues that the ninety minute break in interrogation requires the signing of a new waiver. In <em>Williams </em>the defendant did not expressly waive his rights, but refused to answer questions, and eventually made inculpatory statements after continued police interrogation. In the present case, however, the defendant signed a written waiver form and orally agreed to make a statement. The ninety minute break in questioning does not invalidate the waiver, and fresh warnings were given to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>although they were not necessary. See 1W. Lafave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 6.8 (b). Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its finding that the defendant effectively waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court should have suppressed his incriminating statements because the police violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights by continuing to question him after he had invoked his right to remain silent. The defendant bases this claim on the fact that during the interview, when asked if he wished to make a statement, the defendant stated that he \u201chad nothing to make a statement about.\u201d As the defendant notes, the \u201cpivotal question\u201d is whether he invoked his right to remain silent with these words, or at any other time prior to making the inculpatory statements. If he did not invoke the right to remain silent, we do not reach the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s right to cut off questioning was \u201cscrupulously honored,\u201d as required by <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 104, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975). After reviewing the circumstances leading to the defendant\u2019s statement, we find that he did not invoke the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Review of the record indicates that the defendant understood his constitutional rights and clearly invoked them when he chose to do so. His remark that he \u201chad nothing to make a statement about\u201d was in response to the police inquiry whether he wanted to make a statement and was consistent with his stance that he was uninvolved in the crime. The statement simply does not rise to the level of an invocation of the right to remain silent. The defendant did not indicate that he was opposed to speaking with the police, and we decline to construe his statement to mean this. Rather, his statement was one in a series of exculpatory statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>proffered by the defendant to clear himself from suspicion. One court has recently noted that where the \"petitioner made no reference whatsoever to the Fifth Amendment, but maintained steadfastly that he simply had no information to give police authorities . . . [t]his conduct . . . cannot rationally be construed as an invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>Damiano </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>592 F. Sup. 1222,1226 (D. Mass. 1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pacheco, </em>481 A.2d 1009,1015 (R.1.1984). The facts here resemble a situation where a defendant \"expresses an unwillingness or inability to respond to a particular inquiry (e.g., \u2018you\u2019ve done asked me a question I can\u2019t answer\u2019) [which] is not a general claim of the privilege.\u201d 1 W. Lafave &amp; J. Israel, supra, \u00a7 6.9 (e), citing <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>563 F.2d 133 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1020, 98 S. Ct. 744, 54 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that his incriminating statements were involuntary. In support of this claim, he argues that given his young age and limited intelligence, his will was overborne by the police when they confronted him with the fingerprint evidence. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\"The use of an involuntary confession in a criminal trial violates due process of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 475, 512 A.2d 189 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>[supra]. The trial court must determine the voluntariness of a confession based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 477; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 235, 511 A.2d 310 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6,16, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). In this determination, the central criterion is whether police conduct \u2018was such as to overbear [the defendant\u2019s] will to resist and bring about confessions not freely self-determined . . . . \u2019 <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 544, 81 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>S. Ct. 735, 5 L. Ed. 2d 760 (1961); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Review of the record reveals no evidence indicating that the defendant\u2019s will was overborne. The defendant was eighteen years old and had previously been exposed to the criminal justice system. Moreover, the defendant was repeatedly advised of his rights prior to making the incriminating statement and was asked if he understood them. Although a special education student and of \u201cdull normal\u201d intelligence, the defendant indicated through his conduct that he could comprehend the meaning of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As discussed above, he exercised his rights when he chose to do so. Nothing in the record indicates that his intellectual deficiency stripped him of his <em>free </em>will. Nor did the police conduct affect the voluntariness of his statements. The police did not coerce or trick the defendant when they confronted him with the fingerprint evidence. Rather, the police accurately informed the defendant of the information they possessed, and he chose to make a statement. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>547 F.2d 40 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em>76 Wis. 2d 1, 250 N.W.2d 706 (1977). Finally, as indicated in the record, the defendant\u2019s physical needs were provided for, he had an opportunity to telephone his mother and he did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on the suppression issue is that his incriminating statements were the fruit of an illegal arrest because the warrant for his arrest lacked probable cause. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the arrest warrant was supported by an affidavit sufficient to establish probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest and therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201cThe validity of an arrest warrant depends upon whether the application for the warrant and the accompanying affidavit establish probable cause to believe that: (1) a crime has been committed; and (2) the person to be arrested committed that crime. General Statutes \u00a7 54-2a (a) (1); Practice Book \u00a7 593; <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>189 Conn. 717, 720, 458 A.2d 1147 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 529, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980); 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure (1978) \u00a7 3.7. The affidavit must recite sufficient facts so that the judicial officer who issues the warrant can, relying solely on the information thus brought to his or her attention, make an independent determination that probable. cause exists as to each element of every crime charged.

Ed. 2d 721 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>supra, 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The affidavit before the issuing judge set forth the following facts: (1) on the morning of September 8, 1982, the body of the victim, a white female, was found naked from the waist down on the bedroom floor of her first floor apartment, with fluid-type substance present around her vaginal area; (2) a metal folding chair was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>found on that morning, at the base of the victim\u2019s kitchen window, where entry appeared to have been made; (3) the defendant\u2019s fingerprint was found on the chair by the police; (4) a tenant in the second floor apartment arrived home at approximately 9 p.m. on September 7, walked directly past the victim\u2019s kitchen window to reach the door and did not observe the metal folding chair at that time; (5) the tenant heard commotion from the victim\u2019s apartment at approximately 11:30 p.m.; (6) the victim\u2019s husband stated that to the best of his knowledge no black males had visited their apartment during the past five years; (7) negroid pubic hairs were present in combings from the victim\u2019s pubic hair; and (8) the defendant is a black male. There is no dispute that the facts recited in the affidavit in support of the arrest warrant show probable cause that a crime has been committed. Also, when the recited facts are considered collectively with the positive fingerprint identification of the defendant these facts combine to constitute probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime. Even though the recited facts may not be sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crimes charged, we agree that they establish a substantial basis for the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court\u2019s instructions pertaining to capital felony were erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically he claims that: (1) the instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>regarding the meaning of \u201cin the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree\u201d enlarged the crime beyond its statutory elements, thereby depriving the defendant of due process of law; and (2) the instructions regarding the legal consequence of sexual intercourse with a dead body were incorrect as a matter of law. We find harmless error as to the first claim and no error as to the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the meaning of \u201cin the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree\u201d were erroneous because they enlarged the crime of capital felony by allowing an attempted sexual assault to constitute one of the predicate offenses. \u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury we must review the instructions as a whole, including any supplemental instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 308, 386 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>A.2d 243 (1978); <em>Maciejewska </em>v. <em>Lombard Bros., Inc., </em>171 Conn. 35, 40, 368 A.2d 206 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>163 Conn. 527, 537, 316 A.2d 387 (1972). \u2018[IJndividual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. State v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140,151, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977); <em>Mazzucco </em>v. <em>Krall Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>172 Conn. 355, 357, 374 A.2d 1047 (1977).\u2019 <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 193, 199, 438 A.2d 55 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>194 Conn. 297, 311, 481 A.2d 413 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1112, 105 S. Ct. 793, 83 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1985). Examining the jury charge in its entirety, we find harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In its instruction, the trial court made a number of references to the temporal relationship required by the capital felony statute between the two predicate offenses, murder and sexual assault in the first degree. In so doing, the trial judge used the word \u201cattempt\u201d to explain that the phrase \u201cin the course of the commission of\u201d means before, during or after the completion of the sexual assault. This use of \u201cattempt\u201d was in error, however, because a possible interpretation of the charge is that the underlying sexual assault need not be completed. The trial judge also stated \u201c[i]t is not necessary, however, that the sexual intercourse be completed.\u201d It appears that the trial court intended this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>phrase to indicate that it did not matter whether the sexual assault was completed before the murder, so long as there was an intent, prior to killing, to sexually assault the victim. Nonetheless, we find error because an essential element of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree is penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We find these errors harmless. The complained of phrases, standing alone, could be interpreted as allowing an attempted sexual assault to constitute a predicate offense of capital felony. These phrases, however, must be considered with respect to the charge as a whole. \u201cA phrase having a different meaning when culled from the charge will not be regarded as error when there is no \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that the jury were misled.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 532, 363 A.2d 1011 <em>(1975); Magnon v. Glickman, </em>185 Conn. 234, 247, 440 A.2d 909 (1981). After reviewing the entire charge, we are convinced that the jury was adequately instructed on the elements of capital felony. Although the trial court\u2019s use of the questioned language was erroneous, the trial court clearly explained the requisite elements of capital felony on two separate occasions. Furthermore, the trial court read the capital felony statute to the jury three times. Finally, even if the jurors misperceived the instructions and believed that attempted sexual assault could constitute a predicate offense for capital felony, any such misperception could not have affected their verdict. There was no factual dispute as to whether sexual intercourse occurred, and the defendant did not suggest penetration had not occurred. We conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s misstatements misled the jury. \u201c \u2018Jury instuctions are calculated to give the jurors a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and to afford them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>[197 Conn. 574, 581, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>500 A.2d 539 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 219, 479 A.2d 814 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 270, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986). We conclude that the jury charge fulfilled this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The defendant also claims that the jury instructions pertaining to the legal consequences of sexual intercourse with a dead body were erroneous. He argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that if the victim was dead before sexual intercourse occurred, he could not be found guilty of sexual assault in the first degree. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 502 A.2d 360 (1985), we held that one who renders his victim unconscious and then commits a sexual assault on that person can be found guilty of sexual assault in the first degree. In that case, the defendant argued that because the victim was unconscious when the sexual assault occurred, he could not be found to have \u201ccompelled\u201d the victim to engage in sexual intercourse. We stated that it would be \u201cbizarre ... to impose a lesser degree of responsibility for sexual assault upon a person, who, by his own hand, renders the victim physically helpless . . . .\u201d Id., 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Today we apply the logic of <em>Rodgers </em>to the present case. It would be strange indeed if the penalty under our law would be less severe if the defendant sexually assaulted the victim and in so doing caused her death than it would be if he sexually assaulted the victim and did not cause her death. That would be the same bizarre result we noted in <em>Rodgers, </em>and would encourage assailants to kill their victims when committing a sexual assault. Sexual assault in the fourth degree occurs when an assailant commits a sexual assault on a dead body, but the assailant is not involved in causing the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>death. When, however, the assailant kills the victim in order to commit a sexual assault, he has committed sexual assault in the first degree. The trial judge properly instructed the jury on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the third count of the indictment, the murder charge, because murder is a lesser included offense of the capital felony charge. The state concedes that murder is a lesser included offense of capital felony under these circumstances, but opposes the defendant\u2019s claim that the motion for acquittal on that charge should have been granted. The state argues that the trial court erred when it rendered judgment for both the greater offense and the lesser included offense, after guilty verdicts on both counts were returned by the jury. We agree. The trial court erred when it rendered a judgment on the murder charge and that judgment should be set aside. There is no basis to support a motion for acquittal on this charge as the defendant was found guilty of murder by the jury, although he may not be punished for both that crime and for capital felony. See <em>Ball </em>v. <em>United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 865, 105 S. Ct. 1668, 84 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">There is error in part, the judgment of conviction with regard to the third count of the indictment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-14\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54b. capital felony.

And the only way you continue with this charge is if you find the defendant guilty of murder as to the third count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cIf you find him guilty as to a lesser included charge of manslaughter, it does not fulfill the first element, and you need go no further with this count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cIf, on the other hand, you find the defendant guilty of murder, you must consider the second count. As to the second count, sexual assault in the first degree is set out in the statute as follows: \u2018A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cNow, actually, when you consider that statute, you can break it down into the two elements or parts: first, that there must be sexual intercourse by the defendant with the victim, and it must have been compelled by the use of force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201cNow, the statute does define a person, for the purposes of this statute, as a human being. And as to the first part of sexual assault in the first degree, sexual intercourse includes its ordinary meaning, which is the penetration of the female vagina by the male penis. Any penetration, no matter how slight, is sufficient under the statute, and there is no need for the emission of semen from the male organ. This statute only applies where the defendant and the victim are not married to one another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">\u201cNow, as to that part of it, you have had testimony of both [the victim\u2019s husband] and Miss Alfonsi, that the apartment was occupied by [the victim\u2019s husband] and his wife, the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">\u201cIn this connection, the touching of the private parts would not be sufficient, such as the touching of the breast or the pubic area, because the element of the statute is sexual intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201cAs to the second element, it must have been compelled by the use of force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">\u201cNow, \u2018use of force\u2019 is defined in the statute as the use of a dangerous instrument or the use of actual physical force or violence or superior strength against the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cAnd \u2018dangerous instrument\u2019 is defined as any instrument, article or substance which, under the circumstances in which it is used or attempted to be used, is capable of causing death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201cNow, the Court will instruct you that if the instrument used to cause the injury, which Dr. Shah testified caused the death, was the brick, then it was a dangerous instrument, if you credit her opinion that its use in each of the blows to the head of [the victim] could have caused unconsciousness or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cNow, there would not be force used to compel if the penetration or intercourse was made on an unconscious or helpless body or a dead body. So, if the intercourse, if there was intercourse that you found, or penetration of the vagina, and you found that it was done after the fact, in other words, where the defendant or the person coming upon the helpless body or dead body, it does not fall within sexual assault in the first degree because the sexual intercourse must have been compelled by force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cNow, in this connection, however, if the person who is having the sexual intercourse or penetration has compelled it by force, even though the person has become unconscious or dead, then it is sexual assault in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cNow, the phrase \u2018in the course of the commission\u2019 is a time limitation and means conduct occurring in an attempt to commit, during the commission or in the immediate flight after the attempt or the commission of the .offense. The immediate killing of said person so as to eliminate a witness to the crime or to avoid detention is also \u2018in the course of commission.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cIn this connection, an assault to overcome her resistance to sexual assault, without the intention to cause her death, is not enough, or if the offender caused her death prior to having an intent to sexually assault her, would not be sufficient. The intent to cause her death must occur some time during the attempt or commission of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201cIt is not necessary, however, that the sexual intercourse be completed. It is sufficient if some act, such as the use of force, is done and the sur-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>rounding circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the force was used with the intent to have sexual intercourse with [the victim].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\u201cUnder such circumstances, it then would not be of a consequence if the sexual intercourse was engaged in while she was unconscious or dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201cSo, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has proved each of the following elements, first, that the defendant committed the murder of [the victim], and, second, it was done in the course of sexual assault in the first degree, then you must find him guilty of capital felony murder, the first count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201cOn the other hand, if you find that the State has failed to prove either one of these elements to you beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find him not guilty as to the first count.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
