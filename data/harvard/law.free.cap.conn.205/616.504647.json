We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: In the early evening of September 4,1982, in the city of Hartford, the defendant along with Mishelle Reddick and Leroy Slater, had been riding in an automobile driven by John Betts. The defendant borrowed a gun from Slater. The defendant and Reddick were dropped off on Barbour Street at about 9 p.m. The defendant was purportedly looking either to buy some cocaine or to find someone who had sold him some \u201cbad dope.\u201d At about the same time the victim and his girlfriend, Deborah Atkins, were walking along Barbour Street. As the two couples approached each other the victim began flashing a baggie containing silver packets and money. The defendant took the gun he had borrowed from Slater out from under his coat and put it to the victim\u2019s left temple and said something, perhaps \u201cfreeze\u201d or \u201chands-up.\u201d The defendant searched the victim, and ordered Reddick to search Atkins. The gun went off, the victim fell to the ground and the defendant searched his pockets. He again ordered Reddick to search Atkins. Nothing was taken from Atkins during either search. The defendant then asked Atkins if she had ever seen him before, and when she said she had not, he and Reddick ran away. Atkins testified that she had not seen the defendant take anything from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Hartford police officers Tracey Williams and Frank Rudowitz were standing on Barbour Street about seventy-five yards from the scene when they heard a sound \u201clike a firecracker.\u201d As they approached the location, they saw two people leaving the scene running westward across Barbour Street. One was a tall black male, and the other was \u201cshorter\u201d and \u201cran like a woman.\u201d At the scene the officers found a black male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>in his twenties lying on the ground with blood spurting from his cheek. As the victim was being placed upon the ambulance stretcher, his right hand fell open, revealing a torn plastic baggie containing silver packets. Williams and Atkins accompanied the victim to the emergency room where he later died. At the hospital, Williams was given the victim\u2019s personal belongings\u2014coins totaling $1.09, an identification card and some personal papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Pursuant to a warrant, the defendant was arrested on September 8, 1982, in his sister\u2019s apartment in Springfield, Masachusetts. On October 4, 1982, the defendant was indicted by a grand jury on one count each of the crimes of felony murder, in violation of General statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c, 53a-54a (c), and murder, in violation of General Statutes 53a-54a. The felony murder charge was based upon the predicate crimes of robbery or attempted robbery. The defendant was convicted as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury violated his constitutional rights by relieving the state of its burden of proving an essential element of the offense of attempted robbery. Although the defendant took no exception to the instruction he now challenges, we will review his claim under the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), because it \u201cimplicates the fundamental constitutional right that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 489-90, 522 A.2d 249 (1981); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 361, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>199 Conn. 30, 34, 505 A.2d 699 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 299-300 n.9, 503 A.2d 146 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s constitutional attack is that the trial court\u2019s language regarding attempted robbery allowed the jury to dispense with the inquiry whether conduct that could be held to be a substantial step under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2), is also strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose. The defendant attacks the following language in the court\u2019s instruction: \u201cExamples of conduct <em>which are strongly corroborative </em>of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose in a substantial step are . . . possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime . . . which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute, however, reads as follows: \u201cConduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) <em>unless it is strongly corroborative </em>of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose. Without negating the sufficiency of other conduct, <em>the following, if strongly corroborative </em>of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (b). Because the state concedes that this instruction was technically inaccurate, we need only address whether the error was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">At the outset, we note that in examining the jury charge, we \u201c \u2018must review the instructions as a whole . . . [and that] \u201cindividual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>205 Conn. 298, 314-15, 533 A.2d 212 (1987) \u201c \u2018A phrase having a different meaning when culled from the charge will not be regarded as error when there is no \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the jury were misled.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 532, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975); <em>Magnon </em>v. <em>Glickman, </em>185 Conn. 234, 247, 440 A.2d 909 (1981).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>supra, 316. After reviewing the entire charge, we are convinced that the jury was adequately instructed on the elements of attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Although the use of the questioned language was erroneous, the trial court clearly explained the corroboration principle of attempted robbery both before and after the misstatement. Immediately following the challenged statements, the trial court instructed the jury that possession of materials, such as a gun, could constitute a substantial step \u201cif you were to find that that is what the defendant did for the purpose of engaging in this crime.\u201d We find that the jury instructions \u201c \u2018 \u201c[gave] the jurors a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and [afforded] them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Furthermore, the likelihood that the jurors misper-ceived the instructions was attenuated by the strength of the state\u2019s case. The facts, which are set forth in greater detail above, indicate that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s guilt of the predicate offense of attempted robbery: The defendant acquired a gun less than one hour before the shooting. Upon encountering the victim, the defendant held the gun to the victim\u2019s head and fired the gun. Immediately thereafter the defendant searched the victim\u2019s pockets and ordered his companion to search the victim\u2019s girlfriend. Because these acts, in and of themselves, are strongly corroborative of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose, it is not reasonably possible that the instruction complained of could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court\u2019s instructions on criminal intent unconstitutionally invaded the province of the jury and relieved the state of its burden of proving that element beyond a reasonable doubt. Again, the defendant did not except to this portion of the charge at trial. As this portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>charge implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial, it is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, as discussed above. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The defendant claims that a portion of the charge regarding the inferences that may be drawn by the jury with respect to the evidence before them was improper, and objects to language such as the jury had a \u201cduty to draw those inferences ... if they are reasonable and logical inferences.\u201d He argues that the use of the words \u201creasonable and logical\u201d permitted the jury to find intent by a standard lower than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We first note that the trial court did not at any time instruct the jury on a standard of proof less than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Furthermore, following the challenged phrase, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that \u201cin order for the accused to be found guilty of the charge of murder, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had an intent to cause the death of [the victim]. If you do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had that intent, then he is not guilty of murder.\u201d We have recently held that \u201c[i]n the course of a charge on drawing inferences ... a court may correctly instruct a jury that it has the prerogative to draw inferences that are \u2018reasonable and logical.\u2019 Such an instruction, at least when qualified ... by a caveat that both the ultimate inference of guilt and the facts essential to that inference must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, does not dilute the constitutional standard of proof in a criminal case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 773-74, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>205 Conn. 352, 533 A.2d 857 (1987). We find that the charge properly instructed the jury regarding the standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The defendant next argues that this portion of the jury charge was erroneous because it directed the jury to find intent on the basis of a conclusive presumption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The defendant objects to portions of the charge in which the following language was used: \u201c[I]f there are inferences that you can draw from those facts to determine intention, you are entitled and it is your duty to draw those inferences . . . .\u201d Despite the language regarding the jury\u2019s duty to draw inferences, we find that when the charge is read as a whole, the instructions made clear to the jury that it was their prerogative to draw inferences, but that they were not required to do so. We note that similar language was recently upheld in <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra, where the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018you are asked to draw whatever inference or conclusion is reasonable and logical . . . . If it is reasonable and logical, you should draw it, but you don\u2019t have to.\u2019 \u201d Id., 772. In this charge, the trial judge instructed the jury that it \u201cshould draw all fair and reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances\u201d and that it \u201cmay draw any reasonable inference from the facts proven.\u201d This language clearly indicates that the jury had the option to draw inferences from the defendant\u2019s conduct, but that it was not required to so do.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-18\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54c. felony murder.
