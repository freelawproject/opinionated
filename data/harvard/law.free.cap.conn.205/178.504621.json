Those pertinent to this inquiry are as follows: On December 5, 1983, James M. DelGreco sustained serious injuries, when his automobile was struck by one being driven by Ronald J. Fields, Jr. DelGreco died as a result of his injuries on July 7, 1984. Herman DelGreco, the administrator of James DelGreco\u2019s estate, pursued claims against Fields and, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 30-102, the Dram Shop Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against David\u2019s Restaurant. The estate was paid the $20,000 limit under Fields\u2019 motor vehicle liability policy by the Allstate Insurance Company. It also received the $20,000 policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>limit under David\u2019s Restaurant\u2019s dram shop policy, which had been issued by the Great American Insurance Company. It was stipulated that the damages to the estate were in excess of $100,000. Thereafter, the defendant administrator made a claim for the underin-sured motorist benefits provided by an automobile insurance policy issued to the defendant\u2019s decedent by American Universal Insurance Company. That policy provided underinsured motorist benefits in the amount of $40,000 per accident and $5000 in basic reparations benefits. American Universal paid $2335.80 in basic reparations benefits but refused to pay any underin-sured motorist benefits claiming that it was entitled, under the policy and Connecticut law, to a setoff, not only of the $20,000 paid by Allstate under Fields' automobile policy and $2335.80 in basic reparations benefits it had paid, but also, of the $20,000 paid to the estate under the dram shop policy issued to David\u2019s Restaurant. The parties stipulated that the plaintiff is entitled to a credit for the $20,000 paid by Allstate on Fields\u2019 policy and for the $2335.80 the plaintiff paid in basic reparations benefits. Therefore the entitlement to $17,664.20 of the $40,000 underinsured motorist benefits remains at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the General Statutes, and the provisions of the automobile policy issued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the defendant\u2019s decedent, the parties submitted the following issue to the panel of arbitrators: Whether, \u201cunder the policy language and Connecticut law, the American Universal Insurance Company is entitled to an additional [setoff] in the amount of $20,000 which was paid on behalf of the dram shop.\u201d The arbitration panel, in a memorandum of decision dated July 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>1986, held that the setoff provisions of \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1) and the insurance regulations applied only to payments made by virtue of automobile bodily injury policies, and also that the dram shop payment was not made by or on behalf of \u201cany person responsible for the injury\u201d as required by \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The panel, therefore, ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>dered an award in favor of the defendant, holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to a setoff for the dram shop payment of $20,000 made to the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Thereafter, in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed an application to vacate the arbitration award in the Superior Court, arguing that the panel exceeded its powers and/or imperfectly executed them. The defendant moved, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417, for an order confirming the arbitration award. The trial court reviewed the stipulated facts and the law, and after an \u201cindependent construction of the law,\u201d held that the arbitration panel\u2019s interpretation of the applicable law and its conclusions were \u201clegally and logically correct\u201d and confirmed the award. The plaintiff took a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>appeal to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, the appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The dispositive questions raised by this appeal are: (1) What is the proper scope of judicial review of a compulsory arbitration decision and award; and (2) did the arbitration panel and the trial court err in holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to a setoff for dram shop payments under the underinsured coverage provisions of the general statutes and the insurance regulations?</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We are first called upon to decide the proper standard of judicial review of a compulsory arbitration award. The trial court, in interpreting dictum in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 509 A.2d 467 (1986), determined that: <em>\u201cWilson </em>requires the reviewing court to consider these elements [the applicable statutes, insurance regulations and the contract of insurance] to determine whether the panel\u2019s interpretation or conclusions of the law are <em>legally </em>and <em>logically </em>correct.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then conducted an independent review and concluded that the arbitration panel\u2019s decision was correct and confirmed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In <em>Wilson, </em>this court raised doubts as to the propriety of applying the standard of judicial review applicable to voluntary arbitration proceedings to a compulsory arbitration proceeding under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c. We specifically held that \u201c[t]he issue of the appropriate scope of judicial review of a compulsory arbitration award is not . . . properly raised by this appeal but must await the result of the arbitration that has been ordered.\u201d Id., 630. Additionally, we noted that voluntary and compulsory arbitrations are fundamentally different; id., 629; and that some states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>have recognized the need to broaden the scope of judicial review when arbitration is mandated by statute. Id., 629-30. We did not, however, determine the extent of judicial review of compulsory arbitration awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Ordinarily, arbitration is a creature of contract whereby the parties themselves, by agreement, define the powers of the arbitrators. <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Limited Partnership No, 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>195 Conn. 266, 269, 487 A.2d 553 (1985); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>189 Conn. 16, 20, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983); <em>Malecki </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>181 Conn. 211, 212-13, 435 A.2d 13 (1980); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Waterbury Police Union, </em>176 Conn. 401, 403, 407 A.2d 1013 (1979); <em>Ramos Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Construction Co., </em>174 Conn, 583, 587, 392 A.2d 461 (1978). Parties who have contracted to arbitrate certain matters have no duty to arbitrate other matters which they have not agreed to arbitrate. Nor can the courts, absent a statute, compel the parties to arbitrate those other matters. See <em>Security Ins. Co. of Hartford </em>v. <em>DeLaurentis, </em>202 Conn. 178,182-83, 520 A.2d 202 (1987); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra, 622; <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>183 Conn. 481, 488, 439 A.2d 416 (1981); <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 274, 231 A.2d 531 (1967). Where the parties have voluntarily and contractually agreed to submit to arbitration and have delineated the powers of the arbitrator through their submission, then the scope of judicial review of the award is limited by the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement and by the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418. See <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Protection, </em>190 Conn. 14,18,458 A.2d 685 (1983); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 21; <em>Bic Pen Corporation </em>v. <em>Local No. m, </em>183 Conn. 579,583,440 A.2d 774 (1981); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Waterbury Police Union, </em>supra, 403,407; <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brookman, </em>1 Conn. App. 219,221-22,470 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 801, 473 A.2d 1226 (1984). Thus, in determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his authority or improperly executed the same under \u00a7 52-418 (a), the courts need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra, 626-27; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>supra, 271; <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 340, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703,105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985); <em>Waterbury Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>189 Conn. 560, 563, 457 A.2d 310 (1983); <em>Bic Pen Corporation </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>supra, 584; <em>Malecki </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>supra, 213; <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Waterbury Police Union, </em>supra, 404; <em>Ramos Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Construction Co., </em>supra, 587-88, 590; <em>Board of Educations. Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 291, 377 A.2d 323 (1977). Under an unrestricted submission, the arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra, 626-27; <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Protection, </em>supra, 18-19; <em>Carrolls. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 19; <em>Bridgeport v. Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>183 Conn. 102, 105-106, 438 A.2d 1171 (1981); <em>Milford Employees Assn. s. Milford, </em>179 Conn. 678, 683, 427 A.2d 859 (1980); <em>Waterbury v. Waterbury Police Union, </em>supra; <em>Meyers s. Lakeridge Development Co., </em>173 Conn. 133, 135, 376 A.2d 1105 (1977); <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Brookman, </em>supra, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Such a limited scope of judicial review is warranted given the fact that the parties voluntarily bargained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>for the decision of the arbitrator and, as such, the parties are presumed to have assumed the risks of and waived objections to that decision. See <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>supra, 107-108; <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>Trumbull Police Local 1745, </em>1 Conn. App. 207, 213,470 A.2d 1219 (1984). It is clear that a party cannot object to an award which accomplishes precisely what the arbitrators were authorized to do merely because that party dislikes the results. See <em>New Britain </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Mediation and Arbitration, </em>178 Conn. 557, 563, 424 A.2d 263 (1979); <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>Trumbull Police Local 1745, </em>supra. Thus, we have previously held that the parties should be bound by a decision that they contracted and bargained for, even if it is regarded as unwise or wrong on the merits. See <em>Local 453, International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>314 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 949, 83 S. Ct. 1680, 10 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1963); <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>supra, 107; <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>Trumbull Police Local 1745, </em>supra, 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Such is not the case with statutorily mandated or compulsory arbitration. \u201cThe simple and ineradicable fact is that voluntary arbitration and compulsory arbitration are fundamentally different if only because one may, under our system, consent to almost any restriction upon or deprivation of right, but similar restrictions or deprivations, if compelled by government, must accord with procedural and substantive due process.\u201d <em>Mount St. Mary\u2019s Hospital </em>v. <em>Catherwood, </em>26 N.Y.2d 493, 500, 260 N.E.2d 508, 311 N.Y.S.2d 863 (1970); see also <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 637-38, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985); <em>Dearborn Fire Fighters Union, Local No. 412 </em>v. <em>Dearborn, </em>394 Mich. 229, 264, 231 N.W.2d 226 (1975); <em>Agri-Link Corporation </em>v. <em>Schmitz, </em>272 Or. 654, 670, 538 P.2d 924 (1975). \u201cParties to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>contract calling for statutory arbitration are <em>not free to agree, </em>implicitly or explicitly, that their dispute will be resolved in disregard of controlling principles of constitutional, statutory, or judge-made law, and expect the courts to approve and enforce the result.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>416 Mich. 407, 433, 331 N.W.2d 418 (1982). In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra, 630, this court acknowledged that the complete insulation of statutorily mandated arbitration awards from judicial review for errors of law creates the anomaly that, without the consent of the parties, arbitrators are empowered to disregard the law in deciding issues affecting substantial rights. Therefore, we held that a higher level of judicial review of an arbitration award is warranted where the arbitration is statutorily mandated. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The degree of judicial review warranted by a compulsory arbitration award has been addressed in other jurisdictions against the background of a variety of constitutional challenges to the statutory compulsory arbitration scheme. These jurisdictions have generally held that compulsory arbitration statutes that effectively close the courts to the litigants by compelling them to resort to arbitrators for a final and binding determination are void as against public policy and are unconstitutional. See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Ugalde, </em>61 Ariz. 221, 224, 147 P.2d 490 (1944); <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 288-90, 385 A.2d 57, appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 805, 99 S.

Jur. 2d 526, Arbitration and Award \u00a7 9; see annot., 55 A.L.R.2d 440-41, \u00a7 5. These compulsory arbitration statutes have been held uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>stitutional in that: (1) they deprive one of his property and liberty of contract without due process of the law; <em>see Dorchy </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>264 U.S. 286, 288, 44 S. Ct. 323, 68 L. Ed. 686 (1924); <em>Wolff Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Court of Industrial Relations, </em>262 U.S. 522, 544, 43 S. Ct. 630, 67 L.

Jur. 2d, supra; and (3) they result in the unconstitutional delegation of legislative or judicial power in violation of state constitutional separation of powers provisions. See <em>Spillman </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>179 So. 2d 454, 455 (La. App. 1965); <em>Macaluso </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>171 So. 2d 755, 758 (La.

Jur. 2d, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Compulsory arbitration, per se, however, is not automatically invalid so long as fair procedures are provided by the legislature and ultimate judicial review is available. <em>Republic Industries </em>v. <em>Teamsters Joint Council, </em>718 F.2d 628, 641 (4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1259,104 S. Ct. 3553, 82 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1984). Courts throughout the United States have uniformly upheld compulsory arbitration statutory schemes as against the constitutional challenges previously mentioned where <em>due novo judicial review </em>of the arbitrator\u2019s award is available to either party.

There is no requirement that a verbatim record be made. . . no formal requirements of procedure and practice . . . and no findings of fact or conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of law are required.\u201d <em>Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>supra, 428; see also 6 C.J.S. 304-305, Arbitration \u00a7 85. Unless required by the submission, the decision of the arbitrator need contain no more than the actual decision, and need not make reference to the specific claims of the parties. An explanation of the means by which he reached the award is not needed, and, in fact, has been held to be superfluous. <em>See Bic Pen Corporation v. Local No. 134, </em>supra, 589; <em>Malecki </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>supra, 213-14; <em>Ramos Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Construction Co., </em>supra, 589; <em>Gary Excavating Co. </em>v. <em>North Haven, </em>160 Conn. 411, 414, 279 A.2d 543 (1971). Thus, a standard of judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings which is limited to the record, and under which the reviewing court may determine only whether the award conforms to the submission, would in most cases be equivalent to no review at all and would be constitutionally suspect. Something more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Since, in this case, there was a stipulation of facts, it is only necessary for its resolution that we articulate the standard of review necessary with regard to determining questions of law. Accordingly, we hold that, where judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings required by \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) is undertaken under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418, the reviewing court must conduct a de novo review of the interpretation and application of the law by the arbitrators. The court is not bound by the limitations contractually placed on the extent of its review as in voluntary arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court and the arbitration panel erred, as a matter of law, in deciding that the plaintiff is not entitled to set off the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>due the defendant, pursuant to his decedent\u2019s underin-sured motorist policy, by the amount which was paid to the defendant on behalf of the dram shop, David\u2019s Restaurant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In addressing this claim, we must consider the language of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1) and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Section 38-175c (b) (1) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn insurance company shall be obligated to make payment to its insured up to the limits of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage <em>after the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident </em>have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Section \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe limit of the insurer\u2019s liability may not be less than the applicable limits for bodily injury liability specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112 of the General Statutes, except that the policy may provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that damages have been (1) <em>paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff relies mainly on the language of the regulation, and the public policy behind uninsured motorist coverage, to support its contention that it is entitled to set off the dram shop payment because the dram shop was \u201cresponsible for the injury\u201d to the insured. In addition, it claims that the language, \u201call bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident,\u201d which is contained in \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1), is unqualified, and thus applies to any kind of insurance, including dram shop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>policies. In response, the defendant argues that these provisions apply only to <em>automobile </em>liability policies applicable at the time of the accident and to persons and/or organizations that are operators of the automobiles. The trial court agreed with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and we agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">It is clear that, when the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 421, 528 A.2d 811 (1987); <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54-55, 523 A.2d 477 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987). If, however, the language is unclear, as it is with \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1), we must ascertain the intent of the legislature by examining the language of the statute, its legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 422; <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). In addition, the statute must be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation. <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 14, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1), as amended by Public Acts 1979, No. 79-235, and which contains the subsection at issue in this case, expressly provides \u201c[e]very such policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage, in accordance with such [insurance] regulations, with limits for bodily injury or death not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for the protection of persons insured thereunder <em>who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) The 1979 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ment added subsection (b) (1), quoted earlier in this opinion, and (2), which provides: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 means <em>a motor vehicle with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident </em>is less than the applicable limits of liability under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy against which claim is made under subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In deciding whether a dram shop policy should be considered as a \u201cbodily injury liability bond or insurance policy\u201d for purposes of this statute, we agree with the plaintiff that the language is not crystal clear. Examining the statutory scheme in its entirety does, however, offer guidance on this issue. Section 38-175c (a) (1) refers to the mandatory minimum provisions for <em>automobile </em>liability policies as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-112. <em>Citrano </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 248,253, 368 A.2d 54 (1976); cf. <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 55-59. In addition, as the defendant points out, the bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies described in subsection (b) (2) are those which cover the tortfeasor\u2019s motor vehicle. That subsection mandates that, in determining whether a motor vehicle is \u201cunderinsured\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 38-175c, the aggregate of the limits of all such bonds and policies <em>on the tortfeasor\u2019s motor vehicle </em>is compared against the amount of uninsured motorist coverage of the insured. If the aggregate is less than the limits of liability in the uninsured motorist portion of the insured\u2019s policy, then the underinsurance coverage is activated. Therefore, it seems logical and rational to construe the reference to \u201cbodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies\u201d in subsections (a) and (b) (2) as referring only to automobile policies. Although the language of subsection (b) (1) does not specifically limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the phrase \u201call bodily injury bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident\u201d to the tort-feasor\u2019s motor vehicle as does subsection (b) (2), when it is read together with the entire statute, in order for the legislation to be consistent, it must also be interpreted as referring to any <em>automobile policy </em>issued to the tortfeaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">A review of the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 38-175c supports this interpretation. In commenting on Public Acts 1979, No. 79-235, Representative Silvio Mastrianni explained that \u201c[a]n uninsured vehicle is generally defined <em>as a vehicle to which no bodily injury bond </em>or <em>policy </em>applies at the time of the accident. . . . Mr. Speaker, this bill requires coverage be provided against the underinsured motorist. It also requires [the] insurance company of an innocent driver to pay up to the full amount of the uninsured motorist coverage when the <em>at fault driver\u2019s insurance </em>has been exhausted and a deficiency remains.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1979 Sess., p. 5341. Senator James J. Murphy, Jr., in remarking on the same bill, stated: \u201c[w]hat this bill does is require that hereafter, when one has purchased uninsured motorist coverage, that if that coverage exceeds any insurance coverage which a responsible party has in causing injuries, that <em>mice the liability insurance of the so-called responsible or negligent party has been exhausted, </em>if there is additional coverage under one\u2019s uninsured motorist\u2019s plan, then payment under that program would be <em>triggered </em>and allow for the greater recovery of the insured . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 22 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1979 Sess., p. 1354.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These comments indicate a legislative intent that under-insured motorist coverage is triggered when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>tortfeasor\u2019s <em>automobile </em>liability coverage is exhausted. A dram shop policy is not classified as automobile coverage. Rather, it is designed to cover risks arising out of the sale of intoxicating liquors. See <em>London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Duryea, </em>143 Conn. 53, 58-59, 119 A.2d 325 (1955); <em>Lincoln Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Vic &amp; Mario\u2019s, Inc., </em>62 Ill. App. 2d 262, 265-66, 210 N.E.2d 329 (1965); 13A G. Couch, Insurance (2d Ed.) \u00a7 48:186. We conclude, therefore, that a dram shop policy was not intended to be considered as \u201cbodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The plaintiff argues that, despite this conclusion, nothing in \u00a7 38-175c specifically addresses the issue of what the insurer may or may not setoff against its liability under the authority of the insurance regulations. We agree. Section 38-175a grants the insurance commissioner the authority to enact regulations governing uninsured/underinsured coverage. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 472-73, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976); <em>Pecker </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>171 Conn. 443, 448-49, 370 A.2d 1006 (1976). The regulations, however, must carry into effect the purpose and intent of the statute pursuant to which they are enacted. See <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospital &amp; Health Care, </em>177 Conn. 356, 365, 417 A.2d 358 (1979); <em>Citrano </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 248, 255, 368 A.2d 54 (1976); <em>Berlinski </em>v. <em>Ovellette, </em>164 Conn. 482, 492, 325 A.2d 239 (1973). We also note that a limitation of liability on uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage must be construed most strongly against the insurer. 12A G. Couch, supra, \u00a7 45:652; see also <em>Madison County Mutual Auto Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Goodpasture, </em>130 Ill. App. 2d 946, 267 N.E.2d 31, aff\u2019d, 49 Ill. 2d 555, 276 N.E.2d 289 (1971). The regulatory language that the plaintiff relies on must be read, therefore, in light of this principle as well as the language and intent of \u00a7 38-175c.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The plaintiff argues that Connecticut Insurance Regulation \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) allows for setoffs of monies received pursuant to a dram shop policy. As mentioned previously, the regulation states that an insurance \u201cpolicy may provide for the reduction of the insurer\u2019s liability to the extent that damages have been (1) paid by or on behalf of <em>any person responsible for the injury. . . . </em>\u201d Both the arbitration panel and the trial court concluded that the regulation, when read in conjunction with the language and intent of \u00a7 38-175c, relates only to setoffs of amounts received from other automobile liability policies of those \u201cresponsible for the injury.\u201d We agree. To interpret the regulation otherwise would defeat the remedial purpose of underinsured motorist coverage to protect and make whole a person injured at the hands of an uninsured/underinsured <em>motorist. Harvey </em>v. <em>Traveler\u2019s Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); <em>Infante </em>v. <em>Texas Farmers Ins. Co., </em>640 S.W.2d 321, 323 (Tex. App. 1982); see 12A G. Couch, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 8:6 (e), 45:624, and cases cited therein; 2 A. Widiss, Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance (1987) \u00a7 31.4 (underinsured motorist coverage provides protection for the risk that the damages sustained by insureds will not be adequately indemnified by the liability coverage carried by a <em>negligent insured </em>motorist).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>manifestly true in this situation where the sums due the decedent\u2019s estate, even if all were to be collected, are far short of the damages suffered. As the defendant argues, \u201can insurer may not, by contract, reduce its liability for such uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage except as \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies <em>expressly </em>authorizes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>201 Conn. 478, 483, 518 A.2d 373 (1986); see 2 A. Widiss, supra, \u00a7 35.2. Clearly, \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) does not expressly authorize a deduction for payments received pursuant to a dram shop policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In addition, we are not persuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s argument that, under General Statutes \u00a7 30-102, a payment by a dram shop is by one \u201cresponsible for the injury\u201d as is required by the regulation in order to invoke the setoff. We stated in <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 341, 348-49, 493 A.2d 184 (1985), that \u201c[\u00a7 30-102] establishes a cause of action that did not exist at common law. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>144 Conn. 241, 249, 129 A.2d 606, appeal dismissed, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S. Ct. 36, 2 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1957). It creates a new tort liability which is based upon a specified course of conduct and the consequences of such conduct. <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>142 Conn. 452, 456,115 A.2d 337 (1955). The delict defined by \u00a7 30-102 is not the sale of liquor to create a condition of intoxication. It is rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the sale of liquor to one who is already intoxicated. <em>No carnal relation between the sale and the injury is required. London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co. </em>v. Duryea, [supra, 59]. To recover under the statute, a plaintiff must bring himself squarely within its provisions. Id., 57. In each case, therefore, the trier must decide as a question of fact: whether there was (1) a sale of intoxicating liquor (2) to an intoxicated person (3) who, in consequence of such intoxication, causes injury to the person or property of another.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Viewed from this perspective, we cannot conclude that a payment made pursuant to a dram shop policy is made by a person \u201cresponsible for the injury.\u201d Furthermore, such a payment is not made \u201con behalf of any person responsible for the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, a dram shop payment is made on behalf of a liquor establishment which serves alcohol to an intoxicated person who thereafter causes injury to a third party. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra; 12A G. Couch, supra, \u00a7 48:186.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We hold therefore that the trial court was correct in finding that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies do not allow an insurer to reduce its liability for underinsured motorist coverage by an amount of money received by the insured pursuant to a dram shop policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is no error.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In this opinion Healey, Santaniello and Glass, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\"> The decision of the arbitration panel was two to one in favor of the defendant.

Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 474, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976), also argues that the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage is simply to ensure a \u201cminimum\u201d level of protection, and that where the \u201cinjured party receives more than the minimum level of protection from one of those responsible for the injuries, the statutory purpose is satisfied and no recourse to the uninsured motorist coverages is warranted.\u201d Even if we were to agree that the dram shop is \u201cresponsible\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>for the injuries, we must note that there are basic differences between the policies of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. See 2 A. Widiss, Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance (1987) \u00a7 31.4. The statutory change which provided for underinsured coverage was a legislative response to both <em>the Roy case </em>and <em>Simonette </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 466,338 A.2d 453 (1973), and it was introduced to provide more than the minimum protection. See <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249-52, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 390-97, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1979 Sess., pp. 81-82, remarks of Joseph C. Mike, commissioner on insurance. We must therefore keep this broader policy in mind in interpreting the regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> We recognize that the language of the setoff contained in the insurance contract is broader than that of the regulation. See footnote 7, supra. We indicated in <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 399, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982), however, that any provision of a private contract of insurance which conflicts with the statutes or regulations must give way to the latter. See General Statutes \u00a7 38-175d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> Though the trial court did not use the words \u201cde novo review\u201d in reference to the standard of review it applied, its \u201cindependent construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ed the law\u201d was its functional equivalent.

I agree with part I of the opinion, which establishes a de novo standard for review of questions of law arising in a compulsory arbitration proceeding. I disagree with part II, however, which holds that only motor vehicle liability policies are included within the phrase \u201call bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident,\u201d which is used to establish the prescribed limits for \u201cuninsured motorist coverage\u201d in subsection (b) (1) of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c and thus to define the term \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d in subsection (b) (2) of \u00a7 38-175c. The plain intent of this reference to \u201call\u201d bodily injury liability policies was that every available source of liability insurance coverage for an accident should be considered before resorting to the uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, in pursuance of the legislative scheme to make such coverage available at the lowest possible cost. See <em>Bobeck </em>v. <em>Public Service Mutual Ins. Co., </em>38 Conn. Sup. 318, 323, 445 A.2d 602 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In reaching the conclusion that only motor vehicle liability policies were intended to be considered in determining whether a motor vehicle is \u201cunderinsured,\u201d the opinion necessarily overturns the regulation of the commissioner of insurance; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-175a-6; authorizing the reduction of uninsured motorist coverage, and accordingly underinsured coverage, by amounts that have been \u201cpaid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury.\u201d That regulation, adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the directive of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175a (a) for regulations \u201cwith respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability policies,\u201d is a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 38-175c and is wholly consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ent with the reference to \u201call bodily injury liability policies applicable at the time of the accident\u201d contained in subsection (b) (1) and (2) thereof. Such a regulation, issued after proper hearings and consultations \u201cwith insurers licensed to write automobile liability insurance in this state and other interested parties\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 38-175a (b), ought not to be set aside unless it is clearly in conflict with the statutes. In concluding that such a conflict exists, the opinion relies primarily upon some ambiguous legislative history to narrow the scope of the reference in \u00a7 38-175c (b) (2) to \u201call\u201d bodily injury liability policies applicable to the accident. These inconclusive remarks of two legislators, which are only remotely related to the question before us, should not be accorded such significance as to change the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Accordingly, I dissent from part II of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
