J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP9\">The sole issue in this case is whether a creditor may garnish, as a debt owed to the underlying debtor, the proceeds of bank accounts for which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>prior to the garnishment, the debtor had received teller\u2019s checks made payable to the order of a third person. The plaintiff, the Hospital of Saint Raphael, brought a civil action against Isabel Gonzales, in conjunction with which it obtained a prejudgment order of garnishment. The garnishee, the New Haven Savings Bank, was duly served in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-329.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After obtaining a judgment against Gonzales in the amount of $28,409.24, the plaintiff demanded payment from the defendant. When the defendant refused to pay, the plaintiff brought this action of scire facias pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-381.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff then filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The defendant appeals from this judgment. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed. Isabel Gonzales had two accounts with the defendant bank, a passbook savings account and a certificate of deposit. On September 2, 1981, Gonzales closed these accounts and received in exchange two teller\u2019s checks drawn by the defendant on the Union Trust Company. These checks, one for $21,000 and one for $10,000, were made payable to the order of Isabel Rodriquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The following day, September 3,1981, notice of garnishment was served on the defendant. The garnishment directed the sheriff to attach, to the value of $30,000, the goods or estate of Isabel Gonzales, a/k/a Isabel Gonzalez, a/k/a Maria Gonzales, a/k/a Maria Gonzalez. The writ made no mention of anyone named Rodriquez. The checks were subsequently deposited for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>payment in a bank in Puerto Rico and were thereafter presented to and paid by the Union Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">After the action against Gonzales had been reduced to judgment in 1986, the plaintiff filed its complaint in scire facias, alleging that the defendant was obligated to pay because, at the time it was given notice of the writ of garnishment, it was indebted to Isabel Gonzales.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint contained no allegation concerning Rodriquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment. In its affidavit in support of this motion, the plaintiff for the first time included a \u201ccontention that . . . Isabel Rodriquez and Isabel Gonzales . . . are one and the same person.\u201d This contention was based upon a reference to Gonzales\u2019 driver\u2019s license which was used for the purpose of identification when the teller\u2019s checks were deposited for payment in Puerto Rico. The defendant\u2019s counter affidavit denied that it knew or should have known, at the time of the garnishment, that Gonzales and Rodriquez were the same person. The defendant\u2019s affidavit noted that it would not have seen any endorsement on the teller\u2019s checks until after the checks had been paid by the drawee bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment without making a finding concerning the identity of Rodriquez. Even if the teller\u2019s checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>had been issued to a stranger, the court concluded, the defendant had failed to take the proper action with respect to the garnishment of the debt. The court determined that, under our case law, the proceeds of the debt owed to Gonzales were still deemed to be \u201cin the hands of [the] garnishee\u201d despite the issuance of the teller\u2019s checks in satisfaction of the debt. The court concluded that because, at the time of the garnishment, the defendant could still have stopped payment on the checks, its debt to Gonzales had not yet been discharged and, consequently, it was liable to the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">A writ of garnishment subjects to the claims of a creditor only a debt which, at the time of the garnishment, was due to the underlying debtor. <em>Dorr-Oliver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Willett Associates, </em>153 Conn. 588, 595, 219 A.2d 718 (1966); <em>Seigel </em>v. <em>Heimovitch, </em>128 Conn. 543, 544, 24 A.2d 481 (1942). The question before us is therefore whether, on the facts of this case, the defendant was indebted to Gonzales on September 3, 1981. In light of the governing provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we agree with the defendant that its obligations on the savings accounts had then been discharged, and its obligations on the teller\u2019s checks p\u00e1yable to Rodriquez did not constitute a debt owing to Gonzales. In the absence of a continuing outstanding debt to Gonzales, the defendant was not answerable to the plaintiff for its judgment against Gonzales. The trial court\u2019s judgment to the contrary was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The first issue that we must address is the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that Gonzales continued to have an interest in her bank accounts despite the defendant\u2019s issuance of the two teller\u2019s checks. The plaintiff cites a number of cases that rely on the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>presumption that checks are ordinarily taken as conditional rather than as absolute payment, and their acceptance, until they are finally paid, does not discharge the obligation that they replace. <em>Tuckel </em>v. <em>Jurovaty, </em>141 Conn. 649, 651, 109 A.2d 262 (1954); <em>Sperandeo </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>131 Conn. 407, 410-11,40 A.2d 280 (1944); <em>Second National Bank of New Haven </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>122 Conn. 180, 184-85, 187 A. 910 (1936); <em>Kossover </em>v. <em>Willimantic Trust Co., </em>122 Conn. 166,168,187 A. 907 (1936); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Merchants Trust Co., </em>118 Conn. 586, 595,173 A. 777 (1934); <em>Alex-iou </em>v. <em>Bridgeport People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>110 Conn. 397, 402, 148 A. 374 (1930); <em>Huybrechts </em>v. <em>Huybrechts, </em>4 Conn. App. 319, 321, 494 A.2d 593 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">These cases are distinguishable both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. As a matter of fact, most of them involve negotiable instruments that are personal obligations, rather than obligations on which a bank engages its own credit, as it does when it issues a teller\u2019s check. The two cases that involve teller\u2019s checks, <em>Kossover </em>v. <em>Willimantic Trust Co. </em>and <em>Alex-iou </em>v. <em>Bridgeport People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>deal with teller\u2019s checks made payable to the person to whom the bank had been indebted. The plaintiff has cited no Connecticut case, and we have found none, that deems a payment to be merely conditional when the underlying obligation of a bank is exchanged for teller\u2019s checks made payable to the order of a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">More important, however, the law governing negotiable instruments has changed with the adoption in Connecticut of the Uniform Commercial Code; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-101 et seq.; especially articles 3 and 4. Two Code provisions are of particular relevance. One is General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-303 (1), which states: \u201cAny . . . legal process served upon ... a payor bank, whether or not effective under other rules of law to terminate, suspend or modify the bank\u2019s right or duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>to pay an item or to charge its customer\u2019s account for the item, comes too late to so terminate, suspend or modify such right or duty if the . . . legal process is received or served . . . after the bank has . . . (d) completed the process of posting the item to the indicated account of the . . . person to be charged therewith or otherwise has evidenced by examination of such indicated account and by action its decision to pay the item . . . . \u201d The other is General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-802 (1), which states: \u201cUnless otherwise agreed where an instrument is taken for an underlying obligation (a) the obligation is pro tanto discharged if a bank is drawer . . . and there is no recourse on the instrument against the underlying obligor . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In combination, these provisions demonstrate that the plaintiff\u2019s garnishment came too late with respect to any alleged claim to the Gonzales savings accounts. The rule contained in \u00a7 42a-4-303 (1) applies literally to Gonzales\u2019 certificate of deposit. Such a certificate is an \u201cinstrument\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-104 (2) (c) and therefore an \u201citem\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-104 (1) (g). The defendant \u201cevidenced . . . its decision to pay [this] item\u201d by having Gonzales sign a savings withdrawal slip and and by issuing a teller\u2019s check in the stipulated amount. By operation of \u00a7 42a-3-802, the tender and taking of a teller\u2019s check, on which the defendant bank was a drawer, presumptively discharged its obligation on the certificate of deposit. By analogy, the same principles govern the closing out of the Gonzales passbook savings account. That account too was finally settled by having Gonzales execute a savings withdrawal slip and having the defendant assume a direct obligation on its teller\u2019s check. We have often applied Code provisions to commercial transactions that were analogous to those expressly covered by the terms of the Code. <em>New England Yacht Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>198 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>624, 630, 504 A.2d 506 (1986); <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 762, 463 A.2d 242 (1983); <em>Conference Center Ltd. </em>v. <em>TRC, </em>189 Conn. 212, 225, 455 A.2d 857 (1983); <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>180 Conn. 491, 494-95, 429 A.2d 946 (1980). For both the certificate of deposit and the passbook account, Gonzales and the bank executed an exchange of savings account indebtedness for indebtedness defined by the terms of the teller\u2019s checks. In the absence of evidence of an agreement to the contrary, that exchange, which antedated the writ of garnishment, discharged the defendant from its former indebtedness to Gonzales on the savings accounts. E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 69 (b), p. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">There remains, however, a second issue. Even if the garnishment came too late to reach the Gonzales savings accounts directly, could it attach instead to the teller\u2019s checks that Gonzales purchased with the proceeds of these accounts? The teller\u2019s checks were still outstanding, unpaid, at the time of the garnishment. The plaintiff maintains that the garnishment was valid because the defendant could then have protected itself from further liability on the teller\u2019s checks by ordering their payment to be stopped, the defendant having made no claim that it did not have a reasonable time to stop payment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">At the outset, it is important to note that the defendant, as issuer of the teller\u2019s checks, incurred direct liability for their payment. As in the case of a certified check or a cashier\u2019s check, a teller\u2019s check engages the bank\u2019s own credit and is therefore more of a substitute for cash than is an ordinary personal check.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the defendant, as the \u201ccustomer\u201d for whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>account the checks were payable, could itself have asked its drawee, the Union Trust Company, to stop payment on the teller\u2019s checks; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4-403 (l);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such a request, if honored, would have left the defendant, as drawer, liable for breach of its engagement as drawer. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-413.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a drawer, once the instruments had been dishonored, the defendant would have been liable not only to the named payee but to any future holder in due course, such as a depositary bank that cashed the checks. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-305,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 42a-4-208<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>and 42a-4-209.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant would also have been liable to other holders who might not qualify as holders in due course, because the claims of third persons are ordinarily \u201cnot . . . available as a defense to any party liable thereon unless the third party himself defends the action for such party.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-306 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">For these reasons, a purchaser of bank paper does not have a right to insist that an issuing bank order that payment be stopped on a teller\u2019s check that is not made payable to the purchaser. See <em>Fur Funtastic, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>120 Misc. 2d 794, 795, 467 N.Y.S.2d 499 (1983); J. Brady, Bank Checks (5th Ed. H. Bailey, 1979) \u00a7 20.12, p. 20-30, and \u00a7 20.13; J. White &amp; R. Summers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed. 1980) \u00a7 17-5, p. 681. For similar holdings in cases involving cashier\u2019s checks, see, e.g., <em>Louis Falcigno Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>14 Mass. App. 92, 94-96, 436 N.E.2d 993 (1982), <em>Santos </em>v. <em>First National Bank of New Jersey, </em>186 N. J. Super. 52, 66-67, 451 A.2d 401 (1982), and <em>Dziurak </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>44 N.Y.2d 776, 777, 377 N.E.2d 474, 406 N.Y.S.2d 30 (1978).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Applying these principles to the facts presented by this case, we conclude that Gonzales, as the purchaser of teller\u2019s checks payable to Rodriquez, could not have compelled the defendant to rescind that transaction through a stop payment order. The defendant could not itself have requested that payment be stopped without exposing itself to liability to Rodriquez or to the bank that ultimately cashed the checks for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The rights of the plaintiff as garnisher cannot exceed those of its underlying obligor at the time of the garnishment. The plaintiff cannot assert a facial claim to the teller\u2019s checks because they were made payable to the order of Rodriquez and not of Gonzales, and therefore do not directly evidence an obligation owed by the defendant to Gonzales.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiff has no indirect claim to the teller\u2019s checks because service of the writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of attachment did not compel the defendant to stop payment thereon: owing no such duty to the purchaser of the teller\u2019s checks, the defendant had no such duty to the plaintiff. Any other result would expose the defendant to the risk of double liability, to the plaintiff and to holders of the teller\u2019s checks.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A garnishee cannot be compelled to pay the full amount of the original indebtedness twice. <em>Parker, Peebles &amp; Knox, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co., 111 </em>Conn. 383, 399, 150 A. 313 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Whether the plaintiff seeks to assert an interest in the savings accounts that Gonzales once had with the defendant or in the teller\u2019s checks that Gonzales purchased upon liquidation of her savings accounts, the plaintiff\u2019s effort to enforce its writ of garnishment cannot succeed. Since the defendant was not indebted to Gonzales at the time of the garnishment, the defendant was entitled to judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s action in scire facias. The trial court\u2019s ruling to the contrary was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">There is error, the judgment of the trial court is set aside and the case is remanded with direction that judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-329. process of foreign attachment.

The plaintiff, on praying out an execution, may direct the officer serving the same to make demand of such garnishee for the effects of the defendant in his hands, and for the payment of any debt due the defendant, and such garnishee shall pay such debt or produce such effects, to be taken and applied on such execution.
