An amendment was made by which punitive damages were struck out. The amendment did not at that time go to the extent of striking out the allegations upon which punitive damages could he shown. It is now sought to strike out those allegations, and the point is simply this. Where there is a suit and certain things are struck out, still leaving a cause of action, that cause of action must be held to continue to exist as under the original suit; and it would seem as if this amendment,\u2014 striking out allegations of malice, \u2014 asked for some time ago and not yet decided, should be allowed. The court is not free from doubt, but it will take that course.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
