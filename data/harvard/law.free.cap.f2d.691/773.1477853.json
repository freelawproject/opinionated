RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AKr\">Petitioners claim the Interstate Commerce Commission exceeded its statutory authority by granting a household goods broker\u2019s license to an agent for a motor common carrier of household goods. We find no statutory prohibition against agents becoming brokers and, therefore, affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWtI\">Mullen Bros, of North Adams, Mass., Inc. is a motor carrier of household goods with authority to provide service in the eastern United States. Since 1981, Mullen Bros, has also been an agent for Aero Mayflower Transit Co., a national household goods motor carrier. In 1981, Mullen Bros, applied to the Commission for a license to operate as a broker of household goods transportation between all points in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEm\">Mullen\u2019s application stated that its principal carrier, Aero Mayflower, provided excellent service. The application also represented, however, that no carrier can provide top quality service between all points. Thus, Mullen Bros, asserted that it could better serve the public if it could route shipments through the best carrier available in each area. The application was granted by Division 2 of the Commission, acting as an appellate division.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_z\">Petitioners, national motor common carriers of household goods, claim that Mullen Bros, was ineligible for a broker\u2019s license because the firm was an agent for Aero Mayflower. Petitioners rely upon the statutory definition of \u201cbroker\u201d: \u201ca person, <em>other than a motor carrier or an employee or agent of a motor carrier, </em>that as principal or agent sells ... transportation by motor carrier for compensation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(1) (Supp. Ill 1979) (emphasis added). For the reasons set forth below, we find that the statute does not preclude the licensing of a motor carrier as a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">The statute itself,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> read as a whole,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> solves the problem. Section 10102(1) ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>eludes motor carriers, their employees and their agents<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from the broker definition. This, however, recognizes only that a motor carrier, acting in that capacity, is not required to obtain a broker\u2019s license. This interpretation is affirmed when the section is read in <em>pari materia </em>with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10924(c)(2), which provides that a motor carrier soliciting traffic for its own account need not obtain a broker\u2019s license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unless a motor carrier engages in conduct other than solicitation for its own account, it is not considered to be a broker in the statutory sense, any more than it would be in the common understanding of the term, \u201cbroker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">This does not mean, however, that a motor carrier <em>cannot </em>be a broker. Indeed, if a motor carrier engages in certain activities, it <em>must </em>obtain a broker\u2019s license:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">The status of any given person in any particular activity depends upon, and is determined by, what such person does in that respect and not upon what it does, or its status, in some other respect. And the mere possession of carrier status and the holding of a certificate or permit does not relieve a person of the necessity of obtaining a license if in fact such person is engaged in brokerage activities for compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">Practices of Property Brokers, 49 M.C.C. 277, 292 (1949) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In fact, \u201c[TJhere is substantial precedent for granting broker\u2019s licenses to motor carriers.\u201d Property Broker Entry Controls, - M.C.C.-,.-, 1979 Fed.Carr.Cas. (CCH) 13904, 13904.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-18\">Petitioners rely also on the I.C.C.\u2019s broker regulations, which distinguish between brokers and agents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They contend that the regulations distinguish between brokers and agents because the classifications are mutually exclusive. The argument fails because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>it ignores the historie purpose of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The broker regulations originated in ICC rule-making proceedings that attempted, <em>inter alia, </em>to clarify when a person was an agent within the meaning of the 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10924(c)(2) licensing exemption.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Practices of Property Brokers, 49 M.C.C. 277, 295-303 (1949); Practices of Property Brokers, 55 M.C.C. 633 (1951). Thus, the regulations were an effort to clarify who was not required to obtain a broker\u2019s license, not who was barred from licensing.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In the past, the I.C.C. has not approved broker\u2019s license applications from agents. For the most part, this policy was not based upon statutory objections.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the Commission held that allowing agents to become brokers would be inconsistent with the public interest and national transportation policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This holding was premised on two considerations. First, the Commission asserted that \u201cone who is primarily a carrier\u2019s agent owes his first duty to his principal and lacks the right to exercise that independence of action which should govern his acts as a broker.\u201d Practices of Motor Common. Carriers (Agency Relationships), 115 M.C.C. 628, 634 (1972). <em>See, e.g., </em>Lux Broker Application, 53 M.C.C. 730 (1951). Second, the Commission sought to preserve the historic system of exclusive agents in the household goods field. <em>See </em>Entry Control of Brokers, 126 M.C.C. 476,-, 1977 Fed.Carr.Cas. (CCH) 136,816, f 36,816.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">As this and other cases<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> indicate, however, the Commission has now reversed its view about the public interest concern with persons acting at once as agents and brokers. Petitioners ask us to consider only their statutory objection to Mullen Bros.\u2019 broker\u2019s license application. We, therefore, express no opinion as to this shift in the Commission\u2019s policy. We do, however, find that the change does not violate 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10102(1) (Supp. Ill 1979) and 10924(c)(2) (West Supp.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">For these reasons, the decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\">.

This exemption was clearer prior to the recodification and revision of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1978. Then, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 311(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-11\">No person shall for compensation sell or offer for same transportation subject to this chapter ... unless such person holds a broker\u2019s license issued by the Commission to engage in such transactions ...: <em>provided further, </em>that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any carrier holding a certificate or a permit under the provisions of this chapter or to any bona fide employee or agent of such motor carrier, so far as concerns transportation to be furnished wholly by such carrier or jointly with other motor carriers holding like certificates or permits, or with a common carrier by railroad, express, or water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">The 1978 recodification placed the general rule stated before the colon in one section, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10921 (Supp. Ill 1979), and the proviso modifying that rule in another section, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10924(c)(2) (West Supp.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b851-20\">.

Two cases are arguable exceptions. In Nev-ins Distributors, Inc., Broker Application, 51 M.C.C. 383, 386 (1950), the Commission stated that it was \u201cclear beyond argument that one who is identified with and a part of a shipper\u2019s organization ... as ... a bona fide agent, stands in the position of the shipper and is of necessity outside the classification of brokers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Exec-Van Systems, Inc., Broker Application, 128 M.C.C. 669 (1978), the Commission indicated that an agent acting as a broker would violate 49 C.F.R. 1045.2(a). <em>Id'., </em>at 677 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The question presented by this case is one of statutory construction. These agency decisions do not, therefore, control our decision. <em>See Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R. R. v. United States, </em>682 F.2d 1092, 1096 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry., </em>608 F.2d 213, 218 (5th Cir. 1979). Moreover, as the I.C.C. decision in this case indicates, the agency\u2019s construction of the statute has not been consistent. <em>Cf. United States v. Missouri Pac. Ry., </em>278 U.S. 269, 280, 49 S.Ct. 133, 137, 73 L. Ed. 322, 377 (1929) (agency\u2019s construction of statute not entitled to deference if inconsistent). Therefore, to the extent that <em>Nevins </em>and <em>Exec-Van Systems </em>are contrary to the opinions expressed here, we decline to follow them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b852-16\">. The statute requires the Commission to issue a broker\u2019s license only if it finds, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe transportation for which the person is to be a broker will be consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10924(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b852-17\">. <em>See </em>Ward Moving &amp; Storage Co., Inc., Household Goods Broker Application, 132 M.
