We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>The Georgia statute confers jurisdiction over any nonresident if the cause of action arises from any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-5\">(a) The transaction of any business within the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-6\">(b) The commission of a tortious act or omission within this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-7\">(c) The commission of a tortious injury in the State caused by an act or omission outside the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-8\">(d) If the person owns, uses or possesses any real property situated within the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">Defendant\u2019s allegedly tortious conduct took place in California and the injury said to have resulted from this conduct occurred in Tennessee. Defendant does not own, use or possess any real property in Georgia, so subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 24-113.1 are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">Plaintiffs contend that, because the defendant transacted substantial business within the State of Georgia, a jurisdictional \u201ccontact\u201d exists between the nonresident defendant and the State, and therefore personal jurisdiction exists under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 24-113.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">The district court, relying on <em>Whitaker v. Krestmark of Alabama, Inc., </em>157 Ga.App. 536, 278 S.E.2d 116 (1981), held that Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 24-113.1(a) applies only to claims based on contract and not those sounding in tort. Since all the claims in this case were based on the law of torts, the district court found that the Georgia long-arm statute was inapplicable. We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of Georgia case law. Furthermore, even if Section 24-113.1(a) applied to tortious conduct, it would not apply in this case because the plaintiffs have not alleged that their cause of action <em>arose </em>from the transaction of business in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
