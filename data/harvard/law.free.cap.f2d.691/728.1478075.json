There Mrs. Causey E. Gram, Jr., purchased four skirts with her husband\u2019s \u201cMr. Bol.\u201d card, a charge system operated by the Bank of Louisiana. Mrs. Gram subsequently returned the skirts, but Clothes Town was unable to issue her a \u201cMr. Bol.\u201d credit slip. Mrs. Gram then contacted the bank, which informed her that the charge for the skirts would be removed in the next billing cycle. The bank failed to keep this promise, and further attempts to correct the error proved equally fruitless. This suit by Mr. Gram under the Truth-in-Lending Act ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">At trial the parties settled Gram\u2019s claim for $150.00. A dispute then erupted over the effect of the settlement on the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. The bank contended that settlement of the substantive claim necessarily amounted to a settlement of the entire lawsuit, including attorney\u2019s fees. Gram countered that the settlement agreement reserved the issue and that he was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(3). After a hearing on the matter, the district court denied Gram\u2019s request for fees without opinion and entered judgment accordingly. We vacate this judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">The sole question presented by this appeal is whether Gram was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. He stakes his claim under \u00a7 1640(a)(3), which provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin the case of any successful action\u201d under the Truth-in-Lending Act. The bank\u2019s position is that an action is not \u201csuccessful\u201d unless it results in a final judgment finding a violation of the Act. Here, because the case was settled, the bank contends that it was not \u201csuccessful\u201d and thus that attorney\u2019s fees are not mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">We disagree. The bank\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1640 would do violence to its goal of \u201ccreating a system of \u2018private attorneys general\u2019 who will be able to aid the effective enforcement of the Act. Section 1640 is intended to allow aggrieved consumers to participate in policing the Act, and its language should be construed liberally in light of its broadly remedial purpose.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Myers-Dickson Furniture Co., </em>479 F.2d 740, 748 (5th Cir. 1973) (citations omitted). Awarding attorney\u2019s fees only in cases where rights are vindicated after a full-blown trial would discourage consumers from seeking judicial relief for violations of the Act. This would defeat \u00a7 1640\u2019s <em>raison d\u2019etre, </em>a result we cannot abide.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-19\">Our conclusion is bolstered by the jurisprudence developed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, a similar statute providing for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cprevailing\u201d parties in civil rights cases. Those decisions establish that a plaintiff who achieves a meaningful settlement is a \u201cprevailing\u201d party under \u00a7 1988 and thus entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>E.g., Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Culpepper, </em>559 F.2d 274 (5th Cir. 1977). Although the legislative history of \u00a7 1988 is clear on this point and that of \u00a7 1640 is silent, we find this distinction unimportant. Both statutes were enacted by Congress to encourage private liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>gants to assert important rights. It is inconceivable that Congress intended that we give the two statutes opposite constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We express two caveats. First, nuisance settlements should not give rise to fee awards. <em>Chicano Police Officer\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Stover, </em>624 F.2d 127, 131 (10th Cir. 1980). Second, a plaintiff may waive his right to attorney\u2019s fees in a negotiated settlement agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 132.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But Gram did not waive his right to fees here. The district court correctly interpreted the agreement to permit consideration of whether fees should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">We remand this case to the district court for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, to determine the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees award. In making this decision, the court must make findings on all applicable guidelines established in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974), as required by our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-15\">. <em>But see </em>Bartell, Awards of Attorneys\u2019 Fees by the Federal Courts, Part II, 6 ALI ABA Course Materials Journal, 63, 66 (1982), discussing the possible conflict of interest between the attorney and his client when the principal settlement and the fee allowance are negotiated simultaneously, and citing cases dealing with that question. <em>See also </em>Opinion No. 80-84, Committee on Professional Responsibility and Judicial Ethics, Association of the Bar of the City of New York (Sept. 18, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
