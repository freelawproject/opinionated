The facts so stipulated are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>On June 4, 1946, Barker sustained injuries to his left hand and right hand by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment by Appalachian Power Company. He was paid compensation at the then maximum rate of $18 per week on account of total work incapacity from June 12, 1946, through December 24, 1946, under \u00a7 65-51 of the Code [then \u00a7 1887 (30) of the 1942 Code, Michie]. On December 25, 1946, it was determined that Barker\u2019s injuries were permanent and that he had sustained 80% loss of use of his left hand and 65% loss of use of his right hand, and on January 15, 1947, the Commission, pursuant to \u00a7 65-53 of the Code [then \u00a7 1887 (32) of the 1942 Code], awarded Barker compensation at the rate of $18 per week for 207 % weeks for said injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Following the June 4, 1946, injuries, Barker returned to work for Appalachian and on December 21, 1965, in the same employment, he had an accident, arising out of and in the course of his employment which resulted in his total and permanent incapacity for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As a result of this 1965 accident Barker was paid compensation on account of total work incapacity from February 27, 1966, through March 20, 1966, or 3 1/7 weeks. On March 21, 1966, Barker returned to work and continued to work until September 28, 1966, at which time his injuries had become progressively worse and it was then determined that he was permanently and totally disabled for any type of employment which he was mentally and physically qualified to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On the basis of these facts and the Commission\u2019s construction of the applicable statutes, \u00a7 65-51<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u00a7 65-57<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Code, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>mission entered its award granting to Barker compensation at the rate of $39 per week beginning September 29, 1966, and continuing thereafter for 189.36 weeks, or a total of $7,385.04, \u201con account of total and permanent work incapacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Barker appeals and contends that the award should have been $39 a week for 292 <em>l/z </em>weeks, amounting to $11,407.50. The difference results from the different methods of calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Commission held that \u201csince Barker\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of accident in 1965 entitled him to the maximum rate of compensation of $39.00 per week, he would reach the maximum monetary amount payable under the Act [then $15,600] at the end of 400 weeks. Thus, \u2018the total payment of compensation due\u2019 as provided for in \u00a7 65-57, in the present case would be 400 weeks of compensation at $39.00 per week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In further explanation of the award on the basis of 400 weeks, the Commission stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201c* # We here hold that the proper application of \u00a7 65-57, Code of Virginia, requires that the payments, in weeks, made on account of the permanent partial loss of use sustained to the left and right hand in the accident of June 4, 1946, that is, 207 {4 weeks, must be deducted from the total number of weeks (400) of compensation to which Barker would be due on account of total disability as a result of the accident of December 21, 1965. Thus, we find that Barker is entitled to compensation on account of the accident of December 21, 1965, for 192.50 weeks at the rate of $39.00 per week. The employer, having already paid 3.14 weeks of compensation under this award, is entitled to a credit for that compensation, leaving 189.36 weeks of compensation due under the award now to be entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Section 65-57 (note 2, <em>supra) </em>provides that when there have been two injuries as described the employee shall be entitled to compensation for both \u201cbut the total compensation shall be paid by extending the period and not by increasing the amount of weekly compensation, and in no case exceeding five hundred weeks.\u201d It further provides that \u201cpayments made for the previous injury shall be deducted from the total payment of compensation due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The emphasis in the statute would appear to be primarily on the period of payment, and it speaks of \u201cextending the period,\u201d but in no case beyond 500 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><em>Morris </em>v. <em>Pulaski Veneer Corp., </em>184 Va. 424, 35 S.E.2d 342, dealt with the application of \u00a7 65-57, referred to therein as \u00a7 36 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act [Code 1942, \u00a7 1887 (36)]. Morris suffered an accident in 1935 for which he was awarded compensation for 150 weeks. In 1944 he suffered a second accident while working for the same employer and made claim for permanent total disability. The Commission awarded him $14.90 per week for 350 weeks. This award was affirmed on appeal by Morris against his contention that it should have been based on the maximum amount payable (then $7,000) less the amount paid for the first accident. In the opinion it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201c* * The first paragraph of this section [\u00a7 65-57] reaffirms the limitation on the number of weeks. The second paragraph merely provides for the deduction of compensation paid for a previous injury so as not to exceed the limitation of $7,000. * * It reaffirms compensation for total disability as provided in section 30 [now \u00a7 65-51]; but that total disability rate is fixed by his earning at the time of the total injury. In this case, the workman\u2019s weekly rate was $14.90 for permanent total disability. He can receive, under provisions of section 30 [now \u00a7 65-51] and the first paragraph of section 36 [now \u00a7 65-57], payment only for three hundred and fifty weeks, having already previously received payment for one hundred and fifty weeks. Therefore, he is entitled to only $14.90 for three hundred and fifty weeks. If he is paid any more, it will be equivalent to paying him a larger sum than his average weekly rate entitles him to; or it will amount to paying him for more than 500 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\"># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u201cSection 30 [now \u00a7 65-51] of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act measures the compensation for total disability. It is a weekly compensation measured by average weekly wages. The period covered by such compensation cannot be greater than 500 weeks nor more than $7,000.\u201d 184 Va. at 428-29, 35 S.E.2d at 343-44.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The opinion, after stating that Indiana cases are to be given weight because the Virginia Act was substantially the same as Indiana\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>quoted from <em>Hollerback </em>v. <em>Blackfoot Coal Corp., </em>113 Ind. App.. 614, 618, 49 N.E.2d 973, 974, in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201c &lt;# * Thus, by the express terms of the Act, if an employee . should lose the sight of one eye in an accident and receive compensation for 150 weeks therefor, and later return to the same employment and lose the sight of the other eye in another accident, \u25a0 <em>he would receive for the second injury compensation for 500 weeks, from which would be deducted the 150 weeks previously </em>received.\u2019 * * \u201d Italics added in 184 Va. at 431, 35 S.E.2d at 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In the present case the Commission applied the correct principle in basing its award on the number of previous weekly payments, but erred in using 400 weeks as the number of weeks for which Barker was entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The limit of time fixed by the statute, \u00a7 65-57, is 500 weeks, and the limit of amount in 1965 was $15,600. As shown by the record, the award of $18 per week for the first accident was paid for 207(4 weeks, amounting to $3,735. Subtracting the 207(4 weeks from the 500 weeks, the maximum time fixed by the statute, leaves 292(4 weeks, for which Barker is entitled to be paid for his permanent total disability following the 1965 accident. This number of weeks at $39 a week amounts to $11,407.50. This sum added to the $3,735 paid for the 1946 accident makes a total payment of $15,142.50, which is within the $15,600 monetary limit, as well as within the 500 weeks time limit, fixed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We have said many times that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is highly remedial and should be liberally construed in favor of the workman. <em>Gobble </em>v. <em>Clinch Valley Lbr. Co., </em>141 Va. 303, 305, 127 S.E. 175, 176; <em>Fauver v. Bell, </em>192 Va. 518, 522, 65 S.E.2d 575, 577. The foregoing method of calculation, in the absence of a specific method provided by the statute, we consider to be in keeping with this established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Accordingly we reverse the award of the Commission and remand the case with direction to enter an award to Barker at the rate of $39 a week for 289.36 weeks (being 292(4 weeks less the 3.14 weeks which the Commission found that Appalachian had already paid under its award and for which it was entitled to credit).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> \u201c\u00a7 65-51. When the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee during such total incapacity, a weekly compensation equal to sixty per centum of his average weekly wages, but not more than thirty \u2014 * <em>nine </em>dollars, nor less than * <em>fourteen </em>dollars a week; and in no case shall the period covered by such compensation be greater than five hundred weeks, nor shall the total amount of all compensation exceed * <em>fifteen </em>thousand <em>six </em>hundred dollars.\u201d Acts 1964, ch. 94, p. 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\"><em> </em>\u201c\u00a7 65-57. * * If an employee receives a permanent injury as specified in \u00a7 65-53, after having sustained another permanent injury in the same employment, he shall be entitled to compensation for both injuries, but the total compensation shall be paid by extending the period and not by increasing the amount of weeldy compensation, and in no case exceeding five hundred weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\u201cWhen the previous and subsequent permanent injuries received in the .same employment result in total disability, compensation shall be payable for permanent total disability, but payments made for. the previous injury shall be deducted from the total payment of compensation due.\u201d \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">(By Acts 1968, ch.'660, p. 1123, Title 65 of the 1950 Code as amended, containing the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, was repealed and a new Title numbered 65.1 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>enacted in its place, to be known as the \u201cVirginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d The sections thereof were renumbered from <em>65.1-1 </em>to 65.1-137, inclusive.
