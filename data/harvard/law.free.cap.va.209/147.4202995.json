The Commissioner allowed a refund of $19,-397.11 for taxes paid on fuel purchased by Eastern after March 26, 1966, but disallowed the refund of $27,033.04 for taxes paid on fuel purchased prior to that date, on the ground that the application for refund had not been filed within three months from the date of sale as required by Code \u00a7 58-753.1, enacted by Acts of Assembly 1952, ch. 633, p. 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 58-754 (as amended by Acts of 1962, ch. 325, p. 453) Eastern filed in the court below a petition for appeal from the decision of the Commissioner disallowing such refund. Upon consideration of the petition and the Commissioner\u2019s demurrer thereto, which both parties agree present the issues involved, the court held that Eastern was entitled to a refund of the amount in dispute. From an order to that effect the Commissioner has appealed as of right. Code \u00a7 58-754 as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On appeal the parties make the same respective contentions as they did in the court below. The Commissioner contends that the right to a refund is controlled by \u00a7 58-753.1, enacted by Acts of 1952, ch. 633, p. 1091, which requires that application for refund be filed within three months from the date of sale of the fuel. Eastern contends that the right to a refund is controlled by \u00a7 58-753.3, written into the Code by Acts of 1960, ch. 398, p. 616; that since this section places no time limitation upon the filing of an application for refund, if the right of application is restricted as to time, the six-months\u2019 limitation provided in \u00a7 58-716 (as amended by Acts of 1960, ch. 499, p. 774) applies. The lower court sustained this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Moreover, Eastern contends that even if \u00a7 58-753.1 controls the right of refund it is entitled to the benefit of an amendment to this section by Acts of 1966, ch. 42, p. 100, which requires the filing of an application for refund within six months from the date of sale, within which time its application was filed. The lower court also sustained this contention. Under our view of the case it is unnecessary that we consider this latter issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">We hold that Eastern\u2019s right to a refund of such special fuel taxes is prescribed by \u00a7 58-753.3, subject to the time limitation of six months fixed by \u00a7 58-716, as amended, and that the application was timely filed and the refund properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>This State imposes a tax on fuel purchased for use in combustible, jet and rocket engines for transportation and other purposes. Chapter 13 (Code \u00a7 58-686 <em>ff. </em>(Repl. Vol. 1959)), embracing the \u201cMotor Fuel Tax Act,\u201d is directed primarily at gasoline used in motor vehicles but also includes aviation fuel used in aircraft. Code \u00a7 58-687(3). Chapter 14 (Code \u00a7 58-731 <em>jf.), </em>embracing the \u201cSpecial Fuels Tax Act,\u201d imposes a tax on all fuels used to propel motor vehicles, aircraft and rockets, except such fuels as are taxed under Chapter 13. Code \u00a7 58-732(4). The application of Chapter 14 is thus limited to fuels other than gasoline. By Acts of 1960, ch. 398, p. 615, the definitions in \u00a7 58-732 of the Special Fuels Tax Act were amended to include aircraft and aviation fuel. By the same Acts, Code \u00a7 58-744, which imposes the tax, was amended and made applicable to aircraft fuel, and \u00a7 58-753.3 was added as a new section to the Special Fuels Tax Act. Acts of 1960, ch. 398, p. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Both Chapters 13 and 14 impose a tax on such fuel at the same basic rate of <em>1\u2021 </em>per gallon (Ch. 13, \u00a7 58-711 as amended; Ch. 14, \u00a7 58-744 as amended), and both chapters provide for a refund of certain taxes when the fuel is used for the operation of aircraft. Ch. 13, \u00a7 58-715 as amended; Ch. 14, \u00a7 58-753.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">As indicated, the critical issue here presented is whether Eastern\u2019s right to a refund is controlled by \u00a7 58-753.3, as the lower court held, or by \u00a7 58-753.1, as the Commissioner contends. The pertinent portions of these sections are found in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The Commissioner argues that the right to a refund on aircraft fuel is <em>created </em>by \u00a7 58-753.1, and that \u00a7 58-753.3, written into the Code by Acts of 1960, ch. 398, p. 616, \u201cmerely limits the amount refundable with respect to the intrastate aviation phase of nonhighway use.\u201d We think that this position is refuted by both the language and history of the two sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Section 58-753.3 provides in clear and unambiguous language for the refunding of taxes paid on fuel used for <em>aircraft </em>purposes. It provides: \u201cAny person who shall buy <em>* * * </em>any special fuel for the purpose of operating or propelling any aircraft # * <em>shall be allowed a partial refund </em>on each gallon of <em>special fuel purchased within the State and consumed in any aircraft </em>in flights over and within the boundaries of this State, * * *.\u201d It further provides that \u201ca <em>refund </em>of the full tax paid <em>shall be made </em>on all special fuel purchased in this State and consumed in aircraft in flights outside the boundaries of the State.\u201d Again, it provides that \u201cwith respect to <em>all fuels </em>taxable under this chapter and all motor fuels as are subject to the tax imposed by Chapter 13 (\u00a7 58-686 <em>et seq.) * * * </em>purchased in this State and consumed in aeroplanes or aircraft in flights over and within the boundaries of this State, a <em>refund </em>in the following graduated amount <em>shall be made </em>to each user of such fuel.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Clearly, then, \u00a7 58-753.3 creates the right to such refund and requires the payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">While the wording of \u00a7 58-753.1, relating to a refund on all fuel used \u201cfor purposes other than to propel vehicles operated or intended to be operated on the highway,\u201d is broad enough to include fuel used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>for the purpose of operating aircraft, there is no specific language indicating such intended application. There is no reference to \u201caircraft\u201d fuels or fuels consumed in \u201caircraft\u201d flights as is found in \u00a7 58-753.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Moreover, as the trial court noted, \u00a7 58-753.1 provides that all refunds contemplated thereunder are to be paid \u201cin the manner provided in \u00a7 58-753,\u201d that is, out of the State\u2019s general fund by warrants of the Comptroller drawn on the State Treasurer. Section 58-733 (as amended by Acts of 1964, Ex. Sess., ch. 6, p. 8) provides that special fuel taxes imposed by Chapter 14 are to be paid into the treasury \u201cas a special fund,\u201d out of which refunds are to be made. Thus, the provision for the payment of refunds under \u00a7 58-753.1 is inconsistent with the provisions for the refund of taxes on special fuels. The Commissioner argues that as a practical matter the refunds under both sections are made out of the general fund of the Commonwealth. However that may be, the language of the two sections shows a legislative intent that refunds under each are in different categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Again, the history of \u00a7 58-753.1 shows that it was not intended to relate to a refund of special fuel taxes. As has been noted, this section in its present language was enacted in 1952 (Acts of 1952, ch. 633, p. 1091), eight years prior to the imposition of taxes on jet aviation fuel. Such latter tax was imposed by appropriate amendments in the Acts of 1960, ch. 398, p. 614, to the Special Fuels Tax Act. It is significant that when the General Assembly determined in 1960 to include aviation fuel under Chapter 14, it amended each of the relevant sections to apply to aircraft. It amended \u00a7 58-744 imposing a tax on such fuel and \u00a7 58-733 requiring the payment of such taxes into a special fund, and added \u00a7 58-753.3 providing for the refund of such special fuel taxes upon a graduated scale applicable only to aircraft operation. At the same time the language of \u00a7 58-753.1 was unchanged and remained equally inapplicable to aviation fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">It will be observed that \u00a7 58-753.3 provides no procedure for obtaining a refund and fixes no limitation within which application therefor must be made. We think such procedure and limitation are supplied in \u00a7\u00a7 58-715 and 58-716, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Section 58-715 (as amended by Acts 1964, ch. 122, p. 169) provides for the refund in graduated amounts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the tax on \u201call motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>fuel and other fuels as are subject to the tax imposed by Chapter 14 (\u00a7 58-731 <em>et seq.) * * * </em>purchased in this State and consumed in aeroplanes or aircraft in flights over and within the boundaries of this State.\u201d Section 58-716 (as amended by Acts of 1960, ch. 499, p. 774) provides the procedure for obtaining such refund and specifies that application therefor must be filed with the Commissioner within six months<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the date of the sale or invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It is true that there are no cross references between \u00a7\u00a7 58-715, 58-716 and 58-753.3 to show that they are interrelated. But they relate to the same subject of aviation fuels and were obviously harmonized and correlated by the 1960 session of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Since Eastern\u2019s application for a refund, filed on July 13, 1966, was within the period of six months provided by the terms of \u00a7 58-716 as then written, it was timely and the refund was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> \u201c\u00a7 58-753.3. Any person who shall buy, in quantities of five gallons or more at any one time, any special fuel for the purpose of operating or propelling any aircraft on which special fuel the tax or taxes imposed by this chapter shall have been paid, shall be allowed a partial refund on each gallon of special fuel purchased within the State and consumed in any aircraft in flights over and within the boundaries of this State, which partial refund per gallon of such fuel so used shall be equal to the tax per gallon less four cents, the intention being that the State shall retain four cents tax per gallon; and a refund of the full tax paid shall be made on all special fuel purchased in this State and consumed in aircraft in flights outside the boundaries of the State, the quantities consumed within and without the State to be determined by the flight logs of each trip and the average consumption of special fuel per hour per month by each aircraft.
