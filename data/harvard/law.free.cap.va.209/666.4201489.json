In the county jail later that morning, Jarette Arlo Dean confessed that he had shot Lam. At Dean\u2019s trial in March 1967, the jury found him guilty of second degree murder and fixed his sentence at five years in the penitentiary. Dean appeals from a final order entered April 10, 1967, sentencing him in accordance with the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\"> The principal question raised on this appeal is whether Dean\u2019s confession, which was admitted in evidence at his trial, resulted from custodial interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L.ed.2d 694 (1966). Other questions stem from (a) the court\u2019s refusal to examine the prospective jurors separately and to ask them certain questions on the voir dire and (b) the court\u2019s admitting evidence that Dean had refused to testify at the trial of Barbara Shifflett, another person charged with murdering Lam.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">I. Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Several hours after Lam was shot, two investigating officers went to Barbara Shifflett\u2019s house, where Dean, one Floyd Smith, Barbara and another woman were staying. After a brief conversation, the officers asked Dean and Smith to come with them to the Harrison-burg jail so that they could talk to Dean and Smith there. Dean and Smith agreed, and rode to the jail in the police officers\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">On arrival at the jail, the officers questioned Dean alone. After Dean had denied any knowledge of Lam\u2019s death, the officers sent him to the jailer\u2019s office and began to question Smith. While this questioning was in progress, Dean sent word that he wished to speak to the officers. Shortly thereafter, and apparently without any further questioning, Dean confessed that he had shot Lam.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The Commonwealth concedes that Dean was not given the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra. </em>The Commonwealth contends, however, that <em>Miranda </em>is not applicable here because (1) Dean was not in custody when he made his confession and (2) his confession did not result from questioning by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\"><em>Miranda </em>applies to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d \u2014 \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way\u201d. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612, 16 L.ed.2d at 706. Although Dean had not been told he was under arrest, one of the officers testified that Dean was in his custody at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the jail and would not have been permitted to leave to jail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Questioning under such circumstances constitutes \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as defined by <em>Miranda. Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 740, 160 S.E.2d 793 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><em>Miranda </em>does not apply to \u201cany statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences\u201d. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.ed.2d at 726. But since Dean confessed after questioning by the police and while he was still in custody, his confession was subject to compelling influences and should not have been admitted in evidence. <em>Durham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 415, 158 S.E.2d 135 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">II. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The court denied defense counsel\u2019s request that he be permitted to examine each prospective juror separately, out of the presence of the other prospective jurors. Counsel recognizes that sequestration of prospective jurors usually lies within the court\u2019s discretion. Nevertheless, he argues that because Dean was charged with a capital offense that had caused \u201cconsiderable speculation, discussion and comment in the community\u201d, the court abused its discretion by denying the request for sequestration.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Code \u00a7 8-199, which governs the voir dire, does not require sequestration of prospective jurors. See <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 574, 166 S.E.2d 232, decided today (court may examine prospective jurors collectively). Since there was no showing that sequestration was necessary to obtain an unbiased and unprejudiced jury, the court did not err in refusing to sequester the prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Defense counsel also assigns error to the court\u2019s refusal to ask certain questions submitted for the voir dire. One of the refused questions was: \u201cDid you know Larry Lam in his life time, or any member of his family? \u201d Because the term \u201cany member of his family\u201d has different meanings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the sense in which it was used should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>been explained. Otherwise, the question was proper if the information sought had not been obtained by other questions asked by the court. We find no error in the court\u2019s refusal to ask other questions requested by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">III. Dean\u2019s Refusal to Testify at Another Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Barbara Shifflett, who was with Dean on the morning Lam was shot, was also tried for murdering Lam. While on the witness stand at his own trial, Dean was asked, \u201cAt [Barbara\u2019s trial], didn\u2019t you, under oath, decline to testify on the ground it might incriminate you?\u201d The court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection and required Dean to answer the question. He answered, \u201cYes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">During closing argument the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney commented on Dean\u2019s refusal to testify at Barbara\u2019s trial. Defense counsel objected to that comment, and the court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The question raised by counsel, and now before us, is whether the evidence and the comment on Dean\u2019s refusal to testify impaired his constitutional right against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">In 1926 the Supreme Court held that a defendant who testified at the second trial of his case could be questioned about his refusal to testify at his first trial, without impairing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>Raffel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>271 U.S. 494, 46 S. Ct. 566, 70 L.ed. 1054 (1926). In 1957, however, the Court held that a defendant was improperly questioned at his trial for tax-fixing about liis refusal to testify before a grand jury that was investigating corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. <em>Grunewald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.ed.2d 931 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The majority in <em>Gr\u00fcnewald </em>refrained from overruling <em>Raff el, </em>basing its holding primarily on the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s testimony at his trial was not inconsistent with his previous refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>testify before the grand jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But four Justices, all of whom are now members of the Court, were of the opinion that <em>Raffel </em>should be overruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201c[We] can think of no special circumstances that would justify use of a constitutional privilege to discredit or convict a person who asserts it. The value of constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on them. It seems peculiarly incongruous and indefensible for courts which exist and act only under the Constitution to draw inferences of lack of honesty from invocation of a privilege deemed worthy of enshrinement in the Constitution. To the extent that approval of such a rule in Raffel v. United States, 271 U.S. 494, 46 S.Ct. 566, 70 L.Ed. 1054, has vitality after Johnson v. United States, 318 U.S. 189, 196-199, 63 S.Ct. 547, 553-554, 87 L.Ed. 704, [we] think the Raffel case should be explicitly overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">353 U.S. at 425-26, 77 S.Ct. at 984-85, 1 L.ed.2d at 955 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">We interpret cases decided after <em>Grunewald </em>as indicating that the Supreme Court has adopted the reasoning of the concurring opinion in <em>Grunewald, </em>rather than the reasoning of <em>Raffel. E.g. Spevack </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.ed.2d 574 (1966); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.ed.2d 106 (1965). We therefore hold that the Fifth Amendment precludes the prosecution from using an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination to discredit or convict the person who asserted it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">We also interpret Section 8 of the Virginia Constitution, which provides that no person shall \u201cbe compelled in any criminal proceeding to give evidence against himself\u201d, as precluding the use of an assertion of such privilege to discredit or convict the person who asserted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Accordingly, evidence should not have been admitted and comment should not have been made concerning Dean\u2019s refusal to testify at Barbara Shifflett\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Our order will reverse the judgment appealed from and will remand the case for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\"> \u201cQ.
