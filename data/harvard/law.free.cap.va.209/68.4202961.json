The superintendent of the hospital notified the court below, on January 9, 1967, that the defendant was not insane and was competent to stand trial and testify in his own defense, and he was promptly returned to the city jail in Bristol. On February 13, 1967, defendant, represented by court-appointed attorneys, entered a plea of not guilty to the indictment. A jury heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the evidence, found him guilty as charged, and fixed his punishment at seven years in the State penitentiary. Defendant was sentenced accordingly, and we granted a writ of error to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Defendant makes several assignments of error, but the principal and controlling one is that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence his written confession dated February 1, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The evidence shows that late on the night of January 9, or in the early morning hours of January 10, 1966, the Euclid Avenue Baptist Church in Bristol, Virginia, was broken into and entered, the church offices were ransacked, and postage stamps of the value of $17.00 were taken and carried away.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The pastor of the church testified that the defendant made a profession of faith in the Lord at a revival service conducted during the first week in January, 1966, and that he baptized him on the night of January 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Captain Stigall of the Bristol Police Department conducted an investigation of the burglary, and on February 1, 1966, he went to the Hillsville jail in Carroll county, Virginia, to question the defendant, who was confined there on an unrelated charge. Stigall testified that he interrogated defendant in the jail concerning the church burglary and no one else was present during that time. Before interrogating defendant he advised him \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have to make any statement, that any statement he might make could be used against him at court of law, that he had a right to an attorney, and that if he made any statement, it had to be free and voluntary on his part without any threats, promises or rewards being made to him by me.\u201d Defendant did not request the assistance of counsel, and after being questioned about five minutes he readily confessed to breaking and entering the church. Stigall reduced the deta\u00f1ed confession to writing and it was signed by the defendant after he had read it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">At the top of the confession signed by the defendant there was printed the substance of the oral warning given by Captain Stigall, and the fo\u00f1owing statement: \u201cI hereby expressly waive my right to the advice of counsel, and voluntarily make the following statement * *</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The confession was admitted in evidence and read to the jury over the objection of defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Defendant says that the confession was not admissible in evidence because he was not warned before making the statements that he had a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>compliance with the procedural safeguards delineated in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R. 3d 974 (1966). He also relies on our recent cases of <em>Durham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 415, 419, 158 S. E. 2d 135, 139 (1967); <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 452, 456, 158 S. E. 2d 731, 734 (1968); and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 740, 743-5, 160 S. E. 2d 793, 795-6 (1968), which quoted and followed the <em>Miranda </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In <em>Miranda, supra, </em>the Court held that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, certain procedural safeguards are required to protect the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. In addition to the traditional warning that the person has the right to remain silent and that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, he must be told prior to any questioning \u201cthat he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d 384 U. S. at 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1630, 16 L. ed. 2d at 726, 10 A.L.R. 3d at 1014. See also, <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U. S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1503, 20 L. ed. 2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">It is perfectly manifest that neither the oral warnings of Captain Stigall nor the printed statements in the written confession advised the defendant before his in-custody interrogation that he had the right to the presence of an attorney and that if he could not afford an attorney one would be appointed for him by the court if he so desired. Thus the constitutional rule delineated in <em>Miranda </em>and followed by this court in <em>Durham, Dailey </em>and <em>Johnson, supra, </em>was not complied with, and defendant\u2019s statements did not qualify as a voluntary confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The Commonwealth says that the <em>Miranda </em>opinion recognized that an accused may waive his right to retained or appointed counsel at an in-custody interrogation, and from that premise it argues that defendant\u2019s written confession shows that he expressly waived his right to the advice of counsel and voluntarily made the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The Court said in <em>Miranda </em>that after all the required warnings have been given an accused he may knowingly and intelligently waive his rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. But the Court further said that \u201cunless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d 384 U. S. at 479, 87 S. Ct. at 1630, 16 L. ed. 2d at 726, 10 A.L.R. 3d at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Defendant was told by Captain Stigall before the questioning began \u201cthat he had the right to an attorney,\u201d but he was not told that if he could not afford an attorney one would be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desired. The statement in defendant\u2019s confession that \u201cI expressly waive my right to the advice of counsel,\u201d is not a waiver of his right to have court-appointed counsel. One cannot knowingly and intelligently waive a right which he was not told he had. Moreover, the statement in defendant\u2019s written confession expressly waiving his right to the advice of counsel was not made until after he had orally confessed the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The answer to the Commonwealth\u2019s final argument, that the defendant was of average intelligence and knew that he had the right to court-appointed counsel present before answering any questions, is also found in <em>Miranda. </em>There it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201c[A]n individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during the interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we delineate today. As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against him, this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation. No amount of circumstantial evidence that a person may have been aware of this right will suffice to stand in its stead. Only through such a warning is there ascertainable assurance that the accused was aware of this right.\u201d 384 U. S. at 471, 472, 86 S. Ct. at 1626, 16 L. ed. 2d at 722, 10 A.L.R. 3d at 1009, 1010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">For the reason stated, the defendant\u2019s confession was inadmissible in evidence and the case is reversed and remanded for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth may deem advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
