Sturman, by his father and next friend, Max Sturman, filed a motion for judgment seeking to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained by him in an automobile accident. The motion alleged that Walter F. Johnson, the defendant, was the operator of the vehicle; that the infant plaintiff was \u201ca passenger for pay\u201d in the automobile; and that his injuries were caused by the \u201cnegligence and . . . gross n\u00e9gligence\u201d of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The infant plaintiff\u2019s father, Max Sturman, also filed a motion for judgment against the defendant, seeking recovery of the expenses incurred in the treatment and care of his son\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The two iactions were consolidated and were tried together before a jury. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs were granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The accident occurred sometime after 10:30 p.m. on October 4, 1964, when the infant plaintiff and the defendant, who were students at the University of Virginia, members of the same fraternity, and roommates at the fraternity house, were driving back to school after returning their dates to the latter\u2019s dormitory at Richmond Professional Institute, following a dance weekend in Charlottesville.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The circumstances surrounding the making of the trip present the first question for decision, and that is: Was the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficient to submit to the jury the issue of whether the infant plaintiff was a paying passenger in the automobile operated by the defendant and thus entitled to recover for only ordinary negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">The defendant was engaged to the young lady who was his date for the weekend, and through her, a \u201cblind date\u201d with her roommate was arranged for the infant plaintiff. The two girls had planned to take a bus back to Richmond on Sunday afternoon, but for some reason failed to do so. The defendant then borrowed a car to drive the girls back to their school. He was familiar with the vehicle, having, driven it on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">After obtaining the car, the defendant went to the fraternity house and asked the infant plaintiff to make the trip with him. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>infant plaintiff \u201chad not originally wanted to go ... at all\u201d because he \u201chad not particularly liked his date.\u201d The defendant, however, urged the infant plaintiff to go because he thought \u201cit would be the proper thing for [the infant plaintiff] to do to ride along and escort his date back.\u201d The infant plaintiff apparently \u201cthought so too because he agreed to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On direct examination, the infant plaintiff was asked to relate the discussion he had with the defendant \u201cas to the arrangements for taking\u201d the two girls \u201cback to Richmond.\u201d He replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cWell, I felt it more or less my obligation to ride back with her since she was my \u2014 had been my date for the weekend, and of course Walter, Mr. Johnson, wanted to be with his fiancee, and as was customary with fraternity brothers, we always split costs on these trips.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The following questions and answers then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cQ. Did you actually agree on that with him in the room when he came up there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cA. Well, yeah, we made a \u2014 well, I told him that I would pay my half or pay for half the gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cQ. All right. Did you have any money on you at all at that time in the fraternity house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u201cA. Some change in my pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u201cQ. And what arrangements did you make with Walter as to how you were going to pay him for your half share of the expenses of taking the girls down and bringing [you] back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u201cA. On the return I was to write him a check to pay for my half of the expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">On cross-examination, the infant plaintiff was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">\u201cQ. Now, as a matter of fact, any idea about any paying back any gas was never actually said . . . you never said anything to him, but you only intended to contribute. Isn\u2019t that what actually happened?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">The infant plaintiff\u2019s answer was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-17\">\u201cA. Oh, I came out and told him that I would pay for my half of the expenses, and I told him \u2014 because I didn\u2019t have much money when he asked me if I wanted to go I told him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>I didn\u2019t have much cash but I would pay him when we returned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The infant plaintiff was also asked if he made any other statement concerning expenses, and he replied, \u201cit was pretty well understood on both our parts that I was to pay the expenses when we returned to Charlottesville.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The defendant, called as an adverse witness by the plaintiffs, denied that he had discussed with the infant plaintiff the proposition that they \u201cwere going to split expenses for this trip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfR\">The question now before us arises from the operation of Code, \u00a7 8-646.1 which provides, so far as is pertinent here, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cNo person transported by the owner or operator of any motor vehicle as a guest without payment for such transportation . . . shall be entitled to recover damages against such owner or operator for . . . injuries to the person ... of such guest resulting from the operation of such motor vehicle, unless such . . . injury was caused or resulted from the gross negligence ... on the part of such owner or operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Since enactment of the above statute in 1938, we have on numerous occasions been called upon to decide the question of whether a plaintiff was a \u201cguest without payment\u201d within the meaning of the statute and required to prove gross negligence, or a paying passenger entitled to recover for only ordinary negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The defendant contends that one of our prior decisions, <em>Davis </em>v. Williams, 194 Va. 541, 74 S. E. 2d 58 (1953), \u201cis dispositive of the issue under consideration.\u201d His reliance upon that case is mistaken, however, because there we held as a matter of law that the plaintiff was a paying passenger. The evidence was that the plaintiff, a school teacher, voluntarily contributed the equivalent of weekly bus fare for transportation to and from school in the defendant\u2019s automobile, although not requested to do so by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">The present defendant\u2019s reliance upon the <em>Davis </em>case apparently stems from the fact that in the opinion we noted that the Supreme Court of Michigan had applied our guest statute in the case of <em>Bushouse </em>v. <em>Brom, </em>297 Mich. 616, 298 N. W. 303 (1941), involving an accident occurring in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">The plaintiff in the Michigan case, after being invited to accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>pany the defendant and her mother on a trip, stated that she would pay half the expenses. Her offer was not refused by the defendant, but the latter claimed that she only intended that the plaintiff should pay a third of the expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It was shown that the three ladies making the trip did establish what they called the \u201cCompany\u2019s purse,\u201d each placing money in a purse from which the expenses of the trip were paid as demanded. At the time of the accident, approximately $80 had been placed in the purse, of which amount plaintiff had contributed $30; all but a few dollars had been spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Michigan court stated that its guest statute was, in effect, the same as ours; that our decisions indicated that we had construed our statute in like manner as it had construed Michigan\u2019s; and that it would, therefore, \u201cinterpret and enforce the law as [had] already been done in\u201d that state. 298 N. W., at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">One of our cases referred to by the Michigan court was <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Wilber, </em>163 Va. 211, 217, 175 S. E. 739, 741 (1934), where we had observed, \u201cThe term \u2018passenger,\u2019 in its legal sense, imports some contractual relation between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The Michigan court said of the foregoing passage: \u201cThere is little, if any, room for controversy concerning the quoted proposition; but it would be applicable only when a legally binding contractual relation was established.\u201d 298 N.W., at 304. The court held that the plaintiff was a guest and not a paying passenger because \u201cthere was never any definite understanding between these parties which resulted in an \u2018express legal obligation to pay.\u2019 \u201d 298 N. W., at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">At the time the <em>Bushouse </em>case was decided by the Michigan court, we had not had occasion to apply our guest statute in a similar factual situation. However, since that time and, in fact, since our decision in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>where we took note of <em>Bushouse, </em>we have had two similar situations before us; and in each instance arrived at a result different from that reached by the Michigan court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Thus, in <em>Gammon </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>199 Va. 918, 924-925, 103 S. E. 2d 221, 226 (1958), we held the plaintiff to be a paying passenger where, before starting on a trip to a church convention in Iowa, the passengers contributed $50 each to defray part of the expense of operating the defendant\u2019s car, although there was \u201cno requirement by [the defendant] or specific agreement between him and his passengers that this contribution be made.\u201d 199 Va., at 925, 103 S. E. 2d, at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">And, in <em>Bernard </em>v. Bohanan, 203 Va. 372, 375-376, 124 S. E. 2d 191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>194 (1962), we held that the plaintiff was a paying passenger where the parties, before starting on a pleasure trip, agreed to establish a \u201ckitty\u201d to defray the expense of operating the defendant\u2019s automobile, each party originally contributing $5 to the fund, which was kept in a separate pocketbook, and then adding equal contributions when the \u201ckitty\u201d needed replenishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In the <em>Bernard </em>case, we said, \u201cThe benefit defendant received amounted to more than gratuitous gestures or social amenities. It was a consideration for the transportation.\u201d 203 Va., at 376, 124 S. E. 2d, at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">When that criterion is applied to the case before us and the infant plaintiff\u2019s testimony is accepted, for the time being, as true, the situation is presented where the parties, by pre-trip arrangement, provided that the infant plaintiff would compensate the defendant for one-half the expenses of operating the car on the trip. This would have been more than a mere social or incidental benefit to the defendant; it would have constituted a substantial pecuniary contribution to help defray such expenses, placing the infant plaintiff in the status of a paying passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The defendant, as has been noted, denied that any such arrangement was made, and the resulting conflict posed a typical jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The next question for decision is: Was the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence sufficient to submit to the jury the issues of whether the defendant was guilty of ordinary negligence, if the infant plaintiff was found to be a passenger, or of gross negligence, if he was found to be a guest?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">As has already been stated, the accident occurred sometime after 10:30 p.m. on October 4, 1964. It had rained earlier in the evening, but at the time of the accident, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The accident took place on U. S. Route 250 near its intersection with University Airport Road, seven miles east of the city of Charlottesville and ten miles west of Zion Crossroads. Route 250 runs east and west. The oral testimony and photographic exhibits of the accident scene show that a vehicle traveling in a westerly direction passes a highway sign indicating a curve to the right and a maximum safe speed of 50 m.p.h.; proceeds upgrade through an area where the road is three lanes in width but lined for no passing by westbound traffic; encounters a sharp curve to the right, marked by reflectors, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the top of the grade where traffic is channeled by lines painted in the middle of the road to one lane in each direction; and then passes over a bridge above the Chesapeake and Ohio railway tracks. The Airport Road intersects Route 250 from the south or left about at the apex of the curve.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On the return trip from Richmond to Charlottesville, the automobile operated by the defendant and occupied by the infant plaintiff ran out of gas several miles west of Zion Crossroads. The defendant-left his companion in the car and hitchhiked a ride back to Zion Crossroads, where a combination restaurant and filling station was still open. He secured a gallon of gasoline in a jar, and the operator of the establishment drove him back to his car, where the gas was poured into the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The infant plaintiff and the defendant then returned to the filling station, secured more gas, and each had a cup of coffee. An employee of the restaurant observed the defendant on both his visits, and described him as \u201cvery polite, and . . . wide awake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The two young men re-entered their car and, with the defendant driving, continued the trip to Charlottesville. The infant plaintiff fell asleep and was awakened by the noise of the \u201cwind whistling in through the window and the car . . . rattling.\u201d He testified that the vehicle \u201cwas rattling violently as if it was traveling at a high rate of speed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The infant plaintiff \u201clooked at the speedometer and . . . noticed that the speedometer needle was somewhere in the vicinity of ninety miles an hour.\u201d He looked at the defendant and saw that the latter was awake. He \u201cturned to protest\u201d to the defendant, and \u201cabout that time,\u201d the vehicle \u201chit something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The car ran off the left side of the pavement where the highway curves to the right at the intersection of Route 250 and the University Airport Road. It traveled approximately 190 feet on the shoulder of the road, knocking over two <em>6\" </em>x <em>6\" </em>highway marker posts; went over a 100-foot cliff and sailed approximately 240 feet through the air, clipping off the tops of some tall trees; then struck the trunk of a large tree and fell to the ground, turned in the opposite direction from which it had come. The vehicle was demolished, and parts of it \u201cflew off\u201d when it hit the tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The infant plaintiff was found 20 to 30 feet beyond the car, \u201cin the honeysuckle.\u201d The defendant crawled up the bank and was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>sitting on the edge of the highway at the west end of the bridge over the railroad tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendant had no recollection of the events which occurred after he left the filling station at Zion Crossroads. He did remember that \u201cprior to reaching Zion\u2019s Crossroads [he] had done some speeding . . . eighty miles an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The infant plaintiff contends that the evidence was sufficient to take his case to the jury upon either theory of negligence relied upon by him, that is, ordinary negligence if he was a passenger, or gross negligence if he was a guest.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the evidence was sufficient to sustain neither theory. He says that there was no evidence as to \u201cwhat caused the automobile to reach\u201d the speed of 90 miles per hour ascribed to it by the infant plaintiff or as to what caused the vehicle to leave the highway. Thus, he argues, it was not shown how and why the accident happened, and the jury could only have speculated about the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">It is true that we have said, in cases which need not be enumerated here, that if it cannot be determined how and why an accident occurred, there can be no recovery. But we know of no rule, and can perceive of no reason to establish one, imposing upon a plaintiff the burden of proving what caused an automobile to travel at a particular speed where, as here, there is direct evidence showing that a certain speed was attained and that the driver was awake. In such circumstances, it will be assumed, until the contrary appears, that a vehicle traveled at a particular speed because the driver voluntarily caused it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The parties have cited numerous cases in support of their respective positions on the negligence question, none of which, however, is controlling. Not cited is a case which is controlling, and that is <em>Leech </em>v. Beasley, 203 Va. 955, 128 S. E. 2d 293 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">In the <em>Leech </em>case, the accident occurred on an \u201cS\u201d curve, the first portion thereof bearing to the right and the second to the left. Reflecting highway markers warned of the presence of the curve and indicated a maximum safe speed of 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The vehicle operated by Leech entered the first portion of the curve at a speed of 75 miles per hour, and its speed was then accelerated to \u201c80 or 85 or 90\u201d miles per hour. It failed to make the second or left-hand portion of the curve, ran off the road to the right, traveled 250 feet, knocked down a highway sign, proceeded another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>110 feet and came to rest 62 feet from the edge of the road at the bottom of a 50-foot embankment, pointed in the opposite direction from which it had corner</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We said in the <em>Leech </em>case, in sustaining the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence, \u201cHere, the jury could point directly to how and why this accident took place. Under the evidence presented to it, the jury could have found that Leech, with an utter lack of a sense of caution, entered a dangerous curve, heedless of the warnings displayed,\u201d at a grossly excessive rate of speed and, \u201cas a result thereof, was unable to control the vehicle and to complete the curve, thus causing it to run off the road and crash.\u201d 203 Va., at 963, 128 S. E. 2d, at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The same can be said about the case now before us. Under the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the jury, if the matter had been presented to it, could have found that the accident occurred because the defendant foolheartedly tried to negotiate the hazardous curve at a highly excessive rate of speed and, as the result thereof, could not make the curve and lost control of the vehicle, causing it to run off the highway and crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Negligence and gross negligence have been so often defined that the meaning of the terms should need little elucidation here. Negligence is the failure to use ordinary care. Gross negligence is that degree of negligence which shows an utter disregard of prudence amounting to complete neglect for the safety of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The conduct of the defendant in this case, if the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is believed, was such as to come within the definition of gross negligence and, accordingly, within the definition of ordinary negligence. The issues of whether the defendant was guilty of ordinary negligence, if the infant plaintiff was found to be a passenger, or of gross negligence, if he was found to be a guest, should have survived the motion to strike the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> The parties say that there is a final question for us to decide, and that is whether the provisions of Code, \u00a7 8-286,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the so-called Dead Man\u2019s Statute, are applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The claim is that as a result of the accident, the defendant suffered retrograde amnesia and could not recollect the details of the accident. This condition, he contends, rendered him incapable of testifying within the meaning of the Dead Man\u2019s Statute, and thus corroboration of the infant plaintiff\u2019s testimony was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">It is, of course, difficult to see how this question arises, since the evidence was struck at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and the defendant submitted no evidence showing that he suffered retrograde amnesia. True, he testified as an adverse witness, at the call of the plaintiffs, and claimed not to remember the circumstances of the accident. But he laid his loss of memory to another factor, \u201cgasoline fume influence,\u201d caused by some fuel spilling on him when he tried to pour it into his gas tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">There was some medical testimony submitted in the trial below about retrograde amnesia, but that related to the infant plaintiff, who was unable to recall the details of the accident until many months after it occurred. The testimony showed that retrograde amnesia results from a head injury and causes the patient to be unable to recall \u201cthe actual details\u201d of an incident for \u201ca long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">All that is in the record about the defendant\u2019s being incapable of testifying appears from the argument on the motion to strike the evidence. Counsel for the defendant, after citing Code, \u00a7 8-286 to the trial court, said, \u201cAnd this defendant is incapable of testifying.\u201d The trial judge then commented, \u201cAnd that testimony they [plaintiffs] rely on comes under that statute.\u201d This is hardly the way for counsel to raise and present a question for appellate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">However, since the case has to be retried, and so that this question will not be tiresomely litigated, we will lay it to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">If it had been shown that the defendant suffered retrograde amnesia and so could not remember how the accident occurred, it was, nonetheless, unnecessary that the infant plaintiff\u2019s testimony be corroborated. The Dead Man\u2019s Statute simply does not apply to this type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The defendant was not incapable of testifying. He did testify, at length, in the court below. He was merely unable, supposedly, to recall the actual details of the accident. That is not, in our opinion, such an incapability as is envisioned by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Moreover, in <em>John Doe </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>203 Va. 522, 525, 125 S. E. 2d 169, 171 (1962), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cSection 8-286 was adopted to provide protection for estates of <em>persons </em>laboring under disability, or who are <em>incapable </em>of testifying----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">. The defendant here Was neither dead nor, so far as we know, had he been adjudged incompetent; and no committee, trustee, executor, administrator, or other representative had been appointed for him. He was not, therefore, in the status of such a \u201cperson\u201d as is entitled to the protection of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">For the error in striking the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, we will reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the cases for new trials not inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\"> \u201c\u00a7 8-286. <em>Corroboration required and evidence receivable when 'one party incapable of testifying </em>\u2014 In an action or suit by or against a person who, from, any cause, is incapable of testifying, or by or against the committee, trustee, executor, administrator, heir, or other representative of the person so incapable of testifying, no judgment or decree shall be rendered in favor of an adverse or interested party founded on his uncorroborated testimony; and in any such action or suit, if such adverse party testifies, all entries, memoranda, and declarations by the party so incapable of testifying made while he was capable, relevant to the matter in issue, may be received as evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
