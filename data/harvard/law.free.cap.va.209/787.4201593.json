The trial court, sitting without a jury, found that the damage was caused by the weight of snow and ice and was therefore covered by the policy. On this appeal we are called upon not to interpret doubtful language of an insurance policy, but to decide whether the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">The homeowners policy provides coverage for damage caused by the \u201cweight of ice, snow or sleet\u201d, but excludes from coverage \u201closs caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by . . . water which backs up through sewers or drains\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">In the latter part of January 1966, there were two heavy snowfalls in Staunton. After the second snowfall, shingles were dislodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>from the roof of White\u2019s home and water leaked through the roof causing damage to the interior.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The insurance company contends that the shingles were dislodged by \u201cthe melting of the snow on the roof, the backing up of this water by the stoppage of the guttering (drains), and the cracking of shingles on the roof as the melted snow would freeze\u201d. White contends that the shingles were dislodged by the weight of snow and ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">White\u2019s home has a steep roof covered with composition shingles. After the second snow in January, White observed that ice \u201chad come off\u201d the roof, and that shingles \u201cwere stuck to it\u201d. White called a roofing contractor, who suggested that he remove the guttering from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The roofing contractor, who was snowbound when White first called, came to the house several days later and inspected the roof. Referring to this inspection, he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">\u201cWell, it was so much snow you couldn\u2019t hardly tell much, but there <em>was </em>\u2014 the <em>snow was beginning to slip and the shingles were going with it. </em>At the top part where the snow was off, everything seemed to be in fine order but down at the bottom this was where the damage was, and the shingles was removing, going from the roof and the water was leaking in at the lower side.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">The contractor also noticed that a roofing board had been split.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The evidence showed that snow and ice had adhered to the shingles. The trier of fact could have reasonably found that the weight of the snow and ice caused snow and ice to slip off the roof and, in the process, to dislodge the shingles. The fact that a roofing board had been split lends support to the finding that weight caused the dislodging of the shingles.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">On the other hand, the evidence does not show, much less conclusively show, that the shingles were cracked by alternate freezing and thawing or that water backed up on the roof because the gutters were stopped-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
