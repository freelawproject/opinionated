He was granted a writ of error and here asserts, as his principal contention, that \u00a7 18.1-365 did not apply to city streets. He contends also that the Commonwealth did not prove lack of permission and that the statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The evidence established that the cross was placed and burned by the defendant on a sidewalk of the City of Richmond in front of the premises of No. 1212 North Boulevard, occupied by North American Transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Section 18.1-365 originated as Chapter 483, Acts of Assembly, 1952, entitled: \u201cAn Act to prohibit the wearing of masks in certain places except under certain circumstances; to prohibit the placing of certain exhibits on the property of another, except under certain conditions, and to prohibit the placing of certain exhibits for certain purposes, within the State.\u201d Acts 1952, p. 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>It was the second of four sections of that Act. Section 1 prohibited any person over sixteen years of age while wearing a mask \u201cto be or appear in any public place,\u201d or \u201cto be or appear upon any private property in this State\u201d without a permit in writing \u201cfrom the owner or tenant thereof,\u201d with exceptions not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Section 2 was in the words of Code \u00a7 18.1-365, <em>supra, </em>before its amendment in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Section 3 made it unlawful for any person masked or unmasked to place or cause to be placed \u201canywhere in the Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d any exhibit or do any act \u201cwith the intention of intimidating any person or persons,\u201d and thereby prevent them from doing any lawful act or cause them to do an unlawful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Section 4 fixed the punishment for violating the above sections. These sections were recodified without change by Chapter 358 of the Acts of 1960, at page 479, and given Code numbers as they now appear in the 1960 Replacement Volume 4 of the Code, <em>i.e., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 18.1-364, 18.1-365, 18.1-366 and 18.1-367.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Defendant contends that \u00a7 18.1-365 did not apply to city streets; that being a criminal statute it must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth; that any extension beyond its words by implication or construction is forbidden; that the act committed must be within both the letter and the spirit of the statute; and that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in the construction of the statute. Our cases support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">In <em>Gates &amp; Son Co. </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>103 Va. 702, 49 S.E. 965, a city ordinance provided that no person could place any porch, step, fence \u201cor other projection which shall project into any street\u201d on penalty of a fine. Defendant was charged with violating the ordinance by placing a \u201cskid\u201d composed of two parallel pieces of timber from his store across the sidewalk to deliver to wagons in the street. For this he was fined, but on appeal his conviction was reversed by this court in an opinion which stated these principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">\u201cThis is a penal ordinance, and is, therefore, to be construed strictly. It is not to be extended by implication, and must be limited in its application to cases clearly described by the language employed. The books abound with cases illustrating this principle, which is of universal application,, except in particular instances in which the doctrine has been modified by statute. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cIn <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, 5 </em>Wheat. 76, 5 L. Ed. 37, Marshall, C.J., observes: \u2018The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly is, perhaps, not much less old than construction itself. It is \u25a0founded in the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals, and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not the judicial, department. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201c \u2018It would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute, because it is of kindred character with those which are enumerated.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201c \u2018There can be no constructive offenses, and before a man can be punished, his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the statute.\u2019 Chief Justice Fuller, in <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Lacher, </em>134 U.S. 624, 33 L. Ed. 1080, 10 Sup. Ct. 625.\u201d 103 Va. at 704, 705, 49 S. E. 965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">See also <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 821, 63 S.E. 1080; <em>Enoch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>141 Va. 411, 436, 126 S.E. 222, 230, stating that an accused is as much entitled \u201cto the benefit of a reasonable doubt about the law as about the facts\u201d; <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Bles, </em>198 Va. 49, 53, 92 S.E.2d 486, 489, and <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201c \u2018A penal statute cannot be extended by implication, or be made to embrace cases which are not within its letter and spirit. Such statutes are always construed strictly against the State and in favor of the liberty of the citizen.\u2019 * *\u201d <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 239, 243, 148 S. E.2d 829, 831-2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The Attorney General asserts that we have clearly held that the word \u201canother\u201d as used in a criminal statute means \u201canother person\u201d and that a municipality is a person. His reference is to <em>Hanbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 182, 122 S. E.2d 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The assertion is too broad. In <em>Hanbury </em>the defendant engaged in forging and using on packages of cigarettes a rubber stamp which falsely stated that the tax thereon due the City of Lynchburg had been paid. He was indicted and convicted under \u00a7 18.1-96 of the Code which provides that if any person forge any writing (with stated exceptions) \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right,\u201d he shall be punished as therein provided. We said that the rights of the City were prejudiced by the use of the forged stamp and \u201cThe city is a \u2018person\u2019 whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>rights may be prejudiced by a forgery. Code I 1-13 (19).\u201d 203 Va. at 187, 122 S.E.2d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Code \u00a7 1-13.19 (as it is now designated) provides: \u201cThe word \u2018person\u2019 may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate as well as individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive. Its use necessarily means that the word \u201cperson\u201d does not in all cases include bodies politic and corporate. It is applicable to political bodies and corporations only where it is reasonable so to apply it. Our cases illustrate this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 72, 49 S.E.2d 369, the defendant, a minister of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, was distributing literature of his church in a large apartment building in the City of Richmond after being forbidden to do so. He was convicted and fined for trespass under \u00a7 4480-a of the 1942 Code, now, as amended, \u00a7 18.1-173, 1960 Repl. Vol. 4 of 1950 Code, which provided that if any person without authority of law goes or remains \u201cupon the lands or premises of another,\u201d after being forbidden, he is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine. Defendant claimed a right to preach in public places and on the streets and sidewalks and in apartments. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201c* * The statute does not restrain the accused in any of his activities in the exercise of his religious beliefs; he may go from house to house distributing his pamphlets on the streets, sidewalks, or any other public place without violating any provisions of the statute. The only purpose of this law is to protect the rights of the owners or those in lawful control of private property. * *\u201d 188 Va. at 76-7, 49 S.E.2d at 371.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Again in <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 661, 119 S.E.2d 817, defendant was refused service at a restaurant operated by Thalhimer Brothers, Incorporated, in its store in the City of Richmond and he refused to leave the store after being ordered to do so. He was convicted of violating \u00a7 18.1-173, <em>supra </em>(then Code \u00a7 18-225). In affirming the conviction we said that this statute forbids any person without authority of law \u201cto go upon or remain upon the lands or premises of another,\u201d and we repeated the statement in <em>Hall, supra, </em>that \u201c \u2018The only purpose of this law is to protect the rights of the owners or those in lawful control of private property.\u2019 \u201d 202 Va. at 664, 119 S.E.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>In <em>Hanbury, supra, </em>the prosecution was under \u00a7 18.1-96 for forgery \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right.\u201d It was the City of Lynchburg whose right had been prejudiced by the stealing of its money by means of a forgery. It was clearly within the intent and purpose of \u00a7 1-13.19 of the Code to make the forgery statute in such a case applicable to the city, the \u201cperson\u201d whose right had been violated. Forgery is a form of stealing, a <em>malum in se, </em>essentially criminal, and universally known to be a wrong without being made so by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In contrast, \u00a7 18.1-365, which defendant Price was convicted of violating, involved an offense of a different nature. It concerned an act made a crime only by statute, a <em>malum prohibitum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">If by a strict construction of the statute, \u00a7 18.1-365, which is required, the act of defendant Price was not clearly forbidden by its terms, then Price has not committed the crime for which he has been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">This statute, \u00a7 18.1-365, made it unlawful to place \u201con the property of another\u201d a burning cross without the written permission \u201cof the owner or occupier of the premises.\u201d This is not language that the average person would consider to be applicable to the sidewalks of a city. The words \u201cproperty of another\u201d in this context would reasonably mean property of another individual, and the word \u201cpremises\u201d ordinarily does not refer to city streets. It is only by inserting into the statute the permissive provision of \u00a7 1-13.19, <em>supra, </em>that this defendant may properly be convicted. The average person would not think that he was committing a felony by doing an act which would be entirely legal if done with the permission of the owner or occupier of the premises affected. He would have to know that under another and different statute the words \u201cproperty of another\u201d in the statute under which he was indicted included property of a city.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>137 Va. 826, at 830, 120 S. E. 138, at 139, this court said that a penal statute cannot be extended by implication or construction, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\u201cTo constitute the offense the act must be both within the letter and spirit of the statute defining it. Those who contend that a penalty is imposed must show that the words of the act distinctly cover the case. No conviction can be had if the words are merely equally capable of a construction that would, and one that would not, inflict the penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u201cIf a penal statute be so ambiguous as to leave reasonable doubt of its meaning, it is the duty of the court to refuse to impose the penalty. * #\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Both the history and the wording of \u00a7 18.1-365 make it doubtful that it was intended to apply to city streets and sidewalks. In its orginial enactment in 1952 its companion sections, as referred to above, specifically were made applicable to public places, while the paragraph now designated as \u00a7 18.1-365 was not, but used language that may well be interpreted to mean what it is customarily taken to mean, <em>i.e., </em>individual persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We hold that the act of burning a cross on a sidewalk in the City of Richmond did not violate \u00a7 18.1-365 of the Code as then written. We therefore reverse the judgment below and dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AUl\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> The General Assembly in 1968 amended \u00a7 18.1-365 to make it read now as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person or persons to place or cause to be placed on the property of another <em>or on public property </em>a burning or a flaming cross, <em>with the intention of intimidating any person, group, or group of persons, </em>or any manner of exhibit in which a burning or flaming cross, real or simulated, is a whole or a part, without first obtaining written permission of the owner or occupier of the premises so to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\"><em>\u201cThe unlawful burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of the intention to intimidate a person or group of </em>persons.\u201d Acts 1968, ch. 350, p. 450.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">The italicized words show the changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b501-8\">Carrico and Gordon, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ais\">dissenting</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">We interpret \u201cproperty of another\u201d, as used in Code \u00a7 18.1-365, to include public as well as private property. In our opinion, such interpretation is dictated by <em>Hanbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 182, 122 S.E.2d 911, and is not inconsistent with the rule of strict construction or the holdings and dicta in <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 661, 119 S.E.2d 817, and <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 72, 49 S.E.2d 369.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
