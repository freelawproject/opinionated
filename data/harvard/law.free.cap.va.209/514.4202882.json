Hughes, Administratrix of the Estate of James R. Hughes, plaintiff, filed a motion for judgment against American Home Assurance Company, defendant. She sought to recover a judgment in the sum of $12,128.38, the unpaid balance on a mortgage, allegedly due her decedent\u2019s estate under \u201ca group mortgage accident and health policy\u201d issued by defendant. The defendant filed an answer in which it in effect denied liability and alleged, among other things, that the policy terminated on January 1, 1966, the date Hughes died. Prior to trial counsel stipulated:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cNow comes Earl F. Wagner, Esquire, attorney for the Plaintiff and John A. K. Donovan, Esquire, attorney for the Defendant, and, in aider of submitting this cause to the Court upon questions of law alone, agree upon the following stipulations and submit them, therefore, to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201c1. That on or about the 1st day of May, 1964, the Defendant Insurance Company issued a * * * mortgage * * * accident and health policy for disability resulting from injury or sickness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c2. That on or about the 18th day of May, 1964, the said James R. Hughes became totally disabled as the result of illness and remained totally disabled until his death on or about the 1st day of January, 1966.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201c3. That the said mortgage concerning which the policy was issued is held and serviced by Weaver Brothers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201c4. That all of the payments to the mortgagee which would be due under the said policy have been paid to August, 1965; that the amount which would be due by mortgage payments from August, 1965 to the date of the death of the said subject would be $512.35.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c5. That the specimen copy of the policy attached hereto is a true specimen of the policy in effect in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201c6. That the issue of law before the Court is whether or not, under this policy contract, .the estate of James R. Hughes is entitled to have the monthly payments on the mortgage paid to Weaver Brothers continuously or in any amount, from the date of said decedent\u2019s death on January 1, A. D., 1966.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">By order entered June 21, 1967, the trial court adjudged that the plaintiff recover from the defendant \u201cthe monthly mortgage payments due Weaver Brothers in the amount of ONE HUNDRED, TWO and 47/100 DOLLARS, payable monthly, from the 1st day of January, 1966 until the balance due on said mortgage be paid <em>* * </em>We granted the defendant a writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The sole issue presented in this appeal is whether the insurer, American Home Assurance Company, is liable under the terms of its policy for any monthly payments due on the mortgage of plaintiff\u2019s decedent after January 1, 1966, the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">The specimen copy of the group mortgage accident and health policy contained in the record provides that American Home Assurance Company agrees with the mortgagee (Weaver Brothers) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cThat it will pay benefits for loss suffered by any Mortgagor of the Mortgagee becoming insured hereunder (herein called Insured Mortgagor) and resulting from injury or sickness, to the extent herein provided and subject to the exceptions, limitations and provisions of this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">######</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cPART I. MONTHLY BENEFIT: When as the result of injury or sickness, as hereinabove defined, the Insured Mortgagor is wholly and continuously disabled and prevented from performing each and every duty pertaining to his occupation for more than-days, the Company will pay periodically, commencing with the_ day of such disability, a daily benefit calculated at the rate of one-thirtieth of the Monthly Benefit stated in the Certificate of Insurance issued to the Insured Mortgagor<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> for the period the Insured Mortgagor <em>is so disabled and under the regular and personal attendance of a legally qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy other than himself, </em>not to exceed twelve consecutive months. After the payment of benefits <em>for </em>twelve consecutive months as aforesaid, and provided the Insured Mortgagor is wholly and continuously disabled and prevented by reason of the same injury or sickness from engaging in each and every occupation or employment for which he is qualified by reason of experience, education or training, <em>and continues under the regular and personal attendance of a legally qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy other than himself, </em>the Company will continue to pay the daily benefit for so long as the Insured Mortgagor is so disabled, but in no event beyond the earliest of the following dates: (1) 25 years from the effective date of insurance of the Insured Mortgagor; (2) the date the Insured Mortgagor attains retirement; (3) the original expiration date of the Insured Mortgagor\u2019s indebtedness with the Mortgagee or the date on which said indebtedness is terminated by reason of prepayment, renewal, refinancing or otherwise. (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cPART IV. INDIVIDUAL TERMINATIONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cThe insurance of any Insured Mortgagor shall terminate on the earliest of the following dates:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201c(1) on the date this policy is terminated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201c(2) on the premium due date if the mortgagee fails to pay the required premium for the Insured Mortgagor, except as the result of inadvertent error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201c(3) on the Insured Mortgagor\u2019s premium due date next following the date the Insured Mortgagor attains retirement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201c(4) on the original expiration date of the Insured Mortgagor\u2019s indebtedness with the Mortgagor [mortgagee] and the date on which said indebtedness is terminated by reason of prepayment, renewal, refinancing or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201cTermination of coverage of any Insured Mortgagor hereunder shall be without prejudice to any claim of such Insured Mortgagor existing prior to such termination for which benefits are otherwise payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">######</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cPART IX. POLICY PROVISIONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201cPhysical Examination: The Company at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the Insured Mortgagor when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">The defendant contends that its insurance contract is a disability policy and not a life insurance policy; that it is unambiguous; that under the terms of the policy the insurer is not obligated to make the monthly payments on the mortgage after the death of the insured mortgagor, and that the trial court erred in ordering the company to make such payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">On the other hand the plaintiff argues, in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment, that the policy does not inform the insured mortgagor \u201cthat once having become wholly and continuously disabled and after having received benefits pursuant to the terms of the contract, if he were to die, all benefits would cease\u201d. She says that if such were intended the policy should have specifically provided for the exclusion. Plaintiff points out that the only reference to \u201clife\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>or \u201cdeath\u201d appears in a provision under the heading of \u201cPayment of Claims\u201d wherein it is stated: \u201cAll indemnities under this policy shall be paid to the mortgagee to the extent of the Mortgagee\u2019s interest herein, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to the Insured Mortgagor if living, otherwise to the estate of the Insured Mortgagor. The interest of the mortgagee in this policy shall be the amount of the indebtedness, if any, owing by the Insured Mortgagor to the Mortgagee at the time claim is made.\u201d Thus, plaintiff says that the contract \u201ccontemplates a wholly and continuous disability\u201d and death \u201cis the most total, wholly continuous and permanent of all disabilities\u201d. In any event, she asserts that the insurance contract is ambiguous and subject to more than one interpretation and should be construed \u201cstrictly in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">\u201cContracts of insurance are to be liberally construed in favor of the insured, but if they are plain and clear and not in violation of law or inconsistent with public policy, we are bound to adhere to their terms. It is the function of the court to construe the language of the contract as written, and the court cannot make a new contract for the parties different from that plainly intended and thus create a liability not assumed by the insurer.\u201d (Citing cases.) <em>Pilot Life </em>v. <em>Crosswhite, </em>206 Va. 558, 561, 145 S.E.2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The policy here involved is a disability policy and not a life insurance policy. It is clear and unambiguous. Under the provisions of \u201cPART I. MONTHLY BENEFIT\u201d, <em>supra, </em>the company agrees to pay benefits while the insured mortgagor \u201cis wholly and continuously disabled\u201d as the result of \u201cinjury or sickness\u201d for the period the. insured mortgagor \u201cis so disabled and under the regular and personal attendance of a legally qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy other than himself, not to exceed twelve consecutive months\u201d. It further provides that after benefits have been paid for that period of time the company will continue to pay benefits until the occurrence of certain events not here pertinent, so long as the insured mortgagor \u201cis wholly and continuously disabled <em>* * * </em>and continues under the regular and personal attendance of a legally qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy other than himself # *</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">As was said in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Penn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>305 Ill. App. 537, 542, 27 N.E.2d 548, 550, \u201cDisability presupposes life. Death is the antithesis of life.\u201d The insurer reserved the right to examine the person of the insured \u201cduring the pendency of a claim\u201d. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Hughes\u2019 death he could no longer be \u201cunder the regular and personal attendance\u201d of a doctor of medicine, which was a condition precedent to the requirement that benefit payments be continued. Clearly, this language imports an intent that the insured mortgagor be alive as a prerequisite to the payment of benefits. When Hughes, the insured mortgagor, died he ceased to be \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">We hold that the insurer, American Home Assurance Company, is not liable under the terms of its policy for any monthly payments due'on the mortgage of plaintiff\u2019s decedent after January 1, 1966, the date his death occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The judgment appealed from is accordingly reversed and final judgment entered here for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> The individual certificate of insurance issued to the insured mortgagor incidental to the group policy does not appear in the record. During oral argument before us counsel for defendant, without objection, distributed a specimen copy. It is labeled \u201cCertificate of Mortgage Accident and Health Insurance.\u201d Similar provisions of \u201cPART I. MONTHLY BENEFIT\u201d are incorporated in the mortgagor\u2019s certificate of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b629-14\"> Similar provisions of \u201cPART IV. INDIVIDUAL TERMINATIONS\u201d and \u201cPART IX. Physical Examination\u201d are incorporated in the mortgagor\u2019s certificate of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
