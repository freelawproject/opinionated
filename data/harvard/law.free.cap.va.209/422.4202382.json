He was, however, found guilty of impaired driving and was fined $100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The defendant appealed the case to the circuit court, and there entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of impaired driving. His counsel then moved to quash the warrant. The motion was denied, and the case was presented to the jury on the charge of impaired driving. The jury found the defendant guilty and fixed his punishment at a fine of $275.00. The trial court approved the jury\u2019s verdict, imposed the fine, and suspended the defendant\u2019s driving privileges for a period of six months. The defendant was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The defendant first contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the warrant. The motion was based, as is the contention here, upon the proposition that the terms of the impaired driving statute, Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not permit his prosecution in circuit court upon a charge of impaired driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The defendant relies upon the last sentence of the second paragraph of Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>rested, prosecuted or convicted for violation of this section except as a lesser included offense of a prosecution for violation of \u00a7 18.1-54. &gt;5</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The defendant argues that the quoted sentence of Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 applies to all trials,, not just the original trial in county court, and makes it a prerequisite to a conviction of impaired driving in any court that the prosecution therein be for a violation of the driving under the influence statute; that his trial in the circuit court was <em>de </em>novo, and he could have been convicted of impaired driving in that court only if there prosecuted on a charge of driving under the influence; and that since he had been already acquitted of driving under the influence in the county court, he could not have been prosecuted again therefor in the circuit court, and hence should not have been there prosecuted for or convicted of impaired driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We are of opinion that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the warrant. A logical analysis of Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 does not permit the interpretation sought by the defendant \u2014an interpretation requiring the automatic dismissal of every charge of impaired driving reaching a court of record on appeal. Such an interpretation would render the statute a virtual nullity, thwarting the obvious legislative purpose sought to be achieved by its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The first paragraph of Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 creates and defines the offense of impaired driving. The first sentence of the second paragraph of the section provides that in every prosecution under Code, \u00a7 18.1-54, the driving under the influence statute, \u201cthe offense with which the accused is charged shall be deemed to include the offense punishable under this section.\u201d The last sentence of the same paragraph provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be arrested, prosecuted or convicted for violation of this section except as a lesser included offense of a prosecution for violation of \u00a7 18.1-54. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The language of Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 makes it clear that impaired driving is a lesser offense included within the driving under the influence statute and punishable in any case arising under the latter statute where the evidence is insufficient to sustain the greater charge but is sufficient to sustain the lesser. It is just as clear that all the legislature sought to insure by the last sentence of the second paragraph of Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 was that no arrest, prosecution, or conviction should emanate from an original charge of impaired driving, independent of and separate from a charge of driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">But when a person is charged originally with driving under the influence, he may be convicted of the lesser offense of impaired driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>rather than the greater offense, if the circumstances warrant,, at his trial in a court not of record or on his appeal of right to a court of record, notwithstanding his acquittal in either court of the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Here, the defendant was arrested for and charged in a warrant with driving under the influence. Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 became applicable, therefore, to permit his conviction of impaired driving in county court. While the trial of the lesser offense on appeal was <em>de novo, </em>it was proper for the trial judge to look at the warrant to see that the original charge was driving under the influence and to hold that the defendant should stand trial for impaired driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The defendant\u2019s next, and final, contention is that the definition of impaired driving contained in Code, \u00a7 18.1-56.1 is so vague and indefinite as to render the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The Code section provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate one of the vehicles enumerated therein while his ability to drive or operate such vehicle is impaired by the presence of alcohol in his blood. The section then states that a \u201cperson\u2019s ability to drive or operate such a vehicle shall be deemed to be impaired by the presence of alcohol in his blood within the meaning of this section when such person has so indulged in alcoholic intoxicants as to lack the clearness of intellect and control of himself which he would otherwise possess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 454, 458, 94 S. E. 2d 537, 540 (1956), the rules for testing the validity of a statute, in face of an attack of vagueness, were set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">\u201cIt is elementary that an act creating a statutory offense, to be valid, must specify with reasonable certainty and definiteness the conduct which is commanded or prohibited, that is, what must be done or avoided, so that a person of ordinary intelligence may know what is thereby required of him. . . . The enactment should define the acts to be done or not to be done which constitute such offense with such certainty that a person may determine whether or not he has violated the law at the time he does or fails to do the act, which is charged to be a violation thereof. . . . Unless an act creating a statutory offense satisfies this requirement of certainty and definiteness it violates the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the Virginia Constitution. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">We are of opinion that the statutory definition of impaired driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ing passes the foregoing tests and is not vague and indefinite. The words employed are in everyday usage and should be given their natural and familiar meaning. Any person of ordinary intelligence reading the definition should know what is prohibited and what he must refrain from doing if he is not to violate the statute and incur its penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Finding the defendant\u2019s contentions to be without merit, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 18.1-56.1. <em>Driving automobile, engine, etc., while ability to drive is impaired by alcohol. </em>\u2014 It shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any automobile or other motor vehicle, car, truck, engine or train while such person\u2019s ability to drive or operate such vehicle is impaired by the presence of alcohol in his blood.
