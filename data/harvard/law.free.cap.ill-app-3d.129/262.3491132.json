Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 38, pars. 11\u2014 4(a)(2), (a)(3)), defendant was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals, contending that his guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p id=\"b285-8\" pgmap=\"285\">We affirm, and pertinent to our disposition are the following:</p> <p id=\"b285-9\" pgmap=\"285\">The victim, D.J., a nine-year-old boy, testified that he lived with his mother, two sisters and his mother\u2019s boyfriend; that on March 30, 1983, he fell asleep on the couch in the living room after watching defendant do some card tricks; that his mother awakened him and sent him to bed at about 8 p.m.; that he went to his bedroom and lay down on his bed fully clothed and fell asleep on top of the covers. He woke up when the defendant came in, but fell back asleep. Defendant woke him up again and took his clothes off, including his underpants. Then defendant took off his own clothes and got into bed with him, holding him close to him with one hand on his mouth and the other around his waist. Defendant then tried to put his \u201cthing\u201d in his butt. For the next 15 minutes he felt the defendant\u2019s hard \u201cthing\u201d by his butt, and the defendant kissed him on the side of his jaw five times. He noticed alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath. After about 15 minutes, the defendant got up and went to the adjoining bed, which was 18 inches away, and fell asleep. D.J. further testified that when he became sure that the defendant was asleep, he got up and went to the bathroom. Then he went to his mother\u2019s bedroom, which was 15 feet away, and told her that the defendant took off his socks, shirt, pants and underpants and tried to put his \u201cthing\u201d in his butt. She told him to lie down, and, after she thought about it, she got up and went to the telephone across the street and called the police. There are no doors on D.J.\u2019s bedroom or his mother\u2019s bedroom. He admitted that he made no attempt to stop the defendant\u2019s actions, nor did he object to defendant\u2019s undressing him, nor did he fight him off when the defendant attempted to put his \u201cthing\u201d into his butt. He admitted the defendant never threatened him. He also admitted he was angry with the defendant for his refusal to teach him a card trick.</p> <p id=\"b285-10\" pgmap=\"285(21) 286(70)\">D.J.\u2019s mother substantially corroborated his testimony, adding that the defendant is a brother of her boyfriend and that he had just come in from Memphis to seek a job. She was in her bedroom with her boyfriend when D.J. came in and related the occurrence. She stated that it took several moments for her to awaken and understand the full meaning of what her son had said, then she called the police. She took D.J. to the hospital for examination. It was stipulated that there were no visible injuries to him.</p> <p id=\"b286-5\" pgmap=\"286\">Defendant testified on his own behalf that when he entered the bedroom and saw D.J. sleeping in his clothes he woke him and told him to take his clothes off; that D.J. took all but his underwear off and got under the covers; that he then undressed himself and went to sleep in the adjoining bed after he finished smoking his cigarette. He was later awakened by the police and denied doing anything. He admitted that he had three or four shots of whiskey that night.</p> <p id=\"b286-6\" pgmap=\"286\">Opinion</p> <p id=\"b286-7\" pgmap=\"286\">Defendant contends now, as he did in the trial court, that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the evidence was not clear and convincing nor sufficiently corroborated.</p> <p id=\"b286-8\" pgmap=\"286\">He urges this court to place itself in the position of reviewing the factfinder\u2019s determination of the credibility of the witnesses. He points to discrepancies in the testimony of D.J. and his mother and his own testimony. He maintains that D.J. first said that defendant stuck his \u201cthing\u201d in his butt, but later said he attempted to stick his \u201cthing\u201d in his butt. He further notes that D.J. did not cry out or struggle to avoid the act and that the medical report did not indicate any trauma from the purported act.</p> <p id=\"b286-9\" pgmap=\"286\">Our supreme court has held that force is not material to the offense of taking indecent liberties with a child and that acquiescence or failure to resist is no defense to such a charge. (See People v. Guertin (1930), 342 Ill. 99, 104, 173 N.E. 824.) Even consent by the victim is irrelevant (People v. Mullen (1980), 80 Ill. App. 3d 369, 379, 399 N.E.2d 639), and anal penetration is not necessary to secure a conviction (People v. Oliver (1976), 38 Ill. App. 3d 166, 170, 347 N.E.2d 865).</p> <p id=\"b286-10\" pgmap=\"286\">Defendant maintains that because the victim D.J.\u2019s testimony was not clear and convincing nor sufficiently corroborated it was not sufficient to sustain his conviction.</p> <p id=\"b286-11\" pgmap=\"286(64) 287(1)\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s contention. It is well established that it is for the trier of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and where the evidence is conflicting a court of review will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. People v. Akis (1976), 63 Ill. 2d 296, 347 N.E .2d 733.</p> <p id=\"b287-5\" pgmap=\"287\">The trial court here observed that D.J. was a nine-year-old boy; that the defendant was a grown man; and that D.J. promptly told his mother of the defendant\u2019s conduct. Before permitting him to testify, the trial judge examined D.J. as to his understanding of the importance of the oath which he was asked to take and the obligation to tell the truth, and the judge concluded that he was competent. The trial court observed the demeanor and heard the testimony of all the witnesses, considered the forensic evidence, and concluded that the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove defendant\u2019s guilt. Our review of the record does not disclose any basis to indicate that the trial court\u2019s evaluation was erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b287-6\" pgmap=\"287\">The cases relied upon by defendant are distinguishable. People v. Kolden (1962), 25 Ill. 2d 327, 185 N.E.2d 170, involved a complainant who reported the indecent act the day after it allegedly happened but denied the act the same day; she testified that defendant touched her \u201cprivates,\u201d but admitted on cross-examination that she did not know what \u201cprivates\u201d meant, nor did she know where defendant had placed his hand. In People v. Morgan (1977), 69 Ill. 2d 200, 370 N.E.2d 1063, the complainant waited two days to report an alleged indecent act, told several inconsistent versions to different people at different times, and, according to her schoolteacher, had a history of telling wild stories. The court there concluded: \u201cWhere the complainant\u2019s testimony is substantially impeached by prior inconsistent statements and a history of fabrication, we will not sustain a conviction based on other testimony which is at best speculative.\u201d (69 Ill. 2d 200, 208.) By contrast, D.J.\u2019s testimony here was plausible, straightforward and consistent. A reading of this record which finds circumstances similar to Kolden or Morgan is, in our view, fanciful.</p> <p id=\"b287-7\" pgmap=\"287\">The judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is therefore affirmed. Pursuant to People v. Nicholls (1978), 71 Ill. 2d 166, 374 N.E.2d 194, we grant the State\u2019s request that defendant be assessed $50 as costs for the State\u2019s defending this appeal and incorporate it as part of our judgment.</p> <p id=\"b287-8\" pgmap=\"287\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b287-9\" pgmap=\"287\">MEJDA, P.J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b287-10\" pgmap=\"287\">JUSTICE PINCHAM,</author> <p id=\"AJI\" pgmap=\"287\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b287-11\" pgmap=\"287(27) 288(76)\">It is the province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence. It is likewise the duty of this court to review the evidence, and, if it is improbable, unsatisfactory or insufficient to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to reverse the conviction. A review of the evidence in this case reveals that it is improbable, unsatisfactory, unclear and unconvincing, uncorroborated and unsubstantiated and does not establish the defendant\u2019s guilt of indecent liberties with a child beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore dissent. The complete pertinent testimony of the three trial witnesses follows.</p> <p id=\"b288-5\" pgmap=\"288\">D.J. testified on direct examination that he was nine years old, in the fourth grade and on March 13, 1983, he lived at 901 West 51st Street with his mother, father, two sisters and Horace Hunter, the defendant. On that evening he was asleep on the living room couch, and about 8 o\u2019clock his mother woke him up, he went into his bedroom and went to sleep. He did not undress before he went to sleep. There were two beds in the bedroom, and Horace slept in one of them and he slept in the other. After he went to sleep, the. next thing he remembered was that Horace came into the room and woke him up. He went back to sleep. He was still dressed. Horace woke him up a second time and took off his socks, shirt, pants and underpants. Horace was dressed- at that time, and Horace then took off his own clothes:</p> <blockquote id=\"b288-6\" pgmap=\"288\">' \u201cQ. When Horace took off his clothes what, if anything, did Horace do next?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-7\" pgmap=\"288\">A. He put his thing in my butt. He tried to.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-8\" pgmap=\"288\">Q. Now, were you in bed at the time that Horace took off your clothes?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-9\" pgmap=\"288\">A. Yeah.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-10\" pgmap=\"288\">Q. Did Horace, when he did that to you, get into your bed or did you get into his bed?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-11\" pgmap=\"288\">A. Mine.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-12\" pgmap=\"288\">Q. And when you say Horace put his thing, tried to put his thing into your butt, what, if anything, did he do? How did he get into your bed to do that? Explain it to the Court.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b288-13\" pgmap=\"288\">A. He held my mouth and did like this and put his hand under my waist.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b288-14\" pgmap=\"288\">When Horace had his hand over D.J.\u2019s mouth and his other hand over his stomach, he felt something at his butt. It felt like 1 \u2018his thing and it was hard.\u201d He was in that position 15 minutes. Horace kissed him five times on the jaw, and he noticed that Horace had liquor on his breath:</p> <blockquote id=\"b288-15\" pgmap=\"288\">\u201cQ. When Horace finished this 15 minutes that you are talking about, what, if anything, did Horace do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-2\" pgmap=\"289\">A. Got up.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-3\" pgmap=\"289\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-4\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. Where did Horace go?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-5\" pgmap=\"289\">A. In his bed.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-6\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. Is that the other bed in the room?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-7\" pgmap=\"289\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-8\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. And what did you do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-9\" pgmap=\"289\">A. I waited until he went to sleep.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-10\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. When he fell asleep, what did you do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-11\" pgmap=\"289\">A. Got up and went to the bathroom.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-12\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. After you went to the bathroom, where did you go?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-13\" pgmap=\"289\">A. I told my mother.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b289-14\" pgmap=\"289\">His mother was in another room in the apartment and he told her that Horace took off his socks, pants, shirt, underwear and tried to put his thing in his \u201cbutt\u201d:</p> <blockquote id=\"b289-15\" pgmap=\"289\">\u201cQ. And what did your mother do after you told her that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-16\" pgmap=\"289\">A. She told me to lay down and she thought about it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-17\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. Where was that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-18\" pgmap=\"289\">A. She thought about it. She got up.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b289-19\" pgmap=\"289\">She went to the telephone booth, and shortly thereafter the police came and Horace was arrested.</p> <p id=\"b289-20\" pgmap=\"289\">D.J. testified on cross-examination that Horace Hunter was his father\u2019s brother. Horace didn\u2019t normally live with them, and he was only there for about three days. He, D.J., did not normally sleep in that room alone. His sister usually slept there with him, but Horace was sleeping in his sister\u2019s bed at that time:</p> <blockquote id=\"b289-21\" pgmap=\"289\">\u201cQ. Is there any door on this bedroom?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-22\" pgmap=\"289\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-23\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. And your mother and father sleep in a bedroom close to your bedroom, is that right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-24\" pgmap=\"289\">A. Right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-25\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. Is there any door on their bedroom?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-26\" pgmap=\"289\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-27\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. How many feet would you say the door of your bedroom is from the door of your parents\u2019 bedroom?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-28\" pgmap=\"289\">A. About 15.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-29\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. Is there any curtain on your bedroom door?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-30\" pgmap=\"289\">A. Curtain?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-31\" pgmap=\"289\">Q. Curtain like on a window. Is there any curtain or something hanging over your parents\u2019 bedroom?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b289-32\" pgmap=\"289\">A. (Shaking head.)\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b289-33\" pgmap=\"289(11) 290(65)\">Right after supper, Horace showed D.J. and his sister card tricks played with three cards, and they had to guess what card Horace was trying to hide from them. Horace hid the card and he could never find it. Horace let his sister find the card, and he asked Horace to show him the trick. Horace said he was not going to show him the trick. D.J. didn\u2019t like that, and he was mad at Horace.</p> <p id=\"b290-5\" pgmap=\"290\">After Horace showed him the card tricks, the adults played cards and he fell asleep. His mother told him to go to his bedroom, which he did, and he fell asleep on his bed. When Horace came into the bedroom, he first tried to wake him up. He got up but Horace thought he was asleep. Horace did not tell him to take his clothes off; Horace took them off:</p> <blockquote id=\"b290-6\" pgmap=\"290\">\u201cQ. When Horace was taking your clothes off, did you ever say to Horace not to do it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-7\" pgmap=\"290\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-8\" pgmap=\"290\">Q. Did you ever tell Horace to stop it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-9\" pgmap=\"290\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-10\" pgmap=\"290\">Q. Did you ever yell out for your mother?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-11\" pgmap=\"290\">A. I couldn\u2019t, he was holding my mouth.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-12\" pgmap=\"290\">Q. And now you say he had his hand over your mouth, is that right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-13\" pgmap=\"290\">A. Right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-14\" pgmap=\"290\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-15\" pgmap=\"290\">Q. Did he make you take your clothes off?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-16\" pgmap=\"290\">A. Um-hmm.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-17\" pgmap=\"290\">Q. He took them off himself, right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-18\" pgmap=\"290\">A. Right.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b290-19\" pgmap=\"290\">Once Horace took D.J.\u2019s clothes off, Horace then took his clothes off. Horace was standing on the floor when he took his clothes off. He used both his hands to take his clothes off, during which Horace did not have his hands over D.J.\u2019s mouth. Horace did not threaten him at that time. After Horace took off his clothes, he got back in bed with D.J. and tried to put his penis in his \u201cbutt.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b290-20\" pgmap=\"290\">D.J. remembered testifying in another courtroom downstairs on April 15 of this year:</p> <blockquote id=\"b290-21\" pgmap=\"290\">\u201cQ. Do you remember \u2014 page 10 and 11 \u2014 do you remember a State\u2019s Attorney asking you this question: \u2018What happened while you were in the bedroom that day?\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-22\" pgmap=\"290\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-23\" pgmap=\"290\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b290-24\" pgmap=\"290\">MR. GOLNEWICZ: Further down you answer, \u2018He took off my socks and my pants and my shirt and he took off my underclothes. Then he put his penis in my butt.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-4\" pgmap=\"291\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b291-5\" pgmap=\"291\">At trial D.J. said that he told his mother that Horace \u201ctried\u201d to put his penis in his butt. When Horace tried to put his penis in his butt, he did not cry out. He did not ask his mother or his father for help. Horace did not threaten him nor tell him not to tell anybody. D.J. testified further:</p> <blockquote id=\"b291-6\" pgmap=\"291\">\u201cQ. When Horace was trying to put his penis in your butt, as you say, did you try to fight him off or anything like that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-7\" pgmap=\"291\">A. I turned around.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-8\" pgmap=\"291\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-9\" pgmap=\"291\">Q. How long was Horace\u2019s penis in your butt?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-10\" pgmap=\"291\">MR. KLAPMAN: Objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-11\" pgmap=\"291\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-12\" pgmap=\"291\">THE WITNESS: About 20 minutes.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b291-13\" pgmap=\"291\">After he told his mother, the police came and took him to the hospital where he was examined by a doctor.</p> <p id=\"b291-14\" pgmap=\"291\">D.J.\u2019s mother testified on direct examination that on March 30-31, Horace Hunter was staying at her house. Horace Hunter, her boyfriend\u2019s brother, had been staying there for three days. He came from Memphis, Tennessee, had no place to stay, and he was sleeping in the room of D.J. and his sister. There were two beds in the room, one for D.J. and one for his sister. Horace was staying in the bed of D.J.\u2019s sister.</p> <p id=\"b291-15\" pgmap=\"291\">At approximately 10:30 or 11 that night she, her boyfriend and Horace had been drinking and playing cards. After they finished playing cards, Horace left, went in the room and said he was going to' bed. Her daughter was not staying in the bedroom at that time; she was on the couch. At about midnight D.J. came into her bedroom. Her boyfriend, Frederick Hunter, was in the bedroom when D.J. came in. D.J.\u2019s mother testified:</p> <blockquote id=\"b291-16\" pgmap=\"291\">\u201cQ. Now, when D.J. came in what did [he] tell you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-17\" pgmap=\"291\">A. He woke me up and said he didn\u2019t want to sleep in that room no more.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-18\" pgmap=\"291\">Q. What happened next?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-19\" pgmap=\"291\">A. And I asked him why. He said Horace tried to do something to him. Then I asked him what did he try to do? He said he pulled off his socks and pulled off his pants and blouse \u2014 I mean his shirt and took \u2014 he said his thing and put it in his butt.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-20\" pgmap=\"291\">Q. Did he say anything else to you about what Horace did?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b291-21\" pgmap=\"291\">A. And then he said \u2014 and I asked him what else did he do? And he said kissed him five times on the jaw.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-4\" pgmap=\"292\">Q. What did you do after D.J. told you that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">A. Well, when he told me, you know, when he woke me up I was kind of half sleep and half woke. I really didn\u2019t pay no attention to it. I laid back down and then I thought of what he said and I got up and I told my old man and I told my son, and I told him stay in the room and don\u2019t come out of the room. I was going to call the police. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b292-6\" pgmap=\"292\">D.J.\u2019s mother went across the street to a tavern. D.J. stayed with Frederick when she went to call the police. She returned to the apartment and the police arrived. She took D.J. to Englewood Hospital.</p> <p id=\"b292-7\" pgmap=\"292\">D.J.\u2019s mother testified on cross-examination that the bedroom that she and Frederick slept in did not have a door, and there was no door to the bedroom in which Horace and D.J. slept. Her bedroom door is about 15 feet from Horace\u2019s and D.J.\u2019s bedroom door. D.J. was not crying and she didn\u2019t know if he was in pain when he first came to her; he just came in and woke her up. D.J. never said that Horace \u201cstuck his thing in his butt.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b292-8\" pgmap=\"292\">D.J.\u2019s mother testified at the preliminary hearing on April 15:</p> <blockquote id=\"b292-9\" pgmap=\"292\">\u201cQ. Did someone ask you this question and did you give this answer:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-10\" pgmap=\"292\">\u2018Q. Whose drawers were on?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-11\" pgmap=\"292\">A. My son. And said he pulled them down in the back and stuck his penis in him.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-12\" pgmap=\"292\">Q. Did you give that answer to that question?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-13\" pgmap=\"292\">A. They must have wrote it down in the wrong way, but he said he tried to.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-14\" pgmap=\"292\">Q. But then you are saying that you did not give that answer?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b292-15\" pgmap=\"292\">A. I might have gave the answer.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b292-16\" pgmap=\"292\">Horace Hunter, the defendant, testified on direct examination that he lived at 2682 McDonald in Memphis with his mother, \u201chis lady,\u201d and his two children. He recently came to Chicago. He received a phone call from his brother, who told him that there were going to be job openings in Chicago and he asked if he could come up. Hunter arrived on Monday, March 28, 1983, and stayed with his brother at 901 West 51st Street, where D.J.\u2019s mother, her two little kids and D.J. lived. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Hunter and his brother, Fred, went looking for a job. They did not have any luck, and they returned to the apartment about 5 p.m. D.J.\u2019s mother and her kids were there when they returned. Later, Fred and D.J.\u2019s mother went to the store, and they were gone between 45 minutes and an hour. When they came back they set out the groceries and had supper.</p> <p id=\"b293-4\" pgmap=\"293\">After supper Horace showed D.J. and his sister a card trick, three-card molly. The object of the game was to find one card among three. Horace teased D.J.; Horace would throw the card and wouldn\u2019t let D.J. find it, but he would let his sister find it. D.J. asked Horace to show him the trick, but Horace would not do so and D.J. could not find the card. D.J. seemed to be angry. D.J.\u2019s mother came over and said, \u201cCut out playing and let\u2019s get down on some spade, 3-handed spade.\u201d The three adults played spades. They started about 8 and played up until about 11 or 12 o\u2019clock. They were drinking from a fifth of G&amp;J Brandy and a six-pack of beer. Over the three-hour period they did not drink \u201chalf of it.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b293-5\" pgmap=\"293\">After the adults finished playing cards, D.J.\u2019s mother and Fred said they were going to turn in and asked Hunter to lift out the couch and \u201cturn the kids in.\u201d D.J.\u2019s sister was sleeping on the couch. D.J.\u2019s mother told him, Horace, to wake D.J. up and \u201cturn him in.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b293-6\" pgmap=\"293\">Hunter went out to the porch, smoked a cigarette and came back into the bedroom where he and D.J. were staying. D.J. was lying on the bed on top of the covers fully clothed. Hunter shook D.J. and told him to take off his clothes. D.J. said there was a knot in his tennis shoe and asked Hunter to take it out, which Hunter did. D.J. took off his clothes. Hunter did not take off any of D.J.\u2019s clothes. D.J. took off his own clothes down to his underwear and got back in the bed, under the cover.</p> <p id=\"b293-7\" pgmap=\"293\">There were two beds in the bedroom, about 18 inches apart. There was no door on the bedroom, just an opening. Hunter\u2019s brother, Frederick, and D.J.\u2019s mother slept in another bedroom, which was about six to nine feet from Hunter\u2019s bedroom door. There was no door on that bedroom either, just an open doorway.</p> <p id=\"b293-8\" pgmap=\"293\">After D.J. went to bed, Hunter sat on his bed, smoked the rest of his cigarette, took off his clothes, lay down and went to sleep. The next thing he remembered, \u201cthe police bust in, had the flashlight and throwed the gun on me and told me I was under arrest.\u201d Hunter stepped out of the bedroom and asked D.J.\u2019s mother what was the problem. Hunter testified he did not sexually assault, hit or try to lewdly fondle D.J.</p> <p id=\"b293-9\" pgmap=\"293\">On cross-examination the defendant, Horace Hunter, testified that he drank about three or four shot glasses of whiskey; that D.J. got up and \u201ctook all of his clothes off himself\u201d; that within the last 10 years he had been in the penitentiary in Tennessee for burglary.</p> <p id=\"b293-10\" pgmap=\"293\">The following stipulation was presented:</p> <blockquote id=\"b293-11\" pgmap=\"293(21) 294(63)\">\u201cMR. GOLNEWICZ: Judge, there will be a stipulation by and between the parties of a medical examination by Dr. Lee, which is memoralized in a three-page report ***. What in essence this medical report does say is on March 31st this year at approximately 12:35 in the morning a Dr. Lee examined D.J. After taking various vital statistics under his physical findings, treatment and time he finds no bruises, chest is clear, soft, flat rectal, no bruises, no lacerations. So stipulated?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b294-5\" pgmap=\"294\">MR. KLAPMAN: So stipulated.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b294-6\" pgmap=\"294\">On this evidence the trial court found, \u201cThe record amply supports a finding of guilty of attempt of anal intercourse which constitutes indecent liberties with a child.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b294-7\" pgmap=\"294\">In People v. Morgan (1977), 69 Ill. 2d 200, 370 N.E.2d 1063, following a bench trial the defendant was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a nine-year-old child. A divided appellate court reversed the conviction on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On the State\u2019s request for leave to appeal, our supreme court affirmed the appellate court\u2019s reversal. In Morgan, the mother of the child-victim testified that the defendant visited them in their home shortly after supper, that the defendant drank a \u201cbeer or two\u201d with the victim\u2019s mother and her husband, while the victim played and watched T.V. The mother testified further that the defendant fell asleep on the sofa and that she later sent the child-victim to bed. Because she could not awaken the defendant she left him asleep on the sofa. She and her husband then went to bed. The following morning, when she arose, the defendant was gone. It was during the night, the victim-child testified, that the defendant entered her bedroom, awakened her and took her in the living room, pulled down her underpants and kissed her on her \u201ccrotch.\u201d The victim later felt a burning and itching sensation in her vaginal area and her grandmother testified that the area was red and irritated. The defendant denied the allegations and denied being at the victim\u2019s home on the date of the alleged offense. The trial judge held that the testimony of the victim\u2019s grandmother was corroboration and specifically stated that it \u201cbelieved the testimony of the little girl and particularly the mother of this little girl in this situation,\u201d strikingly similar to the trial court\u2019s statement in the case at bar. The State argued in Morgan, as the State argues in the case at bar, that the victim\u2019s testimony \u201cwas clear and convincing as well as corroborated, and that the question of the witness\u2019 credibility was one for the trial court.\u201d In affirming and holding that the appellate court properly reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, our supreme court stated, in language most applicable to the case at bar:</p> <blockquote id=\"b294-8\" pgmap=\"294(8) 295(18)\">\u201cContrary to the State\u2019s contention, the complainant\u2019s testimony was neither clear and convincing nor substantially corroborated, as required in cases of this nature. [Citations.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b295-5\" pgmap=\"295\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b295-6\" pgmap=\"295\">While due weight must be given to the trier of fact as to the credibility of the witnesses, \u2018it is our duty to reverse the judgment if the evidence is not sufficient to remove all reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt and create an abiding conviction that he is guilty of the crime charged.\u2019 [Citations.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b295-7\" pgmap=\"295\">The only corroborative evidence supporting the complainant\u2019s testimony was that of her parents and the grandmother, neither of which constituted substantial corroboration. The parents\u2019 testimony merely placed the defendant in their trailer home on March 14. Although this testimony constituted some corroboration, in People v. Kolden (1962), 25 Ill. 2d 327, [185 N.E.2d 170], *** this court held that merely placing the defendant in the house with the complainant was not, alone, sufficient corroboration to sustain a conviction where the complainant\u2019s testimony was otherwise unconvincing.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b295-8\" pgmap=\"295\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b295-9\" pgmap=\"295\">While we are cognizant of the difficulties in adducing proof in cases of this type, this does not vitiate the traditional requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) People v. Morgan (1977), 69 Ill. 2d 200, 206-208.</blockquote> <p id=\"b295-10\" pgmap=\"295\">In People v. Nunes (1964), 30 Ill. 2d 143, 195 N.E.2d 706, the jury found the defendant guilty of taking indecent liberties with a 12-year-old girl. The defendant contended on review that the testimony of the victim and her 12-year-old girlfriend that the defendant prevailed upon the victim to sit on his lap, and thereafter put his arm around her, kissed and fondled her and induced her to touch his private parts was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Our supreme court agreed and, in reversing the conviction, held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b295-11\" pgmap=\"295(115) 296(11)\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that a charge of indecent liberties is an accusation easily made, hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused. [Citations.] In such cases reviewing courts are especially charged with the duty of carefully examining the evidence, and while due weight must be given to the judgment of the jury as to the credibility of the witnesses, it is our duty to reverse the judgment if the evidence is not sufficient to remove all reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt and create an abiding conviction that he is guilty of the crime charged. In our opinion the testimony of the two girls was not sufficient to remove all reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b296-4\" pgmap=\"296\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b296-5\" pgmap=\"296\">It cannot be said in the face of the contradictions and the improbabilities in the testimony of the two girls that the evidence creates an abiding conviction of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) People v. Nunes (1964), 30 Ill. 2d 143, 146-47.</blockquote> <p id=\"b296-6\" pgmap=\"296\">In People v. Kolden (1962), 25 Ill. 2d 327, 185 N.E.2d 170, as in the case at bar, the victim was nine years of age and the defendant was found guilty by the court of taking indecent liberties with a child. On review he contended for reversal that the evidence failed to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In Kolden, the victim testified that the defendant told her to touch his private parts, but the conversation was interrupted when the defendant answered her brother\u2019s knock at the bathroom door. The victim testified that later that day in the bedroom the defendant \u201cput his finger in my private.\u201d The defendant testified and denied the misconduct attributed to him. In reversing, our supreme court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b296-7\" pgmap=\"296\">\u201cIt is well settled in Illinois that where a conviction for taking indecent liberties with a child depends on the testimony of the prosecuting witness, and the defendant denies the charge, there must be substantial corroboration of her testimony, or the testimony must be otherwise clear and convincing. [Citations.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b296-9\" pgmap=\"296\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b296-10\" pgmap=\"296\">We think it clear that in the absence of substantial corroboration, the testimony of this 9-year-old prosecutrix is not so clear and convincing as to sustain a conviction. The State does not deny the need for corroboration ***.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b296-12\" pgmap=\"296\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b296-13\" pgmap=\"296\">While we are cognizant of the difficulties in adducing proof in cases of this type, and the susceptibility of small children to confusion upon cross-examination, the very odium and prejudice arising from such a charge requires that the courts do not vitiate the traditional requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. From the record before us we are convinced that the State has failed to sustain this burden.\u201d (Emphasis added.) People v. Kolden (1962), 25 Ill. 2d 327, 329-30, 185 N.E.2d 170.</blockquote> <p id=\"b296-14\" pgmap=\"296(50) 297(91)\">In the case at bar, the trial judge did not accommodate his finding with specific designations of the record which he found \u201camply supported]\u201d the guilty finding, and my diligent search of the record fails to reveal it. In the case at bar not one iota of corroborative evidence of D.J.\u2019s testimony was presented. In fact, in those instances in which corroborative evidence would have certainly occurred, no such corroborative evidence was presented or existed. The absence of such corroborative evidence creates a reasonable doubt of guilt. Moreover, the State\u2019s evidence is so improbable, unsatisfactory and bizarre that it creates a reasonable doubt of guilt. Further, the defendant\u2019s testimony that D.J. was angry with him is not only uncontradicted, but in fact it is corroborated by D.J.\u2019s testimonial admission that he was angry with the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b297-5\" pgmap=\"297\">The act of attempted anal intercourse with D.J. purportedly occurred in D.J.\u2019s open-door bedroom, within a few feet of his mother\u2019s open-door bedroom. D.J. knew his mother was within easy hearing distance. Yet, there was no outcry by him to his ever-protective guardian. D.J. did not actually testify that the defendant held his hand over his mouth during the contended 15- or 20-minute effort, and his testimony of his inability to yell, scream or make a single outcry to his mother during the entire episode that he relates is unconvincing.</p> <p id=\"b297-6\" pgmap=\"297\">D.J. did not \u201cpromptly\u201d tell \u201chis mother of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d as the majority states. D.J.\u2019s testimony was that after the purported anal intercourse attempt, he waited for the defendant to go to sleep. He was not asked, he did not testify, and the evidence does not reveal how long he ostensibly waited for the defendant to go to sleep.</p> <p id=\"b297-7\" pgmap=\"297\">D.J. testified that he went to the bathroom, after he waited for the defendant to go to sleep. There is not one scintilla of evidence in this record to reveal the location of the bathroom, with relation to D.J.\u2019s bedroom or his mother\u2019s bedroom or otherwise. Whether D.J. went away from, toward or by his mother to get to the bathroom from his bedroom is undisclosed. More importantly, there is no evidence of the length of time D.J. remained in the bathroom, for what reason he went there, or what he did while there.</p> <p id=\"b297-8\" pgmap=\"297\">The evidence is that D.J. went to his mother\u2019s bedroom from the bathroom, and in response to several inquiries from his mother, he told her that the defendant had committed acts which constituted attempted anal intercourse. D.J. was not asked and did not testify to his physical or emotional state at that point. His mother testified, however, that D.J. was not crying and she did not know if he was in pain when he came in her bedroom. This testimony was elicited on cross-examination, and she was not otherwise asked nor did she otherwise testify to D.J.\u2019s physical or emotional state.</p> <p id=\"b297-9\" pgmap=\"297(22) 298(77)\">D.J.\u2019s testimony was that the defendant completely disrobed him. Yet, neither D.J. nor his mother was asked, nor did either testify and the record is completely silent on, whether D.J. was nude when he ostensibly reported the alleged incident to his mother. D.J. was not asked, he did not testify and the record is silent on whether D.J. remained nude or put on some clothing after the episode which he related and before he told his mother about it. Fleeing nude to his mother would have been at least corroborative of his having been disrobed.</p> <p id=\"b298-5\" pgmap=\"298\">D.J.\u2019s testimony that the incident related by him took place in his bed, over a 15- to 20-minute interlude, during which he was unable to scream because the defendant had his hand over his mouth, coupled with the defendant\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to insert his penis in D.J.\u2019s anus, would indicate some degree of struggle in D.J.\u2019s bed. Yet, there is not one descriptive testimonial word in this record of the condition of D.J.\u2019s bed after this specious act. This, too, would have been corroborative evidence.</p> <p id=\"b298-6\" pgmap=\"298\">D.J. testified that the defendant was completely disrobed and was nude when he committed the unauthenticated acts D.J. attributes to him. Yet, D.J. was not asked and did not testify whether the defendant put on any clothing, underwear or sleeping apparel after the incident. Nor was D.J., his mother or the arresting officer asked and neither testified whether the defendant was nude when the officer awakened and arrested him. This, too, would have been corroborative of D.J.\u2019s testimony.</p> <p id=\"b298-7\" pgmap=\"298\">D.J. was promptly examined by a physician. The medical examination would be expected to corroborate D.J.\u2019s testimony of a 15- to 20-minute forcible attempt at anal intercourse with a \u201chard\u201d penis. But it did not do so. The defense presented, by stipulation, the doctor\u2019s examination of D.J., which was that D.J. had a \u201csoft, flat rectal, no bruises, no lacerations.\u201d Even a slight tenderness in D.J.\u2019s rectal area seemingly would have been present to corroborate D.J.\u2019s testimony, but no such evidence was presented. Thus, the testimony of the \u201cforensic scientists\u201d does not substantiate the trial judge\u2019s guilty finding. Rather, it lends itself to the defendant\u2019s innocence.</p> <p id=\"b298-8\" pgmap=\"298(97) 299(32)\">D.J.\u2019s testimony is bizarre, improbable and unconvincing. The defendant\u2019s testimony that D.J.\u2019s mother asked him to \u201cturn the kids in\u201d on the other hand is uncontradicted. Moreover, it is nothing less than preposterous and unpersuasive that the defendant, with knowledge that D.J.\u2019s mother and his own brother were in an adjoining, open-door room only a few feet away, forcibly disrobed D.J., then completely disrobed himself, got in D.J.\u2019s bed and for 15 to 20 minutes forcibly but unsuccessfully attempted to insert his erected penis in this young lad\u2019s anus, while successfully restraining him from making an outcry. Thereafter, according to the State, the defendant promptly got in his bed only a few feet from D.J.\u2019s bed and there slept until the police arrived and arrested him.</p> <p id=\"b299-5\" pgmap=\"299\">In People v. Kepler (1966), 76 Ill. App. 2d 135, 221 N.E.2d 801, it was the bizarre testimony of the victim that the defendant forcibly and against her will had sex with her and thereafter drove her home that created a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. In reversing the rape conviction, the court held, in language most applicable to the case at bar:</p> <blockquote id=\"b299-6\" pgmap=\"299\">\u201cA reviewing court will not hesitate to reverse a conviction where, after a review of all the evidence, there exists a grave and substantial doubt as to the guilt of the defendant due to a lack of credible evidence or the existence of improbable or unsatisfactory evidence.\u201d 76 Ill. App. 2d 135, 141, 221 N.E.2d 801.</blockquote> <p id=\"b299-7\" pgmap=\"299\">In People v. Szybeko (1962), 24 Ill. 2d 335, 181 N.E.2d 176, it was, in part, the unique and unusual testimony of the sex victim that, after beating and raping her, the defendant drove her to the dormitory in which she resided which created a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. In Szybeko, as in the case at bar, the defendant and victim were acquaintances and the defendant denied commission of the sex act offense.</p> <p id=\"b299-8\" pgmap=\"299\">The victim in People v. Coulson (1958), 13 Ill. 2d 290, 149 N.E.2d 96, testified that the defendants, while armed with a pistol, robbed him of his money and thereafter drove him home for more money. In reversing the armed robbery conviction on this incredible evidence, our supreme court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b299-9\" pgmap=\"299(172) 300(60)\">\u201cThis resume of the testimony shows that the evidence relating to the material facts in issue was conflicting and cannot be reconciled. Under such circumstances it is the duty of a jury, or of a court sitting without a jury, to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and on review, this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the jury or trial court. [Citations.] But it is always the duty of this court to examine the evidence in a criminal case, and if it is so improbable or unsatisfactory as to raise a serious doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt the conviction will be reversed. [Citations.] A judgment of conviction can be sustained only on credible evidence which removes all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant, and it is the insufficiency of the People\u2019s evidence which creates such doubt. If a conviction is to be sustained, it must rest on the strength of the People\u2019s case and not on the weakness of the defendant\u2019s case. [Citations.] The foregoing principle of law is corollary of the presumption of innocence to which a defendant in a criminal case is entitled, and to the rule that the People have the burden of establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) People v. Coulson (1958), 13 Ill. 2d 290, 295-96.</blockquote> <p id=\"b300-5\" pgmap=\"300\">The State\u2019s evidence in the case at bar is improbable and unsatisfactory. Further, the State\u2019s evidence totally lacks corroboration, where corrobative evidence would ordinarily exist and would be presented. The defendant denied commission of the criminal act attributed to him by the alleged victim. For these foregoing reasons, I submit, the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence should be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b300-6\" pgmap=\"300\">I dissent further from this court\u2019s assessment of cost against the defendant \u201cfor the State\u2019s defending this appeal\u201d under People v. Nicholls (1978), 71 Ill. 2d 166, 374 N.E.2d 194. No guidelines or notices thereof have been established by our supreme court or this court for the assessment of such cost against a defendant, and to perniciously allow or deny cost without such guidelines is arbitrary and impermissible in my judgment.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
