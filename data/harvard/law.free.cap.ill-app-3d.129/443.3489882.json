On appeal, he contends that (1) he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the trial court (a) improperly considered matters not in evidence in reaching its verdict, (b) abused its discretion in denying his post-trial motion to reopen the case, and (c) denied him a fair trial by shifting the burden of proof to him.</p> <p id=\"b468-12\" pgmap=\"468(94) 469(136)\">At trial, David \u201cBo\u201d Burns (Burns) testified that he, Willie Adams (Adams), Chester Bland (Bland), Andrew Shaffer (Shaffer), and defendant were drinking beer and wine and smoking marijuana in front of an apartment building at 4014 South Drexel Avenue in Chicago at about 7 or 8 p.m. on August 10, 1982. An argument started between Adams and defendant and, when Adams said that he did not have a gun, defendant said, \u201cSucker, I got mine,\u201d and then drew a gun and stuck it in Adams\u2019 chest. At that point, Myra Sexton (Sexton), who was watching from the window of her apartment, called defendant inside the building, and after he came out the men went to the liquor store to purchase more beer and wine, thereafter returning to the front of the apartment building to drink it. At about 12:15 a.m., the victim \u2014 a security guard \u2014 walked past them on the opposite side of Drexel Avenue near the El Rukn headquarters, and upon seeing him, defendant said, \u201cI am fitting to get this chump,\u201d and then ran across the street with his gun in his hand. As the victim turned, defendant shot him twice in the chest and then took his service revolver. Defendant then ran back across the street, carrying the revolver, and as he passed he said, \u201cI got this chump.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b469-5\" pgmap=\"469(369) 470(23)\">At about 7 a.m. the following morning, defendant came to Shaffer\u2019s house where he (Burns) and Bland had spent the night, and when Shaffer asked defendant, \u201cMan, what did you do?\u201d he responded, \u201cMan, I believe I killed this chump.\u201d Defendant also told them that he threw the victim\u2019s revolver into a red container and hid the murder weapon under some wood. After accompanying defendant to an area where he said the police had chased him, he (Burns), Bland, and Shaffer returned to Shaffer\u2019s house, but defendant remained to search for the weapons. Later that day, defendant returned to Shaffer\u2019s house with a .38-caliber revolver, opened it, removed two spent cartridges, flushed them down the toilet, and left. Several days later, when Burns learned the police were looking for him, he arranged to meet them in a lounge. Three officers took him to a police station, where one officer told him that defendant, who was also in custody, had named him as-the killer. He then told the police what he observed on the night of the shooting. He had not contacted the police immediately, because in 1974 he was framed for a murder he did not commit and ultimately pleaded guilty to robbery in order to get out of jail, and he did not want to get involved with the police again. Burns also admitted to a conviction for possession of marijuana and that he was formerly a \u201cfoot soldier\u201d in the El Rukn street gang. On cross-examination, he stated that while he was in custody, the police said that defendant tried to \u201cgive the case\u201d to him and that they were going to charge him with this murder. He told the police that Shaffer, also known as \u201cRab,\u201d was present on the night of the shooting; that immediately afterwards, defendant said, \u201cI just got this chump\u201d; and that they searched for the guns the next morning, but that he did not tell them what had occurred at Shaffer\u2019s house or about the statements made there by defendant. He admitted that he had been afraid he would be charged for the crime, but he denied threatening defendant\u2019s family, stating that he remained downstairs when he and Shaffer went to defendant\u2019s apartment building to tell his mother they did not want to see defendant go to jail.</p> <p id=\"b470-5\" pgmap=\"470\">Bland, also a former El Rukn \u201cfoot soldier,\u201d testified to essentially the same version of events as did Bums, although he did not hear defendant say anything as he ran past after shooting the victim. He admitted on questioning by defendant\u2019s attorney that she and another person came to his house to question him about the shooting, but he told them he did not want to say anything before consulting with his attorney. He did not say that he would not tell them what really happened on the night of the murder because he' was afraid that if he told the truth he would be charged with perjury. Several days after the shooting, he was taken to Area 1 headquarters, but the police did not tell him they believed he was involved in the murder or that he might be charged with it; neither did he think he would be charged. Although he told the police what occurred on the night of the shooting, he did not tell them that Shaffer had been present throughout the evening, and he did not tell them \u2014 nor did they ask\u2014 anything concerning the events of the following day. He did not initially contact the police because he did not want to become involved, and he acknowledged that he could have been prosecuted for contempt had he failed to comply with a subpoena he received to appear as a witness. Following Bland\u2019s testimony, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to withdraw the petitions for contempt citations against Bums and Bland, since both witnesses had voluntarily complied with the subpoena to testify.</p> <p id=\"b470-6\" pgmap=\"470\">Myra Sexton then testified that she was in front of her apartment building on the night in question with Shaffer, Burns, Bland, Adams, and defendant when the latter two began arguing about a television. She went inside her apartment and, as she watched from a window, she saw defendant draw a gun and point it at Adams. She called defendant upstairs and asked him to leave his gun with her and go \u201ccool out\u201d somewhere, but he left, taking the gun with him. She then closed her window, remained in her apartment, and did not see defendant again that night. She was a good friend of Burns and Bland and acknowledged discussing the shooting incident with them before she was taken to the police station, where she was interviewed for about seven hours. She also knows several members of the El Rukn street gang, but she was not a member of the women\u2019s division thereof.</p> <p id=\"b470-7\" pgmap=\"470(35) 471(81)\">Paulette Jones, a 17-year-old high school student, testified that in late August 1982, she and some friends were behind the \u201cold folks home\u201d across the alley from her father\u2019s church when one of the boys saw a gun lying next to some trash cans. They flagged down an unmarked police car, whose occupants retrieved the gun. It was stipulated that, if called, Officer Lipinski would testify that he was stopped by Paulette Jones and her friends and directed to a red container next to a senior citizens\u2019 home, where he found a .357-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver. The gun was registered to the victim, but it was not the weapon used to kill him.</p> <p id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471\">Ernest Wells testified for the defense that shortly after midnight on August 10, 1982, he was driving southbound on Drexel Avenue when he heard gunfire, turned, and saw a man on the opposite side of the street standing over and pointing a gun at another man, who was lying on the sidewalk. The gunman fired a second shot at the victim, bent down, removed something from the victim\u2019s pocket, and then walked south toward 40th Street, where he crossed Drexel Avenue and was joined by another man, with whom he then ran away. He (Wells) made a U-turn, drove back to where the victim was lying, and when the police arrived he described the gunman as 18 or 19 years old, 140 to 150 pounds, five feet eight inches or five feet nine inches tall, with short hair and a \u201cdark tan\u201d complexion which was approximately the same as, or a little darker than, that of his girlfriend, whom he pointed out in the courtroom. Later, during arguments, the trial court specifically noted that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s complexion was very close to that lady *** there was not much difference.\u201d A few days later, he viewed a lineup but did not identify any of the participants. He did not know defendant, and stated when viewing defendant in the courtroom that he had never seen him before. In response to questions by the court, Wells also stated that his observation of the gunman was for about five minutes from a distance of 200 feet, and that he did not want to get closer because the man had a gun. He also stated that it was dark outside and that, although the streetlights were on, he could see only the man\u2019s right profile.</p> <p id=\"b471-6\" pgmap=\"471(131) 472(51)\">Karen Shore, defendant\u2019s 16-year-old sister, testified that she was at home on the afternoon of December 1, 1982, when she heard a knock on the door. Her younger sister, Laydia, opened the door to two men whose names she subsequently learned were \u201cRab\u201d and \u201cBo.\u201d The men asked Laydia if her mother or sisters were home, and when Laydia said, \u201cNo,\u201d she (Karen) ran to the door and slammed it. She then heard \u201cRab\u201d say, \u201cTell your brother he just better not tell anything. I\u2019ll kill all you _\u201d, whereupon her other sister, Phyllis, called the police. She stated that she knew \u201cRab\u201d and \u201cBo\u201d by sight but had never seen them with her brother, and she did not know their real names or what they were talking about until her mother told her later that they were going to be witnesses against defendant. Laydia Shore, defendant\u2019s 15-year-old sister, testified that when Karen slammed the door, she (Laydia) ran toward the back of the house and did not hear the men, whose names she too learned from her mother, say anything else.</p> <p id=\"b472-5\" pgmap=\"472\">The parties stipulated that defendant was 20 years old, six feet tall, and weighed 175 pounds; that Ernest Wells viewed a lineup in which defendant appeared but did not make an identification; that there was nothing in the police reports indicating that Burns told them that Shaffer was present on the night of the shooting or that defendant said, \u201cI shot the chump,\u201d or that there was a search for the guns the following day. Certified copies of Burns\u2019 1971 and 1975 convictions for disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property were admitted into evidence.</p> <p id=\"b472-6\" pgmap=\"472\">Drew Sosnowski, a former student intern at the public defender\u2019s office, testified that he was present on September 1, 1982, when Bland told defense counsel that what he told the police did not really happen and that he was afraid that if he told the truth he would be charged with perjury. Bland then refused to answer any additional questions before speaking to his attorney.</p> <p id=\"b472-7\" pgmap=\"472\">Defendant was found guilty of felony murder on January 6, 1983, and the case was continued until February 28, for post-trial motions and sentencing. On that date, defendant filed a motion to reopen the case for admission of evidence not presented at trial. At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel made an offer of proof as to the evidence sought to be admitted, during which Robert Lee Clark testified that on the night of August 10, 1982, after being together practically all day, he and defendant were riding their bicycles southbound on Drexel Avenue on their way home from the lake when he heard two shots and saw a man, whom he did not recognize, running across the street carrying a gun. The man hollered to a second person, and both men, neither of whom he knew or could describe, ran toward the housing project; he and defendant continued on to the apartment building where they lived. Although he learned about defendant\u2019s arrest the day after it occurred, he never told the police what he saw because he \u201cknew what those studs would do\u201d and he first told defense counsel what he knew \u201csometime around Christmas.\u201d Clark admitted that he had a juvenile conviction for auto theft and that he had known defendant for four or five years.</p> <p id=\"b472-8\" pgmap=\"472(35) 473(295)\">Defendant then testified on the offer of proof that shortly after midnight on August 10, 1982, he and Clark were riding their bicycles southbound on Drexel Avenue when he heard a shot followed by a pause and a second shot. He turned and saw a man, whom he recognized as David Burns, running across the street carrying a large silver object in his hand. Burns met up with a second man, and they both turned and pointed toward him (defendant). A \u201cfat lady\u201d carrying a baby then approached Bums and the other man, and it appeared that they \u201cexchanged something\u201d with her before running toward the housing project. He was not a gang member and did not own a gun or have an argument with Willie Adams. He had not been with Burns, Bland, and Sexton on the night of the shooting nor at Shaffer\u2019s house the following day. When arrested, he was afraid to tell the police what he knew, because the day after the shooting two men in a lounge asked him if he saw anything and, when he told them he had not, they said that if he did or if he said anything about what he saw, he would find himself in the morgue. On cross-examination, defendant denied telling the police that he had been home in bed on the night of the shooting, stating that he told them he had a tooth pulled and had stayed in bed during the day but that he went out with Clark that night. He also stated that although defense counsel represented him since shortly after his arrest, he did not tell her what he saw \u201cuntil after the trial began\u201d because of the threat he received and because he \u201cjust wanted to go ahead and let it all be over with and leave it alone.\u201d In response to questions by the court, defendant stated that everything Burns, Bland, and Sexton had testified to was untrue.</p> <p id=\"b473-5\" pgmap=\"473\">It was then stipulated that if called, Detectives Kerstein and VanBershott would testify that while in custody defendant told them that he arrived home from having a tooth pulled at about 5:30 p.m. on the day in question and that he stayed in bed the remainder of that night and the following morning. After arguments by counsel, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the case, and this appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b473-6\" pgmap=\"473\">Opinion</p> <p id=\"b473-7\" pgmap=\"473\">Defendant first contends that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Setting out numerous allegations of evidentiary deficiencies in chart form in his brief, defendant essentially maintains that his conviction should be reversed because (1) the two State witnesses who provided the only direct evidence of his involvement in this crime were not credible for the reason that (a) as former suspects themselves, they had motive to implicate him and to thereafter testify falsely, and (b) their testimony was contradicted and impeached; and (2) that the trial court\u2019s findings were unsupported by the record.</p> <p id=\"b473-8\" pgmap=\"473(15) 474(116)\"> It is well settled that in a bench trial it is the function of the trial court, as the trier of fact, to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony, to resolve inconsistencies and conflicts therein, and to render its decision accordingly (People v. Berland (1978), 74 Ill. 2d 286, 385 N.E.2d 649, cert. denied (1979), 444 U.S. 833, 62 L. Ed. 2d 42, 100 S. Ct. 64), and a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on these matters, nor will we reverse a conviction unless the evidence is so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory as to leave a reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt (People v. Kline (1982), 92 Ill. 2d 490, 442 N.E.2d 154).</p> <p id=\"b474-5\" pgmap=\"474\"> In support of his contention that Burns and Bland both had motive to implicate him in the murder and thereafter testify falsely, defendant first asserts that Burns admitted naming defendant as the murderer after being told by police that he \u201cwould get this case\u201d unless he named defendant, and that Bland \u201cnearly admitted\u201d the same. Initially, we note that the statement defendant attributes to Burns is not a wholly accurate representation of that elicited by defense counsel on cross-examination, during which the following colloquy occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b474-6\" pgmap=\"474\">\u201cQ. When you were in the police station, the police had you in their custody, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-7\" pgmap=\"474\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-8\" pgmap=\"474\">A. Yes, I was in custody.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-9\" pgmap=\"474\">Q. In fact, they told you they were going to give the case to you if you did not name Steve Shore, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-10\" pgmap=\"474\">A. They told me\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-11\" pgmap=\"474\">Q. Answer my question, Mr. Burns, please, yes or no?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-12\" pgmap=\"474\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-13\" pgmap=\"474\">A. They said Steve Shore tried to give the case to me.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-14\" pgmap=\"474\">Q. Answer the question, Bo.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-15\" pgmap=\"474\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Objection, he did answer.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-16\" pgmap=\"474\">[Defense counsel]: It calls for a yes or no.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-17\" pgmap=\"474\">THE COURT: It can be answered yes or no. They told you they were going to give the case to you? Can you answer that yes or no? Is that what the police told you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b474-18\" pgmap=\"474\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b474-19\" pgmap=\"474(70) 475(250)\">When read in context, it is apparent that Burns, responding to counsel\u2019s inquiry as to whether his release from custody was conditioned upon his specifically naming defendant as the murderer, initially answered that the police told him that \u201cSteve Shore tried to give the case to me.\u201d The question to which Burns ultimately gave a positive response was the more narrow one posed by the court, i.e., whether the police threatened to charge him with this offense. Similarly, with respect to defendant\u2019s assertion that Bland \u201cnearly admitted\u201d that his implication of defendant was induced by a fear that he would be charged, we note that Bland said the police never told him they thought he was involved or might be charged with this crime, nor did he think that he would be charged. Moreover, although the fact that a witness was previously arrested and/or charged with the same crime might raise an inference that his testimony was influenced by pressures from law enforcement authorities sufficient to affect his credibility (see People v. Green (1983), 118 Ill. App. 3d 227, 454 N.E.2d 792), we note again that determinations concerning the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are matters for the trier of fact. Here, the fact that Burns and Bland had both been in custody and questioned and that Burns feared he might be charged with this murder were matters brought out on cross-examination and vigorously argued by defense counsel as indicia of their bias and lack of credibility. Nevertheless, the trial court found their accounts of the shooting to be credible and, because it had the opportunity to hear their testimony and observe their demeanor, we see no reason to substitute our judgment therefor. People v. Berland (1978), 74 Ill. 2d 286, 385 N.E.2d 649, cert. denied (1979), 444 U.S. 833, 62 L. Ed. 2d 42, 100 S. Ct. 64.</p> <p id=\"b475-5\" pgmap=\"475\"> Neither do we see any merit in defendant\u2019s contention that bias of Bums and Bland was established because they were members of the El Rukns, whose headquarters were only a block from the scene. Solely on the basis of this membership, defendant argues \u201cthese El Rukns managed to fool the police. They fooled Judge Heyda. They framed Steve Shore because they needed to put him out of the picture.\u201d Thus, defendant theorized that as El Rukns, Burns and Bland conspired to frame him, a concept rejected by the trial court but apparently adopted in the dissenting opinion here. We also reject it for a number of reasons, some of which will be discussed in more detail below.</p> <p id=\"b475-6\" pgmap=\"475(100) 476(188)\">First, there is nothing in the record refuting the testimony of Burns and Bland concerning the fact that they had disassociated themselves from the El Rukns. Second, the record does not disclose or explain the relationship between El Rukn membership and possible bias toward defendant. Third, the State had petitioned for contempt citations against Burns and Bland for failure to appear at trial in response to subpoenae served upon them. The suggestion in the dissenting opinion that this was a subterfuge finds no support in the record. Rather, because it indicates they were not eager participants in the investigation or trial, it is negative of any conspiracy. Fourth, the trial court commented that Myra Sexton was an \u201cexceptionally good witness,\u201d and the defense does not indicate otherwise. It appears to us that had there been a conspiracy to frame defendant, it would have been easy \u2014 indeed logical \u2014 for Sexton to corroborate Burns and Bland; instead, she testified that she did not witness the shooting, stating that she was present only during the early evening hours. During that period, it should be noted that her testimony is corroborative of Burns and Bland. Fifth, in a further attack on the credibility of Burns and Bland, the defendant and the dissenting opinion point to a conflict in their testimony in that Burns testified to damaging statements made by defendant before and after the shooting, but Bland said that he did not hear those statements. We think, however, that had there been a conspiracy to frame defendant, Bland would surely have corroborated the testimony of Burns concerning those statements. Our further examination of the record discloses no support for a conspiracy to frame defendant.</p> <p id=\"b476-5\" pgmap=\"476\"> Defendant next asserts that several inconsistencies between the testimony of Burns and Bland, as well as contradictions thereof by defense witnesses, undermine their credibility and raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt. In this regard, he first states that \u201cBurns said defendant already had a pistol with him\u201d prior to the early evening argument with Adams, but that Bland testified that he, Burns, and Shaffer accompanied defendant to obtain a gun. A close examination of the record reveals, however, that Burns was not asked, nor did he specify, where or when defendant obtained the gun; he merely testified, as did Bland, that at one point during that argument defendant drew a gun and pointed it at Adams. Thus, we see no inconsistencies with regard to this testimony. Furthermore, in our view, the details as to when and where defendant came into possession of the gun are merely collateral matters of questionable import. What is significant is that the State\u2019s witnesses made positive, consistent statements that defendant was with them throughout the evening and that at some time before midnight \u2014 the time of the shooting \u2014 he drew a gun and threatened Adams with it.</p> <p id=\"b476-6\" pgmap=\"476(79) 477(74)\">Defendant also points to a conflict between Burns\u2019 testimony\u2014 that defendant said, \u201cI am fitting to get this chump\u201d before shooting the victim and, \u201cI just shot this chump\u201d as he fled from the scene\u2014 and Bland\u2019s testimony \u2014 that he did not hear defendant make these statements despite being only three to four feet from Burns when they were allegedly made. Once again, however, the record discloses that Bland, who testified after Burns, was never asked whether he heard defendant say anything prior to the shooting, and although he stated that he did not hear defendant say anything as he ran away, in view of Bland\u2019s unequivocal testimony that he saw him shoot the victim, we do not find it significant that he did not hear defendant confirm what he had personally observed only moments earlier. See People v. Rodriquez (1981), 100 Ill. App. 3d 244, 426 N.E.2d 586.</p> <p id=\"b477-5\" pgmap=\"477\"> Similarly, we are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that the credibility of Burns\u2019 and Bland\u2019s accounts of the shooting was seriously damaged because their testimony that defendant acted alone in this crime was contradicted by that of Wells, a disinterested eyewitness, who stated that after the shooting the gunman was joined by and ran away with a second man. We see no contradiction, however, as all three testified that the gunman was alone during the shooting. While Wells testified that the gunman walked toward 40th Street and crossed Drexel Avenue where he was joined by the other man, neither Burns nor Bland was asked whether defendant fled the area alone. There is also nothing in the record to indicate either knew what defendant did after he passed them following the shooting, or whether from their positions they would have been able to see the point where Wells said the gunman was joined by another man. Moreover, the versions of Burns and Bland concerning the occurrence were otherwise substantially corroborated by Wells\u2019 testimony that when he heard a gunshot, he turned and saw a man standing over a person lying on the sidewalk on the east side of Drexel Avenue, and that after the gunman fired a second shot he reached down and removed something from the victim\u2019s pocket and then ran westward, across Drexel, toward the housing project, where he was joined by a second man.</p> <p id=\"b477-6\" pgmap=\"477(174) 478(50)\"> With respect to the contradictions by defendant\u2019s sisters (Karen and Laydia) of Burns\u2019 denial that he and Shaffer threatened defendant\u2019s family at his apartment, we first note \u2014 as did the trial court \u2014 that Karen testified that when she saw the man, whose nicknames she later learned were \u201cRab\u201d and \u201cBo,\u201d she slammed the apartment door, whereupon \u201cRab\u201d said that he would kill her and her family if defendant told anyone what he knew; whereas, her sister Laydia testified that she did not hear the men say anything after the door was closed. Thus, Laydia did not corroborate Karen\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged threat, as defendant asserts, and the trial court was therefore presented with a conflict only between the statements of Burns and Karen. As the supreme court has stated, \u201cwhere *** the evidence is irreconcilably conflicting, it is the peculiar prerogative of the trier of fact *** to ascertain the truth.\u201d (People v. Hammond (1970), 45 Ill. 2d 269, 278, 259 N.E.2d 44, 48.) In the instant case, the trial court chose to believe Burns, rather than Karen, observing that her sister did not hear the threats. Because the trial court had the opportunity to hear the evidence and observe the demeanor of both witnesses, we cannot say its determination as to her credibility was erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b478-5\" pgmap=\"478\"> Nevertheless, it is also defendant\u2019s position that the testimony of Bland was completely negated by that of student intern Sosnowski, who stated that during an interview prior to commencement of this trial, Bland told him and defense counsel that what he related to the police did not really happen and he feared that if he told them the truth he would thereafter be charged with perjury, but that he would not answer any questions before consulting with his attorney. Bland not only denied making the statements testified to by Sosnowski, but also stated that he refused to answer defense counsel\u2019s questions without the benefit of private counsel. The trial court commented that, to the extent the testimony of Bland and Sosnowski conflicted, it believed the latter, and defendant syllogizes therefrom that everything Bland told the police and repeated at trial was a lie, and therefore that Bland\u2019s testimony as to seeing defendant commit the murder was entitled to no weight.</p> <p id=\"b478-6\" pgmap=\"478(260) 479(13)\"> We reject defendant\u2019s reasoning, noting that while Bland was discredited to some degree by Sosnowski\u2019s testimony, we cannot assume \u2014 as defendant posits in his brief \u2014 that Bland\u2019s admission to defense counsel meant that \u201ceverything [he] told the police *** was a lie,\u201d particularly since the trial court also found Bland\u2019s account of the shooting to be credible, and specifically noted that impeachment of a witness does not automatically mean that the whole of his testimony was fabricated. Moreover, it is well settled that the credible testimony of a single eyewitness is sufficient to sustain a conviction. (People v. Berland (1978), 74 Ill. 2d 286, 385 N.E.2d 649, cert. denied (1979), 444 U.S. 833, 62 L. Ed. 2d 42, 100 S. Ct. 64; People v. Rodriquez (1981), 100 Ill. App. 3d 244, 426 N.E.2d 586.) Here, the trial court also stated that it believed Bums\u2019 testimony, which was corroborated by Sexton, who testified that defendant was drinking and smoking marijuana in front of her apartment a few hours before the shooting and that, during an argument with Adams, he (defendant) drew a gun and threatened Adams. The testimony of Bums was also corroborated in part by Wells, whose account of the shooting was essentially the same as Bums\u2019, and by the testimony of Paulette Jones regarding the discovery of the victim\u2019s revolver in a red container behind a senior citizens\u2019 home, which substantiated Burns\u2019 testimony as to where defendant said he hid the gun. Thus, even without Bland\u2019s testimony, we find that there was sufficient credible evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction.</p> <p id=\"b479-5\" pgmap=\"479\"> Finally, with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant asserts that the \u201cmyriad instances\u201d of impeachment of both Burns and Bland at trial so severely impaired their credibility as to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt. In his brief, defendant has charted numerous details which were included in their trial testimony but which were not told to the police when they were questioned about the crime. Specifically, defendant points out that neither Burns nor Bland told the police that Shaffer was with them throughout the evening in question; that he (defendant) came to Shaffer\u2019s house the following morning; that while there, he said he shot the victim and described where he hid the guns; that they accompanied him to search for the guns; or that he returned to Shaffer\u2019s house later that afternoon carrying a .38-caliber revolver from which he removed two spent cartridges. While it is true that a witness\u2019 failure \u201cto state a particular fact under circumstances rendering it incumbent upon him to, or likely that he would, state such fact, if true, may be shown to discredit his testimony as to such fact\u201d (People v. Henry (1970), 47 Ill. 2d 312, 321, 265 N.E.2d 876, 882), we note that there is nothing in the record here indicating that either witness was questioned by the police concerning these matters. In view of their testimony that they wanted no involvement with the police, which was corroborated by the fact that they did not contact authorities to report what they had seen as well as by their reluctance to testify \u2014 both of which were noted by the trial court in its findings relating to defendant\u2019s theory that they conspired to \u201cframe\u201d him \u2014 we do not believe it likely that either Burns or Bland would have volunteered any information not specifically requested by the police. See People v. Green (1983), 118 Ill. App. 3d 227, 454 N.E.2d 792; People v. Rodriquez (1981), 100 Ill. App. 3d 244, 426 N.E.2d 586.</p> <p id=\"b479-6\" pgmap=\"479\">In the light of the foregoing, we are of the belief that there was sufficient credible evidence presented to the court to support its finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p id=\"b479-7\" pgmap=\"479\"> Defendant next contends that he was denied a fair trial because the court improperly considered and was influenced by matters not in the record. We note, however, and defendant concedes, that absent a contrary showing, it is presumed that the court in a bench trial considered only competent evidence in arriving at its verdict. People v. Gilbert (1977), 68 Ill. 2d 252, 369 N.E.2d 849; People v. Earullo (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 774, 447 N.E.2d 925, cert. denied (1984), __ U.S. __, 79 L. Ed. 2d 761, 104 S. Ct. 1441.</p> <p id=\"b480-4\" pgmap=\"480\"> Here, defendant posits that the court\u2019s comment on the fact that he answered ready for trial on the first day the case appeared on the trial call implied that the court believed he \u201cwas acting in concert \u25a0with the prosecution witnesses.\u201d A review of the record, however, reveals that the comment was made two months after defendant was found guilty during a hearing on his post-trial motion to reopen the evidence, at which defense counsel argued that the State\u2019s witnesses conspired to \u201cframe him.\u201d In denying the motion to reopen, the court said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b480-5\" pgmap=\"480\">\u201cThere is no question in my mind that Burns and Bland did not want to testify against defendant in this case. Defendant never thought they would come forward, which is one reason I suspect there was a demand for trial from the date that this case came to my call.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b480-6\" pgmap=\"480\">We find nothing therein to support defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court \u201cseemed to feel\u201d there was a \u201cconspiracy\u201d between him and the State or its witnesses. Indeed, the record supports the trial court\u2019s statement that Burns and Bland were reluctant to testify, and there is further support for the court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that he (defendant) did not believe the State had sufficient evidence to convict him and therefore chose to immediately proceed to trial \u2014 in defendant\u2019s own statement that \u201cI didn\u2019t feel all this was going to happen to me. I just wanted to go ahead and let it all be over with and leave it alone.\u201d In view of the speculative nature of his assertions, we find that defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only proper evidence in finding him guilty.</p> <p id=\"b480-7\" pgmap=\"480\">Defendant next contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen the evidence, arguing only that \u201cwhere, as here, the need is great and the burden small *** it is unfair to shut off the proofs\u201d because the trial court should consider as much relevant evidence as possible.</p> <p id=\"b480-8\" pgmap=\"480(140) 481(145)\"> The decision whether to grant a defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the case for further testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion (People v. Siciliano (1954), 4 Ill. 2d 581, 123 N.E.2d 725, cert. denied (1955), 349 U.S. 931, 99 L. Ed. 1261, 75 S. Ct. 774; People v. Henry (1982), 103 Ill. App. 3d 1143, 432 N.E.2d 359), and the burden is on the party seeking to reopen to show sufficient reason therefor (People v. Housby (1975), 26 Ill. App. 3d 92, 324 N.E.2d 465). In the present case, defendant was found guilty on January 6, 1983, and moved to reopen the case on February 28, 1983. The court permitted him to make an offer of proof in the form of testimony given under oath with cross-examination as to the evidence sought to be admitted. In the offer of proof, Robert Lee Clark testified that he and defendant were riding their bicycles southbound on Drexel Avenue on their way home from spending \u201cpractically all day\u201d together at the lake when he heard two shots and saw a man running across the street with a gun in his hand. The man hollered to and was joined by a second man, and then they both ran into the housing project. Clark did not recognize, nor could he describe, either of the two men he saw running. Although he learned the next day that defendant had been arrested, he did not contact the police because he was afraid, and he first told defense counsel sometime in late December 1982 that he was with defendant at the time of the shooting.</p> <p id=\"b481-5\" pgmap=\"481\">Although defendant testified to essentially the same version of the shooting incident as did Clark, he also stated that after having a tooth pulled earlier that day he went home to bed, and later went to the store, before going out with Clark. He further testified that although he recognized the man carrying the gun as David Burns, he did not report what he saw to the police because of a threat made to him the following day by two unidentified men, and admitted not giving the information about Clark to his attorney until \u201cafter the trial began,\u201d i.e., some unspecified time after December 9, 1982.</p> <p id=\"b481-6\" pgmap=\"481\">It was also stipulated that, if called, two detectives who interviewed defendant at the police station six days after the shooting would testify that defendant told them he returned from the dentist at about 5:30 p.m. and remained at home in bed on the night of August 9 and the morning of August 10, 1982.</p> <p id=\"b481-7\" pgmap=\"481\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to reopen, finding that the proposed evidence was neither credible nor newly discovered, and that defendant had failed to exercise diligence in presenting it. These findings, which will be further discussed below, are clearly supported by the record. Moreover, the court further stated that even if the evidence were admitted, its findings and verdict would remain unchanged. Under these circumstances, it is our view that the court properly exercised its discretion in denying the motion and excluding the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b481-8\" pgmap=\"481\"> Defendant correlatively contends that certain remarks by the court established that it had improperly shifted the burden of proof in this case to him and thereby denied him a fair trial. He first directs our attention to the following colloquy between defense counsel and the court regarding the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses and what, if any, motivation they had to testify falsely:</p> <blockquote id=\"b481-9\" pgmap=\"481(9) 482(13)\">\u201cTHE COURT: What about Myra [Sexton], what reason has Myra got? As you recall Myra was an exceptionally good witness ***.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-3\" pgmap=\"482\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-4\" pgmap=\"482\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, I am not in a position to answer that question but what you are doing right now, with all due respect, you are shifting the burden of proof on me to explain why did these 3 people concoct a story ***.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-5\" pgmap=\"482\">THE COURT: I agree.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b482-6\" pgmap=\"482\">Defendant argues that the court\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s allegation shows that it improperly placed the burden of proof in this case on the defense. However, as defendant notes, the above-quoted exchange took place not at trial but at the hearing on his motion to reopen the case wherein defense counsel\u2019s argument for admission of the evidence presented in the offer of proof was grounded on the theory that the State\u2019s witnesses had fabricated their testimony in order to \u201cframe\u201d defendant. As the issue of witness credibility had been vigorously argued by defense counsel and resolved by the court at trial, and because \u2014 as we have previously stated \u2014 the party moving to reopen the case must show sufficient reason for doing so (People v. Housby (1975), 26 Ill. App. 3d 92, 324 N.E.2d 465), it was in fact the burden of the defense to show what new evidence there was to support that reopening; and it was that burden to which the trial court\u2019s response to counsel was directed.</p> <p id=\"b482-7\" pgmap=\"482\"> The second comment cited by defendant was made during the court\u2019s ruling on the post-trial motion. The court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b482-8\" pgmap=\"482\">\u201cIt is difficult for this court to believe a two-year Army veteran would sit there and listen to 3 witnesses testify about him shooting another person and waving a gun around only because the tall man and his friend said that if he, the defendant, saw [sic] anything he would find himself in the morgue.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-9\" pgmap=\"482\">He, the defendant, would have the Court believe that he just sat there while the actual murderer testified that he, the defendant, did it, because he was afraid.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b482-10\" pgmap=\"482\">Defendant insists that this was an improper comment on his failure to testify at trial and is further evidence that the court shifted the burden of proof to him. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b482-11\" pgmap=\"482\">Initially, we note that in addition to the above, the court also commented:</p> <blockquote id=\"b482-12\" pgmap=\"482(43) 483(4)\">\u201c[E]ven though the testimony in this case is over prior to Christmas, defendant per his attorney, first tells her about another account at Christmastime. Even though the case is set for decision on January 6, 1983, no motion to reopen the proofs is filed or requested.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-5\" pgmap=\"483\">After a finding of guilty, defendant\u2019s attorney then first makes a motion to reopen proofs *** [and] in her argument *** on the motion *** she indicates that she believes the defendant is innocent *** even though [he] has been far from candid with even his own attorney.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-6\" pgmap=\"483\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-7\" pgmap=\"483\">When he finally saw what dynamite the State had against him he apparently started to worry and told his attorney *** another account of what happened. Nothing is done even though all were aware that the Court would render its decision on January 6,1983.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-8\" pgmap=\"483\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-9\" pgmap=\"483\">Defendant wanted his cake and he wanted to eat it also.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b483-10\" pgmap=\"483\"> We think that when the remarks complained of are read in conjunction with these additional comments and in the context of the court\u2019s statement in its entirety, it becomes apparent that the trial court was commenting not on defendant\u2019s failure to testify at trial, but rather, on (a) the incredibility of his testimony on the offer of proof that he sat through the entire trial while State\u2019s witnesses \u2014 one of whom he believed to be the actual murderer \u2014 testified that he had committed the crime, without telling his own attorney that there was a witness who was with him the night of the shooting who knew he did not commit the crime; and (b) the lack of diligence in the presentation of the motion where, although defendant gave the information to his attorney during the trial, which was concluded on December 22, 1982, with the finding of guilt entered on January 6, 1983, the motion to reopen was not presented until February 28, 1983. Clearly, these were properly considered by the trial court in determining whether there was sufficient, credible reason to reopen the case.</p> <p id=\"b483-11\" pgmap=\"483\">In People v. Reese (1973), 54 Ill. 2d 51, 294 N.E.2d 288, the supreme court considered the propriety of the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Without deciding whether the evidence met the standards for \u201cnewly-discovered evidence,\u201d the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion, stating:</p> <blockquote id=\"b483-12\" pgmap=\"483(68) 484(42)\">\u201c \u2018Applications for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence are not looked upon with favor by the courts, and in order to prevent, so far as possible, fraud and imposition which defeated parties may be tempted to practice, as a last resort, to escape the consequence of an adverse verdict, such application should always be subjected to the closest scrutiny by the court, and the burden is upon the applicant to rebut the presumption that the verdict is correct and to show there had been no lack of diligence.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Reese (1973), 54 Ill. 2d 51, 59, 294 N.E.2d 288, 292.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b484-5\" pgmap=\"484\">Although Reese, unlike the case before us, involved a post-trial motion for a new trial, we believe the principles expressed therein are nonetheless applicable to a post-trial motion to reopen the case, and we find that in the light of defendant\u2019s admitted failure to inform his attorney of the witness Clark, as well as the implausibility of his explanation for failing to confide in her, the trial court\u2019s comments were merely expressions of its findings on the motion and in no way indicated it had shifted the burden of proof in the case to defendant.</p> <p id=\"b484-6\" pgmap=\"484\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b484-7\" pgmap=\"484\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b484-8\" pgmap=\"484\">MEJDA, P.J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b484-9\" pgmap=\"484\">JUSTICE PINCHAM,</author> <p id=\"Axl\" pgmap=\"484\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b484-10\" pgmap=\"484\">I dissent. The record in this case reveals that the State\u2019s evidence is woefully unpersuasive and that the trial judge committed grievous errors in his rulings and findings. Reversal of the defendant\u2019s murder conviction and sentence is therefore demanded. Inasmuch as the defendant vociferously protests his innocence and adamantly argues that the evidence fails to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a chronology of the events of this case, the trial evidence and the court\u2019s findings and rulings necessarily follows.</p> <p id=\"b484-11\" pgmap=\"484\">On August 10, 1982, shortly after midnight, Garrison Hester, a security guard, was fatally shot and robbed of his service revolver while walking northbound on the east side of the 3900 block of South Drexel Boulevard in Chicago. Ernest Wells witnessed the murder-robbery. Wells was driving south on Drexel when he heard a shot. He looked around and saw a man standing on the opposite (east) side of Drexel pointing a gun at the victim, who was on the ground. The assailant fired another shot into the victim, went into the victim\u2019s pocket, turned around and walked south on the east side of Drexel toward 40th Street. Wells stopped his car on Drexel \u201cto look at what was happening.\u201d The assailant walked about 50 feet, turned and started jogging westward across the median on Drexel. After the assailant arrived on the west side of Drexel, Wells saw another man join the assailant, and the two men ran off together.</p> <p id=\"b485-4\" pgmap=\"485\">Wells started his car, went to the next intersection, made a U-turn and came back to see what he could do for the victim. He drove to where the victim was lying on the sidewalk. As Wells was en route to get the police, he almost collided with a squad car. Wells immediately gave the police the following description of the assailant:</p> <blockquote id=\"b485-5\" pgmap=\"485\">\u201cA black man about 18 or 19 years old, with short hair, about 5\u20198 or 9, he wasn\u2019t black but he was about dark tan, darker than his [Wells\u2019] girl friend [sic], *** and weighed about 140 to 150 pounds.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b485-6\" pgmap=\"485\">When he witnessed the incident, Wells viewed the right profile of the assailant for five minutes from a distance of 200 feet. Wells did not immediately approach the victim, however, because the assailant had a gun.</p> <p id=\"b485-7\" pgmap=\"485\">Apparently, Wells believed that he could identify the assailant, because four days later he went to a police station and viewed a lineup. Defendant, Steve Shore, was in the lineup. Wells did not identify Shore as the assailant. In fact, Wells testified at trial that he did not know the defendant and \u201chad never seen him before.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b485-8\" pgmap=\"485\">The State did not call Wells as a witness at trial. Instead, Wells was called by the defendant. Cross-examination by the State was waived.</p> <p id=\"b485-9\" pgmap=\"485\">The record reveals the defendant\u2019s description to be as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b485-10\" pgmap=\"485\">\u201cSix feet tall, 175 pounds, 20 years of age, medium to light complexion.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b485-11\" pgmap=\"485\">The record also reveals that the defendant\u2019s complexion was lighter than the complexion of Wells\u2019 girlfriend.</p> <p id=\"b485-12\" pgmap=\"485\">The trial judge concluded: \u201cI believe Ernest Wells [sic] however, did not help the State or the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p> <p id=\"b485-13\" pgmap=\"485\">I am of the opinion that the trial court unjustifiably refused to recognize that: (1) Wells\u2019 description of the assailant was not that of the defendant; (2) Wells never stated that he could not identify the assailant; (3) Wells did not identify the defendant in the lineup as the assailant, and (4) Wells testified at trial that he had never seen the defend\u00e1nt before. Like the trial court, this court also unjustifiably refuses to recognize Wells\u2019 extremely salient testimony. As will be discussed in more detail, the trial court\u2019s and this court\u2019s treatment of other facets of Wells\u2019 testimony is convoluted.</p> <p id=\"b485-14\" pgmap=\"485(58) 486(38)\">The defendant served in the United States Army from 1979 to the end of 1981, during which he received his high school G.E.D. diploma. After being honorably discharged from the Army, he returned to Chicago, lived with his family, and for six or seven months was employed as a maintenance man at the Fountainbleu Manor Nursing Home, 6200 North Winthrop. For three or four months thereafter he was employed at Kokomo\u2019s Meat Market, 5558 West Harrison, packing, shipping and selling meat. He was working there on the day of his arrest, August 14, 1982.</p> <p id=\"b486-5\" pgmap=\"486\">The record is completely silent and does not reveal why, how or under what circumstances this six-foot, 175-pound, 20-year-old medium-complected defendant, who had no prior criminal record, was arrested and placed in a lineup to be viewed by the homicide eyewitness, Ernest Wells, who promptly described the assailant as five feet eight or nine inches, 140 to 150 pounds, 18 to 19 years old and of a dark tan complexion.</p> <p id=\"b486-6\" pgmap=\"486\">It is readily discerned from the record, however, that while in police custody the defendant implicated David \u201cBo\u201d Burns to the police. \u201cBo\u201d Burns had been a five-year foot soldier of the El Rukn street gang, whose headquarters were at 39th and Drexel, \u201cjust a few steps away from where the shooting happened.\u201d Burns was incarcerated in 1974 for a murder which he contended he did not commit and was a \u201cframe.\u201d He eventually pleaded guilty to the offense of robbery \u201cto get out of the jail\u201d and received five years\u2019 probation.</p> <p id=\"b486-7\" pgmap=\"486\">Burns ultimately became one of the State\u2019s star eyewitnesses to the homicide. He testified on direct examination as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b486-8\" pgmap=\"486\">\u201cQ.

Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b487-21\" pgmap=\"487\">BY MS.

Yes, they told me Steve Shore was in custody.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b487-23\" pgmap=\"487\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b487-24\" pgmap=\"487\">Q. Now, Bo, you were afraid that you were going to get charged with this crime, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b487-25\" pgmap=\"487\">A. The police got me \u2014 yes, I was afraid.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b487-26\" pgmap=\"487\">Chester \u201cBlood\u201d Bland, like \u201cBo\u201d Bums, was a former five- or six-year member and foot soldier of the El Rukn street gang. This court unconvincingly points out that \u201cthere is nothing in the record refuting the testimony of Bums and Bland concerning\u201d their disassociation from the \u201cEl Rukns.\u201d Had they remained the accused, however, there is no doubt that the State would adamantly urge that their testimony of withdrawal from this street gang was incredible.</p> <p id=\"b487-27\" pgmap=\"487(10) 488(7)\">Testifying for the State as an eyewitness to the homicide, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland stated on cross-examination as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b488-5\" pgmap=\"488\">\u201cQ. Now the police came and got you and brought you to area one in connection with this case, is that right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-6\" pgmap=\"488\">A.

You called the police and they came and got you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-19\" pgmap=\"488\">A. Right. I didn\u2019t make the call. Burns made the call. They called Shaffer\u2019s mother\u2019s house and they met me and Burns across the street.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b488-20\" pgmap=\"488\">Myra Sexton was a third prosecution witness. She did not witness the homicide, however, She testified that the defendant had a gun and that he was in front of her home at 4014 South Drexel four hours before the homicide. On cross-examination, Sexton testified that she had talked to an assistant State\u2019s Attorney about her testimony in the presence of \u201cBo\u201d Bums, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer. Further cross-examination of Sexton elicited the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b488-21\" pgmap=\"488\">\u201cQ. And in fact you talked about what happened, about the shooting of the security guard and all that? You talked about that with Bo, Blood, before you talked to the police, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-22\" pgmap=\"488\">A. Yes, you could say.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-23\" pgmap=\"488\">Q. And you talked to the police a few days after this incident, right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-24\" pgmap=\"488\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-25\" pgmap=\"488\">Q. And the police brought you down to 51st and Wentworth and you talked to them there, right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-26\" pgmap=\"488\">A. Two days, yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-27\" pgmap=\"488\">Q. You were down therefor two days?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-28\" pgmap=\"488\">A. Yes, you could say.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-29\" pgmap=\"488\">Q. In fact, they asked you a lot of questions, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-30\" pgmap=\"488\">A. Seven hours worth of questions.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b488-31\" pgmap=\"488(12) 489(3)\">Q. Now where you live it\u2019s very close to the El-Rukin headquarters, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-5\" pgmap=\"489\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-6\" pgmap=\"489\">Q. There are a lot of El-Rukin members in the neighborhood?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-7\" pgmap=\"489\">A. True.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-8\" pgmap=\"489\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-9\" pgmap=\"489\">Q. You\u2019re friends with the El Rukins?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-10\" pgmap=\"489\">A. I know several of them.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-11\" pgmap=\"489\">Q. In fact you are pretty good friends with Bo, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-12\" pgmap=\"489\">A. Yes, you can say.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-13\" pgmap=\"489\">Q. You\u2019re pretty good friends with Blood, too?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-14\" pgmap=\"489\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-15\" pgmap=\"489\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-16\" pgmap=\"489\">Q. Now when you say the police questioned you for seven hours, they kept you in an interview room?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-17\" pgmap=\"489\">A. Right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-18\" pgmap=\"489\">Q. They wouldn\u2019t let you leave, would they?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b489-19\" pgmap=\"489\">A. No.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b489-20\" pgmap=\"489\">The fact that the police custodially interrogated Sexton, who did not witness the incident, for two days or seven hours is of no small significance.</p> <p id=\"b489-21\" pgmap=\"489\">It would not be productive to speculate on the probability or improbability of whether the defendant would (1) commit a homicide in the presence of the three eyewitnesses, Ernest Wells, an impartial witness, \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland, who described themselves as the defendant\u2019s drinking buddies; (2) thereafter appear in a police-conducted lineup and not be identified by Wells as the assailant; (3) deny his involvement in the homicide, and (4) then implicate his purported friends \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland in the commission of the homicide which they witnessed the defendant commit. It would likewise be unfeasible, but by no means insurmountable, to accurately conjecture on the dialogue between Myra Sexton, \u201cBo\u201d Bums, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer during their extensive pre-custodial conferences among themselves and during the protracted custodial conference with the police.</p> <p id=\"b489-22\" pgmap=\"489\">In any event, promptly after these numerous conferences, Steve Shore was no longer the accuser of \u201cBo\u201d Burns. Instead, Shore was suddenly switched by the former El Rukns (Burns and Bland) from the accuser to the accused and \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland became the accusers. Ultimately, Steve Shore was charged with the robbery and murder of Garrison Hester.</p> <p id=\"b489-23\" pgmap=\"489(36) 490(10)\">Thus, by this mere fluctuation the State was vacillated from the tenable position that these two El Rukn street gang members were unreliable and unworthy of belief as defendants, to the untenable position that they were believable, trustworthy and credible witnesses for the State.</p> <p id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">On August 14, 1984, when \u201cBo\u201d Bums, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland and Sexton concluded their conferences among themselves and with the police officers, Hester\u2019s service revolver had not yet been recovered. At this time, neither \u201cBo\u201d Bums or \u201cBlood\u201d Bland had made a single statement to the officers about any conversation with the defendant subsequent to the homicide about any concealment of, search for or discovery of the victim\u2019s gun or the murder weapon.</p> <p id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">However, at the time of trial on December 9, 1982, the victim\u2019s weapon had been discovered. Paulette Jones testified that on Sunday, August 22, 1982, at about 1 p.m., she and her friend Jerry discovered a gun in a red box next to a garbage can near her father\u2019s church at 702 East 43rd Street in Chicago. She flagged a passing police officer who retrieved the gun, which the evidence established was registered to Garrison Hester, the deceased. As hereinafter pointed out, \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland conveniently expanded and adjusted their subsequent trial testimony to this belated discovery of the victim\u2019s weapon.</p> <p id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490\">The preliminary hearing on August 16, 1982, was continued on the State\u2019s motion to August 31, 1982, at which time David \u201cBo\u201d Bums testified and the trial court entered a finding of probable cause.</p> <p id=\"b490-8\" pgmap=\"490\">The following day, September 1, 1982, the defendant\u2019s attorney, Andrea Lyon, and Drew Sosnowski, a 21-year-old law school senior who was interning with the Cook County Public Defender\u2019s office, went to 7033 South Claremont, the home of Chester \u201cBlood\u201d Bland. Sosnowski testified at trial that when attorney Lyon told \u201cBlood\u201d Bland that she wanted to ask him about the case, Bland stated \u201c*** that what he [Bland] told the police didn\u2019t really happen and that he was afraid that if he told us what really happened that he could be charged with perjury *** and that he wouldn\u2019t say anything else because he wanted to talk to his attorney ***.\u201d Sosnowski testified further that upon leaving Bland\u2019s house he wrote a memorandum of this conversation while sitting in the car, that he later had this memorandum typed and that he signed it.</p> <p id=\"b490-9\" pgmap=\"490\">\u201cBlood\u201d Bland testified on direct examination at trial that attorney Lyon and another person came to talk to him and that Lyon told him that she was defendant\u2019s lawyer. The record reveals the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b490-10\" pgmap=\"490\">\u201cQ. What did you tell her?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b490-11\" pgmap=\"490\">A. She asked me about, she wanted to talk to me about the case. And I told her I don\u2019t want to say anything unless I had a lawyer, somebody to talk to first.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b490-12\" pgmap=\"490(37) 491(25)\">While no question is raised or made concerning Bland\u2019s right not to talk to attorney Lyon without a lawyer, nor is any question raised regarding his right to a lawyer, nevertheless a question can be persuasively made and raised on his reason for not wanting to talk to her and his reason for not wanting to do so without a lawyer.</p> <p id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">On redirect examination, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland testified further:</p> <blockquote id=\"b491-6\" pgmap=\"491\">\u201cQ. When you talked to Ms. Lyon when she came and she gave you her card, did you tell her you wanted to talk to a lawyer first?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-7\" pgmap=\"491\">A. I said I would like to talk to a lawyer first before I say anything. She gave me the card. I said after I talk to my lawyer I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b491-8\" pgmap=\"491\">\u201cBlood\u201d Bland denied on direct examination that he told attorney Lyon that he did not want to talk to her about what really happened on the night of the incident because he was afraid that if he told the truth he would be charged with perjury. On cross-examination he reiterated his denial:</p> <blockquote id=\"b491-9\" pgmap=\"491\">\u201cQ. You are saying here today under oath you did not tell us that you did not want to talk to us about what really happened that night until you talked to your lawyer because you were afraid that if you told us the truth you could be charged with perjury in light of what you told the police?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-10\" pgmap=\"491\">A. I did not say that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-11\" pgmap=\"491\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-12\" pgmap=\"491\">Q. And are you saying here today that you never said the word \u2018perjury\u2019 to me in regards to what you said to the police?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-13\" pgmap=\"491\">A. No. I never said the word \u2018perjury.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-14\" pgmap=\"491\">Q. You never said it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b491-15\" pgmap=\"491\">A. Nope.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b491-16\" pgmap=\"491\">With regard to this irreconcilable conflict between the testimony of State\u2019s witness \u201cBlood\u201d Bland and defense witness Sosnowski, the trial judge concluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b491-17\" pgmap=\"491\">\u201cI also believe Drew Sosnowski, the law student who testified in this case, and where his account differed from Chester (\u2018Blood\u2019) Bland\u2019s I believed Sosnowski, but I again call to your attention People v. Klein [Kline], 92 Ill. 2d 490, impeachment is not synonymous with fabrication.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b491-18\" pgmap=\"491\">The trial court and this court made a Herculean effort to rationalize and reconcile this testimonial conflict between Sosnowski and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland. The trial judge believed and found that \u201cBlood\u201d Bland told attorney Lyon and Sosnowski \u201cthat what he told the police didn\u2019t really happen\u201d and \u201cthat if he told what really happened he could be charged with perjury,\u201d which \u201cBlood\u201d Bland denied.</p> <p id=\"b491-19\" pgmap=\"491(31) 492(35)\">This conflict between Sosnowski\u2019s and Bland\u2019s testimony defies rationalization. Moreover, inasmuch as \u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 statement to the police, his trial testimony, Bland\u2019s statement of the shooting to the police, which Bland said \u201cdidn\u2019t really happen,\u201d and Bland\u2019s trial testimony are somewhat the same, the trial court\u2019s and this court\u2019s reliance on \u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 testimony to sustain and affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction is grossly unwarranted.</p> <p id=\"b492-5\" pgmap=\"492\">After the above-mentioned aborted interview of \u201cBlood\u201d Bland by attorney Lyon and intern Sosnowski on September 1, 1982, the defendant was arraigned on September 21, 1982, and answered ready for trial. The trial was continued on the State\u2019s motion to October 4, 1982, and on that date the defendant again answered ready for trial. The trial was again continued on motion of the State to October 25, November 18, December 1 and to December 2, 1982. On each date the defendant answered ready for trial.</p> <p id=\"b492-6\" pgmap=\"492\">On the afternoon of December 1, 1982, following the trial continuance earlier that morning, the defendant\u2019s sister, Karen Shore, a second-year high school student, was at home, where she lived with her mother, at 709 East 41st Street, apartment 302. Karen testified that she heard a knock at the front door. Her younger sister, Laydia, opened the door. Karen heard \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer ask Laydia whether her mother was home. Karen went to the door, which had been opened by Laydia, and at the door were \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer. \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d feet were in the door. \u201cRab\u201d then asked Laydia whether any of her sisters were home and Laydia said no. Karen testified that she slammed the door, whereupon \u201cRab\u201d said, \u201cTell your brother he just better not tell anything. I\u2019ll kill all you m-\u2014 f- \u2014 .\u201d Karen\u2019s other sister, Phyllis, then called the police, who came to the apartment shortly thereafter.</p> <p id=\"b492-7\" pgmap=\"492\">Laydia Shore, the defendant\u2019s 15-year-old sister, corroborated Karen\u2019s testimony. Laydia testified that on December 1, 1982, after she had returned home from school at about 2:30 p.m., \u201cBo\u201d and \u201cRab\u201d knocked on the apartment door. She opened the door, \u201cRab\u201d asked whether her mother was at home and Laydia told him no. Laydia testified further that \u201cRab\u201d then said, \u201cTell your mother \u2014 \u201d and Karen promptly came and closed the door in \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d face. Laydia stated that she told her sister, Phyllis, to call the police and that they responded to the call and came to the apartment. She testified further that she did not hear what \u201cRab\u201d said after Karen slammed the door because she ran to the back of the apartment.</p> <p id=\"b492-8\" pgmap=\"492\">It appears in the record that the Shore sisters also immediately notified the defendant\u2019s attorney, Lyon, of these threats and that Lyon notified the assistant State\u2019s Attorneys who were assigned to the Steve Shore case. The record further reveals that \u201cBo\u201d Bums admitted that he and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer were at the Shore residence. On cross-examination of \u201cBo\u201d by Lyon,'the following occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\">\u201cQ. I want to call your attention, Mr. Bums, to last week, Wednesday, December 1st and I want to call your attention to the place, 711 East 41st Street, second, third floor.

I told you who he was. I called the police. I called the State\u2019s Attorney. I called gang crimes. I called everybody. You know all about this.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-10\" pgmap=\"493\">MR. SPFVACK: You said you knew somebody?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-11\" pgmap=\"493\">MS.

No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-15\" pgmap=\"493\">BY MS. LYON: Were you there with Rab pounding at their front door?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-16\" pgmap=\"493\">A.

I am taken by surprise by this.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-4\" pgmap=\"494\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: Okay, I take it that you didn\u2019t know who exactly did the threatening?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-6\" pgmap=\"494\">MS. LYON: I didn\u2019t have the real name for Rah until this morning when the State added Mr. Shaffer to their list of witnesses. I now know they are one of the same person ***. I do not believe the State is taken by surprise because I called the State\u2019s Attorney. I called gang crimes, I called Area one Homicide, and I went there and I talked to all these people.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-7\" pgmap=\"494\">And I told Mr. Morrisey, in fact I saw him and spoke to him person to person as I was coming back in the building from having gone out to Mrs. Shore\u2019s home to get as much of the details of this as I could. I was frankly concerned for my client\u2019s family\u2019s safety. I did everything I knew to try to protect them. This is no surprise to anybody.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. SPIVACK [assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: We had no names. I asked Ms. Lyon if we could have names. We don\u2019t tolerate threats. Give us the names. She thought it was some of the State\u2019s witnesses. Didn\u2019t have any definite names.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. MORRISSEY [assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: *** I will admit I spoke to Andrea Lyon about this alleged incident. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for her to come in and make substantive use or affirmative use of these factors at trial. Certainly I should have rendered the names and addresses of the witnesses.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-10\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: I will tell you what I will do. I think it is important enough. We should hear it. Prior to any of the family going on you will have an opportunity to interview them.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-11\" pgmap=\"494\">MS. LYON: Absolutely, I\u2019ll make them available.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b494-12\" pgmap=\"494(86) 495(111)\">It is unlikely that, and indeed difficult, if not impossible, to conceive why the Shores would abruptly close the door in \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d face, immediately call the police and thereafter promptly call defense attorney Lyon, if \u201cBo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d mission to the Shore home was to express their sympathy to the defendant\u2019s mother that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to see her son go to the penitentiary.\u201d Moreover, \u201cBo\u201d would not have heard what \u201cRab\u201d said at the entrance to the third floor apartment if he, \u201cBo,\u201d remained downstairs on his bike as he testified he did. It is also significant that on the very eve of trial, the State, over the defendant\u2019s objection, added Andrew \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer to its list of witnesses. Although he was available at trial, the State did not call him as a witness to rebut the threats attributed to him by the Shore sisters. It is also extremely pertinent that the threats and conduct of \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer, the Shore sisters\u2019 report to the police and attorney Lyon, and Lyon\u2019s report to the assistant State\u2019s Attorneys all occurred immediately before this case was scheduled to proceed to trial.</p> <p id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495\">In ruling on the defendant\u2019s post-trial motion to reopen the proofs, the trial judge stated, \u201cI do not believe Karen Denise Shore. She was impeached by her sister\u2019s account.\u201d The trial judge neglected to point out wherein Laydia Shore\u2019s testimony impeached Karen\u2019s testimony, however. Indeed, the trial court could not do so, because Laydia\u2019s testimony is not contradictory, inconsistent or inapposite to Karen\u2019s. In fact, Karen\u2019s and Laydia\u2019s testimony is unquestionably supportive, corroborative and synonymous.</p> <p id=\"b495-6\" pgmap=\"495\">\u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 testimony, in which he admitted being at the Shore residence on December 1, 1982, with \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer, does not rebut the testimony of the Shore sisters of the threats from \u201cRab.\u201d \u201cBo\u201d Bums, if his testimony is to be believed, was downstairs on his bicycle and therefore could not possibly have known what threats \u201cRab\u201d made at the third-floor entrance to the Shore apartment. But although \u201cRab\u201d was available as a witness to dispute the alleged threats, the State nonetheless refused to call him to testify. It is well settled, of course, that it is the trial court\u2019s function to determine the credibility of a witness. However, that function must be exercised within the evidentiary framework presented at trial, and when a trial court\u2019s basis for disbelieving a witness is completely unsupported by such evidence, the court\u2019s determination of credibility is obviously erroneous and is not entitled to consideration on appellate review.</p> <p id=\"b495-7\" pgmap=\"495(128) 496(29)\">This court\u2019s efforts to support and affirm the trial court\u2019s rejection of the testimony of Karen and Laydia Shore is unacceptable. This court reasons that Laydia\u2019s testimony does not corroborate Karen\u2019s because she did not hear \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d threats after Karen slammed the door. Laydia did not hear \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d threats after the door was slammed simply because, as she testified, when the door was slammed she ran to the rear of the apartment to tell Phyllis to call the police. Second, Laydia corroborated Karen\u2019s testimony about \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 presence at the third-floor entrance to their apartment. Bums, in turn, corroborated Karen and Laydia\u2019s testimony of \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d presence at the door of the Shore apartment. Third, the trial court observed that Karen\u2019s \u201cown sister\u2019s account differed from her\u2019s,\u201d but the trial court failed to point out wherein their testimony is contradictory or in what manner Karen\u2019s testimony of \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d threats \u201cwas not credible.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">When the cause came on for trial on December 2, 1982, the day after \u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer\u2019s sympathetic or threatening visit to the defendant\u2019s home, the record reflects that the defendant again answered ready for trial, that the \u201cState\u2019s witnesses were missing\u201d and the trial was postponed on the State\u2019s motion to December 6, 1982. On December 6 and 7, the same circumstances prevailed. On December 9, the defendant waived trial by jury. Thereupon, a dialogue occurred before the court which unequivocally established that \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland were not the reluctant or recalcitrant State witnesses that they pretended to be. In fact, this colloquy, coupled with their trial testimony, established that their professed sympathy for the defendant and their hesitancy as State\u2019s witnesses were nothing but a thinly veiled, but transparent, subterfuge, because when \u201cBo\u201d Burns and \u201cBlood\" Bland appeared as \u201cunwilling\u201d witnesses, they brought with them a third volunteer witness, Andrew \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer, another El Rukn street gang \u201cfoot soldier,\u201d about whom the prosecuting attorney knew nothing. In addition to bringing the prosecuting attorney this previously unknown witness, these three El Rukns also expediently brought with them belated, previously unrevealed and purportedly detrimental admissions of the defendant of: (1) the shooting; (2) the defendant\u2019s hiding of the victim\u2019s gun and the murder weapon; (3) their joint unsuccessful search efforts for both weapons; and (4) the defendant\u2019s convenient discarding of the murder shell casings in their presence in \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d toilet. This colloquy is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b496-6\" pgmap=\"496\">\u201cMR.

Rather, they were coy and zealous, but subtly endeavoring to convict the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b498-3\" pgmap=\"498\">The prosecuting attorney\u2019s opening statement was that the evidence would establish that on August 10, 1982, Steve Shore shot the victim in the presence of \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland, who came to the police station four days later and implicated the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b498-4\" pgmap=\"498\">The defense attorney\u2019s opening statement was that the description of the assailant to the police by the eyewitness, Ernest Wells, was not a description of the defendant, that Wells did not identify the defendant in the lineup as the assailant; that during the defendant\u2019s custodial interrogation from his arrest on August 13, 1982, to the preliminary hearing on August 16, 1982, the defendant \u201cconsistently maintained his innocence,\u201d that in their interview of \u201cBlood\u201d Bland, he told the defense attorney and her law clerk, Sosnowski, that if he told them what really happened that night he would be charged with perjury; and that \u201cThis is a case of some criminals, some El Rukn gang members who sought to put the blame for the crime on someone else. I don\u2019t know if they did or if they know who did. *** They had a few days to get their story together and they blamed Steve Shore. *** They did not make any statement to the police until August 16, which is some six days late. *** David Bums, also known as \u2018Bo,\u2019 was arrested, brought into the station and he made a statement against Steve Shore *** because he did not want to get the case himself.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">The defense attorney on cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses pursued the defense course outlined in her opening statement. \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland testified on direct examination that the defendant departed their company on the west side of Drexel Boulevard, crossed to the east side of Drexel, shot the deceased, took the deceased\u2019s gun, returned to the west side of Drexel, ran past \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland at 4014 South Drexel, with the pistol in his hand, to 4040 South Drexel and \u201c[tjhrough the projects.\u201d The numerous contradictions and inconsistencies between Bums\u2019 and Bland\u2019s testimony were set forth in chart form in the defendant\u2019s brief before this court. These contradictions need not be here reiterated.</p> <p id=\"b498-6\" pgmap=\"498(91) 499(54)\">Eyewitness Ernest Wells\u2019 version was notably different from Bums\u2019 and Bland\u2019s version. Wells testified that after the shooting the assailant joined an accomplice on the west side of Drexel and that \u201cthey both started running together.\u201d This is not \u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 or \u201cBlood\u201d Bland\u2019s version, and this court is exceedingly generous, to say the least, in attempting to reconcile this testimonial conflict by relying on the fact that \u201cneither Bums nor Bland was asked whether defendant fled the area alone.\u201d It could be persuasively argued that Burns\u2019 and Bland\u2019s version established that the assailant ran past them and fled \u201calone\u201d into the housing project, without any further testimonial clarification from them. It could be just as persuasively argued that the assistant State\u2019s Attorney shied away from further inquiry of his two witnesses in this area for fear of further contradictions in their testimony.</p> <p id=\"b499-5\" pgmap=\"499\">\u201cBo\u201d Bums testified further on direct examination that after seeing the defendant ran through the project, he, Bums, proceeded to the Regency Lounge, a tavern at 41st Street and Cottage Grove, and while there he saw Steve Shore again riding on a bike.</p> <p id=\"b499-6\" pgmap=\"499\">This \u201cbike\u201d testimony takes on a special significance when the defendant\u2019s post-verdict testimony, hereafter set forth, is considered. \u201cBlood\u201d Bland\u2019s \u201cbike\u201d testimony on direct examination is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b499-7\" pgmap=\"499\">\u201cQ. Who was there when he passed you, who were you with?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-8\" pgmap=\"499\">A. Me, Bums, and Willie.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-9\" pgmap=\"499\">Q. Did Steve say anything as he passed you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-10\" pgmap=\"499\">A. I didn\u2019t hear him say anything.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-11\" pgmap=\"499\">Q. What did you do as Steve passed you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-12\" pgmap=\"499\">A. I started walking south towards the projects.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-13\" pgmap=\"499\">Q. Who were you with. Were you alone or with someone?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-14\" pgmap=\"499\">A. I was with Bums.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-15\" pgmap=\"499\">Q. Then what is the next thing that happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-16\" pgmap=\"499\">A. I seen Steve in the projects.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-17\" pgmap=\"499\">Q. Where did you see him in the projects?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-18\" pgmap=\"499\">A. On the west side of the building.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-19\" pgmap=\"499\">Q. Was he walking, in a car, or what?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b499-20\" pgmap=\"499\">A. He was getting on a bike.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b499-21\" pgmap=\"499\">\u201cBlood\u201d Bland testified on direct examination that he and \u201cBo\u201d Bums spent the night with Andrew Shaffer and that the following morning the defendant came by Shaffer\u2019s home, told them that he had put one gun in a red container and had thrown the other gun under a car or some bushes; that they, Bland, Bums, Shaffer and the defendant, went to \u201c42nd Street through the alley,\u201d that he, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland, did not find or look for a pistol and that Bland, Bums and Shaffer left the defendant there to look for the pistols. Bland\u2019s further direct testimony was that later that day the defendant came to Shaffer\u2019s mother\u2019s home and told him that he had found one pistol, which the defendant showed him, along with two fired bullets or cartridges, which the defendant put in the toilet.</p> <p id=\"b499-22\" pgmap=\"499(48) 500(76)\">\u201cBo\u201d Bums\u2019 direct testimony was that the defendant came by Andrew Shaffer\u2019s home the morning following the shooting and admitted to him, Bums, Bland and Shaffer that he \u201ckilled this chump,\u201d and that the defendant said \u201che don\u2019t know where he threw the pistol. He said he threw one in a red container and the murder weapon he said he hid under some wood.\u201d Burns further stated on direct examination that the four of them went to the area of \u201c43rd and Langley,\u201d that later he saw the defendant at Shaffer\u2019s mother\u2019s house, at which time the defendant had the .38-pistol, which he opened, took out two fired cartridges, flushed them \u201cdown the commode and took the gun with him and left.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b500-5\" pgmap=\"500\">Neither Bums nor Bland ever mentioned these post-homicide incidents inculpating the defendant at any time during their extensive interrogations and interviews by the police on August 14, 1982, when they initially \u201cput the case\u201d on Steve Shore. As before stated, the victim\u2019s gun had not been found in a \u201cred container.\u201d The very first time these post-homicide episodes are mentioned by Burns and Bland is when they appear on the morning of the trial, December 9, 1982, with their newly discovered El Rukn foot soldier compatriot, \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer. It involves no difficulty to conclude that these dramatically incriminating episodes were contrived.</p> <p id=\"b500-6\" pgmap=\"500\">This court endeavors to explain and justify Bland\u2019s and Bums\u2019 protracted silence on these post-homicide, inculpating episodes by stating \u201cthere is nothing in the record here indicating that either witness was questioned concerning those matters. In view of their testimony that they wanted no involvement with the police *** we do not believe it likely that either Bums or Bland would have volunteered any information not specifically requested by the police.\u201d This explanation is unsatisfactory. The fact that the record is silent on Bland and Bums\u2019 being questioned on \u201cthese matters\u201d establishes simply that the record is silent on the matter. Second, having been told by the police that Steve Shore tried to give the case to \u201cBo\u201d Bums, it seems Bums would not have hesitated but would have been adamant in immediately telling the officers of Steve Shore\u2019s post-homicide inculpatory admissions and conduct. Third, the officers\u2019 initial protracted interrogation of Bums and Bland would have elicited from them information about these incidents had they occurred. Fourth, the officers could not possibly have known to request information concealed by the three El Rukns and about which the officers had no knowledge. Fifth, if they were such reluctant witnesses, how then was the assistant State\u2019s Attorney so readily able to obtain such previously unrevealed, volunteered information from them, when they were no longer threatened with being charged with the murder, and when the police were unable to acquire this same information from them even under the threat of the murder charge? Moreover, \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer was added as a last-minute witness, immediately before trial, but he was not called as a witness by the State to substantiate these extremely tardy post-homicide admissions and actions of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b501-4\" pgmap=\"501\">More importantly, however, the conglomerate testimony of \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland that the defendant shot the deceased to rob him of his gun, that the defendant hid both guns, one in a red container, at unknown locations, and then told Bums and Bland about it the next day, solicited their unsuccessful aid in finding the weapons, and finally returned to their presence with the murder weapon, flushed the two murder shell casings down the commode and promptly departed their company is ludicrous, far-fetched, unreasonable and unworthy of belief. As defense counsel so convincingly argued, their reluctance to be witnesses might just have well been occasioned by their knowledge of the defendant\u2019s innocence, and/or their own commission of or involvement in the homicide.</p> <p id=\"b501-5\" pgmap=\"501\">\u201cBo\u201d Bums, \u201cBlood\u201d Bland and Myra Sexton concluded their testimony on December 9, 1982. The trial was continued to the following day, at which time there was a cause-of-death stipulation. The trial was postponed to December 16, 1982, and then to December 22, when Paulette Jones testified that she found the victim\u2019s gun in a \u201cred container\u201d on August 22, 1982. The State rested, and the court heard arguments in support of and in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for a not-guilty finding, which the court denied. Thereupon, the defendant called Ernest Wells, the eyewitness to the homicide, and Karen Shore and Laydia Shore, the defendant\u2019s sisters, each of whom testified as previously set forth. Various stipulations were entered into, and thereafter Sosnowski testified, also as previously set forth. The defense rested, and the State offered no rebuttal testimony. The court heard closing arguments and postponed making a finding to January 6, 1983, on which date the court found the defendant guilty of felony murder. The court set hearing of post-trial motions for January 13, 1983, on which date the motions were reset for February 28,1983.</p> <p id=\"b501-6\" pgmap=\"501\">On February 28, 1983, defense attorney Lyon presented a motion to reopen the evidence, which in part stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b501-7\" pgmap=\"501\">\u201cCertain evidence was not presented at trial. This evidence was not presented because both counsel and Mr. Shore were afraid for his life. He has been threatened both in and out of jail, his family has been threatened, and he has been beaten in jail. The threats are that if he told what he saw he will be killed by the El Ru-kins.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b501-8\" pgmap=\"501\">The motion was signed by attorney Lyon, but the source of her information was not revealed. The trial judge entered and continued the defendant\u2019s motion to reopen to March 8, 1983, and in so doing advised attorney Lyon, \u201cYou might want to go ahead and submit an affidavit to back up what you have as to what your client is going to be saying.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b502-2\" pgmap=\"502\">On March 8, 1983, attorney Lyon filed the defendant\u2019s affidavit, the pertinent parts of which are as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b502-3\" pgmap=\"502\">\u201c2. I did not testify at my trial in this cause because I was told to keep quiet or I and my family would be harmed or killed. The threat was made by David \u2018Bo\u2019 Bums and \u2018Rab\u2019 Shaffer. The first threat was made before my arrest. There have been several since.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-4\" pgmap=\"502\">3. The reason I was threatened is simple. I did not shoot Garrison Hester. I was riding my bicycle south on Drexel Boulevard heading home shortly after midnight on August 10, 1982. I heard two shots from the other side of the street, and saw a man running across the median strip with a gun in his hand. He joined up with a second man and ran away. I recognized the first man. He is Davis \u2018Bo\u2019 Bums. He recognized me because we live in the same neighborhood although we are not friends or associates. He is an El Rukin. I am not.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">4. I did not tell the police this because I was afraid the El Ru-kins would kill me. I did not even tell Ms. Lyon this until we had already begun trial for the same reason.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502\">The defendant\u2019s revelations to his attorney constituted attorney-client privileged communications. But whether the defendant was aware of and knowingly waived the privilege by submission of his affidavit need not be here decided.</p> <p id=\"b502-7\" pgmap=\"502\">On presentation of the defendant\u2019s affidavit, attorney Lyon stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b502-8\" pgmap=\"502\">\u201cAs to the good cause and reason as to why this evidence was not presented at trial, I would like to say two things. First of all, Mr. Shore\u2019s very real fear of reprisals against him by the members of the gang to which the State\u2019s witnesses in this case belong, or belonged, if you believe that they all quit. The second reason, your Honor, is a little more complicated, and I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m approaching this correctly in discussing it at this point, but I will do so. The second reason is because Steve Shore was so afraid of these people, that not only did he not talk to the police about what he saw that night, but he didn\u2019t talk to me about what he saw that night until after a jury waiver had been executed and the trial began. *** [H]e is very much afraid, his family has been threatened and assaulted, he has been assaulted in the jail, and he is very much afraid.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b502-9\" pgmap=\"502\">It is quite apparent from the foregoing that attorney Lyon recognized the possibility that her remarks might constitute an infraction of the attorney-client communication privilege. Indeed, she was in a delicate predicament.</p> <p id=\"b502-10\" pgmap=\"502(10) 503(1)\">The State opposed defendant's motion to reopen. Attorney Lyon responded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b503-5\" pgmap=\"503\">\u201c*** I know this is awkward, I feel awkward right now, I feel very awkward because my client was so afraid of this whole situation that he did not confide in me until he cracked, frankly, he cracked during the trial, and fell apart and told me what happened.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b503-6\" pgmap=\"503\">Understandably, attorney Lyon was in an \u201cawkward\u201d predicament in revealing to the court and the State her client\u2019s privileged communication, in spite of her unquestionably benevolent motive. Again, whether the defendant knowingly waived the attorney-client privilege need not be here determined. The trial judge decided to receive evidence on the motion to reopen as an offer of proof. In so doing, he expressly noted:</p> <blockquote id=\"b503-7\" pgmap=\"503\">\u201cHere I note that the defendant, after the testimony of the two eyewitnesses that testified *** he would have *** asked for a continuance, I could easily see granting him a continuance if it were told to me for the first time that after listening he decided to confide a little bit more with his attorney. But here the defendant just sat through all of the testimony, the court took a date to go ahead and evaluate the evidence, and look carefully through it, and the defendant didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"ArG\" pgmap=\"503\">Thereupon the trial judge set the cause for March 17, 1983, \u201cfor an offer of proof under oath.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b503-8\" pgmap=\"503\">Robert Lee Clark and the defendant testified on the \u201coffer of proof under oath\u201d on March 17, 1983. They both stated that on August 10, 1982, shortly after midnight they were riding their bikes at 40th and Drexel. It would appear to be more than mere irony that both \u201cBo\u201d Bums and \u201cBlood\u201d Bland testified that the defendant appeared (suddenly out of nowhere) on a bike after the deceased was shot, which was preceded by an evening of drinking wine and smoking dope with the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b503-9\" pgmap=\"503(160) 504(81)\">Clark and the defendant testified further that while riding their bikes they heard two shots and then saw a man running with a gun in his hand, that he was joined by another man and they both ran off. Clark testified that he did not know either man, that he did not tell the police what he had seen \u201c[bjecause I was afraid because I know what those studs would do to me if I would go to the police and tell.\u201d The defendant identified the man with the gun in his hand as Dave Bums, whom he did not know personally but had seen in the neighborhood. The defendant testified further that Bums pointed at him and said something to the other man, who also pointed at him and the two men ran toward the (housing) project. The defendant stated that he went home, that he did not shoot the deceased and that on the following morning at \u201cRab\u2019s\u201d house he did not show a gun to \u201cRab,\u201d David Bums or Chester Bland. It was the defendant\u2019s further testimony that the next day he went to a lounge for cigarettes for his mother and \u201cthe taller guy and his friend asked him if he saw anything and told him if he said anything to anybody about it he would find himself in the morgue and he told them that he didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d He testified further on redirect examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201cQ. Steve, you didn\u2019t tell me anything about hearing shots until after the trial began, is that correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b504-7\" pgmap=\"504\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b504-8\" pgmap=\"504\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b504-9\" pgmap=\"504\">Q. Why not?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b504-10\" pgmap=\"504\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b504-11\" pgmap=\"504\">A. Because I was scared to tell what I seen because of what they told me and I know what they told me and I know what these people do to people and I have heard and I know of people, what they do to them and my family got threatened and I got tired and I didn\u2019t feel all this was going to happen to me, I just wanted to go ahead and let it all be over with and leave it alone, I didn\u2019t want to hurt nobody. *** I didn\u2019t want to have nothing to do with this.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b504-12\" pgmap=\"504\">In arguing to the trial judge to open the proofs and accept the foregoing testimony of Clark and the defendant that was presented on the offer of proof, attorney Lyon declared:</p> <blockquote id=\"b504-13\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201cHe [defendant] should have said to the police detectives I\u2019m scared to death, I\u2019m terrified, these guys threatened me, threatened my family. *** The young man was afraid and he was so afraid it warped his judgment. God knows he should have told me, there is no question about it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b504-14\" pgmap=\"504\">Attorney Lyon further argued:</p> <blockquote id=\"b504-15\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201cI am personally convinced of my client\u2019s innocence and I know that that is not evidence and their objection is correct. *** I am speaking to you as a professional and it is a personal plea too ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b504-16\" pgmap=\"504\">The trial judge took the offer of proof under advisement and postponed the proceedings to March 24,1983, to rule on the offer of proof.</p> <p id=\"b504-17\" pgmap=\"504\">On March 24, 1983, the trial judge made the following comments and ruling:</p> <blockquote id=\"b504-18\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201c[E]ven though the testimony in this case is over prior to Christmas, defendant per his attorney, first tells her about another account at Christmastime. Even though the case is set for decision on January 6, 1983, no motion to reopen the proofs is filed or requested.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b505-4\" pgmap=\"505\">After a finding of guilty defendant\u2019s attorney then first makes a motion to reopen proofs concerning an account that the defendant told her at Christmastime. Defendant\u2019s attorney in her argument in response to the hearing on the motion to reopen proofs on March 17, 1983, even though she states that it is improper for an attorney to indicate what she personally believes, she indicates that she believes that the defendant is innocent. This, even though that the defendant has been far from candid with even his own attorney.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">An attorney\u2019s beliefs are improper in argument, and I hope that I don\u2019t hear what any attorney\u2019s beliefs are in this courtroom again.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b505-6\" pgmap=\"505\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b505-7\" pgmap=\"505\">There is no question in my mind that Bums and Bland did not want to testify against the defendant in this case. Defendant never thought they would come forward, which is one reason I suspect there was a demand for trial from the date that this case came to my call.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b505-8\" pgmap=\"505\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b505-9\" pgmap=\"505\">The motion to reopen proofs is hereby denied. The evidence here was not inadvertently overlooked. Defendant knew what the evidence was against him all along the way. When he finally saw what dynamite the State had against him he apparently started to worry and told his attorney at Christmastime another account of what happened. Nothing is done, ***. Instead, the trial court was allowed to give its findings without objection or even a hint that further testimony was being considered. Defendant wanted his cake and he wanted to eat it, also. In effect, what was done here is called laches, lack of diligence. *** If I admitted the offer of proof my decision would remain the same. The felony murder finding of guilty stands.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b505-10\" pgmap=\"505\">If the defendant \u201cwanted his cake and he wanted to eat it, also,\u201d the trial judge refused to allow him to do so. Instead, it was the trial judge who \u201cwanted his cake and he wanted to eat it, also,\u201d and in fact did so repeatedly.</p> <p id=\"b505-11\" pgmap=\"505(81) 506(5)\">First, the trial judge heard Clark\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s testimony on the offer of proof on the defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the proofs, and then relied on that testimony and the defendant\u2019s lack of credibility in denying the motion. Second, the trial judge relied on the defendant\u2019s relationship with his attorney in adversely assessing his credibility. Yet, the defendant\u2019s attorney vowed to the court her personal confidence in the defendant\u2019s credibility, her belief of the defendant\u2019s fears and her assuredness of the defendant\u2019s innocence.</p> <p id=\"b506-5\" pgmap=\"506\">Third, the trial judge resoundingly condemned the defense attorney for expressing and injecting her personal beliefs of the defendant\u2019s innocence into the case. The trial judge then expressly relied on the defendant\u2019s privileged communications to his attorney in determining the defendant\u2019s credibility and his basis for disbelieving the defendant\u2019s testimony. To have done so was plain error. The propriety of the disclosure of privileged attorney-client communications and waiver of the privilege need not therefore be further discussed or decided.</p> <p id=\"b506-6\" pgmap=\"506\">Fourth, the trial judge simultaneously held that \u201c[i]f I admitted the offer of proof my decision would be the same.\u201d The trial judge, by the means stated, miraculously \u201ckept his cake and ate it also,\u201d which he had successfully precluded the defendant from accomplishing, if such was the defendant\u2019s intent.</p> <p id=\"b506-7\" pgmap=\"506\">A mere cursory examination and analysis of the trial judge\u2019s comments, findings and ruling clearly reveal that the trial judge committed plain error. It was manifestly improper for the trial judge to have allowed the defendant\u2019s demand for trial to have played any role in his decision on the defendant\u2019s offer of proof or on the defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the evidence. The trial judge obviously did so, as revealed by his statement that because Burns and Bland were reluctant witnesses, the court thought, \u201cis one reason I suspect there was a demand for trial from the date this case came on my call.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p> <p id=\"b506-8\" pgmap=\"506\">This court\u2019s treatment of this issue in effect avoids the issue. This court merely points out that \u201cthere is further support for the [trial] court\u2019s conclusion that he [defendant] did not believe the State had sufficient evidence to convict him and therefore chose to immediately proceed to trial.\u201d This artistry circumvents the gross impropriety of the trial judge\u2019s reliance, however negligible, on a defendant\u2019s trial demand in evaluating and determining the defendant\u2019s credibility.</p> <p id=\"b506-9\" pgmap=\"506(143) 507(78)\">The trial judge was unjustified in its cavalier rejection of the defendant\u2019s testimony of his fears. It is common knowledge that street gang violence is rampant in the Chicago area. Moreover, the defendant initially implicated \u201cBo\u201d Bums in the homicide to the police. It could be reasonably inferred that his fear prohibited him from further expanding on his knowledge of Bums\u2019 involvement to the police. Thus, Bums was thereby enabled to manipulate himself from accused to accuser. In addition, it was not the defendant who invited Bums and \u201cRab\u201d Shaffer to his mother\u2019s home on December 1, 1982, whether to express their sympathy or espouse their threats. No one invited them. The defendant was in custody at the time awaiting trial. Not only that, if the defendant committed the homicide, his testimony on the offer of proof of hearing shots and seeing Bums with a gun, join another man and flee the scene was concocted, and thus, it was not out of fear of gang reprisal that motivated him to withhold his concoction from his lawyer. Hi that event he would have had no reluctance to immediately reveal his concoction to his attorney. The trial judge\u2019s reasoning in evaluating and rejecting the testimony of Clark and the defendant on the offer of proof was unacceptable.</p> <p id=\"b507-5\" pgmap=\"507\">A far more grievous error was committed by the trial judge when he determined the defendant\u2019s lack of credibility on the offer of proof and denied defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the proofs on the mistaken, grossly erroneous and evidentiary unsupported conclusion that the defendant \u201ctold his attorney at Christmastime another account of what happened\u201d and \u201cthe defendant has been far from candid with even his own attorney.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A thorough and meticulous search of the entire record utterly fails to disclose that what the defendant \u201ctold his attorney at Christmastime\u201d was another or different account of what he had previously told his attorney. Nowhere in the entire record is there revealed that the defendant previously told his attorney an account of what happened that was different than the account he related to her during the trial at Christmas. Nor is there any evidentiary support for the trial judge\u2019s naked assertion \u201cthat the defendant has been far from candid with even his own attorney.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p> <p id=\"b507-6\" pgmap=\"507\">From the complete record, all that appears is that the defendant denied commission of the homicide to the police, his lawyer and to the trial judge, and that he was afraid to tell even his own lawyer what he had seen. The record is also completely silent on whether he told his attorney prior to trial that it was his fear that prompted him to withhold his observations from her. It can be reasonably inferred from the record that he informed her that he was afraid to tell her what he knew, and it can be just as reasonably inferred from the record that he did not. Nevertheless, revelation or nondisclosure of his fear to his attorney, or revelation or nondisclosure of what he had seen after the trial had commenced is a far cry from telling \u201chis attorney at Christmastime another account of what happened,\u201d as the trial court found. And if the defendant had in fact told his attorney that because of his fear of gang reprisals he would, not tell her what he knew, on which subject the record is totally silent, then there is likewise no basis in this record for the trial judge\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the defendant has been far from candid with even his own attorney.\u201d Because of the trial court\u2019s erroneous and evidentiary unsupported conclusions on such crucial issues in this case, the plain-error doctrine is unavoidably applicable.</p> <p id=\"b507-7\" pgmap=\"507(20) 508(108)\">Defense counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s reliance on the attorney-client privileged communications in determining the defendant\u2019s credibility, or more accurately, his lack of credibility. Nor did defense counsel object to the trial judge\u2019s findings that the defendant told defense counsel \u201canother account of what happened\u201d and had \u201cbeen far from candid with even his own attorney,\u201d although such findings were not supported by any evidence or facts in the record. Nor has defense counsel assigned this erroneous conduct by the trial judge for reversal before this court. Supreme Court Rule 615 (73 Ill. 2d R. 615(a)) provides, however, that on appeal \u201c[pjlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b508-5\" pgmap=\"508\">This rule and the plain-error doctrine were applied in People v. Benniefield (1980), 88 Ill. App. 3d 150, 410 N.E.2d 455, in which six eyewitnesses testified that the defendant and the deceased argued during a gambling game, that the defendant departed, and that shortly thereafter the defendant returned and gunned down the deceased. The defendant\u2019s version was that the deceased and several of the State\u2019s eyewitnesses chased him and that he shot the deceased in self-defense. On cross-examination, the defendant denied that he had testified at a prior hearing that he had been chased by the State\u2019s witnesses. It was not revealed to the jury or the trial judge that the prior hearing, about which inquiry was made of the defendant on cross-examination, was a plea bargaining proceeding, the evidence of which was inadmissible under Supreme Court Rule 402(a) (73 Ill. 2d R. 402(a)). Defense counsel failed to assert Rule 402 as a basis for his objection to this cross-examination, nor did he rely on this cross-examination in his post-trial motions. On review, the court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b508-6\" pgmap=\"508\">\u201cNotwithstanding the above, the defendant claims it was plain error for the trial court to allow impeachment by the use of a plea discussion. Supreme Court Rule 615 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110A, par. 615) provides that plain errors affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court. The exercise of this option is discretionary by the reviewing court (People v. Fleming (1964), 54 Ill. App. 2d 457, 203 N.E.2d 716), depending on the closeness of the case, the conduct of the trial judge, the extent to which the error may have contributed to the verdict, and the magnitude of the error alleged. People v. Lagardo (1967), 82 Ill. App. 2d 119, 226 N.E.2d 492; People v. Jones (1971), 131 Ill. App. 2d 361, 268 N.E.2d 248.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b508-8\" pgmap=\"508\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b508-9\" pgmap=\"508(34) 509(8)\">[W]e are justified in noticing the error as plain error under Supreme Court Rule 615. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed and the cause will be remanded for a new trial.\u201d People v. Benniefield (1980), 88 Ill. App. 3d 150, 155-56.</blockquote> <p id=\"b509-5\" pgmap=\"509\">Supreme Court Rule 615 was previously embodied in identical language in section 121 \u2014 9(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. 38, sec. 121 \u2014 9(a)), which was applied in People v. Lagardo (1967), 82 Ill. App. 2d 119, 226 N.E.2d 492. In Lagardo, the jury found the defendant guilty of theft on evidence that shortly after the victim\u2019s home was burglarized, the victim\u2019s property that was taken in the burglary was found in the defendant\u2019s home. The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion for a change of venue and substitution of judges, which the defendant failed to assign as a ground for a new trial. Although the guilty finding was based on a jury verdict, the appellate court reversed and held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b509-6\" pgmap=\"509\">\u201cOur Code of Criminal Procedure, section 121 \u2014 9(a), dealing with causes on appeal, states:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b509-7\" pgmap=\"509\">Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court. [Ill. Rev. Stats. (1963), c 38, sec. 121 \u2014 9(a)] [now Supreme Court Rule 615(a) (73 Ill. 2d R. 615(a))].</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b509-8\" pgmap=\"509\">While the general rule is that nonjurisdictional matters not included in a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial are deemed to have been waived and therefore not subject to review, section 121 \u2014 9(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has codified an exception to that general rule in instances where the alleged defect is patent, and it affects substantial rights to the satisfaction of the reviewing court in the exercise of their discretionary powers. Briefly, it may be said that the pivotal factors to be considered to determine whether or not an exercise of such discretion is warranted are, the closeness of the case, the conduct of the trial judge, the extent to which questionable evidence may have contributed to a guilty verdict, the fairness of the trial in general, and the magnitude of the errors alleged. *** We feel that the circumstances attendant on the proceedings below warrant an exercise of such discretion to review the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s denial of a hearing on the aforementioned pretrial motions.\u201d People v. Lagardo (1967), 82 Ill. App. 2d 119, 123-24.</blockquote> <p id=\"b509-9\" pgmap=\"509(89) 510(1)\">In the case at bar, the trial judge\u2019s defects affect patent and substantial rights. Each of the pivotal factors, set forth in Lagardo, are present here. These factors are: (1) the closeness of the case; (2) the conduct of the trial judge; (3) questionable evidence which may have contributed to the trial court\u2019s findings and rulings (there was no such evidence in the instant case); and (4) the fairness of the trial in general. Application of Supreme Court Rule 615 is therefore not only warranted but indeed is demanded.</p> <p id=\"b510-5\" pgmap=\"510\">In People v. Crossno (1981), 93 Ill. App. 3d 808, 417 N.E.2d 827, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder and aggravated battery. The prosecuting attorney made inflammatory remarks to the jury in closing argument. The reviewing court reversed and held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b510-6\" pgmap=\"510\">\u201cIt is conceded by the defendant that none of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was objected to at trial, nor were contentions of error regarding them included in post-trial motions. \u2018In criminal cases in which the evidence is closely balanced, [our Supreme Court] has held that [we] may consider errors that have not been properly preserved for review.\u2019 (People v. Pickett (1973), 54 Ill. 2d 280, 283, 296 N.E.2d 856.) In a case such as this, where the evidence of guilt was conflicting, the statements by the prosecutor which we have found to constitute error \u2018affected substantial rights of the defendant and consequently they are considered in this appeal under the \u201c \u2018plain error\u2019 \u201d doctrine.\u2019 *** For the same reason, these errors cannot be ruled harmless on the record.\u201d 93 Ill.
