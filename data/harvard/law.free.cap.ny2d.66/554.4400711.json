An order which finally adjudicates a cause of action which is unrelated to, and independent of, another cause of action in a complaint or counterclaim is final as to the former but not the latter. However, an order such as that in the present case which decides some issues of relief but leaves pending between the same parties other such issues would, in effect, divide a single cause of action and is, therefore, nonfinal <em>(Le Mistral v Columbia Broadcasting Sys., </em>61 AD2d 491, <em>appeal dismissed </em>46 NY2d 940; Cohen and Karger, <em>op. cit. </em>\u00a7 21, at 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The motion for leave to appeal should, therefore, be dismissed for nonfinality.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Judge Hancock, Jr., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Motion for leave to appeal dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
