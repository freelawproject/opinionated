Having designed and treated its management fee as a single service charge, Colt cannot now transform any part of it from business income into interest income from subsidiary capital. <em>(Commissioner v National Alfalfa Dehydrating, </em>417 US 134; <em>Higgins v Smith, </em>308 US 473; <em>Spector v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>641 F2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>376, 454 US 868; <em>Sullivan v United States, </em>618 F2d 1001; <em>Matter of Sverdlow v Bates, </em>283 App Div 487; <em>Matter of Steen, </em>509 F2d 1398; <em>Harvey Radio Labs. v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>470 F2d 118; <em>Balthrope v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>356 F2d 28; <em>Schulz v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>294 F2d 52; <em>Ullman v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>264 F2d 305.) II. There is substantial evidence in the record that no portion of the management fee was income from subsidiary capital. Therefore, the Department\u2019s determination that the entire fee was business income, no portion of which was excludable from entire net income for city tax purposes, should not have been vacated. <em>(Utility Trailer Mfg.

The court below was correct in holding that the portion of the management fee representing a reimbursement of nondeductible interest is nontaxable income from subsidiary capital. <em>(Dobson v Commissioner, </em>320 US 489, 321 US 231.) II. Alternatively, the decision of the court below should be affirmed because a portion of the management fee was in fact interest charged by Colt to its subsidiaries and as such is excludable income from subsidiary capital. <em>(Deputy v du Pont, </em>308 US 488; <em>Old Colony R. R. Co. v Commissioner, </em>284 US 552; <em>Dorzback v Collison, </em>195 F2d 69; <em>Utility Trailer Mfg.

III. Colt is not taxable on amounts that it received as a conduit between outside lenders and its subsidiaries. <em>(Commissioner v Kresge Dept.

As a management company, Colt\u2019s functions and responsibilities were in the areas of general management, policy development and formation, and centralized service functions. As a holding company, Colt owned all the stock of operating subsidiaries. Colt\u2019s principal subsidiaries were Crucible, Inc., Colt Industries Operating Corp., Central Moloney, Inc. and Trent Tube B.V. In its capacity as a holding company, Colt served as the principal financing vehicle for its subsidiaries, borrowing money from third-party lenders and advancing funds to its subsidiaries to satisfy their working capital needs. Funds borrowed by Colt which were not needed by the subsidiaries at the time of each loan were temporarily invested in short-term securities for cash management purposes. Colt performed this borrowing function on behalf of its subsidiaries on a centralized basis because, by backing each loan with the combined assets of all the subsidiaries, it could borrow funds at more favorable rates and terms than could the subsidiaries acting individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In order to recover its operating costs, which included general administrative, selling and net interest expenses, incurred for services rendered to its subsidiaries, Colt imposed upon each of its subsidiaries a charge, denominated by Colt a \"management fee\u201d. This management fee was based upon a percentage of the gross projected sales of each subsidiary. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>determining the percentage of sales to be charged in a given year, Colt estimated its over-all head office operating costs which included general administrative, selling and net interest expenses. Colt then estimated the sales of each subsidiary for the coming year and totaled all of its projected sales. This ratio of parent costs over subsidiary sales constituted the percentage of sales which Colt generally charged each subsidiary as a management fee for the coming year.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The management fee imposed upon the subsidiaries by Colt included an interest factor. The interest factor of the management fee represented Colt\u2019s net interest expense, determined by subtracting from its gross interest expense the estimated income it derived from temporarily investing funds borrowed from third-party lenders in short-term money market instruments. The management fee did not contain a profit element. During the years in question, the major portion of the management fee represented interest expenses. Colt, however, failed to identify any portion of the management fee as interest income on its books or tax returns. Similarly, the subsidiaries did not label the management fee as \"interest\u201d upon their tax returns. The management fee represented a unified charge for all services rendered by Colt to its subsidiaries, and while the fee contained an interest factor, it could not, according to the New York City Department of Finance (Department), be broken down into component parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The Department issued notices of determination dated September 28, 1978, advising Colt that there were due general corporation tax deficiencies for the years 1971 through 1974. Colt filed a timely petition for redetermination of such deficiencies and, further, sought a refund of general corporation tax for 1971. Before the Department, Colt contended that a portion of the management fees paid to Colt by its subsidiaries contained a verifiable interest factor, so that the management fee constituted income from subsidiary capital which is excludable from entire net income under New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1). The Department disagreed with this view, and determined that there existed a deficiency in New York City general corporation tax in the principal amount of $759,008 plus interest of $463,722.33, representing a total of $1,222,730.33 for 1972, 1973 and 1974. The Department also denied Colt\u2019s claim for a refund of general corporation tax for 1971 in the amount of $6,586.82. Colt commenced this article 78 proceeding to review the determination of the Department. The Appellate Division vacated that determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tian of the Department, dated June 24, 1983, and thereby reversed the assessment of deficiencies against Colt for the years 1972-1974 and the denial of Colt\u2019s refund claim for 1971. For the reasons that follow, we now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Administrative Code of the City of New York (Administrative Code) provides that for the privilege of doing business in the City of New York, every domestic or foreign corporation shall annually pay a tax upon the basis of its entire net income. (Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-3.0 [1].) Entire net income is defined as \"net income from all sources which shall be the same as the taxpayer\u2019s federal taxable income\u201d subject to certain modifications. These modifications, insofar as are relevant to this appeal, are set forth in Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1) and \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (b) (6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1) provides that a taxpayer can deduct \"income, gains and losses from subsidiary capital\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, section 3-11 (b) (2) (i) of the New York City General Corporation Tax Regulations provides that a taxpayer may deduct from Federal taxable income \"all dividends, interest and gains from subsidiary capital * * * but not any other income from subsidiaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">At the outset of our discussion, it is necessary to set forth our standard of appellate review. As stated in <em>Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(49 NY2d 451, 459), \"[w]here the interpretation of a statute or its application involves knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices or entails an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>drawn therefrom, the courts regularly defer to the governmental agency charged with the responsibility for administration of the statute. If its interpretation is not irrational or unreasonable, it will be upheld <em>(Matter of Howard v Wyman, </em>28 NY2d 434; cf. <em>Ostrer v Schenck, </em>41 NY2d 782, 786)\u201d. Moreover, it is the taxpayer\u2019s burden to establish its entitlement to an exclusion from tax. <em>(Matter of Mobil Oil Corp. v Finance Administrator, </em>58 NY2d 95, 99.) In this case, the determinations of the Department were based upon a characterization of the management fee, as well as an analysis of the structure and function of said fee. The Department\u2019s evaluation of the management fee is, of course, sharply disputed by Colt. Under these circumstances, the role of this court is to ascertain whether the Department\u2019s construction of Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1) and its concomitant tax treatment of the management fee were irrational or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Pursuant to Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1), taxpayers are entitled to exclude, in computing entire net income, interest income from subsidiary capital. The Department, construing Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1), determined that Colt\u2019s management fee, while technically income from a subsidiary, was not shown to be \"income from subsidiary capital\u201d. This view is, under the circumstances presented by this appeal, neither irrational nor unreasonable. Colt itself chose to treat the amounts now claimed to be interest income as an undenominated part of a lump-sum management fee, not matched in form or substance to borrowings, and to characterize the fee on its books and tax returns (as did its subsidiaries) as business income (or business expense). The management fees collected by Colt from its subsidiaries were based upon a fixed percentage of the estimated volume of the subsidiaries\u2019 projected gross sales. The management fee was not assessed according to the level of management services received by the subsidiaries, nor was it based upon the amount borrowed by any particular subsidiary or the amount of income generated by Colt\u2019s investment in each subsidiary. Nor can it be said, on this record, that the management fee directly reflected compensation paid by the subsidiaries to Colt for use of the latter\u2019s funds especially since the subsidiaries failed to identify any portion of the fee as \"interest\u201d upon their tax returns. Recognizing that the management fee did not represent income resulting from the investment of capital, and the unified, nondivisible charge was not identified by Colt as interest income, and was, in reality, directly correlated to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>fixed percentage of subsidiary sales, the determination of the Department that the management fee was not \"income from subsidiary capital\u201d was both rational and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the June 24, 1983 determination of the New York City Department of Finance reinstated, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Meyer, Simons, Kaye, Alexander and Titone concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\">. For the purposes of clarity, \"Colt\u201d hereinafter refers only to the taxpayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">. As noted by the Appellate Division, \"[t]he parties are in agreement that the portion of Colt\u2019s management fees represented by interest expense was attributable to subsidiary capital and therefore not deductible under section R46-2.0 (subd 8, par [b], cl [6]) of the city\u2019s Administrative Code\u201d. (106 AD2d 59, 63.) Accordingly, we review only the Department\u2019s construction of New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (8) (a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">. \" 'Subsidiary capital\u2019 \u201d is defined, pursuant to Administrative Code \u00a7 R46-2.0 (3) as: \"investments in the stock of subsidiaries and any indebtedness from subsidiaries, exclusive of accounts receivable acquired in the ordinary course of trade or business for services rendered or for sales of property held primarily for sale to customers, whether or not evidenced by written instrument, on which interest is not claimed and deducted by the subsidiary for purposes of taxation under this part or part three of this title, provided, however, that, in the discretion of the director of finance, there shall be deducted from subsidiary capital any liabilities payable by their terms on demand or within one year from the date incurred, other than loans or advances outstanding for more than a year as of any date during the year covered by the report, which are attributable to subsidiary capital\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
