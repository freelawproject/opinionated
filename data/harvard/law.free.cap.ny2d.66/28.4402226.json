We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Plaintiffs are trustees of a welfare and pension trust fund established by Local Union 282. They commenced this action against defendants, shareholders of the Vacar Construction Company, to recover payments which the corporation failed to contribute to the trust fund created to provide welfare and retirement benefits for plaintiffs\u2019 members and other covered employees. The unpaid contributions were required by the collective bargaining and trust agreements entered into between Local 282 and Vacar for services performed by Local 282 employees between May 1978 and February 9,1979. This action was commenced after plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to collect the unpaid contributions from Vacar was thwarted when the corporation filed a petition for arrangement under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USC \u00a7 1101 <em>etseq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged two causes of action, the first against the present defendants seeking to recover unpaid contributions under the provisions of Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630, and the second against Vacar\u2019s officers seeking to recover under Labor Law \u00a7 198-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Following service of an answer, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in their favor, dismissal of the affirmative defenses asserted in defendants\u2019 answers, and a default judgment against defendant Anthony Vachris who had not appeared. Defendant Charles Vachris submitted a cross motion seeking summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Defendant Helen Vachris joined in his motion opposing plaintiffs\u2019 application, claiming that plaintiffs\u2019 claim was preempted by ERISA, that plaintiffs had failed to give timely written notice pursuant to Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 and she also asserted that she had not been served with notice. Special Term found the second cause of action predicated on the Labor Law not preempted by ERISA and granted plaintiff summary judgment on it. It dismissed that cause of action against Helen Vachris, however, because she was not an officer of the corporation. It dismissed the first cause of action against the shareholder defendants founded on the Business Corporation Law finding that it was preempted by ERISA (116 Mise 2d 797, 800-802). The Appellate Division modified by dismissing plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action as well, holding that no private civil cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tian is to be implied from Labor Law \u00a7 198-c (106 AD2d 132, 141, citing <em>Stoganovic v Dinolfo, </em>61 NY2d 812, <em>affd for reasons stated at </em>92 AD2d 729). Plaintiffs do not challenge the Appellate Division\u2019s interpretation of the Labor Law on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 imposes personal liability upon the 10 largest shareholders of closely held New York corporations for the payment of wages and salaries due and owing to its employees. The statute expressly defines wages and salaries to include employer contributions for welfare benefits and to pension funds <em>(see, </em>Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 [a], [b]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was designed to remedy precisely the default which is alleged in this litigation and to provide a safeguard for employees who would otherwise be left without recourse in the event of the corporation\u2019s insolvency <em>(see, Lindsey v Winkler, </em>52 Misc 2d 1037, 1038; <em>Kane v Benson, </em>86 FRD 460, 462; 3 White, New York Corporations \u00b6 630.01, at 6-736.1). That purpose is achieved by creating a civil cause of action in favor of employees providing them with an additional remedy or enforcement mechanism, not otherwise available, by which they may recover delinquent contributions determined to be \"due and owing\u201d by the corporate employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">ERISA was enacted in 1974 to promote the interests of participants in employee welfare and pension plans by subjecting the plans to Federal regulation <em>(Shaw v Delta Air Lines, </em>463 US 85, 90; 29 USC \u00a7 1001). It imposes substantive requirements relating to participation, funding and vesting of pension plans and it also establishes procedural standards for reporting, disclosure and fiduciary responsibilities for both welfare benefits and pension plans <em>(Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v Massachusetts, </em>471 US \u2014, \u2014, 85 L ed 2d 728, 735; <em>see, Shaw v Delta Air Lines, supra, </em>at p 91; 29 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1114). Although the statute specifies that it provides only minimum standards <em>(see, </em>29 USC \u00a7 1001 [a]), it contains a preemption clause that is so broad on its face that it has been described as \"virtually unique\u201d <em>(Franchise Tax Bd. v Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 US 1, 24, n 26). Section 514 (a) of ERISA (29 USC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00a7 1144 [a]) provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that it \"supersede[s] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d covered by ERISA. Because it is undisputed that the employee benefit plan involved in this case is covered by ERISA (see, 29 USC \u00a7 1003 [a]), the issue presented is whether Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 impermissibly \u201crelates to\u201d the plan \u2014 within the meaning of section 514 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that the phrase \"relates to\u201d found in section 514 (a) of ERISA must be interpreted broadly as its plain language indicates, and that \u201c[a] law 'relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan\u201d <em>(Shaw v Delta Air Lines, </em>463 US 85, 96-97, supra).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both the Supreme Court and several Circuit Courts of Appeals have recognized, however, that \u201cthere are necessary limits to the reach of the phrase 'relates to\u2019 \u201d <em>(Savings &amp; Profit Sharing Fund v Gago, </em>717 F2d 1038, 1040) and that ERISA\u2019s preemption clause is \u201cneither all-encompassing * * * nor unlimited\u201d <em>(Rebaldo v Cuomo, </em>749 F2d 133, 138 [2d Cir]). Thus, only State laws which purport \"to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans\u201d (29 USC \u00a7 1144 [c] [2]) \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans and are thus preempted <em>(see, Rebaldo v Cuomo, supra, </em>at p 137; <em>Lane v Goren, </em>743 F2d 1337, 1339; <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp. v Ilsley, </em>690 F2d 323, 329, <em>affd sub nom. Arcudi v Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp., </em>463 US 1220). State laws that affect employee benefit plans in a \u201ctenuous, remote, or peripheral\u201d manner are not preempted <em>(Shaw v Delta Air Lines, </em>463 US 85, 100, n 21, <em>supra; see, American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v Merry, </em>592 F2d 118, 121).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Plaintiffs assert that when these principles are applied, it is manifest that Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 is not preempted because it is remedial only and does not regulate the terms and conditions of the welfare and pension plan. Defendants contend, on the other hand, that the Supreme Court\u2019s expansive interpretation of ERISA\u2019s preemption clause in <em>Shaw </em>means that ERISA occupies the entire field of employee benefit plans and that Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 falls within its preemptive sweep because it explicitly provides for recovery of employer contributions for welfare benefits or to pension funds. Alternatively, they main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tain that section 630 does regulate the terms and conditions of the employee benefit plan and, therefore, is preempted by expanding liability beyond what ERISA requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Analysis begins with the presumption that the State law has not been preempted by Federal statute in the absence of persuasive evidence to the contrary (see, <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v </em>Massachusetts, 471 US \u2014, \u2014, 85 L ed 2d 728, 741, <em>supra; Alessi v Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 US 504, 522) and with the knowledge that our task in deciding this preemption question is to ascertain and give effect to the congressional intent embodied in the Federal statute at issue <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v Massachusetts, supra, </em>at p 739). So viewed, we have no difficulty in concluding that Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 is not preempted by ER-ISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">As noted, section 630 is remedial in nature; it provides an additional enforcement mechanism by which plaintiffs can recover delinquent contributions already due and owing to them pursuant to the corporation\u2019s obligations under the collective bargaining and trust agreements. It does not \"regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 welfare and pension plan (29 USC \u00a7 1144 [c] [2]) and, therefore, does not \"relate to\u201d the employee benefit plan within the meaning of section 514 (a) of ERISA <em>(see, Rebaldo v Cuomo, </em>749 F2d 133, 137, <em>supra; Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp. v Ilsley, </em>690 F2d 323, 329, <em>affd sub nom. Arcudi v Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp., </em>463 US 1220, <em>supra). </em>The statute, unlike the laws the Supreme Court has found \"relate to\u201d employee benefit plans, does not require or prohibit the provision of specific benefits or practices relative to the calculation of benefits <em>(see, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v Massachusetts, </em>471 US\u2014, 85 L ed 2d 728, <em>supra </em>[State law requiring all general health insurance policies that provide hospital and surgical coverage to provide minimum mental health protection]; <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp. v Ilsley, </em>690 F2d 323, <em>affd sub nom. Arcudi v Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp., </em>463 US 1220, <em>supra </em>[Connecticut law requiring employer to provide health and life insurance for former employee now receiving workers\u2019 compensation]; <em>Shaw v Delta Air Lines, </em>463 US 85, <em>supra </em>[New York Human Rights Law provision forbidding discrimination in employee benefit plans on basis of pregnancy and Disability Benefits Law requirement that employer pay sick leave to pregnant workers]; <em>Alessi v Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 US 504, <em>supra </em>[State law forbidding reduction of pension benefits by workers\u2019 compensation award]; <em>see also, Retail Shoe Health Commn. v Reminick, </em>62 NY2d 173 [breach of fiduciary duties by individual benefit plan trustees]). To the contrary, sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tian 630 \"relates to\u201d the scope of shareholder immunity, excluding the 10 largest shareholders of a closed corporation from such immunity, not only as to employee benefit plans but also for all debts, wages or salaries due employees for services performed for the corporation. Like the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law considered in <em>Carpenters Health &amp; Welfare Fund v Kenneth R. Ambrose, Inc. </em>(727 F2d 279) and the garnishment statute invoked against the pension plan interest of an employee by a former wife seeking payment of past due support in <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v Merry </em>(592 F2d 118, <em>supra), </em>the only effect of section 630 on employee benefit plans is to give plaintiffs a cause of action to recover payments the corporation was already obligated to provide. If the statute has any palpable effect on the plan, it is the type of tenuous, remote or peripheral effect that ERISA was not meant to preempt <em>(see, Shaw v Delta Air Lines, supra, </em>at p 100, n 21; <em>Rebaldo v Cuomo, </em>749 F2d 133, 138-139, <em>supra </em>[Public Health Law provision setting rates that hospitals must charge private payors including employee benefit plans]).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">To the extent that Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630 imposes liability on shareholders for the corporation\u2019s delinquent payments that would otherwise not exist, and assuming defendants are correct that it constitutes a substantive requirement, this does not alter our conclusion that it is not a \"term or condition\u201d of the plan. In finding a Massachusetts law requiring insurance policies to provide minimum mental health benefits not preempted under ERISA\u2019s insurance exception <em>(see, </em>29 USC \u00a7 1144 [b] [2] [A]), the Supreme Court in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v Massachusetts </em>(471 US\u2014, 85 L ed 2d 728, <em>supra) </em>noted that \"laws that regulate only the insurer, or the way in which it may sell insurance, do not 'relate to\u2019 benefit plans in the first instance * * * [and] they would not be preempted by \u00a7 514 (a)\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 741). The court distinguished between laws regulating the insurer or the transaction of selling insurance from content-based laws such as the mandated-benefit law at issue there <em>(see, id., </em>at p 733, n 2). Similarly, that portion of section 630 that imposes joint and several liability on defendants is a law regulating the employer only, rather than a content-based law, regulating the plan, and as such is not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Defendants point to the remedies contained in ERISA, and particularly the 1980 amendments which added specific provisions dealing with delinquent contributions, as support for their contention that ERISA preempts Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630. To the contrary, we find these provisions support our conclusion that section 630 is not preempted. As originally enacted, ERISA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>contained no provision dealing with delinquent employer contributions and would have allowed plaintiffs only equitable relief to enforce the statute or the terms of the employee benefit plan <em>(see, </em>29 USC \u00a7 1132 [a] [3]). The courts have construed this to mean that other remedies were not preempted and that \"[u]nder ERISA [as originally enacted] delinquent contributions were enforced by an action founded either on <em>state law, </em>the collective bargaining agreement between the parties or the trust agreement\u201d <em>(Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v Alco Express Co., 522 </em>F Supp 919, 922 [ED Mich] [emphasis added]; <em>see, Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v Kraftco, Inc., </em>589 F Supp 1061, 1072 [MD Tenn]; <em>Lewart v Woodhull Care Center Assoc., </em>549 F Supp 879, 885 [SDNY]).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Nor do the 1980 amendments to ERISA indicate an intent on the part of Congress to preempt existing State remedies such as section 630. They merely added a statutory obligation upon employers to make contributions to multiemployer plans as required by the terms of the employee benefit plan or the collective bargaining agreement (Pub L 96-364 \u00a7 306 [a], 94 US Stat 1295, codified at 29 USC \u00a7 1145) and provided a civil cause of action in favor of fiduciaries to enforce this obligation (Pub L 96-364 \u00a7 306 [b], 94 US Stat 1295, codified at 29 USC \u00a7 1132 [g] [2]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the position taken by defendants, the relevant legislative history of these amendments evince a specific congressional intent that ERISA\u2019s civil remedies merely supplement, rather than supersede, existing State remedies such as Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630, at least insofar as they provide for the collection of delinquent employer contributions to employee benefit plans <em>(see, </em>HR Rep No. 96-869 [II], 96th Cong, 2d Sess, at 48-49, <em>reprinted, in </em>1980 US Code Cong &amp; Ad News 2918, 3037-3038; Joint Explanation of S 1076: Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, 126 Cong Rec 20189, 20202 [1980]; <em>see also, Carpenters Health &amp; Welfare Fund v Kenneth R.

Thus, it is clear that both Houses of Congress viewed the enforcement amendments of 1980 as setting forth a floor of Federal remedy in the case of delinquent contributions below which the States could not go but which did not preempt or supersede <em>State remedies </em>that granted greater protection than that contained in ERISA. Notably, this language in the legislative history also conflicts with the view that section 514 (a) of ERISA preempts State remedies and provides additional support for our view that ERISA was never meant to preempt State enforcement statutes such as Business Corporation Law \u00a7 630.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
