MVAIC is estopped from raising the issue of whether plaintiff is an eligible injured person under the Liberty policy. <em>(Matter of Hanavan [MVAIC], </em>33 AD2d 1100; <em>Matter of Stroud [Motor Vehicle Acc. Indemnification Corp.], </em>17 AD2d 616, 13 NY2d 611.) II. Plaintiff is not an insured as a family member of a close corporation where the corporation is named the insured. <em>(O'Hanlon v Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>439 F Supp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>377; <em>Fischer v Aetna Ins. Co., </em>37 AD2d 917; <em>Eveready Ins. Co. v Schwartz, </em>54 AD2d 750.) III. The insurance policy issued clearly indicates that it is a business auto policy. IV. There is no ambiguity in the language of the uninsured motorist endorsement. <em>(Matter of Country-Wide Ins. Co. v Wagoner, </em>45 NY2d 581.) V. Plaintiffs status as an employee does not create coverage. <em>(Fischer v Aetna Ins. Co., </em>37 AD2d 917; <em>Bashor v Excess Ins. Co., </em>86 AD2d 882.) VI. Plaintiff is entitled to MVAIC benefits. <em>(Eveready Ins. Co. v Schwartz, </em>54 AD2d 750.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-5\"><em>Donald S. DiBenedetto </em>and <em>John H. Callahan </em>for Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGK\">I. Plaintiff is an insured person under Liberty\u2019s policy issued to Buckner Associates, Inc.; he is not a qualified person under Insurance Law \u00a7 5202 (2) and is, therefore, ineligible for benefits from MVAIC. <em>(Matter of Avila v Motor Vehicle Acc.

MVAIC is not es-topped from asserting that plaintiff is an insured under Liberty\u2019s policy issued to Buckner Associates, Inc. <em>(Matter of Delbeau v St. Jean, </em>66 AD2d 819; <em>Urban Community Ins. Co. v Sedlik, </em>98 AD2d 663; <em>Matter of Motor Vehicle Acc. Indemnification Corp. [Malone], </em>16 NY2d 1027; <em>Capital Tel. Co. v Pattersonville Tel. Co., </em>56 NY2d 11; <em>Schwartz v Public Administrator, </em>24 NY2d 65; <em>Gilberg v Barbieri, </em>53 NY2d 285.) III. Liberty\u2019s reliance on <em>Fischer v Aetna Ins. Co., Eveready Ins. Co. v Schwartz and Matter of Rice v Allstate Ins. Co. </em>is misplaced. <em>(Fischer v Aetna Ins. Co., </em>65 Misc 2d 191, 37 AD2d 917; <em>Eveready Ins.

The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed, with costs, and the order and judgment of Supreme Court, Oneida County, should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Buckner Associates, Inc. is a family owned real estate business. Plaintiff Robert Buckner is a college student who resides with his parents, both of whom are officers of the corporation and who together own all of its outstanding stock. Plaintiff is a college student who performs some part-time work for the corporation. At the time he was injured, however, plaintiff was riding his bicycle and was not engaged in any business of the corporation. He was struck by a hit-and-run driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Liberty Mutual Insurance Company issued to Buckner Associates, Inc. a business automobile policy providing liability insurance, personal injury protection, medical payments insurance and uninsured motorist insurance. Plaintiff\u2019s application to Liberty Mutual for first-party benefits was denied on the ground that plaintiff was not within the coverage of the policy. Plaintiff then applied to the Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation (MVAIC). Arbitration having resulted in a determination that plaintiff was either an \"eligible injured person\u201d within the meaning of the personal injury (no-fault) protection or a \"qualified person\u201d entitled to MVAIC benefits, plaintiff began a declaratory judgment action against both Liberty Mutual and MVAIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Special Term granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment against MVAIC, denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Liberty Mutual, granted Liberty Mutual\u2019s cross motion to dismiss the complaint and MV AIC\u2019s cross claim against it and entered judgment declaring plaintiff to be a qualified person within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5202 and entitled to benefits against MVAIC. The Appellate Division reversed and granted judgment declaring plaintiff an insured person under the Liberty Mutual policy, reasoning that the references in its uninsured motorist endorsement to \"You or any family member\u201d and other references in the policy to relatives and family created an ambiguity which required that the policy be construed against the issuing carrier. We disagree and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Whether the policy covers plaintiff turns on a reading of the entire policy, not just a part of the uninsured motorist endorsement. Only if it can reasonably be said on a reading of the policy as a whole that the words, \"Who is insured 1. You or any family member\u201d appearing in that endorsement would be so understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>by the average person applying common speech <em>(Lewis v Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>224 NY 18, 21) can it be held that Liberty Mutual is obligated to cover such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Considered with respect to the uninsured motorist endorsement alone, such a construction appears unreasonable, for it defines \"family member\u201d as \"a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household,\u201d and \"it is obvious, even to a casual reader, that the insured was to be a corporation which could not possibly have personal injuries or family\u201d <em>(Dixon v Gunter, </em>636 SW2d 437, 441 [Tenn, construing an identically worded \"You or any family member\u201d policy provision]; <em>accord, Kaysen v Federal Ins. Co., </em>268 NW2d 920, 923 [Minn, \"quite obviously a corporation cannot suffer bodily injury, or have a 'spouse\u2019, 'relative\u2019, or 'household\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Pearcy v Travelers Indem. Co., </em>429 So 2d 1298 [Fla App]; <em>Nicks v Hartford Ins. Group, </em>291 So 2d 673 [Fla App]; <em>Fowler v United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 133 </em>Ga App 842, 212 SE2d 486; <em>Polzin v Phoenix of Hartford Ins. Cos., </em>5 Ill App 3d 84, 283 NE2d 324; <em>General Ins. Co. v Icelandic Bldrs., </em>24 Wash App 656, 604 P2d 966; <em>see, </em>8C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 5080.65). The partnership cases relied on by MVAIC <em>(e.g., O\u2019Hanlon v Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>639 F2d 1019) are readily distinguishable, partnerships being a combination of individuals, who can suffer injuries and do have spouses, households and relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Beyond that, however, the endorsement makes clear in its opening paragraph that its definitions are in addition to the words and phrases defined in the policy itself. The declarations of the policy state in Item One that, \"Named insured is corporation.\u201d In Part 1 (A), it defines \"You\u201d to mean \"the person <em>or </em>organization shown as the named insured in item one of the declarations\u201d (emphasis supplied), and in Part 1 (F), states that, \" 'Insured\u2019 means any person <em>or </em>organization qualifying as an insured in the who is insured section of the applicable insurance\u201d (emphasis supplied). Thus, the average person could conclude that a person or an organization, but not both, was the insured, as to the basic policy could only conclude that the insured was Buckner Associates, Inc., and as to the \"applicable insurance\u201d (i.e., the uninsured motorist insurance) that because the \"You\u201d referred to in the \"Who is insured\u201d section of the endorsement was a corporation that there could be no \"family member\u201d within the definition (quoted above) of that term set forth in that endorsement. For like reasons, nothing in the New York Automobile Accident Indemnification Endorsement changes that conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>sion, for its section II defines \"insured\u201d to mean \"the named insured and, while residents of the same household, his spouse and the relatives of either\u201d. Nor can it be argued that such a construction of the endorsement leaves the uninsured automobile coverage without meaning, for the same section II covers any person while occupying an automobile owned by the corporation or while being operated on behalf of the corporation <em>(General Ins. Co. v Icelandic Bldrs., </em>24 Wash App, at p 660, 604 P2d, at p 968, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Finally, the situation is not different if one turns to the no-fault endorsement. That defines an \"eligible injured person\u201d as \"the named insured and any relative who sustains personal injury arising out of the use or operation of any motor vehicle\u201d but defines \"named insured\u201d to mean \"the person <em>or </em>organization named in the declarations\u201d (emphasis supplied) and \"relative\u201d to mean \"a spouse, child, or other person related to the named insured by blood, marriage or adoption\u201d, which is the same definition contained in the uninsured motorist endorsement and which, for the reasons above set forth, would not be construed according to common speech to be applicable to a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order and judgment of Supreme Court, Oneida County, should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Jasen, Kaye, Alexander and Titone concur; Judge Simons taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
