Claimant alleged that he had contracted an occupational disease, hearing loss, arising out of and in the course of his employment with employer, Silgan Container Corporation, in case No. 96 \u2014 WC\u201403534; and arising out of and in the course of his employment with employer, American National Can Company (ANCC), in case No. 97 \u2014 WC\u201415903. The arbitrator found that claimant sustained accidental injuries, permanent partial hearing loss, which arose out of and in the course of employment with each employer and allocated the hearing loss between the two employers. On October 7, 1998, employer ANCC filed a petition for review of the decision of the arbitrator. The Industrial Commission (Commission) reversed the arbitrator\u2019s decision, with one commissioner dissenting. The Commission found that employer ANCC was not claimant\u2019s last employer as required under section 1(d) of the Act (820 ILCS 310/l(d) (West 1996)) and \u201c[claimant] is not entitled to benefits.\u201d On administrative review, the circuit court of Vermilion County confirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. The issue before this court is whether the Commission\u2019s finding that employer ANCC was not claimant\u2019s last employer as required under section 1(d) of the Act and, therefore, claimant is not entitled to benefits, was contrary to law. We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">Claimant began employment with ANCC, a manufacturer of tin cans, in 1970. On August 1, 1995, Silgan Container Corporation bought ANCC. Claimant continued in his employment, now with Silgan Container Corporation. On January 23, 1996, claimant filed an application for adjustment of claim and identified American Can Company/Silgan Container Corporation as employer, case No. 96\u2014 WC \u2014 03534. On March 25, 1997, claimant filed an amended application for adjustment of claim in No. 96- \u2014 WC\u201403534 naming Silgan Container Corporation as employer. On March 25, 1997, claimant also filed an application for adjustment of claim and identified ANCC as employer, case No. 97 \u2014 WC\u201415903. Claimant later motioned the Commission to consolidate the cases, stating that \u201cthese claims involve hearing loss sustained during periods when two different employers owned the plant where [claimant] worked.\u201d The arbitrator entered an order on August 13, 1997, allowing the motion.</p> <p id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621(56) 622(102)\">After a hearing on May 12, 1998, the arbitrator entered a decision in each case finding that claimant \u201cwas exposed to excessive noise levels which resulted in hearing loss\u201d with the date of last exposure being July 31, 1995, as to employer ANCC, and January 8, 1996, as to employer Silgan Container Corporation. The arbitrator apportioned compensation accordingly, ANCC to pay to claimant the sum of $410.43 per week for a period of 60.7 weeks and Silgan Container Corporation to pay to claimant the sum of $410.43 per week for a period of 21.2 weeks. On October 7, 1998, employer ANCC filed a petition for review of the decision of the arbitrator. Neither Silgan Container Corporation nor claimant sought review of the decision of the arbitrator. The Commission found that employer ANCC was not claimant\u2019s last employer as required under section 1(d) of the Act (820 ILCS 310/l(d) (West 1996)) and \u201c[claimant] is not entitled to benefits.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b622-3\" pgmap=\"622\"> The issue before this court is whether the decision of the Commission was contrary to law. Before a reviewing court may overturn a decision of the Commission, it must find that the award was contrary to law or that the Commission\u2019s factual determinations were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 188 Ill. 2d 243, 245, 720 N.E.2d 1063, 1065 (1999).</p> <p id=\"b622-4\" pgmap=\"622\"> Claimant argues that section 1(d) of the Act does not foreclose an award for hearing loss against ANCC, \u201ca prior employer.\u201d Section 1(d) of the Act provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">\u201cThe employer liable for the compensation in this Act provided shall be the employer in whose employment the employee was last exposed to the hazard of the occupational disease claimed upon regardless of the length of time of such last exposure ***. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">The insurance carrier liable shall be the carrier whose policy was in effect covering the employer liable on the last day of the exposure rendering such employer liable in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\u201d 820 ILCS 310/l(d) (West 1996).</blockquote> <p id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\"> In the present case, Silgan Container Corporation was \u201cthe employer in whose employment the employee was last exposed to the hazard of the occupational disease claimed\u201d within the meaning of the Act. 820 ILCS 310/l(d) (West 1996).</p> <p id=\"b622-8\" pgmap=\"622\">In Thermos Co. v.

There was no issue as to last employer and such a determination was not necessary in order to impose liability on the employer. It pertained to the wholly separate issues of (1) when compensation should commence, and (2) which of the employer\u2019s multiple insurance carriers were required to pay that compensation. Those matters are not in dispute here.</p> <p id=\"b622-9\" pgmap=\"622\">In Fleming v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 95 Ill. 2d 329, 333, 447 N.E.2d 819, 821 (1983), also cited by claimant, the supreme court held that an</p> <p id=\"b623-2\" pgmap=\"623\">award to a claimant for his hearing loss was not precluded merely because claimant continued to be exposed to the disabling cause. Here, the award to claimant has been precluded because employer ANCC is not the employer in whose employment the claimant was last exposed to the hazard of the occupational disease claimed.

App. 3d 1096, 523 N.E.2d 386 (1988) (claimant filed an application for adjustment of claim under the Act alleging that his hearing loss arose out of and during course of his employment as a welder and named respondent as employer; claimant had performed welding for engineering and construction firms but did not name them as an employer in an application for adjustment of claim under the Act); Dresser Industries v.

To do otherwise would impose upon the employee the difficult, and often insurmountable, burden of proving that exposure to the noise at a particular employer\u2019s facility resulted in some degree of disability and what that disability was. In theory, allocating liability among the employers, as the claimant argues and as the arbitrator in the present case attempted to do, is more equitable. As a practical matter, however, it would often work to the disadvantage of the employee, who would have to prove how much disability is attributable to which employer. In keeping with the remedial goal of the Act, our legislature took the more pragmatic approach of imposing liability for the entire loss on the last employer in order to more readily facilitate the employee\u2019s ability to recover. Consequently, the arbitrator, the Commission, and the courts are without authority to apportion liability for a hearing loss among the employers. See Concrete Structures of the Midwest, Inc. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 315 Ill. App. 3d 596, 599, 734 N.E.2d 970, 973 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b624-3\" pgmap=\"624\">HOFFMAN and HOLDRIDGE, JJ., join in this special concurrence.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b624-4\" pgmap=\"624\">JUSTICE O\u2019MALLEY,</author> <p id=\"ASP\" pgmap=\"624\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624(224) 625(59)\">In his special concurrence, Justice Rarick recognizes that the rule imposing the burden of compensation for damage done by the hazard of an occupational disease on the last employer to expose the employee to the hazard saves the employee the \u201cthe difficult, and often insurmountable, burden\u201d of proving \u201chow much disability is attributable to which employer.\u201d 326 Ill. App. 3d at 606. No doubt, such solicitude for the employee is faithful to the conviction that the Workers\u2019 Occupational Diseases Act is \u201ca humane law of a remedial nature whose fundamental purpose is to provide employees and their dependents prompt, sure and definite compensation, together with a quick and efficient remedy, for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment\u201d (General American Life Insurance Co. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 97 Ill. 2d 359, 370, 454 N.E.2d 643 (1983)). Certainly, the \u201clast exposure\u201d rule should continue to protect the employee who is unable to apportion his disability between employers. However, where, as here, the employee has sustained what Justice Rarick describes as the \u201cdifficult\u201d and nearly \u201cinsurmountable\u201d burden of proving that each period of employment resulted in a discrete amount of permanent partial disability, and yet finds himself without sufficient compensation, not through lack of proof, but simply because he did not timely seek compensation for the full measure of his disability from the last employer to expose him to the hazard, it is clear to me that the good intentions behind the rule have thwarted the humanitarian intentions behind the Act itself. Under the rules of procedure, it is too late for claimant to seek additional compensation from Silgan; he is left with, perhaps, a claim against his attorney.</p> <p id=\"b625-3\" pgmap=\"625\">The Act is to be construed liberally to effectuate its humanitarian purpose. General American, 97 Ill. 2d at 370, 454 N.E.2d at 649. In my view, the majority\u2019s reading of section 1(d) of the Act is neither appropriately liberal nor consistent with supreme court precedent.</p> <p id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">The majority\u2019s definition of \u201clast exposed\u201d is difficult to reconcile with how the phrase is applied in Thermos Co. In Thermos Co., the claimant worked on an assembly line in the presence of chemical and plastic fumes. In October 1968, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis. In March 1969, she was diagnosed with acute pharyngitis with laryngitis. She was diagnosed on January 18, 1971, with pneumonia, acute tracheobronchitis, and acute bronchial asthma. Her doctor removed her from work. By the time that claimant returned to work in January 1972, the employer had switched insurance carriers. Claimant was assigned to a different location in the employer\u2019s plant to avoid exposure to the noxious fumes. In October 1972, she again was exposed to harmful fumes in the employer\u2019s plant. Complaining of coughing and wheezing, she consulted a doctor in November 1972 and was diagnosed with acute bronchial asthma. Claimant took another job but, at the time of the hearing, was still suffering from chest pains and shortness of breath.</p> <p id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">Based on the records of the claimant\u2019s treatment, the arbitrator found that claimant was \u201clast exposed to the hazards of an occupational disease\u201d on January 18, 1971, and awarded her compensation for temporary total incapacity from that date forward. Thermos Co., 83 Ill. 2d at 57, 413 N.E.2d at 1247. The arbitrator also found that an occupational disease had caused a permanent partial disability. The issue on appeal was which insurance carrier was insuring the employer when claimant was \u201clast exposed\u201d to the hazards of the noxious fumes. Although recognizing that the claimant was again exposed to the harmful fumes in 1972, the supreme court affirmed the finding of the arbitrator that, for purposes of section 1(d), she was \u201clast exposed\u201d in 1972:</p> <blockquote id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625(65) 626(112)\">\u201cThe record shows that by October of 1972 the claimant\u2019s upper respiratory system had already been impaired to the extent that she had suffered a permanent partial incapacity. Though her condition had improved during the 20 months she was not exposed to the chemical fumes, the claimant did not testify, and the record does not show, that she had fully recovered. Furthermore, the medical records indicate that her earlier exposure had greatly increased her sensitivity to irritating odors and fumes and made her more vulnerable to permanent damage upon reexposure. It was for this reason that she was reassigned to another plant and why she eventually had to change her employment. We consider that the legislative intent under the circumstances here would be to determine not the date on which a claimant was last exposed in a literal and narrow sense only to the hazards of an occupational disease, but to determine the date of the last exposure which caused the claimant\u2019s incapacity.\u201d Thermos Co., 83 Ill. 2d at 57-58, 413 N.E.2d at 1248.</blockquote> <p id=\"b626-3\" pgmap=\"626\">In the case at hand, the arbitrator found that, as a consequence of noise exposure at both employers, claimant lost 42.5% of the hearing in his right ear and 39.4% of the hearing in his left ear. However, the arbitrator found that by the time claimant began working for Silgan, he had already suffered permanent and complete loss of 24.3% of the hearing in his right ear and permanent and complete loss of 36.4% of the hearing in his left ear; all due to noise exposure at ANCC. These factual determinations were left standing by the Commission and are not disputed on this appeal. Regardless of the unchallenged fact that, by the time of the exposure at Silgan, claimant had already suffered permanent partial disability, the majority holds that claimant is not entitled to compensation because his exposure to noise continued after his employment with ANCC ceased. This is the very inverse of the approach taken in Thermos Co. There, it was the fact that the claimant had already suffered permanent partial disability as a result of exposure in 1971 and before that compelled the court to hold, despite claimant\u2019s continued exposure to fumes in 1972, that claimant was, for purposes of section 1(d), \u201clast exposed\u201d in 1971. See Thermos Co., 83 Ill. 2d at 57-58, 413 N.E.2d at 1248. The majority applies the \u201cnarrow and literal\u201d sense of \u201clast exposed\u201d that the court explicitly rejected in Thermos Co.</p> <p id=\"b626-4\" pgmap=\"626(129) 627(42)\">The majority suggests that Thermos Co. is distinguishable because there was no issue there \u201cas to last employer and such a determination was not necessary in order to impose liability on the employer.\u201d 326 Ill. App. 3d at 604. I recognize there was only one employer in Thermos Cor, however, it was the definition of \u201clast exposed\u201d not \u201clast employer\u201d that was critical to the court\u2019s holding. Section 1(d) provides that the insurance carrier whose policy was in effect \u201con the last day of the exposure rendering such employer liable in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\u201d 820 ILCS 310/l(d) (West 1998). As the Thermos Co. court recognized (Thermos Co., 83 Ill. 2d at 57-58, 413 N.E.2d at 1248), this language directs the court to determine on what day the claimant was \u201clast exposed to the hazard of the occupational disease\u201d (820 ILCS 310/l(d) (West 1998)). Therefore, despite the fact that Thermos Co. dealt with only one employer, the court\u2019s construal of \u201clast exposed\u201d is controlling here.</p> <p id=\"b627-5\" pgmap=\"627\">Although the majority does not make the point, I recognize that one might attempt to distinguish this case from Thermos Co. on the basis that there was no finding in Thermos Co., as there was in this case, of additional damage on reexposure. One might argue that, had the court in Thermos Co. found such additional damage to the claimant\u2019s respiratory system, it would have considered the 1972 exposure to have been her \u201clast exposure\u201d just as the majority considered claimant\u2019s exposure while employed with Silban to have been his \u201clast exposure.\u201d This argument fails. Although the Thermos Co. court did not explicitly note any discrete level of additional damage done to the claimant in 1972, its remarks clearly imply that such additional damage occurred. Particularly revealing are the court\u2019s remarks in responding to the argument that, for purposes of section 1(d), claimant\u2019s \u201clast exposure\u201d to the fumes occurred in October 1972 when she again was exposed because, prior to that date, she had been free of symptoms since she returned to work in 1972. In stressing that \u201cby October of 1972 the claimant\u2019s upper respiratory system had already been impaired to the extent that she had suffered a permanent partial incapacity,\u201d the court evidently was contemplating, but also minimizing the importance under section 1(d) of, impairment that had not already occurred by October 1972 \u2014 that is, impairment that had occurred during or after that month. (Emphasis added.) Thermos Co., 83 Ill. 2d at 57, 413 N.E.2d at 1248. This reading is consistent with the court\u2019s later observation that the exposure in 1971 and before made the claimant \u201cmore vulnerable to permanent damage upon reexposure\u201d (Thermos Co., 83 Ill. 2d at 58, 413 N.E.2d at 1248). Therefore, I conclude that there are no significant factual differences between Thermos Co. and this case.</p> <p id=\"b627-6\" pgmap=\"627(121) 628(39)\">In maintaining that claimant is entitled to compensation from ANCO, I do not mean to imply that, had claimant timely sought to recover the full amount of compensation from Silgan, the latter could have avoided recovery by observing, correctly, that claimant\u2019s hearing had been impaired before he was employed by Silgan. Construed liberally in favor of the employee, section 1(d) is not such a shield for the employer. Clearly, Thermos Co. places no such bounds on liability. Nowhere in holding that subsequent exposure does not preclude liability under section 1(d) does Thermos Co. indicate that previous exposure precludes liability. There is nothing in the opinion suggesting that the court would not also have affirmed the Commission had it found the second insurance company liable. In affirming, the court would have cited the fact that renewed exposure to hazardous fumes had caused additional permanent harm to the claimant while the employer was covered by the second insurance company.</p> <p id=\"b628-4\" pgmap=\"628\">I would hold that section 1(d), although not permitting double recovery, permits a claimant to recover the full measure of compensation either from the last in a succession of employers over the course of whose employ the claimant suffered permanent damage from exposure to the hazard of an occupational disease (the length of the last exposure and the fact or degree of harm caused having no effect on the liability of the last employer) or from an earlier employer in the succession who the employee can prove caused discrete permanent harm. The latter basis for liability exists here. Accordingly, despite the fact that claimant\u2019s hearing was further impaired while he was employed by Silgan, he was, for purposes of section 1(d), \u201clast exposed\u201d to the hazards of an occupational disease while at ANCC because he there suffered discrete permanent partial disability from noise exposure.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
