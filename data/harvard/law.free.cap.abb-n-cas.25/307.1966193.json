One of the supports of plaintiff\u2019s building is a wall along the centre of the canal. This wall is becoming delapidated so as to render the building insecure, and this action is brought to compel the defendant to turn the water out of its canal a sufficient length of time to enable the plaintiff to repair the wall, and to recover damages through loss of rent occasioned, as it is claimed, by the refusal of the defendant, on December 21, 1888, to accede to the demand of plaintiff that the water be turned off.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The defendant is a corporation, created by chapter 241 of the Laws of 1823, passed April 23, 1823. By section 5 of that act it was provided that the directors of the company \u201c shall have power to explore and designate the route of a canal or mill feeder ; and a proportion of the waters of the Oswego river may be taken and conducted out of said river, at or above the Oswego rapid, so called, at such point or place, and in such manner, as may be deemed proper, so that the water can thereby be carried down upon the east side and bank of said river, to such point or place as may be required by those interested therein,\u201d the route designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>and the manner of making the canal to be determined upon by an engineer who shall be appointed by and be under the direction of the canal commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">By section 6 the corporation had power \u201c to enter upon and take possession of such improved or unimproved lands, not exceeding four rods in width, as shall be necessary for the making of the canal or mill feeder aforesaid, and the works thereunto appertaining,\u201d and provision was made for payment of damages to the owners of any property that was so taken. Upon the completion of the canal the company was authorized \u201c to sell, let, or grant and convey, for a limited time, the use of the water which shall be conveyed in said canal, for mills or other hydraulic purposes, to any person or persons owning and occupying lands adjoining thereto, at such price or prices as may be agreed upon by the parties interested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">By section 10 it was provided that, if any time thereafter it became necessary to adopt the said canal as a part on the contemplated improvement between Lake Ontario and the Erie canal, <em>\u201c </em>the canal commissioners shall at all times have full power, in behalf of the State, to enter upon and make all necessary alterations that by them shall be deemed advisable, to take and make use of the waters therefrom for the use and purposes of filling and supplying all locks that may be constructed to connect the said canal with Lake Ontario; and the said canal shall thereafter become the property of this State, without any payment or compensation whatever to said company; provided, however, that the right to all the surplus waters of said canal shall be vested in the company hereby incorporated, and all persons legally claiming under them; and that they shall be permitted to take, make use of it, and enjoy the surplus waters of said canal, not necessary for filling or supplying the locks that may be erected by the said canal commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The defendant, under this act, commenced, in 1824, the construction of its canal along the easterly bank of the Oswego river, but before its completion across the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>lot, and in the same year, the State adopted and took possession of. it as a part of the canal system of the State, and thereupon it became the property of the State, except the rights to surplus water as reserved in the act. The State made some alterations, and continued to use it as a canal for the passage of boats, from its completion in or about the year 1825, until the completion by the State of a new and -enlarged canal in or about the year 1853, when its use as a canal was discontinued. In the meantime, the defendant had made use of the surplus water, giving .leases to various parties, and resumed the full control of the canal, when it was abandoned by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On February 25, 1823, the surveyor general of the State gave a certificate of sale to Theophilus S. Morgan, of lot 19, in the village of East Oswego, block 99. The lot of plaintiff is part of lot 19. On December 22, 1828, letters patent were issued to Morgan, of lot 19, which were recorded March 26, 1831. Lucius B. Crocker became the owner prior to May 1,1819, and he, at that date, conveyed to Jessie Bennett, and Bennett, on December 1, 1852, conveyed to Hiram Allen. Each of their deeds contained the clause \u201c subject to the rights of the Oswego Canal Company, and the rights \u2022of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In 1851, Allen erected the building in question. The \u2022canal runs in a northerly direction through and across the lot, and-under the building, and extends nearly the entire width of the lot, the east foundation wall of the building being on the east line of the canal, and the west foundation wall of the building being at the south end, substantially identical with the west wall of the canal, and at the northerly end some feet west of the west wall of the canal. The building is supported partly by the side foundation walls, and partly by a stone wall placed nearly in the centre of said canal, and partly by two rows of iron posts, four on \u25a0each side, resting on stone piers in the canal between the .side and central walls. Soon after it was built, portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the central wall were cut out, and four piers formed for the support of the centre of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In 1871, William W. Pul ver, through whom plaintiff derives its title, made an agreement with the defendant in regard to the matters here in controversy. This agreement was under seal, and was duly acknowledged and recorded, and both parties now claim advantages under it. Prior to the execution of this agreement, Pul ver had become the owner of the title of Allen. On February 28, 1871, the canal board, by resolution, passed pursuant to chapter 267 of the Laws of 1857, determined and declared the canal lands in question abandoned, and afterwards, in the same year, and before the agreement above referred to, all the interest of the State in plaintiff\u2019s lot was quitclaimed to Pulver\u2019s grantor, so-far as it could be done consistent with the act of 1857, which provided that, when any of such abandoned canal lands were then used for a hydraulic canal, the conveyance should not prevent the future use of the land for the same purpose, but should expressly reserve the right to continue such hydraulic canal. This agreement bears date July 31, 1871, and, after describing the defendant as party of the first part, and Pulver as party of the second part, proceeded as follows - \u201c Whereas the party of the first part have and own a hydraulic canal on the easterly side of the Oswego river, which crosses lot number nineteen, in block ninety-nine, in the-fourth ward of said city, and whereas the party of the second part is the owner of a building known as 1 Hungerford Block,\u2019' which is erected over the said canal where it crosses said lot, which building is supported by stone walls on the easterly and westerly sides of said canal, and by stone piers or central walls and iron columns placed in said canal, and whereas the-parties hereto desire that their respective rights be clearly and specifically defined, to the end that all contention and controversy may be avoided, therefore it is hereby mutually agreed by and between the parties thereto, their successors, heirs, and assigns, that the said party of the second part is- or claims to be the owner of the fee-simple of that portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of said lot crossed by said building, and that the party of the first part has a right or easement across said lot for the purposes and uses specified in its charter, and to have and maintain its canal free from obstruction, and has the right to enter into and upon the same for the purpose of improving or repairing said canal so as to render it most available for-hydraulic purposes during its legal existence, and that the party of the second part has the right to keep and maintain the building aforesaid over the said canal, and to erect another building in its stead in case of the destruction or removal of the one now standing, and the said company consents, so far as its own rights are concerned, that the said iron columns, and any others that may be substituted to-replace the piers and central walls aforesaid, may remain as. supports to said building so long as it stands, and that the said piers and central walls may remain until they are replaced by iron columns, not to exceed one year from October 2, 1871; and that whenever another building is-erected in its place and stead, it shall be supported by a stone wall on the easterly and westerly sides of said canal, and the present iron columns, and the iron columns replacing-the central stone wall in said canal shall be removed, and the building shall be supported by iron or other trusses-extending from the said walls over the canal so as to sustain and support said building, and that the said iron trusses shall be so erected, placed and situated as to cause no material obstructions to the flow or passage of water through said canal. And the party of the second part, for himself, his heirs and assigns, covenants and agrees that they will remove all rubbish, debris and obstruction from said canal, caused by the falling or burning of said building over said canal, or by any materials falling or thrown from said building, without any unnecessary delay; to pay to said party of the first part the expenses of such removal, if done by said company, and that they will suffer no unnecessary obstructions to be occasioned by said building, except said columns, central walls and piers, to remain in said canal as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>After the execution of the agreement the matter, as between the parties, seems to have rested until 1888. The plaintiff became owner August 31, 1878, and its title from Pul ver, through intermediate deeds, is in terms made subject to the rights of the Oswego Canal Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On December 21, 1888, the plaintiff served on the defendant a written notice, stating that the building was in a dangerous condition, \u201c owing to the weakening and partial removal of the supports of said building, due to the action -of the water of your canal,\u201d and that it desired \u201c to make the necessary repairs to the supports of said buildingsand requesting that the water be emptied from the canal so that \u25a0such repairs might be made, notifying the company that if it was not done the plaintiff would hold it responsible for all damages caused to the plaintiff, either by reason of its inability to rent the premises on account of the unsafe condition, -or by reason of the falling of the building. To this request the defendant did not yield ; but in its reply, on December .21, 1888, claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s building was wrongfully located over the defendant\u2019s canal, and that in case it fell into the canal the plaintiff would be held responsible for all damages. Thereupon this action was commenced on -July 27, 1889. It was held in the court below that the plaintiff was entitled to maintain its building, \u201c and to support the same by the present side foundation walls and \u2022central supports, or to substitute for the latter a single row of iron columns in the center of the said canalthat it has the right <em>\u201c </em>to repair the same, or to substitute for said central \u25a0supports a row of iron columns in the center of the said \u25a0canal, and, for the purpose of doing such work, the plaintiff has the right and is entitled to have the flow of water in the \u25a0said canal, across from the said plaintiff\u2019s premises under said building, stopped by the said defendant, and the water removed from the said canal for the period of fifteen days, which time should commence upon ten days\u2019 previous notice, in writing, from the plaintiff to the defendantthat -the defendant, by reason of its refusal to remove the water,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>was liable to the plaintiff for the damages sustained by it for loss of rents from December 21, 1888, to the date of the-report, (December 28, 1889) being the sum of $1,880.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The first question to be determined arises over the claim of defendant that its lessees of water are necessary parties to-the action. They are affected by the stoppage of the water,, and therefore it is urged they should be heard before the-right of plaintiff to have the water turned off is determined. There are a large number of leases, and they give the right- and privilege of taking and drawing from the canal a certain defined quantity of water, for a long term of years, at a fixed yearly rent; the water to be drawn in flumes or spouts-placed and constructed by the lessees in the manner directed by the company. It is also provided that the company \u201c shall have the right at all times, and from time to time, to-stop the water above demised, or draw off the water from said canal, for a sufficient length of time to make any necessary repairs or alterations in the canal.\u201d We are of the-opinion that the lessees were not necessary parties. The defendant in a certain sense represents them, and it has the title and control of the canal as a whole, and any controversy as to such control is properly with the defendant alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Is the plaintiff entitled to have the water turned out of the canal to enable it to make the repairs it claims the right, to make ? In order to determine this question the agreement of 1871 is to be carefully considered. Pulver was then the owner of the fee, but subject to the rights of the defendant. The claim had apparently been made by the defendant or its lessees that the building or its supports was improperly obstructing the flow of water. In view of this the agreement was made. It provided, among other things, that the canal company had the right <em>\u201c </em>to have and maintain its canal free from obstruction.\u201d It also provided that Pulver had the right to keep and maintain his building over the canal, and to erect another in its stead in case of the destruction or removal of the one then standing; and that the iron columns, which were then there upon either side of' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the central piers or walls, and any others that might be substituted to replace such central piers and walls, might remain as long as that building then there should stand ; and that-such piers and central walls might remain until replaced by iron colums, not to exceed one year from October 2, 1871. Whenever another building should be erected it should be supported by a stone wall on the easterly and westerly sides of the canal, with iron or other trusses extending from such walls over the canal, the trusses to be so situated as to cause no material obstruction to the flow of water, and Pulver agreed for himself and assigns, \u201c that they will suffer no unnecessary obstruction to be occasioned by said building, -except said columns, central walls and piers, to remain in -said canal as aforesaid.\u201d In other words, the company should have the canal free from obstruction, but the stone piers or central walls might remain for a year ; then iron eolumns should be substituted; and these columns, together with the iron columns already there, might remain as long us that building stood; but when another building was ereetted all the iron columns should come out, and the building be supported by side walls and trusses extending from one to the other, thus leaving the entire passage-way substantially unobstructed. Very evidently the central piers or walls were deemed to be an obstruction, and it became the duty of Pulver, in order to carry out the meaning and object of the agreement, to remove them within the year, having the right to substitute therefor iron columns. The obstruction would be materially reduced, and when a new building was erected the obstruction should be entirely removed in the use of side walls with trusses. The central walls and piers were not removed within the year. They have been allowed to remain, in violation of the agreement, until by the action of the water they have become insecure. This was a result that might have been reasonably expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">It also appears that in the summer of 1888 the State of blew York repaired and re-constructed the bulkhead gates leading the water into defendant\u2019s canal, and, in order to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>so, cut the water off entirely from defendant\u2019s canal, so that it was empty and dry for some four weeks in the summer, during which the plaintiff might have repaired the foundations of its block. No steps, however, were taken in that direction. Does the delay of the plaintiff and its predecessors, from 1871, or the failure of plaintiff to embrace the opportunity furnished in the summer of 1888, affect the right of plaintiff, if ever it had the right, to demand of defendant the removal of the water from the canal for a sufficient length of time to enable the plaintiff to make the proper change in the central supports ?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In the agreement nothing is said about the manner in which the work shall be done. There is no agreement by the defendant to turn off the water. It is a matter to be determined upon equitable principles. The plaintiff has not a legal right to have it done. If there was no other way to accomplish the result, it would be inferrled that this was in contemplation when the result was required. The delay might induce the court to impose conditions, and, in a proper case, might require the payment of damages to parties that might be injured by the temporary loss of water. In the present case there is evidence showing it to be possible, by means of coffer-dams, to perform the necessary repairs. Still the referee has found that the removal of the water from the canal is necessary, and that fifteen days is a reasonable time in which to do such work. We are not disposed to interfere with this finding. It is quite clear that better work can be done in this way, and that is the better for all parties. Nor should the delay or the failure of plaintiff to do the work when the canal was empty in the summer of 1888, preclude,the plaintiff from having the benefit of this assistance on the part of defendant. The delay was, to a certain extent, acquiesced in by defendant. We therefore conclude that, as matter of equitable relief, the plaintiff was entitled to have the water temporarily removed for the purposes authorized in the agreement of 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Does it follow that plaintiff is also entitled to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>damages awarded for the loss of rents. Ooncededly the plaintiff is bound by the Pulver agreement. If Pulver had performed that agreement, and removed the central wall and piers within the time specified, and substituted iron columns, there would have been no loss of rents for the cause here complained of. Had the plaintiff examined the wall in the summer of 1888, and ascertained its condition, as it perhaps should be presumed to have done, and repaired it while the water was out, as the referee finds it might have done, there would have been no loss of rents. The plaintiff now seeks to charge the defendant with this loss, because it did not accede to its demand in December following, while, in fact, if it had performed its own duty, there would have been no occasion for the demand. If plaintiff\u2019s loss is attributable to its own neglect, it should not recover it of defendant. In its notice the plaintiff did not refer to the Pulver agreement, or offer to perform its obligations. It claimed the right,, generally, to repair the supports of its building, thereby inferentially claiming the right to continue its central walls and the same claim is made in the complaint, and appears in the judgment. If, in its notice, it claimed more than it had a right to, the defendant was not bound to accede to it. On the part of the defendant, it may be said, with some considable force, that the plaintiff, by reason of its delay and neglect, should compensate the defendant for any loss that, may be sustained by turning off the watei\\ Having in view the situation of both parties, the more equitable course is to-allow damages to neither party.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">It follows that the judgment herein should be modified by providing that the plaintiff is not entitled to maintain the present central wall or piers, but is bound to substitute therefor a row of iron columns ; and that, in case another building is erected, it shall be supported in the manner specified in the Pulver agreement. The judgment should also be modified by striking therefrom the award of damages. As-modified, the judgment should be affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Judgment modified as stated in the opinion, and, as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>modified, affirmed, without costs to either party; judgment to be settled upon five days, notice before Merwin, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Hardin, P. J., and Martin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Note on equitable action to compel the performance OF INDEFINITE OBLIGATIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The doctrine of specific performance is well understood as the equity to compel the substantial performance of a specific obligation assumed by contract. It has been almost a maxim in such cases that the contract must be unambiguous and the obligation specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">There is another class of cases not so numerous, nor <em>so </em>familiar, but if I am not mistaken as decisively recognized by\" unquestioned authority, where the obligation is undefined, perhaps even unexpressed, but is so clear in substance that a court of equity will inquire how, under the circumstances, it ought to be defined, and will express it in the decree in such scope and extent, and subject to such limitations as will render it just to enforce it as if it had been expressly defined by the parties. This is not making a contract for the parties; it is but the investigation of a contract that has been made, and defining what is equitably implied in it. In such a case the court examine a partly performed contract, and on finding that one party, while enjoying performance by the other, refuses himself to perform because of the vagueness of his own stipulation, clear away that vagueness, by inquiring what was necessarily and equitably involved in the contract, and treating the defendant as if he had specifically covenanted to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Thus courts of equity have for some time been accustomed to grant decrees for the performance of contract stipulations that were vague or indefinite, where the equity was clear, and the circumstances would enable the court to define the equitable obligation sufficiently to enable the decree to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">For instance, while they would not enforce a purely executory contract so vague as <em>\u201c </em>to build a bridge over the highway,\u201d' for a money compensation to be paid on completion, yet if a railroad company, for instance, obtained possession of its right of way by stipulating even in such vague language to build, the inequitableness of allowing it to continue in possession and refuse to build at all, is so clear, that the court may justly define the obligation and enforce it as so defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">This practice does not discard the maxim that specific performance will not be decreed of a contract which is vague and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>indefinite; but only restricts that maxim to cases where the contract is purely executory, or where, so far as it has been executed, on plaintiff\u2019s part, the execution is of such a nature that the breach on defendant\u2019s part may be adequately compensated by damages. '</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The cases in the text furnish strong illustrations of the classes of cases where an equitable obligation, inhering in a contract, but nowhere definitely expressed, may be defined and expressed by a judgment of the court in an action brought for the purpose, and specifically enforced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Mr. Justice Bbeweb in a recent case (No. 43, below) has admirably stated the rule as to the power of the court in this respect; and although a guarded discretion does not exercise this power in every case, the uncertainty of a contract is- no longer necessarily an obstacle to its enforcement, if the court can justly ascertain and define the obligation, and if damages are not an adequate remedy for the refusal to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\n<em>Notes of Oases.-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">I. <em>Gases illustrating the maxim that specific performance of an indefinite contract will not he decreed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">II. <em>Gases where a contract has heen performed in part.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">III. <em>Gases where uncertainly was cured hy events.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">IV. <em>Gases where uncertainty was cured hy extrinsic evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">V. <em>Gases where the cou/rt has fixed the details.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">I. <em>Oases illustrating the maxim that a specific performance of an indefinite contract will not he decreed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">1. <em>General rule\u2014contract for </em>support.] In Shakespeare <em>v. </em>Markham, 7<em>2 N.

The court say: \u201c It is an elementary principle in the exercise of equity jurisdiction that a contract will not be specifically enforced unless it is certain in its terms, or can be made certain by reference to such extrinsic facts as can, within the rules of law, be referred to for the purpose of ascertaining its meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">2.

Plaintiff performed his part of the \u25a0contract until required to remove from the house. Mrs. Miller had in the meantime executed a deed of the premises to plaintiff\u2019s daughters and deposited it in escrow to be delivered upon her decease. In this action to compel the depositary\u2019s delivery of the deed to plaintiff and \u25a0for possession of the <em>premises,\u2014Held, </em>that the want of certainty as to the persons to whom the conveyance or devise was to be made, rendered the contract incapable of enforcement, and that the uncertainty was not cured by the designation in the deed executed by Mrs. Miller; \u25a0and that this deed was revokable and was shown to have been revoked by her.

Co., 31 <em>Mich. </em>43, a covenant in a deed to a railway company that it should erect and maintain a depot or station-house on the land conveyed, suitable for the convenience of the public, but which was silent -as to the size, plan, shape, material, arrangement and cost of the building, was held too indefinite and uncertain as to details, to permit of \u25a0enforcement by the court. [Compare cases 32, 38, 44.]</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The court in this case review the authorities at some length, and state the rule as follows (p. 53) : \u201c The jurisdiction of equity in speeific performance proceeds on the supposition that the parties have not only agreed, as between themselves, upon every material matter, but that the matters so agreed on are of such a nature, and the subjects of enforcement so delineated or indicated, either directly or by reference to something else, or so raised to view by legitimate implication, that the court can and may collect, and in their proper relations, all the \u25a0essential elements, and proceed intelligently and practically in carrying into execution the very things agreed on and standing to be performed. If, however, it appears, either that the things to be performed are, in. their nature, incapable of execution by the court, or that needful specifications are omitted, or that material matters are left by the parties so obscure or undefined or so in want of details, or that the subjects of the agreement are so conflicting and incongruous that the court cannot say whether or not the minds of the parties met upon all essential parts, or if they did, then cannot say exactly upon what substantial terms they agreed, or trace out any practical line where their minds met, the case is not one for specific performance. As the court- does not make contracts for the parties, so it never undertakes to supply material ingredients which they omit to mention and which cannot be legitimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>considered as having been within their mutual contemplation. Where the party to perform is left by the agreement with the absolute discretion respecting material and substantial details, and these are therefore-indeterminate and unincorporated until by his election they are devel- \u25a0 oped, identified and fixed as constituents of the transaction, the court cannot substitute its own decrees, and so by its own act, perfect and; round out the contract.\u201d [Compare case 43.]</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">4.

An agreement of December 28, 1868, to sell real estate for a certain sum, and to take payment therefor, in part, a lease of restaurant premises, and in part, merchantable wines at the market price, to be delivered at intervals from such time as the vendor should commence the restaurant business, and for one year thereafter as they should be required, not to exceed in value $250 at any one time, and \u201c on receiving such payments at the time and in the manner above mentioned,\u201d to deliver a deed, \u201c which deed shall be delivered on the 31st day of December, <em>1868,\u201d\u2014Held, </em>not to be specifically enforceable in equity, as uncertain and impossible of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">28.

Action for specific performance of a contract in writing by a lessor to sell the demised premises to his lessee, within a certain time for a fixed price, \u201c upon the terms as specified.\u201d The terms of payment not being fixed by the contract, <em>held, </em>that it could not be specifically enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>29.

Action for specific performance of a covenant in a lease as follows : \u201c And the said party of the first part hereby agrees, in case said party of the second part shall then be tenants of the said premises, to first offer said property so \u2022demised for sale to and purchase by them for the sum of $25,000.\u201d The plaintiffs, the lessees, alleged that they had incurred large expense in anticipation of a purchase under this provision, and prayed for a \u2022decree giving them the right to purchase under this clause of the lease. <em>\u2014Held, </em>that the covenant was so ambiguous and doubtful in its meaning, that the action could not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">30. In Minturn v.

To avoid a contest on a doubtful will, the widow and heirs of \u25a0testator executed an agreement to set aside the will and settle the \u25a0estate as in case of intestacy, and also agreed to settle the demand of one of their number against another heir, by each bearing his or her <em>pro rata </em>share.\u2014Held, that the agreement was not rendered incomplete so as to be incapable of specific performance, by the omission of a term of the contract that one of the heirs was to have the home farm at an appraisal, it being distinct from the subject of the. .agreement. Hall <em>v. </em>Hall, 125 <em>Ill. </em>95.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">II. <em>Oases where cont/ract has been performed, in part.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">32. In Lawrence v. Saratoga Ry. Co., 36 <em>Hun, </em>467, the plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0testator made a contract with the defendant railway company for the sale of a certain portion of his land, through which the road was to run, and defendant agreed in writing that it would, simultaneously with the construction of the road, erect at or near the Excelsior Spring, owned by the vendor, \u201c a neat and tasteful station, built for the ac-commodation of passengers to and from said spring,\u201d which should be a regular station, at which all trains should stop, and would construct \u2022and maintain a bridge over the railroad at a certain highway, and a new and good bridge near the west end of the potato field for an overhead drive over the railroad.\u201d The railroad company having entered \u2019into possession of the land and built the <em>road,\u2014Held, </em>in an action brought for specific performance of its contract, that the defendant\u2019s ; agreement in the three particulars mentioned was sufficiently definite and certain to justify a decree for specific performance. It was no \u2022objection that the contract did not specify the size and material to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>used for the bridges or the station; a bridge suitable for a highway crossing was what was intended, and it was for the court or jury to decide whether the building erected as a station was a fair and reasonable performance of the agreement or a fraud and an evasion. The court say: \u201c Plainly the defendant, who has taken possession of the land under this contract, cannot be permitted to say that the contract is so indefinite that the defendant cannot perform its side of the contract, but that without performing the defendant will keep that land for which the performance of the contract was the consideration.\u201d [Compare cases 3, 38, 44.]</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">33. In Aday <em>v. </em>Echols, 18 <em>Ala. </em>353, specific performance of a parol contract for the sale of land was refused, although the purchaser had entered into possession and made valuable improvements, because the proof was that the payments were to be made in \u201c four or five \u201d annual instalments, and as the whole of the purchase money had not been paid, the proof left it uncertain as to the manner of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">34. Clark <em>v. </em>Clark, 49 <em>Cal. 49,\u2014Held, </em>that if the owner of land makes a verbal agreement with another to lease him the same for one year, with the privilege of two years more at an annual rent of $600, and a lease is to be executed containing the usual covenants, and the lessee takes possession and pays the rent for the first year, the agreement is sufficiently certain to support a decree against the lessor for a. specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">35. In Sutton <em>v. </em>Hayden, 62 <em>Mo. </em>103, a contract evidenced by a-letter to the effect that if the plaintiff would come and live with the writer and take care of her for the remainder of her days, all her property should, at her death, belong to plaintiff, was specifically enforced after the death of the writer, plaintiff having carried out her part of the agreement, and it was held no objection that the contract did not specify the mode of carrying out the decedent\u2019s intention,, whether by deed or will. [Compare cases 1 and 2.]</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">III. <em>Cases where uncertainty was cured by events.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">36. In Nunez <em>v. </em>Morgan, 77 <em>Cal. </em>427, a contract between the defendant in foreclosure and a proposed purchaser at the sale, that if defendant would bear the necessary expense of conveyance, etc., and would consent to the foreclosure of the mortgage upon land of the defendant, which had been before released from the lien of the mortgage, he would convey the same to defendant and would not disturb his possession, was specifically enforced against objection that it depended upon an uncertain or indefinite contingency, after the contingency had happened by the completion of the purchase at the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>87. A contract for the sale of land which provides that the deed, is to be given at any time upon payment of \u00a71,000, may be specifically enforced at the suit of the vendee, as the time for the performance may be made certain at any time by the vendor\u2019s tendering a deed and demanding' payment. It appears in this case that the vendee had taken possession and made improvements upon the property and paid the taxes, so that it would have been a fraud upon the plaintiff to permit the defendant to refuse performance of his part of the contract. Lee v. Briggs (Supreme Ct., 1889), 25 <em>N. Y. State Rep. </em>512. [Compare case 23.]</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">38. Where a landowner entered into a contract with a railroad campany, by which he released to it the right of way through his land, \u201cin sections 22 and 28 Tp., 79 R., 13 Powesheik Co., Ia., together with all necessary width for embankment,\u201d etc., and agreed to convey the fee simple to a strip of ground not less than 50 feet in width on-each side of the center of' the track of said company over and through the said <em>land,\u2014Held, </em>that the agreement, though it did not describe-the land to be conveyed by metes and bounds, was sufficiently definite- and certain to justify specific performance, it appearing that at the time of the contract the construction of the road had not been commenced, but that afterwards the railroad company had staked out certain lines, across the defendant\u2019s lands, over which the road was afterwards constructed. Ottumwa, Cedar Falls &amp; St. Paul R. Co. v. McWilliams, 71 <em>Ia. </em>164.

A contract for the sale of land, described as \u201c four hundred acres; of land in Colbert\u2019s Reserve,\u201d was enforced upon parol evidence clearing up the uncertainty of the description. Angel v. Simpson, 85 <em>Ala. </em>58.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">40. In Wharton v. Stoutenburgh, 35 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>266, a contract for a. lease of mines was specifically enforced at the suit of the lessor, where the lessee had taken possession and had begun working the mines, upon, evidence of its terms derived from the draft of the lease, as amended by the parties, but unsigned, which the court found to be a full and complete expression of the terms and stipulations finally agreed upon between the parties. The contract was for a lease of mines to be worked in a specified manner, and the court held that the fact that the details of the agreement were controverted by the parties, would not deter the court from ascertaining what its terms really were and enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">41. In Golden v. Knapp, 28 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>605, specific performance was decreed of a contract to convey land, which had been lost, on proof of its contents, although the evidence was contradictory as to its terms,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u2022some of the witnesses testifying that it conveyed to the grantee an absolute fee, while, according to other testimony, it conveyed to her \u2022only a life estate, with remainder to her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">42. Poplein v. Foley (Md.), 80 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>297. A written contract for a lease, which was intended to be for the term of ninety-nine years, renewable forever, contained no statement of the term for which the lease was to be made. A bill was filed by the lessors for a reformation -and specific performance of the contract, alleging that the length of the term of the demise agreed upon had been omitted from the written contract by mistake or oversight.\u2014Held, that the mistake having been \u2022established by parol proof, the complainants were entitled to have the \u2022contract reformed by the insertion of the words, \u201cfor the term of ninety-nine years, renewable forever,\u201d or words of like import ; and when go reformed, to have the agreement specifically executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">V. <em>Oases where the court have fixed the details.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">48. In Central Trust Co. <em>v. </em>Wabash, etc. R. Co., 29 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>547, it was objected that the court should not decree specific performance of a contract by one railroad company with another, that it should permit, \u201c under such reasonable regulations and terms as might be \u2022agreed upon, other railroads to use its right of way through the park. . . . Upon such terms and for such fair and equitable compensation to be paid to it therefor, as might be agreed upon by such companies,\u201d because the agreement contemplated that the conditions and compensation for the use should be determined by personal agreement, and as there had been no such agreement, the court could not make a new -contract for the parties and then enforce it. It was <em>held, </em>however, that, as the defendants had taken the position of denying the right of -any company to use its track at all under the contract, and the parties had never advanced to the position of mere disagreement about the amount of compensation or terms of use, the court, having taken cognizance of the question of right, was bound to determine the whole case and settle both the right and the compensation; and that although the agreement was general in its nature, and contained no provisions as to \u25a0details, this did not destroy the power of the court to enforce the agreement. The court (Beeweb, J.) stated the rule in such cases to be, that \u201c if the right is absolutely contracted for and the details are of a nature which courts may properly fix and settle, then, I take it, the \u2022court should not hold the contract incomplete, but determine the right, and also prescribe and settle the details. . . . While I concede that there is force in the objection that this must remain, in a qualified sense, a continuing case in the courts, with the constant duty of supervising the acts of the respondent, yet it seems to me that where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>right there must be a remedy, and that the mere machinery of court procedure is flexible enough to adapt itself to the necessities of protecting a right. Clearly a mere action for damages would be a grossly inadequate remedy. Clearly, the public interests justify, if they do not compel, the enforcement of this right, and so, with much hesitation, I have come to the conclusion that this objection cannot be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>44. </em>In Sanderson v. Cockermouth, etc. R. R. Co., 11 <em>Bean. </em>497, a contract between a railway company and a land owner to make such, roadways.and steps for cattle as might be necessary, was held capable-of being enforced after the company had taken possession of the property and built their railway.

The defendant purchased an estate,under an agreement with the plaintiff, previously made, that if he purchased, he would cede a part of the premises to-plaintiff, but the memorandum of agreement between the parties did. not designate the exact portion which was to be ceded to the plaintiff. In an action for specific performance of the agreement, the court directed a reference to ascertain what portion the plaintiff was entitled to, and that the defendant should convey such portion to the plaintiff..

A., the lessee of a house for the term of 80 years, which had then 59 years to run, executed an underlease to plaintiff from year to year, which contained a further agreement that the plaintiff should have, a lease at the same rent, \u201c at any period he may feel disposed,\u201d and that the lessor \u201c should not molest, disturb or raise the rent \u201d of plaintiff \u201c after his having laid out money in improving the said premises.\u201d Plaintiff knew nothing of the-length of A.\u2019s lease at the time of his underlease. He took possession and laid out money in improvements and while his lease had yet twenty years to run brought an action for specific performance against A.\u2019s <em>representative.\u2014Meld, </em>that the agreement should be construed to mean that the plaintiff was to have a lease for his life, if he desired, and that the court should carry out the agreement so far as the nature of his interest permitted, and should therefore direct the execution of a lease for the residue of A.\u2019s term, less one day, if plaintiff should so long; live.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">See, also, on this subject, <em>Seton on Becrees, </em>654, 691.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
