J., Brady and Daniels J.J].</author>\n<p id=\"AzH\">There seems to be ho good reason shown upon the papers presented on this record for requiring a reply to the answer herein, unless the rule is to be adopted that the court will require a reply to any new matter set up by way of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The allegations as to the proceedings of the court in Illinois can be easily proven, if \u25a0 true, by an exemplified copy of the record in that court, and no reply should be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The defense of the statute of limitations is one which the defendant must establish for himself, and the plaintiffs cannot be called upon to lend their assistance to him, or to aid him in the performance of that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The case of Watson <em>v. </em>Phyfe,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which seems to be relied upon as an authority for the granting of the motion in this action, presented features entirely different from those existing in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In that case, upon various grounds essentially different in their nature, the averments of the answer might be attacked, and the court held that the defendant should be informed of these grounds by a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In the case at bar, the effect of the alleged adjudications in Illinois must depend upon the record of the proceedings in that State and the laws applicable thereto; and of this fact the defendant is perfectly aware, and cannot, therefore, be surprised by the introduction of some new and unexpected reply to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Note on Pleading in avoidance of a defense by ' REPLY, VOLUNTEERED OR COMPELLED, OR BY AVOIDANCE IN THE COMPLAINT OF AN ANTICIPATED DEFENSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">At common law and under the earlier chancery practice, new matter contained in a plea was brought to issue only by a <em>replication; </em>and if the plaintiff designed to prove anything in avoidance of such new matter, the replication was special, stating the facts in avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The prolixity in pleading which resulted\u2014naturally greater in chancery than at common law\u2014led to the disuse of special replications in the English chancery, plaintiff being allowed to amend his bill so as to set up the' same matter in avoidance which otherwise would have required a special replication. The United States supreme court rules in equity adopted this practice and forbade special replications. The usual provisions in the Codes of Procedure adopt the same principle for all actions, and, with the exceptions hereafter noticed, abolish replications, not only general replications as a formality for joining issue, but also special replications as a disclosure of grounds for avoiding new matter set up as a defence in the answer ; so that under the blew Procedure, when a defendant serves an answer setting up new matter in defense and goes to trial, his allegations are on the one hand traversed by the statute, without any actual denial, but on the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>plaintiff may prove anything whatever in avoidance of such new matter, and defendant has no right to object on the .ground of surprise. Two qualifications of this general rule are made by the Codes, one absolute, and the other discretion\u2022ary with the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">1. If it is shown that defendant is embarrassed in his preparation for trial by being left in the dark as to what avoidance plaintiff relies on for meeting defendant\u2019s defense, the court will require plaintiff to put in a reply which will state, and therefore limit the subjects of proof :</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">2. If the answer sets up new matter as a <em>counterclaim, </em>that \"is to say, as a ground of affirmative relief against the plaintiff, 'the allegations of the counterclaim are treated like the allegations of a complaint, as having been admitted if not denied, \u00a1and a reply is necessary in order to deny them.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Code adopted the general principles of equity pleading :as the basis of pleading under the new system and abolished replications, but did not expressly prescribe any rule as to matter in the complaint in avoidance of an anticipated \u25a0defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In equity, such matter was first stated in the charging part of the bill; by later practice it was allowed as proper in \u25a0the narrative part of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Every equity practitioner is familiar with the convenience \u25a0of thus narrowing the issue which defendant might otherwise raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The Codes, however, by making a complaint sufficient which states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, \u25a0departed from the equity rule that the bill must state by amendment, if not originally, an avoidance of the defense, but substituted the rule that the court may require a reply in its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The practice of amending so as to bring into the complaint matter of evidence was repeatedly sanctioned under the Code in the earlier cases before it was as well settled as now that plaintiff may prove any facts constituting a common law avoidance of new matter in defense, although not pleaded by him <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The results are these : 1. If plaintiff\u2019s complaint discloses1the existence of a defense it must also contain matter in avoidance of that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">2. Plaintiff is not bound to plead any common law avoidance of an anticipated defense not disclosed by his own complaint. He may state facts as his cause of action, although he knows defendant has an apparent answer to them, and may-reserve his avoidance of that answer till the trial, provided that avoidance does not require affirmative equitable relief\" against the matter set up as a defense; in other words, provided it is a good avoidance at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The cases are not agreed as to whether an equitable avoidance is thus available without pleading. The later cases favor-the rule that if- there is an obstacle to recovery which cannot be avoided except by equitable relief, the plaintiff should frame his action as an equitable one, and allege his avoidance and ask relief against the matter of defense thus to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">3. If plaintiff does not indicate by his pleading how he intends to avoid a defense, and defendant can show that the facts of his defense are clear and that he is embarrassed in preparation for trial by being left in the dark as to how plaintiff will endeavor to avoid their effect, the court may compel plaintiff to reply, and, of course, conf\u00edne his avoidance-on the trial to the matters alleged in the reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">4. Plaintiff may, if he choose, allege in his complaint an-avoidance of an anticipated defense, even though it be an avoidance good at common law and therefore not necessary to be alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">This conclusion has been contested, and while the weight of reason and authority is in its favor, it is to be taken with the important qualification that if defendant does not plead the anticipated defense, the allegations intended in-avoidance are left without pertinence, are not admitted by not being denied, and are so much surplusage. Hence, if defendant disavows intent to plead that defense, he could move to strikeout the anticipated avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">If, however, defendant does plead the anticipated defense,, he makes the allegations in avoidance material, precisely as in the case of pleading in equity, and he must deny them or they will stand admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">This rule, it will be seen, does not rest directly on any provision of the Code, but on the old practice and reasons of\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>convenience which favor allowing the parties to narrow as much as they will the issues to be tried.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In view of these principles the usual policy of counsel in framing the pleadings in such cases is this :</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">If an anticipated defense will require equitable relief, allege-the facts in avoidance and ask that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Where an anticipated defense can be met by a common law avoidance and needs no equitable relief, then if it is expected that defendant will go to issue in any case and contest a recovery, frame the complaint as if the defense did not exist, and reserve the avoidance until trial; but if the defense is supposed to be the only one, and defendant cannot under oath deny either the cause of action or the avoidance, allege the matter in avoidance in the complaint, and then if he pleads, that defense he must admit or deny the matter in avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Notes of Oases on Reply under the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">I. <em>Requiring Replyi</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">II. <em>Contents of Reply.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">I. <em>Requiring Reply.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\n<em>Plaintiff not entitled to leave to reply.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">In McDonald <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 <em>Month.

Defendant answered that the policy of insurance was void for the reason that plaintiff gave false answers to certain questions set forth in the application concerning the amount of incumbrances upon the property, and omitting to specify a certain mortgage thereon. Plaintiff offered to prove that defendant\u2019s agent, who made out the application, was informed of the mortgage and by mistake omitted it.\u2014 <em>Held, </em>upon appeal reversing a judgment in favor of plaintiff, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u25a0defense consisting of new matter, not constituting a counterclaim, is deemed controverted; and plaintiff, without pleading, may traverse or avoid it, and is entitled to the benefit of every possible answer to it, the .same as if pleaded; for that purpose the proposed evidence, being admissible under the principles either of law or equity, takes the place \u25a0of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Keeler v. Keeler, 102 N. <em>Y. </em>30. Action to foreclose mortgage. The \u25a0\u25a0complaint contained the ordinary averments for foreclosure of a mortgage on land. The answer of defendants, other than the mortgagors, alleged that the mortgagors held as tenants under a perpetual lease, -and the title of the lessor having become vested in said defendants, they brought ejectment for non-payment of rent, recovered judgments, and under writs of possession issued thereon, the mortgagors were dispossessed and possession was delivered to them, whereby plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was cut off. Plaintiff claimed that the pretended execution of the writs of possession was collusive and fraudulent, being designed to \u25a0wrongfully deprive plaintiff of the lien of her mortgage. The trial court decided that this question could not be considered as there was no averment of collusion or fraud in the complaint.\u2014Held, upon appeal, error. That the complaint was purely and simply for the foreclosure of the mortgage. All the allegations with respect to the proceedings in ejectment came from the defendants, and the plaintiff had the right to give evidence on the trial, for the purpose of avoiding the new matter set up as a defense of any facts which might have been pleaded by way of reply when that pleading was in use.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Dambman <em>v. </em>Schulting, 4 Hun, 50; affirming 51 <em>How. Pr. </em>337. Action to set aside release, on the ground of defendant\u2019s fraud in its procurement. It appeared by the complaint, that a preceding action had been brought for the recovery of the debt, and the release had been there pleaded as a defense. For that reason a demurrer in the present action was <em>sustained.\u2014Held, </em>upon appeal from an order sustaining the demurrer, that a reply was not necessary to enable plaintiff to show that the release was fraudulently procured. The fraud might be proved by evidence on the trial. That the provision of the Code, that the allegation of new matter in a reply is deemed t\u201eo be controverted by the \u25a0adverse party, is so broad that it secures to plaintiff every possible \u2022 answer to a defense, as fully as though it were alleged in the most complete and artistic form.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Maricle v. Brooks, 21 <em>State Rep. </em>534; s. c., 5 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>210. Action to recover pay for services rendered. The complaint counted on a contract for labor and services. The answer set up a settlement and discharge as a defense, and plaintiff was allowed to prove that these were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>obtained by fraud and <em>duress.\u2014Held, </em>upon appeal from a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, that this did not constitute a counterclaim and required no reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u2014 e. <em>g., fraud inprocuring execution of instrument pleaded as a justification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Chambooet <em>v. </em>Cagney, 35 <em>Super.

The complaint set forth, among other things, that defendant wrongfully-converted to his own use certain personal property belonging to plaintiff. The answer put in issue the allegations as to the conversion, and alleged that defendant leased to plaintiff a certain house, and that to-secure the due payment of the rent thereof, plaintiff gave to defendant a mortgage upon personal property, which plaintiff covenanted should1 be placed in the house rented, and should not be removed without defendant\u2019s consent. That plaintiff did remove the property referred to, whereupon defendant took the property, under the mortgage, and sold the same. Plaintiff was allowed to prove upon the trial that he had been induced to sign the mortgage containing such covenant by <em>fraud.\u2014Held, </em>that defendant having justified under a written instrument, and plaintiff not being entitled to reply, as of course, the existence of the instrument might be deemed fully at issue without a reply ; and that plaintiff might prove that it contained a clause not agreed to, and that he was induced to sign by fraud, as if the instrument had been declared on and the answer had denied making it.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\n<em>Uncalled for reply may be struck out on motion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In Devlin v.

Plaintiff sued to recover damages sustained through defendant\u2019s negligence. Defendant set up as a distinct defense that plaintiff had released the cause of action. Plaintiff replied that the release was obtained by fraud and undue influence, and without consideration. Defendant moved to strikeout the reply, on the ground that none is necessary or allowed. The court denied the motion, without costs, as the question was <em>new.\u2014Held, </em>upon appeal, that as the reply was served without any application of the court for direction or leave to make it, so that it was not founded on any exercise of the discretion of the court, or on the application of defendant, as provided by Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 576, the motion should have-been granted, and the order denying the motion was therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u2014 <em>but not demurrable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Avery v.

The complaint stated two cases of action in different courts : The first to recover damages for a failure to maintain an opening in a fence; the second to recover damages for the maintenance of a nuisance. The answer, among other defenses, pleaded the statute of limitations and the recovery \u2022of judgments for the same cause of action. Plaintiff served a reply, and defendant demurred.\u2014Held, upon appeal from an order sustaining the demurrer, that as the allegations of the answer did not constitute a counterclaim, no reply was needed, and as no order authorizing such \u2022reply was obtained, as provided by Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 516, the same might be set aside on motion. But the court would not entertain it for the purpose of determining its sufficiency to resist a demurrer, and the demurrer therefore should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Mere set-off not a counterclaim.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">American Dock &amp; Improvement Co. <em>v. </em>Staley, 40 <em>Super.

The answer set up an agreement, alleged a breach thereof, and that thereby defendant suffered \u25a0damage amounting to three hundred dollars and prayed that the same might be set-off against any sum allowed to plaintiff.\u2014Held, upon appeal, that defendant was entitled to judgment on the ground that an answer set up a counterclaim to which there was no <em>reply.\u2014Held, </em>that no counterclaim was stated, but simply a set-off, and such a defense needs no reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u25a0 <em>Demand for payment because of payment or satisfaction, not a \u2022counterclaim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Bates <em>v. </em>Rosekrans, 4 <em>Abb.

That defendant is bound by his own definition of the answer and cannot at his own volition change the nature of the pleading which he has characterized, and by so doing may have misled the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Ward <em>v. </em>Comegys, 2 <em>How.

The matters set forth in the answer were not characterized as counterclaims, but as distinct and separate <em>defenses.\u2014Held, </em>that as defendant had not characterized the defenses as counterclaims, and was therefore estopped from claiming the same, plaintiff was not entitled to serve a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>Gross demand contracted to apply in part payment of plaintiffs \u25a0demand is not a counterclaim, and is not admitted by non-reply.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Burke <em>v. </em>Thorne, 44 <em>Barb. </em>363. Action for work, labor and services. The answer set forth that defendants, during the time of the performance of the labor, had paid divers sums of money to and for plaintiff, to apply in part payment for the services. It then claimed that plaintiff was indebted to defendants for the said sums, and 'alleged that defendants would insist upon the sums so paid as a counterclaim and demanded judgment for <em>costs.\u2014Held, </em>that the answer did not set up a \u2022counterclaim so as to require a reply, but that the facts pleaded constituted the defense of payment only, and that, therefore, although there was no reply, the whole answer did not stand admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\n<em>Gases for ordinary reply.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">Brinkerhoff v.

The complaint contained the usual allegations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The answer set up that a decree of divorce was obtained by the deceased husband from plaintiff, whereby he was discharged from all duties and. covenants incident to the marriage.

Defendant in his answer tacitly admitted the contract or liability, but denied that he was a general partner, and alleged that he was a special partner, and that all the requirements of the statute as to limited partnerships had been complied with. Defendant moved that plaintiff be required to <em>reply.\u2014Held, </em>that where a violation of a statute is the basis of a pleading, the specific grounds should be pointed out; and that a reply was proper, in order to raise a precise and definite issue. The court being vested with a discretion would therefore require a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\n<em>If complaint suggests that plaintiff knows the avoidance relied on by-defendant, he map be required to reply, though defendant knows the ground of reply.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Hubbell <em>v. </em>Fowler, 1 <em>Abb.

The affidavit in support of the motion showed that the action was in fact begun more than six years after the maturity of the note sued upon, and that it was necessary for the proper defense of the suit that defendant\u2019s counsel should be informed in what way plaintiff expected to-defeat the operation of the <em>statute.\u2014Held, </em>that while the case was not one in which, under the Code, plaintiff was bound to reply, it was deemed a proper one in which to exercise the discretion of the court to compel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>a reply.

Defendant waited until thirty-three days after answer was served before making motion, and in the meantime, joined in an argument of a motion made by plaintiff for a <em>reference.\u2014Held, </em>that the failure of defendants to raise an objection that a reply was needful, when the motion for a reference was argued, was a waiver of such rights, and that a plaintiff has no right to reply where a reply is not necessary, unless directed by the court on defendant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>Representative capacity of plaintiff no objection to requiring reply.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In McGin v.

The complaint alleged that defendants ageed to purchase certain notes given (by a company adjudged a bankrupt), under a composition agreement, and of which company plaintiff was a creditor. That a tender of the notes was made to defendants, but payment was refused. The answer denied the tender and demand, and as a separate defense, alleged that the agreement was void by reason of plaintiff\u2019s false representations, and that plaintiff had ceased to be a creditor. The allegations were re-alleged on a counterclaim. The reply denied that plaintiff had ceased to be a creditor, that the agreement was void, and that he had made any false representations. New matter in avoidance was also set up in the <em>reply.\u2014Held, </em>that the reply which denied the allegations of the counterclaim, did not, by setting up new matter in avoidance of it, admit those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">\n<em>Reply alleging only conclusion in addition to what was alleged in the answer.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Croome <em>v. </em>Craig, 53 <em>Hun, </em>350; s. c., 6 <em>N.

The complaint stated that the contract was made upon the settlement of disputes concerning an account between the parties. Defendants, in their answer, alleged that errors intervened in the accounting, which they had discovered at a date therein mentioned, diminishing their liability under the agreement, and demanded that they should be allowed to prove these errors, and that certain amounts should be credited. By way of reply, it was alleged that defendants had delayed so long before attempting to correct the alleged errors, and had been guilty of such laches as not to be entitled to the consideration of a court of equity.\u2014 <em>Held, </em>upon appeal from a judgment overruling a demurrer, that as no fact whatever was inserted in that part of the reply that did not already appear from the complaint and answer, the judgment' should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Reply cannot set up counterclaim to a counterclaim in an answer.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Cohn v.

That there was no warrant under the Code for pleading, in a reply, an independent counterclaim to a counterclaim set up by the defendant, and the \u25a0Code has abolished the long series of successive pleadings possible at common law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\"> 20 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>372.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b167-12\"> Chapman v.
