In both cases the parties can be heard as to any, ground bearing against the proposed consolidation, and the supreme court may demand that proper notice may be given to all parties, who shall have a full hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">2. <em>The same.] </em>An equitable action will therefore not lie and an injunction will not issue to restrain such proceedings for consolidation on grounds of irregularity in the action of the corporations agreeing to consolidation, and allegations of the inadvisability of the consolidation, but the parties will be required to present those objections in the statutory proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Appeal from order of the general term of the court of common pleas for the city and county of Hew York, affirming an order of the special term continuing an injunction pending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The action was brought by James Maclaury, as trustee, etc., of the Protestant Episcopal Church of St. Stephen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u00bfagainst A. Bloomer Hart and others, as defendants, among whom were said church corporation and also the corporation \u2022of the church of the Holy Trinity of Harlem.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The complaint alleged that plaintiff brought the suit as \u2022a trustee, and in behalf of the rector, church-wardens and vestrymen of the church of St. Stephen, a religious corporation, organized under chapter 60 of the Laws of 1813 and the acts amendatory thereof. That the natural persons named -as defendants, with the plaintiff, had for some time formed the vestry, and were under the law the trustees of said -church, and that the defendant, Hart, was the rector thereof. That the defendant, the church of the Holy Trinity, was a \u2022corporation organized under the same act. That said church of St. Stephen owned certain valuable real property, which was specifically described. That the Holy Trinity church has a place of worship distant four miles from that of the church of St. Stephen, recently built and heavily encumbered. That proceedings of an irregular nature had been taken by certain of the defendants at a special meeting of the vestry of the church of St. Stephen looking to the consolidation of the said two churches, the nature of the business to be transacted at such special meeting having been concealed from plaintiff and others, who consequently omitted to take any measures to prevent the adoption of the scheme. That in \u2022consequence of such concealment, a resolution favoring such \u2022consolidation was passed without proper consideration or discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The complaint then alleged facts tending to show the irregularity of the proceedings and the personal interest of \u2022certain of the individual defendants in securing their con,summation, and that further proceedings toward consolidation had been taken by such defendants under the resolution, and were still proceeding, against the protest of plaintiff and a large majority of the church and congregation. There were further allegations showing reasons why such consolidation should not be made, and of conspiracy on the part of She defendants to secure it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Judgment was prayed that th\u00e9 resolution passed at the-special meeting of the vestry be adjudged illegal and set aside, together with the proposed agreement and every contract made by virtue of such resolution, and for an injunction against any act furthering, effecting or consummating the consolidation, or any transfer of the church property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The plaintiff upon this complaint and the affidavits of\u2019 himself and others obtained an injunction order with a provision requiring defendants to show cause why it should not be continued. After a hearing, at which opposing affidavits-were presented, the court continued the injunction in the following form:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Ordebed : \u201c That the defendants and each of them, their agents, attorneys and servants refrain from being or causing or suffering to be done, any act or acts of any character or description, for the making, furthering, effecting or consummating any union and consolidation of the said church of St. Stephen with the said Holy Trinity church, or any sale- and transfer of the real estate and property of the said church of St. Stephen to the said Holy Trinity church, under the-resolution of February 6, 1890, or any proposed consolidated church, or any sale or transfer of the church edifice of the-said church of St. Stephen or any agreement or pretended agreement, for any such union and consolidation, or sale and transfer, under the resolutions of February 6,1890, until the final judgment and decree in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The following opinion was rendered:</p>\n<author id=\"b280-8\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">It is a principle of equity jurisprudence that-one of several trustees may invoke the aid of a court of equity to set aside an agreement illegally entered into by his-co-trustees and to restrain the carrying it into effect, as well as to restrain the doing by them of any threatened illegal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The resolution for consolidation of the churches of St. Stephen\u2019s and Holy Trinity church, of Harlem, to set aside-which and to prevent its being carried into effect this action) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>is brought, was passed at a special meeting of the vestry of the church of St. Stephen. The notice calling such meeting did not state the object thereof. At least two of the-trustees were not present. This renders the action taken at the special meeting invalid and illegal. The rule that a notice calling a special or extraordinary meeting must state-\" particularly the objects of the meeting, is amply supported by the authorities <em>(Angell and Ames on Corp. </em>\u00a7 489; <em>Boone on Corp. </em>\u00a7 64; <em>Morawetz on Corp. </em>\u00a7 482; <em>Waterman on Corp. </em>Vol. 1, pages 207 and 209, and the cases cited in these-text books). The plaintiff is thus entitled to the relief lie-asks for unless something can be found in the Act of 1876, chapter 176, as amended by the act of 1880, chapter 167,. which debars him from the right of the interposition of a court of equity which he possessed before the passage of' that act. It is contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the provision of the act referred to requiring an approval of the-consolidation agreement by the supreme court upon an application being made therefor and providing that upon such application \u201c all persons interested may be heard,\u201d does so 1 debar him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">This statute does not give to the parties interested any new right not before known to the common law or equity and provide a means for enforcing such new right. The equitable right to set aside invalid transactions and to come-into a court of equity for that purpose under the rules and principles laid down by such courts is of very old date. The jurisdiction of courts of equity in this respect cannot under-the constitution of this State be divested by the legislature. The clause in this statute may give -a cumulative remedy ; but the plaintiff is not bound to wait until those whom he opposes see fit, by making an application, to give him an opportunity of availing himself of that cumulative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The statute gives the plaintiff no right to initiate any proceedings under it, nor does it prescribe any mode for bringing parties in opposition before the court, nor is there \u2022 any provision compeding the applicants to disclose to the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>court the fact that there is opposition or that persons other than themselves are interested. A statute of this character does not afford ample, nor even sufficient remedy to the plaintiff, and he should not be debarred of his equitable right and remitted to defending a proceeding which the defendants may, or may not initiate, and of which they may, or may not, give him notice. There is sufficient in the history -of the case to warrant a belief that the plaintiff\u2019s rights may be seriously impaired by such remission.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Upon the views above expressed the motion must be granted, without entering into the question of the good faith of the parties seeking the consolidation,\u2014about which voluminous affidavits have been submitted,\u2014and the injunction restraining the defendants from any act or proceeding for the consolidation of the said churches under the resolution passed at a special meeting of the vestry of St. Stephen\u2019s \u25a0 church, February 6, 1890, continued until the final judgment and decree in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>The Cowrt at General </em>Term, upon appeal (Larremore, \u25a0\u2022Ch. J., and Bookstaver, J.), affirmed the order on the opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">From such order of affirmance, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"><em>Charles Blandy (Andrew J. Shipman, </em>attorney) for appellants. I. Jurisdiction of proceedings for the consolidation of religious corporations is vested exclusively in the supreme court, and it is provided that in such proceedings <em>\u201c </em>all parties interested therein may be heard \u201d (Heiser <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc., 104 <em>N. Y. </em>68, 72; Dudley <em>v. </em>Mayhew, 3 <em>Id. </em>9, 15; Jessup <em>v. </em>Carnegie, 89 <em>Id. </em>441; Brown\u2019s Appeal, 66 <em>Penna. </em>157; Janney <em>v. </em>Buell, 55 <em>Ala. </em>408; Coleman v. Freeman, 3 <em>Ga. </em>137; People <em>v. </em>Wasson, 64 <em>N. Y. </em>167; Wallack <em>v. </em>Society for Reformation, etc., 67 <em>Id. </em>23; Savage <em>v. </em>Allen, 54 <em>Id. </em>458; Mandeville <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 68 <em>Id. </em>528). 'The remedy of the plaintiff in the supreme court is adequate. 'The plaintiff seeks to restrain the supreme court (Schell <em>v. </em>Erie Ry. Co., 51 <em>Barb. </em>369; Grant <em>v. </em>Quick, 5 <em>Sandf. S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>C. </em>612; Savage <em>v. </em>Allen, 59 <em>Barb. </em>291; Wenfield v. Bacon, 24 <em>Id. </em>154; Erie Ry. Co. <em>v. </em>Ramsey, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>647).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">II. The call for the meeting of the 6th of February was- \u25a0 sufficient (Granger <em>v. </em>Original Empire Co., 59 <em>Cal. </em>678). The complaint does not allege that the call for the meeting was-not sufficient. The call for the meeting must be presumed to have been sufficient (Porter <em>v. </em>Robinson, 30 <em>Hun, </em>209; Sargent <em>v. </em>Webster, 13 <em>Metc. </em>497). The notice being in writing, it cannot be proven by parol (Stevens v. Eden Meeting-House Society, 12 <em>Vt. </em>688).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">III. The absence of certain defendants from the meeting-of February 6, does not affect the validity of the resolutions for consolidation (Porter <em>v. </em>Robinson, 30 <em>Hun, </em>210).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">IY. The plaintiff cannot avail himself of the alleged failure to give sufficient notice to certain defendants of the-meeting of February 6 (Schenectady, etc. Plankroad Co. <em>v. </em>Thatcher, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>102; People <em>v. </em>Peck, 11 <em>Wend. </em>604; Matter of M. <em>&amp; </em>H. R. R. Co., 19 <em>Wend. </em>135; Samuel Holliday, 1 <em>Woolw. </em>400; Zabriskie <em>v. </em>Cleveland, etc. R. R. Co., 23 <em>How. U. S. </em>381; Jones <em>v. </em>Milton, etc. Turnpike Co., 7 <em>Ind. </em>547).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Y. The delegation of power to the committee to execute the agreement for consolidation was valid, and the committee did not exceed its powers (Hoyt <em>v. </em>Thompson\u2019s Executor, 19 N. <em>Y. </em>207; Olcott <em>v. </em>Tioga R. R. Co., 27 <em>Id. </em>546; Burrill <em>v. </em>Nahant Bk., 2 <em>Metc. </em>163).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\"><em>Daniel G. Rollins (David Bennett King, </em>and <em>Booraem, Hamilton &amp; Beckett, </em>attorneys) for respondent. I. The order appealed from is not reviewable by this court (Paul <em>v. </em>Munger, 47 N. <em>Y. </em>469; Calkin <em>v. </em>Manhattan Oil Co., 65 <em>Id. </em>557; Hatch <em>v. </em>Western Union Tel. Co., 93 <em>Id. </em>640; McHenry <em>v. </em>Jewett, 90 <em>Id. </em>58; Selchow <em>v. </em>Baker, 93 <em>Id. </em>59; Anderson <em>v. </em>Anderson, 112 <em>Id. </em>104; Allen <em>v. </em>Meyer, 73 <em>Id. </em>1 Haebler <em>v. </em>Bernharth, 115 <em>Id. </em>459).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">II. The action is properly brought by the plaintiff as trustee, etc., and in order to maintain the action he need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>,-sliow that he has demanded that the corporation bring the \u25a0suit and that it has refused to do so (Brinckerhoff <em>v. </em>Bostwick, 88 <em>N. Y. </em>55, 59; Butts <em>v. </em>Wood, 37 <em>Id. </em>317; Robinson v. Smith, 3 <em>Paige, </em>222; Hodges <em>v. </em>New England Screw Co., 1 <em>R. 1. </em>312; Heath <em>v. </em>Erie Ry. Co., 8 Blatchf. 347; Currier <em>v. </em>N. Y. S. <em>&amp; </em>B. R. R. Co., 35 <em>Hun, </em>355; Anderton <em>v. </em>Wolff, 41 <em>Id. </em>471; Sheridan <em>v. </em>Sheridan Electric Light Co., 38 <em>Id. </em>396; Kelsey <em>v. </em>Sargeant, 40 <em>Id. </em>450; Brewster <em>v. </em>Hatch, 4 <em>N. Y. State Rep. </em>617; Young <em>v. </em>Drake, 8 <em>Hun, </em>61; Robinson <em>v. </em>Smith, 3 <em>Paige, </em>222, 233; Stokes <em>v. </em>Phelps Mission, 47 <em>Hun, </em>570; First Ref'd Presby. Ch. <em>v. </em>Bowden, 14 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>356).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">III. A court of equity has power to restrain the proceedings of the trustees of a religious corporation, and amend their acts (Wyatt <em>v. </em>Benson, 23 <em>Barb. </em>327; Matter of St. Ann\u2019s Church, 23 <em>How. </em>286; Stokes <em>v. </em>Phelps Mission, 47 <em>Hun, </em>570; Robertson <em>v. </em>Bullions, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>243; Gram <em>v. </em>The Prussia, etc. German Soc., 36 <em>Id. </em>161).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">IV. The resolutions claimed to have been passed at the special meeting of the vestry of the church of St. Stephen, held on February 6, 1890, were and are illegal and invalid (Porter <em>v. </em>Robinson, 36 <em>Hun, </em>209; Atlantic Delaine Co. <em>v. </em>Mason, 5 <em>R. 1. </em>463; Ehrenfeldt\u2019s Appeal, 101 <em>Penn. St. </em>186; Matter of Bridgeport Brewery Co., 1 <em>L. R. </em>2 <em>Ch. </em>191; People\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Westcott, 14 <em>Gray, </em>440; Gray <em>v. </em>Society, etc., 137 <em>Mass. </em>329; American Tube Works v. Boston Machine Co., 137 <em>Mass. </em>5; Downs <em>v. </em>Bowdoin Sq. Bapt. Ch., 21 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>294; Kortright <em>v. </em>Commercial Bk. of Buffalo, 20 <em>Wend. </em>91; 22 <em>Id. </em>348).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">V. Conspiracy was clearly shown (Kelly <em>v. </em>People, 55 N. <em>Y. </em>576; People <em>v. </em>Mattur, 4 <em>Wend. </em>229, 261).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">VI. Certain of the defendants were clearly disqualified from voting for the resolutions for consolidation (Davone <em>v. </em>Fanning, 2 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>252; Jewett <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 <em>N. Y. </em>405; Butts <em>v. </em>Woods, 37 <em>Id. </em>317; Ogden <em>v. </em>Murray, 39 <em>Id. </em>202; Munson <em>v. </em>S. G. &amp; C. R. R. Co., 103 <em>Id. </em>58; Wardell <em>v. </em>R. R. Co., 103 <em>R. S. </em>651).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>VII. The rector, wardens and vestrymen of the church of St. Stephen, are, under the law, trustees of the corporation, and 'tneir acts as trustees are subject to the same rules as are the acts of trustees of other corporations, and they can do more use their position as such trustees to promote, their own interests than can the directors of a bank or of a railroad \u25a0company use their positions for a transaction with their corporation for their own benefit (Robertson <em>v. </em>Bullions, 11 N. <em>Y. </em>243; Wardens, etc. of St. James Church <em>v. </em>Rector, etc. of Church of Redeemer, 45 <em>Barb. </em>356; Stokes <em>v. </em>Phelps Mission, 47 <em>Hun, </em>570; M. E. Soc. <em>v. </em>Perry, 51 <em>Id. </em>104).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">VIII. The improper and unlawful suppression, concealment and misrepresentations of the objects of the meeting, \u25a0show that certain defendants were influenced by improper motives, besides being disqualified by reason of interest from voting for the scheme of consolidation (Armstrong <em>v. </em>Edwards, 95 <em>Ind. </em>422; People <em>v. </em>A. &amp; S. R. Co., 55 <em>Barb. </em>344; People <em>v. </em>Peck, 11 <em>Wend. </em>604).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">IX. The vestry of the church of St. Stephen had no right to undertake a consolidation, which would destroy the church, remove its place of worship, and transfer its property to another church several miles away, against the wishes of members of the church and congregation which constituted the corporation (Robertson <em>v. </em>Bullions, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>243; Gram <em>v. </em>The Prussia, etc. Soc., 36 <em>Id. </em>161; People <em>v. </em>Hulbert, 46 <em>Id. </em>110; Walker <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 66 <em>Id. </em>655; People\u2019s Bk. <em>v. </em>Anthony\u2019s R. C. Ch., 109 <em>Id. </em>512; <em>In re </em>St. George\u2019s M. E. Church, 21 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>81).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">X. The relief sought here cannot be obtained in the proceeding pending in the supreme court (Savage <em>v. </em>Allen, 54 N. Y. 458; People <em>v. </em>Wasson, 64 <em>Id. </em>167; McDowell\u2019s Appeal, 123 <em>Pa. </em>381; Dinsport <em>v. </em>Ranson, 29 <em>W. V. </em>487; People <em>v. </em>Cromwell, 102 <em>N. Y. </em>476; People <em>v. </em>Fairman, 91 <em>Id. </em>385; People <em>v. </em>Richards, 99 <em>Id. </em>620).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">XI. No proceeding for a consolidation of the church of St. Stephen with Holy Trinity church is now pending before .the supreme or any other court. A threatened proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of that kind cannot be pleaded as a bar to this action (Stokes <em>v. </em>Phelps Mission, 47 <em>Hun, </em>570; Hopkins <em>v. </em>Seymour, <em>N. </em>Y. <em>Daily Reg., </em>May 16, 1884; First R. P. Ch. <em>v. </em>Bowden, 14 <em>Abb. </em>N. <em>C. </em>357; s. c., 10 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>1; Isham <em>v. </em>Trustee, etc., 63 <em>How. </em>465; Johan <em>v. </em>Fullagar, 14 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>363; Little <em>v. </em>Jayne, 124 <em>Ill. </em>123; M. E. Soc. <em>v. </em>Perry, 51 <em>Hun, </em>104).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">XII. Directors of corporations may be restrained from doing acts which ordinarily would be within the scope of their authority and power, when in view of the special circumstances the performance of such acts would be in bad faith or an injury to the interests of the stockholders (Wright <em>v. </em>Woodville, M. Co., 40 <em>Cal. </em>20, 27; Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 <em>How. U. S. </em>340).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">XIII. Preliminary injunctions which only prevent the-defendant from doing an act which would render the final judgment ineffectual may be granted with some readiness(Bronk <em>v. </em>Riley, 50 <em>Hun, </em>489; Atlantic, etc. Tel. Co. <em>v. </em>Baltimore, etc., 46 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>421; Haskell <em>v. </em>Hamilton University, 8 <em>Barb. </em>174).</p>\n<author id=\"b286-7\">Finch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">We reverse the order appealed from upon the ground that the facts stated in the complaint do not justify an award of the equitable relief demanded. We do not review the discretion which grants an injunction temporarily restraining a defendant until final judgment, unless we are entirely satisfied that the plaintiff is not entitled to ultimate relief. The present action seeks to-withdraw from the tribunals specially clothed with authority to determine the controversy the right to decide it, and has no adequate foundation except distrust of those tribunals. Two religious corporations cannot consolidate unless, in the-case of Episcopal churches, their agreement so to do is approved by the bishop and the standing committee of the diocese, and then by the supreme court to whicli is given the fullest and most complete discretion as to all the terms- and details of the arrangement. Before the bishop and the: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>standing committee this plaintiff can be heard, as to every ground of complaint which he has alleged, and as to all the reasons which bear against the consolidation proposed. It is not to be assumed that the bishop will refuse to hear any member of his flock coming with a proper and respectful protest, or will decide in any other way than upon a full view of the situation and with an honest and deliberate purpose to do what it best for both churches. To him, as the ecclesiastical head of the diocese and the standing committee as his adviser and associate in the judgment, it was entirely proper that the proposed agreement of consolidation should be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">But beyond that the statute requires the assent of the supreme court, which may demand that all parties appear before it, and will be' quite sure to see that suitable notice is given, and that no interested party is deprived \u00f3f a hearing. That the statute merely designates the ultimatetribunial and prescribes its authority without specifying the practice to be pursued, does not justify an inference that it will proceed in a partial or unjust manner or contrary to-its normal rules of action. There is no reason, therefore,, why the statute remedy should not be pursued and a court of' equity is never at liberty to draw to its general jurisdiction a question remitted to a competent and sufficient authority by express command of a statute, unless under some very exceptional circumstances, which do not existhere (People <em>v. </em>Wasson, 64 <em>N. Y. </em>167; Heiser <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc., 104 <em>Id. </em>68). The statute <em>(laws of </em>1876, chap. 176) not only provides that all parties shall be heard but makes the agreement of consolidation the necessary preliminary to the action of the ecclesiastical authority and that of the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">When the common pleas enjoined any action under that agreement they simply obstructed the statutory remedy and stripped the bishop and the supreme court of jurisdiction in the specific proceeding, and drew to themselves an authority which the law had lodged elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The agreement, whether made lawfully or unlawfully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>honestly or dishonestly, could harm nobody because it bound nobody, and served only like a petition or a pleading tp bring the question into court and place it before the appointed tribunal for adjudication. Equity wields the' powerful process of injunction to prevent irreparable injury and is somewhat choice of the weapon. In the agreement made, whatever its character or occasion, there was no danger or harm to the plaintiff or his rights. Before the bishop, before the standing committee, before the supreme court, it would stand merely as a proposal, open to every kind of criticism, exposed to full inquiry, and utterly ineffectual for any purpose except to raise the question. To enjoin any proceeding under such an agreement simply forbids the statutory remedy and draws the whole inquiry and the ultimate determination of the controversy away from the appointed tribunal. The injunction averts no danger to the plaintiff unless it be the danger of a hearing and decision before the statutory tribunal, and its sole office is to effect that result. It must therefore be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Order of general and special term reversed, with costs in both courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">All the judges concurred, except Andrews and O\u2019Brien, JJ., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">III.

The proceedings in the replevin suit were also set forth. It was-further alleged that the proceedings for consolidation were hindered by respondent\u2019s refusal; that relator has no power to compel said seal to be actually and materially affixed by respondent, and therefore has no means of consummating^, completing and ratifying the acts it directed, nor of preparing and presenting to the court a petition according to law for the consolidation of the two churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The opposing affidavits denied the regularity and legality of the proceedings for consolidation and traversed many of the allegations of the moving papers. They alleged that respondent had the custody of the seal as treasurer by virtue of the by-laws of the corporation, and that no resolution of the-vestry had been passed authorizing or directing him to affix it to the document in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The proceedings in the court of common pleas and the&lt; injunction order were also set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>Andrew J.

Bloomer Hart, rector of the church of St. Stephen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u25a0against James Blackhurst, as treasurer, to compel him to affix the corporate seal to the agreement for consolidation, or to allow the same to be affixed by the clerk of the corporation, \u25a0and to deliver to the relator a statement of the moneys of the corporation, its property, etc. The moving papers were substantially similar to those used on the prior application for a mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><em>Andrew J.

The respondent had a right to consider whether the pretended meeting and resolutions and agreement were lawful and valid, and if they were as he claims unlawful and invalid, it was his duty to disregard them and to refuse to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>bound by them (People <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 64 <em>N.

The whole subject of taking such steps as might be necessary to bring about a consolidation of the two churches was not referred by the vestry to the relater, but to a committee of three. There has been an election, at which ten vestrymen Were elected and took office. Subsequently, in a <em>quo war? Tanto </em>proceeding, seven of such vestrymen were ousted from their offices. It is certainly very doubtful whether the members of the old board, which was succeeded by a new board, are now in office. If they are not, then there are but three vestrymen in office, and those three could not authorize the relator to commence and maintain this proceeding.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">It is not shown that, as rector, the relator has any authority to maintain a proceeding of this kind, and it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>appear that he has ever been authorized, either by the old board of vestrymen, or by the new board, to institute the same. Certainly a stranger to the church could not maintain the proceeding, and, in my opinion, it is exceedingly doubtful whether the rfelator can do. so.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Third. </em>Assuming, however, that the relator, either by virtue of his position as rector, or under authority received from the old board of vestrymen, or the new board, represents the church corporation and the vestrymen, he has not a clear legal right to have the seal affixed to the proposed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The question whether such right does or does not exist depends partly upon the decision of certain questions of law, and partly upon the decision of certain questions of fact. The questions of law are not altogether free from difficulty, but that circumstance presents no reason why the court should not pass upon it. With regard to the questions of fact, the situation is entirely different. In deciding whether or not a writ of mandamus shall issue, the court never undertakes to determine disputed questions of fact upon affidavits. This has been decided so many times that it is now elementary law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The whole foundation of the relator\u2019s claim rests upon the original resolution adopted by the old board of vestrymen, and it is claimed by the respondent that the resolution is absolutely void, because no notice of the object of the meeting at which it was adopted was given. The relator alleges in his papers that such meeting was \u201c duly \u201d held, and the respondent sets up a variety of facts which tend to show that it was not \u201c duly \u201d held. Before this question can be decided evidence must be taken to ascertain what the facts were, because the question of law involved cannot be decided until it is shown whether or not it was necessary to give any notice of the object of the meeting, and, if so, what notice, if any, was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">If the original resolution was not legally adopted the respondent was under no duty to affix the seal to the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>raent, and neither the rector nor the vestrymen, nor the \u2022church, could compel him to do so; and the respondent has the right to have this question determined in the regular ;and ordinary way\u2014the questions of law by the court, and the questions of fact by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Many other important allegations contained in the moving papers are denied in the answering affidavits, and, as \u2022above stated, the circumstance that there is a serious dispute :as to material and important facts is fatal to this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>Even if the questions of law were less doubtful \u2022and the dispute as to the facts were not so serious, I should be disinclined to issue a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring the respondent to affix the seal to the proposed \u2022agreement, at the present time. There is a serious controversy between members of the church as to the wisdom or \u2022desirability of the proposed consolidation So many charges \u2022and countercharges have been made, and the matter has become so complicated, that it is impossible to determine from the paper.! before me what proportion of the members of the \u2022church are in favor of such consolidation. It seems to me that upon the whole merits of the case no further action \u2022should be taken until there has been a fair election. If a majority of the members of the church consider such consolidation desirable, they will undoubtedly elect a board of vestrymen who will take the proceedings necessary to effect the same; if a majority of the members of the church are \u2022opposed to such consolidation, it is difficult to understand why the minority should be allowed to carry it through at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The application for a mandamus will be denied with $10 \u25a0costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>IV.

That the relators and each of them are entitled to the said offices respectively and to assume the execution of the duties of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The defendants interposed the following answer:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\"><em>First. </em>They admit that the rector, church-wardens and vestrymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church of St. Stephen in the city of Hew York is a religious corporation created by and organized under the laws of the State of Hew York, but they have no knowledge of information sufficient to form a belief as to whether it is incorporated under chapter 60 of the Laws of 1813.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Second; They admit that said corporation has its- church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>-edifice in said city on the Forty-sixth street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Third. </em>TJpon information and belief they admit paragraph III. of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">*Fourth. Except as hereinbefore admitted or denied, they -deny each and every allegation in the complaint contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em>Fifth. </em>They allege that on April 7th, 1890, the defendant Weeks and one Charles E. Fleming were duly elected wardens of said church and corporation, to serve as such until Easter Monday, 1891, and until their successors are \u2022elected, and at the same time the defendants Cock, Linen, Edmund Luis Mooney, S. Montgomery Pike and William G. Smith, together with one Charles Schroeder and one William S. Watson, were duly elected vestrymen of said -\u2022church and corporation to serve as such during the term or time aforesaid, and thereupon at the time of said election the rector of said church duly entered the proceedings of such election in the book of the minutes of the vestry of said corporation and signed his name thereto and offered the same to as many of the electors present as he thought fit, who thereupon signed and certified the same and delivered said certificate to the persons aforesaid, including the \u2022defendants, pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided, which entry and \u2022 certificate is in the words and figures following, to wit : On this Monday in Easter week, April 7, 1890, morning prayer was said by the rector and the following gentlemen were duly elected wardens and vestrymen for St. Stephen\u2019s church to serve until Monday in Easter Week, 1890, viz.: For wardens : Stephen B.

Bloomer Hart, the rector of said church, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Wherefore these defendants demand that the complaint be dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The issues were brought to trial at a trial term of the-court before Hon.

Montgomery Pike, $116.69, being the costs and disbursements of this action, and that they have an execution therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">A motion was subsequently made by the plaintiff to fine the defendants under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 1956, whereupon the following decision was rendered :</p>\n<author id=\"b304-6\">J. F. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEJ\">Under the decision in the People v. Nolan (65 <em>How. Pr. </em>468), it is doubtful whether in an ordinary case of contested election, when the incumbents who are ousted hold office by virtue of a regularly issued cerif\u00edcate of election and the contest is with regard to the rejection of proper votes or the reception of improper votes,\u2014the court should impose a fine under section 1956 of the Code. There are cases of intrusion into and unlawful usurpation of office without any color of right or authority in which the imposition of a fine would be eminently proper. A distinction should be made between such cases and th\u00e9 one above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I also deem it proper to leave the question of a new \u25a0election to the court upon the application for a mandamus. The time for holding it can be decided at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Application denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">VI.

Fleming and others, corporators \u25a0and trustees, against A. Bloomer Hart, rector and trustee, for a peremptory mandamus to compel the respondent to join with the relators as trustees in appointing the time for holding an election to supply the vacancy in the office of ch\u00farchwarden and six vacancies in the offices of vestrymen, and in giving notice of such election, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The petition for the writ, after reciting the various proceedings hereinbefore reported, alleged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">That on the evening of June 20, 1890, the said Charles E. Fleming, a church-warden and a trustee of said church, \u25a0and one of the relators, gave notice in writing to said Hart, the rector and a trustee of said church, and to the relators William S. Watson and Charles Schroeder, trustees of said -church, that a meeting of the trustees of said church would be held in the vestry-room of the church on the evening of \u25a0June 23, 1890, at 8 o\u2019clock p. m., for the purpose of appointing a time for holding an election to supply the vacancy in the office of church-warden and the six vacancies in the \u25a0offices of vestrymen of said church.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">That the said Hart, on receiving said notice from the hand \u25a0of the relator Fleming, stated to the relators Fleming and Watson that he would not attend the meeting therein referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">That the said Hart, on receiving said notice from the hand of the relator Fleming, stated to the relators Fleming and Watson substantially that he would not join in calling an election to fill said vacancies unless required so to do by \u25a0a* mandamus or order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>That on Monday evening, June 23, 1890, at or soon after 8 o\u2019clock p. m., pursuant to said notice, the relatorsattended at the vestry-ioom in said church of St. Stephen, and after waiting there one-half hour or thereabouts, for the-coming of said Hart, and the said Hart having appeared at <em>8 </em>o\u2019clock, but having refused to take part in said meeting in the vestry-room, the relators adjourned from the said vestry-room in said church to meet at once at the residence of said Hait, 43 West Forty-seventh street, and they together re tired at once to the residence of said Hart, and there-called upon him and requested him as rector and a trustee to join in their meeting then being held, which he refused to do, and thereupon the relators requested said Hart to join with them in appointing a time for holding an election to-supply such vacancies, which the said Hart refused to do, and they then presented to said Hart a certain notice in-writing signed by them and by others who were members of the church, appointing a time for holding an election to supply such vacancies, a copy of which is hereto annexed,, and they requested said Hart to sign his name to the same and thus join with them in appointing a time for holding; said election to supply said vacancies, all of which the said Hart refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">That at the meeting held in the said vestry-room of the church, on the evening of June 23, 1890, the defendant. Hart, the rector, having refused to remain and take part in the meeting and act as presiding officer, the relator, Charles-E. Fleming, as one of the church-wardens, presided over the meeting, and the relator Charles Schroeder was thereupon chosen secretary of said meeting. The relators, in view of the vacancies existing in the vestry of said church, believing it to be essential for the best interests of the church that such vacancies should be filled, resolved that a special election should be appointed by the trustees for July 9,, 1890, to fill such vacancies, and that notice should be given of such special election in due form on Sunday, June 29, 1890, and on Sunday, July 6, 1890, in accordance* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>with the statute and by-laws of said church, and the relators thereupon signed the aforesaid notice appointing the said \u2022special election and thereafter adjourned as aforesaid to the house of the said defendant, the rector Hart, in order to induce him, if possible, to take part in said meeting and join with them in said action and notice appointing the \u2022said special meeting; that certain of the members of the \u2022\u2022church and congregation happened at the time of said meeting to be present in the church, three of them, to wit, James Blackhnrst, James Maelaury and Hobart B. Jacobs, being \u2022members of the vestry elected at the annual election in the year 1889, and that the said persons, desiring that said special election should be held and the said vacancies filled, requested leave to sign said notice appointing said special election and were permitted so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">That the defendant, Hart, has been and is greatly interested in promoting and consummating a scheme whereby the said church of St. Stephen is to be consolidated with the Holy Trinity church at One Hundred and Twenty-second \u25a0street and Lenox avenue, Harlem, four miles distant from the church of St. Stephen, and whereby all the valuable property of the said church of St. Stephen is to be turned \u2022over to the said Holy Trinity church, without any consideration therefor, and whereby the aforesaid church edifice \u2022of St. Stephen is to be sold and discontinued as a place of worship of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and the congregation of said church is to be dissipated and scattered, whereby the defendant, Hart, is to be made rector <em>emeritus </em>\u25a0of the newly-consolidated and more important church, and is to have his salary increased from $1,800 per annum to -$2,500 per annum for life and to be relieved of the active duties and responsibilities of his present rectorshipthat the \u2022said Hart has been using his utmost endeavors to bring about and consummate such scheme of consolidation ; in \u25a0order to further said scheme, as rector of said church, the \u2022said Hart called a special meeting of the vestry of the church of St. Stephen and carefully suppressed and concealed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>misrepresented the objects and purposes of said meeting-from almost all the members of said vestry, and with others-refused to permit an adjournment of said special meeting or time for consideration of said proposed scheme of consolidation, and insisted upon urging and enforcing the said scheme through such vestry meeting, without proper and reasonable-opportunity for discussion and consideration, and contrary to the wishes of one half of the members of the then vestry of the church and of a large majority of the congregation of' the church of St. Stephen; that thereafter the said Hart wilfully refused to perform the duty clearly prescribed by the statute for giving notice of the annual election of tliechurch, to be held on April 7, 1890,'and persisted in his-refusal, until he was compelled to give such notice .by a. peremptory writ of mandamus issued out of the supreme-court; that the said Hart presided at such election and wilfully refused to receive the votes of at least four legally qualified electors of said church, said voters all being strongly-opposed and known to said Hart to be opposed to his scheme-of consolidation; that at the said election sixteen votes, were offered for the ticket for church-wardens and vestrymen, composed of those who were opposed to the said Hart\u2019s-aforesaid scheme of consolidation, and eight votes were offered for those in favor of the said Hart\u2019s scheme of consolidation, twenty-four votes having been offered in allj; that the said Hart admitted all the votes offered in favor of' his said ticket, although certain of them were duly challenged for good cause, and refused to receive and count ten of the-votes offered for the ticket which was opposed to his aforesaid scheme of consolidation, and wrongfully and falsely declared that certain persons named on the ticket favoring-his said scheme of consolidation had been elected ; that the relators thoroughly believe and charge that the said Hart\u2019s; refusal to join with them in appointing a special election to fill said vacancies and to give due notice of said special election is a part of his said plan and purpose to promote- and consummate his said scheme of consolidation, whereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>he is to be greatly benefited personally and pecuniarily; that it is very important for the interests of the church of St. Stephen, of which the relators are members and duly qualified electors, that the vacancies should be filled without delay, as certain of the property of the church is in danger of being wasted and lost, unless such vacancies are filled and a vestry properly constituted to protect the said property and transact the business of the church ; that in view of the pressing importance of having the special election occur as fixed in the said notice at an early day, the relators desire an order requiring said defendant to show cause, returnable in less than eight days, why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue out of this court directed to the said defendant, A. Bloomer Hart, directing and requiring him to join with the other trustees in appointing said special election and to give due notice of said election (should he be present) in accordance with the said statute and the by-laws of said church, and for the granting of such other relief as mentioned in the order applied for.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><em>Daniel G.

The duty of the rector is to join in the call for a special election.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">III. If it is the duty of an officer to call a meeting for the election of new officers, and if he neglects or refuses to do so, the court should, by a peremptory writ of mandamus, compel him to perform his duty (People <em>v. </em>Cummings, 72 <em>N. </em>Y. 433; Robertson <em>v. </em>Bullions, 11 <em>Id. </em>243; Gram <em>v. </em>Prussia, 36 <em>Id. </em>161; People\u2019s Bk. <em>v. </em>St. Anthony\u2019s Church, 109 <em>Id. </em>520; People <em>v. </em>Steele, 2 <em>Barb. </em>397; People <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc. of N.

Shepard, Esq., to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u25a0supervise and superintend a new election of the board of officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The order entered upon this decision was settled in the \u25a0following form: \u201c Ordered that the said motion be granted \u00a1and that a peremptory writ of mandamus issue out of and under the seal of this court directed to the said defendant, .A. Bloomer Hart, as rector and trustee of the said corporation, the rector, church-wardens and vestrymen of the Protestant Episcopal church of St. Stephen in the city of New York, commanding him to join with the relators as trustees of the said corporation, in appointing a time for holding a \u25a0special election to supply the vacancy in the office of churchwarden and the six vacancies in the offices of vestrymen in -said church, and directing that the said trustees, to wit, the relators and the defendant, appoint Wednesday, July 23, 1890, at 10 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, and immediately after the morning service in said church, as the time, and the -church edifice of the said church, on Forty-sixth street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues in the city of New York, as the place, for the holding of said special election; and \u25a0directing that the defendant join with the relators in giving notice of such election to occur on July 23, 1890, as afore- \u25a0 said ; and directing that the defendant give said notice of -said special election in the time of divine service on Sunday, \u25a0July 13, 1890, and on Sunday, July 20, 1890, if hg be present at such service, and that if present at said election, he, the defendant, shall in all things relating thereto act under the supervision and superintendence of Edward M. Shepard, Esq., the referee hereinafter appointed, and commanding the \u25a0defendant to do and perform such other and further act or -acts as may be useful and proper in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201c And it is further ordered, that it be referred to Edward M. Shepard, Esq., of the city of New York, to see that \u25a0said' peremptory writ of mandamus is fully obeyed, and to be and act as inspector of such election and the judge of the \u25a0qualification of voters thereat, to supervise and superintend -the same, and to see to it that said election is fairly held and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>conducted in all respects in accordance with the law, and that, the said defendant, if he shall preside at such election, shall receive and count all lawful votes offered thereat, and shall reject all unlawful votes thereat offered, and that the said referee shall have power to administer oaths to, and examine persons offering to vote at said election, and to adjourn the said election at any stage of the same to a time to be specified and announced by him, if in his discretion such adjournment shall be needful, expedient and just, and to report his. proceedings and all matters relating to the conduct of such election to this court with all convenient speed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The respondent subsequently moved for a stay of proceedings under the writ and order, which came on for hearing on July 22, 1890. Such stay was granted until the. hearing and determination of an appeal to the general term from such order and writ, the following opinion being-rendered:</p>\n<author id=\"b312-6\">Bookstaver, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAqE\">On the argument of the motion for a. stay it was contended that the chief judge had passed upon this question when the mandamus proceedings were argued \u00e1nd submitted to him, but there is nothing in the papers to which my attention has been called from which I think it can be fairly inferred that he did pass upon that question. There is certainly nothing to show that he refused to grant, a stay. The motion is made under section 2089 of the Code,, which provides that the proceedings upon a writ of mandamus granted at special term may be stayed, etc. The counsel for the defendant contends that the relators have no. standing in court and cannot maintain the mandamus proceedings for the reason that they had no power to call a special election, and therefore what they did on June 23, 1890, was without jurisdiction and void; that the absence-of the rector from the meeting of June 23, 1890, at which, the alleged resolution calling for the election was passed, renders it and all proceedings thereunder void; that this court cannot mandamus the defendant to join in the call for-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the special election, nor compel him to give notice of the-proposed election; that the relators who passed the resolution were not elected at the election held on April 17, 1890,. and therefore do not constitute any part of the vestry by virtue of that election; that the old vestry holds over and continues in office notwithstanding the election of the three relators, because it is impossible, as he claims, to designate the three persons they succeed; that the election of April 17, 1890, being called for the choice of eight vestrymen and two wardens, and there being a failure to elect that number,, the whole of the old vestry hold over; that by reason thereof there is nti vacancy to be filled at the proposed new election; that the order granted by the chief judge presents-novel questions of law which ought to be determined before the mandamus is executed ; that the appointment of .a referee to supervise the election, either conjointly with the rector or to control him in his action, is without authority and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Some of these questions are of great importance, and are-certainly debatable, and I think should be finally determined before any further complications arise respecting the union of the two churches. On a review\u2019of this order by the general term and by the court of appeals, if necessary, many of the questions raised by the defendants\u2019 counsel can be finally and definitely settled in a much more expeditious manner than if the court compelled the election to proceed at this time, which, I fear, would only lay the foundation for another <em>quo wa/rrcmto </em>action, and involve all parties in further-litigation. In my judgment it is to the interest of all parties that proceedings upon the order and mandamus granted by the chief judge should be stayed at least until the appeal can be heard and determined by the general term of this, court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>NOTE ON THE POWER OF THE COURT TO ENFORCE AND SUPERINTEND THE PROPER EXECUTION OF ITS ADJUDICATIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The contrast between chancery and courts of common law although more commonly defined as existing in questions of jurisdiction, is quite as striking when we compare the difference between what chancery could do in the execution of its orders and decrees, through masters in chancery, receivers, .and managers, and what the courts of common law could do through the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"Ase\">blow that common law courts are vested with equity powers, the distinction may be of diminishing importance, but the powers and the proper method of their exercise are of increasing importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The precedents below given are from recent well considered cases, and illustrate and sanction the proper procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The case in the text affords another important instance of the application of the same general principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">I. <em>A receiver may be </em>appointed, <em>ancillary to a foreign liquidator.

Each of the said corporations may make its separate petition to the supreme court in the judicial district in which such corporations are situated, for an order for such union and consolidation; setting forth in such petition the reason for such union and consolidation, the agreement made as hereinbefore provided, and a statement of all its property, real and personal, all its debts and liabilities, and the amount and sources of its annual income. Upon such petition, from each of such corporations so proposing to be united and consolidated, and upon the said agreement satisfactorily proved or certified, the supreme court may, in case it shall deem it proper, make an order for the union and consolidation of such corporations, determining all the terms and conditions and provisions thereof. All parties interested therein may be heard on such petition. When such order is made and entered according to the practice of the court, the said corporations shall be united and consolidated into one corporation by the name designated in the order, and it shall have all the rights and powers, \u25a0and be subject to all the obligations of religious corporations under the .act to which this is supplementary, and the acts, amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\"> The order entered upon this decision was \u2018 \u2018 without prejudice to the-right of the relator to renew said application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\">It has heretofore been the law that a majority of the body or board, duly assembled, are a quorum; and a majority of such a quorum may perform a corporate act. 1 E. S. 599, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The general corporation law, L. 1890, p. 1063, c. 563, \u00a7 17 (to take effect May 1, 1891), obscures if it does not change this rule. That section reads as follows : When the corporate powers of any corporation are to be exercised by any particular body or number of persons, a majority of such body or persons, if it be not otherwise provided by law, shall be a quorum ; and every decision of a majority of such persons duly assembled as a board, shall be valid as a corporate act.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">If the phrase \u201c a majority of <em>such </em>persons,\u201d means a majority of the \"whole number, it might be contended, perhaps, that a corporate act required the votes as well as the presence of a majority of the members : it being at the time of this revision a disputed question in parliamentary law whether the language of the United States Constitution does not bear this implication in respect to the quorum and majority vote of the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The language of the Revised Statutes was clear. It is not clear that the more condensed expression of the new act was intended to change the rule ; and a familiar principle of interpretation therefore discourages the inference that a change was intended.

This form, is from Matter of Tiebout, 19 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>570, where it was held that the authority of the court to-compel a receiver of the assets of a corporation to allow a creditor of such corporation to make extracts from the corporation books, does not rest on the technical rights of a stockholder or creditor, as between, himself and the corporation, under the statutes relating to corporations, but upon grounds of justice and equity in administering the trust in. the hands of the receiver, and the granting or refusing an application. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>for that purpose is within the discretion of the court. And that upon this petition, supported by the affidavit of the attorney, it was error to, refuse to grant it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
