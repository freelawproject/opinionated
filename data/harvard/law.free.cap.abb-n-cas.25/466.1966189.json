Newburger, it appeared that they were a committee of the county democracy of the city and county of New York, appointed to secure the representation of that organization in the appointment of election inspectors in each election district in the .city of New York; that the county democracy had been, for more than nine years prior, a political organization, and had supported the candidates of the democratic party for State offices, and had participated by its delegates in the State conventions of that party, and that by the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u25a0and practice of the conventions of that party in this State during the past ten years, the representation of the city and -county of New York in the State and national conventions, and the State and national committees, had been equally divided between the county democracy and another democratic organization known as Tammany Hall, and that since 1879 the police board had been accustomed to appoint one inspector of election for each election district for the county \u25a0democracy and one for Tammany Hall, dividing the election inspectors appointed to represent the democratic party in the State equally between the two political organizations; and the relators alleged that the request of the organization made orally and in writing to the respondents, the police 'Commissioners, that they should appoint from the organization one-half of the democratic inspectors and other election officers throughout the city for the election of 1890, had been tabled; that the respondents had appointed two election inspectors in each district from the members of the republican party and were about to appoint the remaining inspector and other election officers from the members of the democratic party who were not members of the county democracy, \u2022and that the respondent, Voorhis, claimed that one-half of \u2019the democratic election inspectors should be appointed from the so-called Voorhis democracy, excluding the county \u2022democracy from consideration, and that the so-called Voorhis \u25a0democracy intended to support the county ticket of Tammany Hall at the election.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">Petitioners therefore asked for a peremptory mandamus requiring the police commissioners to appoint from the members of the county democracy one inspector of elections for the year 1890 for each election district, or in the alternative, directing them to recognize the members of the county democracy as members of the democratic party, and as such entitled to consideration in each election district in the said city in the selection and appointment of inspectors of election and other election officers for the year 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">The affidavit of the respondents in opposition, alleged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>appointment of two republican election inspectors in each district and averred that they \u201c in good faith intended to-obey the statute by selecting two other inspectors of election of different political faith and opinions from their associates, on State issues, namely, from the members of the democratic-party which is the party in majority on State issues in the city and county of New York,\u201d and \u201cin good faith to make such selection of inspectors from the democracy as a whole; as to ensure a just and fair representation of every part of said party,\u201d and \u201c that in consequence of local divisions within the democratic party and the presentation of names of persons as candidates for the position of election inspector from each of such divisions, there are at least three candidates named to the board of police for each inspectorship, and the deponents aver each for himself that it is his intention <em>\u2018 </em>to look at the democratic party with a view to its relation to State issues as a general organization and as a whole and to select from it without respect to local divisions, temporary or permanent, competent and proper men to perform the duty of inspectors.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-5\"><em>Roger Foster </em>and <em>Charles A. </em>Jackson, <em>(Foster &amp; </em>Ackley,, attorneys) for the relators.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acm\">The court is bound by the action, of the last State convention. In re Appointment of Supervisors of Election (9 <em>Fed. R. </em>14) no prior demand wras necessary before the application for mandamus (State <em>v. </em>Common Council of Rahway, 4 <em>Vroom [N. J.] </em>110). The objection to the want of previous demand and refusal may be deemed waived in view of the grounds on which the mandamus is. opposed (People <em>ex rel. </em>Wetmore <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 34 <em>How. Pr. </em>379, 383). The conduct of the commissioners in refusing to take action upon the request of the relators amounts to a refusal (People <em>ex rel. </em>Wetmore <em>v. </em>Supervisors, <em>supra; </em>Queen <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 8 <em>Ad. &amp; El. </em>901, note). It is. not necessary that there should have been a refusal in so many words (King <em>v. </em>Proprietors, 3 <em>Ad. &amp; El. </em>217; Queen <em>v. </em>Select Vestrymen, 8 <em>Ad. &amp; El. </em>889). As to the construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tion of the act of 1872, see People <em>ex rel. </em>McMackin <em>v. </em>Board of Police, 107 <em>N. Y. </em>235; 46 <em>Hun, </em>296, 677.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-5\"><em>W. Bourke Cockran </em>and <em>William H. Clark </em>(corporation \u2022\u25a0counsel) for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b515-6\">Lawrence, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADW\">The object of the act of 1872<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was to \u2022secure to each of the political parties of the State, differing \u2022on State issues, one-half of the number of inspectors to be \u2022appointed in each election district. The only way in which it can be determined whether an organization belongs to \u2022either of the political parties, is by ascertaining whether that \u2022organization has been recognized as such by the State committee and State convention of that party. It appears from 'the moving papers, and has not been denied, that the organization called the New York County Democracy has been -\u2022accorded, for several years past, one-half of the entire representation in the conventions, and is even now so represented 'in the State committee of the democracy of the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The amendment to the law in 1887, allowing a fifth inspector to be appointed, only applies to cases in which any \u2022political party or organization has cast for its candidate for \u2022any office as many as fifty thousand votes or upwards at the next preceding municipal election, and such organization was not entitled to representation under the former act. \"The third democratic organization, which has been referred \u2022to upon the argument in this matter, has never cast any votes, nor entered as an organization into any canvass or election, or shown that it represents any democratic voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">I think, therefore, that the principles enunciated by the .general term of this department in People <em>ex rel. </em>Van Wyck <em>v. </em>Wheeler,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> etc. (18 <em>Hun, </em>540, at p. 550), require me to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>grant the mandamus applied for, directing that one-half of the inspectors* * be selected by the county democracy. In the opinion in that case, the court very clearly states that if improper appointments be made, the court could not interfere by any summary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Let a writ be issued in accordance with these views.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> Ch. 675, \u00a7 13, same statute, Consolidation Act of N.
