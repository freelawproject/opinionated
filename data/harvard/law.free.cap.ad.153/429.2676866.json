Finigan, Appellant, <em>v. </em>The Board of Education of the City of New York, Respondent.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b487-5\">Second Department,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AlX\">November 15, 1912.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-6\">Municipal corporation \u2014 school teacher, city of New York\u2014suit to recover balance of salary \u2014 res adjudicata\u2014prior determination in mandamus proceedings.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-7\">It is a good defense to an action brought by a public school teacher in- the city of New York against the board of education to recover a balance of salary claimed to be due, to allege that there was a final adjudication upon the merits on a prior proceeding of mandamus brought by the plaintiff to compel the defendant to reinstate her in the same employment which she claims to have held during the period and for the same services.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-8\">A public school teacher in said city holds no office, but her relation with the board of education is contractual, she being an employee.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">Appeal by the plaintiff, Rose M.

J., Burr, Thomas, Woodward and Rich, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The following is the opinion delivered at Special Term:</p>\n<author id=\"b487-15\">Maddox, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Plaintiff seeks to recover an alleged unpaid balance of salary as a school teacher, which balance is the difference between that which she received and that which she claims to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>been entitled to as an incident to her said employment from January 1, 1903, to July 1, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\"The defendant, after denying its liability, by a separate and special defense pleads in bar to plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery here the final determination upon the merits of a proceeding instituted by her. as the relator for an alternative writ of mandamus commanding her reinstatement by the defendant to the same employment' she now claims to have held during the aforesaid period of time, for the services in which said employment she here seeks to recover said unpaid balance of salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Plaintiff demurs to said separate defense on the ground that \u201c it is insufficient in law upon the face thereof,\u201d and her counsel cites <em>Steinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(49 App. Div. 143; affd., 165 N. Y. 431) as conclusive on that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Plaintiff held no office; her relation as school teacher with the defendant was contractual, that of an employee, though as an employee the school teacher\u2019s rights are protected by statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">. There can be no doubt, I take it, that a final determination upon the merits in a mandamus proceeding concludes the parties thereto upon all material issues involved therein, for as said in <em>People ex rel. McCabe </em>v. <em>Matthies </em>(179 N. Y. 242, 248), \u201cit is well established that where a matter has been submitted to an authorized judicial tribunal, its decision is final between the parties until it has been reversed, set aside or rejected; and the rule of <em>res adjudicata </em>applies to all judicial determinations, whether made in actions, or in summary or special proceedings, or by judicial officers in matters properly submitted for their determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Referring to the separate defense here under consideration it will be seen that defendant alleges that the fin\u00e1l determination in plaintiff\u2019s alternative writ of mandamus proceeding was upon the merits and consequently all questions here which were material to and determined in that proceeding <em>are.res adjudicata </em>as between the parties in that proceeding who are the parties to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">. The views here expressed are not in conflict with the holding in the <em>Steinson </em>case, since in the Steinson mandamus proceeding, an application for a peremptory writ, the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>was not on the merits, but on the ground of the relator\u2019s laches (See <em>People ex rel. Steinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>158 N. Y. 127, 128); and in the <em>Steinson </em>case (165 id. 431) Judge Landon, speaking for the court (at p. 434), said: \u201c Mandamus would not lie as of strict right, and might be refused in the discretion of the court; hence the former denial of that remedy [referring to the mandamus proceeding] does not bar the present action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">From a careful consideration of the complaint and answer it appears that plaintiff\u2019s status as a school teacher will be one of the questions presented in this litigation and if that be so the special defense is sufficiently well pleaded and the demurrer should, therefore, be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Judgment accordingly for defendant, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
