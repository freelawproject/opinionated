On May 31, 1961, the Commission, Division 2, filed its Report, Commissioner Freas dissenting, finding that the proposed rate was not shown to be just and reasonable, without prejudice to the establishment of a rate of $4.99. The Commission accordingly entered an order requiring the proposed schedules of the rail carriers to be cancelled. On September 25, 1961, the Commission, Division 2, acting as an appellate division, denied the petition of the rail carriers for reeonsideration and in effect ordered its decision carried out, effective November 10, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">The rail carriers thereupon filed the present complaint on November 6, 1961, seeking to set aside the Commission\u2019s order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">On plaintiff\u2019s motion we granted a preliminary restraining order on November 6, 1961, which the parties permitted to expire on November 16, 1961, because in the meanwhile, on November 14, 1961, the Commission postponed the effective date of its decision.until further order. The case now is before us on final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">The report of the Commission enters in some detail upon the items which go to make up the charge in each mode of shipment. It is not necessary, however, to review these factors, for it is evident from the report of the Commission that $4.61 is the fair and reasonable rate unless there should be added to it the charge of 38 cents, consisting of 28 cents for switching at point of origin and 9.7 cents for weighing at point of origin (the total of which the parties have described generally as 38 cents).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-19\">It is clear beyond doubt from the Commission\u2019s report that the charges for switching and weighing at point of origin, totalling 38 cents, have been absorbed by the shipper. (Report of Commission, pp. 9, 12.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The Commission expressly found that \u201cthe proposed rate appears to be compensatory\u201d. (Report of Commission, p. 10). Since this is so, there is no reason for cancelling the proposed schedule, as the Commission did. Manifestly, under the circumstances which would prevail under the Commission\u2019s order \u2014 i. e., a charge of $4.99 by the rail carriers \u2014 the shipment of pig iron from Neville Island, Pa., to Louisville, Ky., would continue to be made by barge lines exclusively because of the advantage which they have liad in the absorption by the shipper of \u00b1he charges of 38 cents for switching and weighing at point of origin. The consignee, who controls the manner of shipment, will not select a rail carrier when toy doing so it will incur an additional charge of 38 cents. The proof of this obvious fact lies in the experience of the parties during the period from April 15 to October 15, 1959, when the rate by rail carrier was $4.72 and the rate by barge line was $4.78. During that time the rail carriers failed to obtain any of the traffic. They are not participating in any of it now (Report of Commission, p. 12), and substantially all of the traffic has moved over the barge lines for some years. (Report of Commission, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The artificial increase of the rail carriers\u2019 rate to $4.99 by adding the charges of 38 cents could be justified only if their proposed rate of $4.61 was a destructive .competitive practice contrary to the National Transportation Policy. The 1958 amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act embodied in \u00a7 15a(3) (49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15a(3)), provides: \u201cIn a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes of transportation * * * the Commission, in determining whether a rate is lower than a reasonable minimum rate, shall consider the facts and circumstances attending the movement of the traffic by the carrier or carriers to which the rate is applicable. Rates of a carrier shall not be held up to <em>a </em>particular level to protect the traffic of .any other mode of transportation, giving due consideration to the objectives of the national transportation policy declared in this' chapter and chapters 8, 12,13 and 19 of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We follow the view of Circuit Judge Hincks in New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, 199 F.Supp. 635, 642 (D.C.Conn.1961), that the intention of Congress in adopting the 1958 amendment was that rates of the carrier should not be held up to a particular level to protect the traffic of another mode of transportation unless this would be contrary to the National Transportation Policy because of a \u201cdestructive competitive practice\u201d, such as the setting of rates so low as to be harmful to the proponent as well as his competitor, or would deprive a competitor of the \u201cinherent advantage\u201d of being the low-cost carrier (supra, p. 642). Here the Commission itself found that there were no factors present of \u201cdestructive competitive practice\u201d or of \u201cinherent advantage\u201d. In fact, it found to the contrary. As to \u201cdestructive competitive practice\u201d, the Commission expressly found that \u201c * * * it is not established * * * that the protestants can not compete as total charges equal to those by rail.\u201d (Report of Commission, p. 12.) As to the \u201cinherent advantage\u201d factor, the Commission rejected the claim that it was established. Thus it stated: \u201cFrom the evidence presented, because of incomplete cost data over the respondents\u2019 routes and the absence of actual operating costs over the complete routes of the protestants, we are unable to determine which constitutes the low-cost mode of transportation for this traffic.\u201d (Report of Commission, p. 9.) Again: \u201cAs stated, it is not established that the rail-water-rail movement is the low-cost mode * * we are persuaded that there is no sound basis for a finding that a differential under the rail rate is required to permit the barge lines to compete effectively for this traffic.\u201d (Report of Commission, p. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In view of the failure of the barge lines to establish a basis under \u00a7 15a(3) for holding up the rates and eliminating the differential between them, the command of that section re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>quires the conclusion that' the rail carriers\u2019 rate \u201cshall not be held up to a particular level to protect the traffic\u201d of the barge lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Accordingly we will enter an order permanently enjoining the operation, enforcement and execution of the orders of the Commission dated May 31 and September 25,1961. The parties will submit an appropriate form of order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">.

The Commission\u2019s report specifically states: \u201cPresently, it [International Harvester Company] is the only Louisville receiver of the consignor\u2019s pig iron.\u201d The report goes on to say: \u201cIt appears, however, that inquiry has been made concerning barge-line shipments in the future to the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation at Louisville.\u201d Nothing is said, however, as to the possible effect of such inquiry or how serious it may have been. (p. 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">. The original rate proposed was $4.41. Because of an increase in barge line rates of 20 cents in the interval between the original proposal and the hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the proposed rate was increased to $4.61 and was so considered by all parties and the Commission. (See Report of Commission, p. 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-21\">. The rate is based on pig iron moved in single shipments of not less than 600' gross tons, minimum 140,000 pounds per car, on one bill of lading, from one consignor at one origin to one consignee at one destination on one day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-22\">.
