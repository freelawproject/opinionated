J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmHH\">Aliso Viejo Company owns a 6,623-acre property that occupies a significant portion of southwest Orange County near Laguna Beach. On this land, the company proposes to build a new city, Aliso Viejo, with a population of possibly 60,000 persons. A precondition to this massive development is the amendment of the Orange County General Plan for that area. And, before the general plan can be amended, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that an adequate environmental impact report (EIR) be prepared. An EIR concerning the amendment of the general plan was submitted to and approved by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, who then adopted the proposed amendment. Appellants sought a writ of mandate to annul the approval of the EIR and the adoption of the amendment. The writ was denied and appellants have appealed, claiming that the EIR is legally insufficient and that the board of supervisors failed to make required findings prior to adopting the amendment. We find the EIR to be sufficient, but reverse because the board\u2019s findings are inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Sufficiency of EIR</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">As this court recently stated in <em>Santiago County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 822-823 [173 Cal.Rptr. 602], \u201cAn express purpose of CEQA is that state agencies give \u2018major consideration\u2019 to preventing damage to the environment when conducting their regulatory functions. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000, subd. (g).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To accomplish this, an environmental impact report is required to be written prior to a project\u2019s approval. (\u00a7\u00a7 21100, 21151.) The EIR identifies significant effects of a project on the environment, the way those effects can be mitigated or avoided, and the alternatives to the project. (\u00a7 21002.1, subd. (a).) It is \u2018an informational document which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>... will inform public decision-makers and the general public of the environmental effects of projects they propose to carry out or approve.\u2019 (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 15012.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The EIR has been referred to as \u2018the heart of CEQA\u2019 and as \u2018an environmental \u201calarm bell\u201d whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return.\u2019 <em>(County of Inyo </em>v. <em>Yorty </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810 [108 Cal.Rptr. 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the [board of supervisors\u2019 actions], we are limited to deciding \u2018whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion ... [which] is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 (\u00a7 21168.5.) Thus, we do \u2018not pass upon the correctness of the EIR\u2019s environmental conclusions, but only upon its sufficiency as an informative document.\u2019 <em>(County of Inyo </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 189 [139 Cal.Rptr. 396].) However, we must be satisfied that the [board] has fully complied with the procedural requirements of CEQA, because only in this way \u2018can a subversion of the important public purposes of CEQA be avoided.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>County of Kern </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 842 [115 Cal.Rptr. 67].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">We further stated in <em>Santiago </em>that \u201cthe ultimate decision of whether to approve a project, be that decision right or wrong, is a nullity if based upon an EIR that does not provide the decision-makers, and the public, with the information about the project that is required by CEQA.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 829.) In the present case, petitioners contend that the EIR for the amendment of the county\u2019s general plan is inadequate in that the EIR does not evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the proposed amendment and that it does not discuss the environmental impacts which could occur should any of several assumptions in the EIR fail to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">One of the required features of an EIR is a \u201cdetailed statement setting forth ... [alternatives to the proposed project.\u201d (\u00a7 21100, subd. (d).) The Guidelines state that \u201call reasonable alternatives\u201d should be described, including the \u201cno project\u201d alternative. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15143, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>Prior to the amendment at issue here, the land use element of the general plan allowed for just over 10,000 dwelling units to be developed over about 1,310 acres of the Aliso Viejo property. After the adoption of the amendment, over 28,000 dwelling units may be developed over 2,472 acres. The company plans to build 20,000 dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The EIR discusses four alternatives to the 20,000 dwelling unit proposal of the company. The first is the \u201cno development\u201d alternative, which the Guidelines expressly require to be examined. This alternative would maintain the property in its present condition of having only four residences and of being used for barley production and cattle grazing. The second alternative discussed is the maintenance of the prior land use element which allowed just over 10,000 dwelling units. The third is described as the \u201clow density\u201d alternative, which calls for 7,500 dwelling units. The fourth alternative is a \u201chigh density\u201d plan envisioning 25,000 dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Appellants\u2019 claim of inadequacy is based on the failure of the EIR to consider as an alternative the development of \u201csome number\u201d of dwelling units between the 10,000 authorized by the prior land use element and the 20,000 proposed by the company. Appellants contend that this omission is significant, because the development of an intermediate number of homes is the most obvious alternative. Indeed, they point to a proposal that was made by one member of the board of supervisors that only 16,000 dwelling units be authorized. We conclude, however, that the EIR evaluation of plans for the development of 0, 7,500, 10,000, 20,000, and 25,000 dwelling units was sufficient to satisfy the informational goal of CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">In the present case, there are literally thousands of \u201creasonable alternatives\u201d to the proposed project. Certainly, if the building of 0 and 25,000 homes are reasonable alternatives to the proposed 20,000 dwelling unit plan, then the building of 1,000, 16,000, 22,500, and 20,001 homes are reasonable alternatives. But, no one would argue that the EIR is insufficient for failure to describe the 20,001 home alternative.  Thus, as both the California and federal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>courts have recognized, \u201c[t]he statutory requirements for consideration of alternatives must be judged against a rule of reason.\u201d <em>(Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 893, 910 [165 Cal.Rptr. 401]; see also <em>Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Com. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 274, 286 [152 Cal.Rptr. 585]; <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. </em>v. <em>NRDC </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 519, 551 [55 L.Ed.2d 460, 483, 98 S.Ct. 1197]; <em>Coalition For Canyon Preservation </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 632 F.2d 774, 783.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">It is significant that no claims of deficiencies are made concerning the discussions of the four alternatives that were considered in the EIR. Therefore, it must be assumed that decision-makers and the public could make an informed comparison of the environmental effects of those various plans. It is not then unreasonable to conclude that an alternative not discussed in the EIR could be intelligently considered by studying the adequate descriptions of the plans that are discussed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This EIR should \u201cnot become vulnerable because it fails to consider in detail each and every conceivable variation of the alternatives stated.\u201d <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 17, 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201cAbsolute perfection is not required; what is required is the production of information sufficient to permit, a reasonable choice of alternatives so far as environmental aspects are concerned.\u201d <em>(Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p. 910.) The requirement has been fulfilled here.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Appellants further fault the EIR for making assumptions about the proposed project but failing to consider the environmental effects should any of those assumptions prove erroneous. Specifically, they note the following assumptions: (1) that the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor, which would bisect Aliso Viejo and would serve as one of \u201cthe primary access routes linking coastal and southern areas with inland and northern points,\u201d will be built; (2) that the Greenbelt, which encompasses \u201c[o]ver one-half of the total acreage of the project, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>ing some of the more important physical, biological and scientific/ cultural resources,\u201d will be preserved; and (3) that 25 percent of the proposed 20,000 dwelling units will be affordable housing units.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Appellants are asking more of the EIR than is legally required. The \u201cassumptions\u201d referred to are actually integral portions of the proposed project. If they fail to become reality (e.g., if the transportation corridor is not built), we are dealing with a different project. However, CEQA only requires that an EIR discuss \u201c[t]he significant environmental effects of <em>the proposed project.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 21100, subd. (a), italics added.) The proposed project, which includes the transportation corridor, a preserved Greenbelt and 25 percent affordable housing, <em>was </em>evaluated in the EIR. CEQA requires nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Significantly, CEQA has anticipated in another context the situation about which appellants now express concern. Section 21166 requires a subsequent or supplemental EIR to be prepared if major revisions of the original EIR are required by \u201c(a) Substantial changes [which] are proposed in the project\u201d or by \u201c(b) Substantial changes [which] occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken.\u201d (See also Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15067, 15067.5.) The future occurrence or nonoccurrence of the \u201cassumptions\u201d therefore does not affect the sufficiency of the present EIR, but rather is relevant in determining whether a subsequent or supplemental EIR should be prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We find support for this position in the federal cases that discuss whether an environmental impact statement (EIS) for a proposed project must also evaluate the environmental effects of related projects. The Supreme Court has held that such is not necessary if the related project has only been contemplated, but not proposed. The court stated, \u201cThe statute [National Environmental Policy Act] . .. speaks solely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>terms of <em>proposed </em>actions; it does not require an agency to consider the possible environmental impacts of less imminent actions when preparing the impact statement on proposed actions. Should contemplated actions later reach the stage of actual proposals, impact statements on them will take into account the effect of their approval upon the existing environment .. ..\u201d <em>(Kleppe </em>v. <em>Sierra Club </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 390, 410, fn. 20 [49 L.Ed.2d 576, 590, 96 S.Ct. 2718], original italics; see also <em>South La. Environmental Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sand </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 629 F.2d 1005, 1015-1016; <em>Minnesota Public Interest Research Group </em>v. <em>Butz </em>(8th Cir. 1976) 541 F.2d 1292, 1307, cert. den. (1977) 430 U.S. 922 [51 L.Ed.2d 601, 97 S.Ct. 1340]; <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Sigler </em>(S.D.Tex. 1982) 532 F.Supp. 1222, 1235-1236.) Certainly, implementation of the proposed project in the present case without the Transportation Corridor, a preserved Greenbelt, or 25 percent affordable housing is even less imminent than a contemplated project, since the contemplation here is that the failure of the \u201cassumptions\u201d will <em>not </em>occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Santiago County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d 818, is misplaced. There we held insufficient an EIR that failed to describe the additional water delivery facilities that would have to be built to accommodate the proposed project, a sand and gravel mine. We stated, \u201cBecause of this omission, some important ramifications of the proposed project remained hidden from view at the time the project was being discussed and approved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 830.) Here, however, as has already been said, the proposed project itself has been fully evaluated in the EIR and any omitted discussions are of other projects, not the project under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Appellants also rely on <em>Chelsea Neighbored Ass\u2019ns </em>v. <em>United States Post. Serv. </em>(2d Cir. 1975) 516 F.2d 378. In that case, the proposed project was a postal service vehicle maintenance facility (VMF) in combination with a multistory housing project in New York City. The court held the EIS to be insufficient on a number of grounds, one of which was discussed in full as follows: \u201cThis brings us to the failure of the EIS to disclose that the housing might never be built at all, the second defect found by Judge Ward. While the impact of the VMF alone was analyzed, the treatment of the VMF without housing was in some instances perfunctory comp\u00e1red with the analysis of the VMF with housing. This defect in itself may well be easily remedied. More significant, however, is the failure to assess the importance and impact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>VMF by itself. The lack is fatal to the EIS for it is at least possible that without the housing the \u2018Assessment of Trade Offs\u2019 would result in a decision not to proceed with the project at all. We do not suggest that it would be arbitrary or capricious for the Service to reach a. contrary conclusion, but such a judgment must come only after full consideration of the VMF standing alone.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 389, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Unlike respondents, we cannot ignore the <em>Chelsea </em>case. However, neither are we able to reconcile it with our holding here. Therefore, we simply disagree with that court\u2019s analysis, also noting that <em>Chelsea </em>precedes <em>Kleppe </em>and the other federal cases cited above (see also <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Sigler, supra, </em>532 F.Supp. at p. 1236, fn. 32) and that <em>Chelsea </em>cites no case or statutory authority in support of the holding pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The EIR for the amendment of the Orange County General Plan was in compliance with the requirements of CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Sufficiency of Board\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Because the EIR identified significant environmental effects6 that will be caused by the amendment of the general plan, the board of supervisors could not approve the amendment unless it made one or more of the following findings: \u201c(a) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, [the] project which mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects thereof as identified in the completed environmental impact report. [11] (b) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and such changes have been adopted by such other agency, or can and should be adopted by such other agency. [H] (c) Specific economic, social, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the environmental impact report.\u201d (\u00a7 21081.) Guidelines section 15088, subdivision (a) requires that there be a finding or findings for each significant effect and that each finding be written and be \u201caccompanied by a statement of the facts supporting each finding.\u201d Appellants claim that the board\u2019s findings are inadequate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">6\u201cSignificant effect on the environment\u2019 means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment.\u201d (\u00a7 21068.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>The board did make the finding<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u201c[s]pecific economic, social, technological or other considerations make improbable the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified to reduce the effects of some significant environmental effects of the plan.\u201d (See \u00a7 21081, subd. (c).) However, the board has not adequately disclosed its reasons for coming to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">After making the general finding above, the board listed a total of 26 unavoidable adverse effects divided among 8 different categories. Then, for each of the eight categories, the board purported to state in a paragraph why the adverse effects in the particular category were going to be allowed to occur. For example, one category reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\u201cf. <em>Natural Resources</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201c(1) Loss of natural resources due to development construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\u201c(2) Change of the agricultural dry farming area to open space and urban uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">\u201c(3) Permanent loss of 1925 acres of agricultural soils (Class I through IV) including 98 acres of Class I and II soils.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">\u201cPrime agricultural soils, energy resources and other nonrenewable resources will be used due to the development of this project. This adverse impact will only be mitigated through the No Development alternative which is considered economically infeasible. The social benefits of the project which provide housing, employment and recreational opportunities override the plan\u2019s impact on non-renewable resources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">We believe the \u201cNatural Resources\u201d finding is characteristic of the findings for the other seven categories. Thus, since all eight findings suffer from the same deficiencies, we deal specifically with only the faults of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">In making its finding on the \u201cNatural Resources\u201d significant environmental effects, the board stated that only the \u201cNo Development\u201d alternative could mitigate those effects and that that alternative was economically infeasible. This treatment of alternatives is lacking in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>significant respects\u2014there is no discussion of the other EIR alternatives and there is no explanation of why the alternative that is mentioned is economically infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Having not made changes or alterations in the project to avoid or mitigate the listed significant environmental effects, the board was required by CEQA to find that some consideration made \u201cthe mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the\u201d EIR infeasible. (\u00a7 21081, subd. (c).) The plain meaning of the statute thus demands that each of those mitigation measures or project alternatives which are identified in the EIR and are not adopted must be expressly rejected as infeasible. The board, however, made a finding about only one of the four alternatives discussed in the EIR. This is in direct contravention of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Additionally, the finding is insufficient even regarding the project alternative which is discussed. Although the board stated that the \u201cNo Development\u201d alternative was economically infeasible, it did not explain <em>why </em>it found the alternative economically infeasible. Such was required by Guidelines section 15088, subdivision (a) which mandates that the board\u2019s finding be \u201caccompanied by a statement of the facts supporting each finding.\u201d It is not enough that the board found that \u201c[t]he social benefits of the project which provide housing, employment and recreational opportunities override the plan\u2019s impact on non-renewable resources.\u201d The statement is conclusionary and too general. This was sufficient to show which \u201c[sjpecific . .. social . . . considerations\u201d the board felt made the \u201cNo Development\u201d alternative infeasible, but it does not constitute \u201ca statement of the facts\u201d supporting the finding. (Cf. <em>Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d 893, 913-914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The state policy is that \u201cpublic agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects\u201d (\u00a7 21002) and that \u201c[e]ach public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects it approves or carries out whenever it is feasible to do so.\u201d (\u00a7 21002.1, subd. (b).)  Since the finding requirement was expressly enacted pursuant to that policy (see \u00a7 21081), it is clear that the purposes of section 21081 are that there be some evidence that the alternatives or mitigation measures in the EIR actually were considered by the decision making agency and, as the Supreme Court stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>in a similar situation, that there be a disclosure of \u201cthe analytic route the ... agency traveled from evidence to action.\u201d <em>(Topanga Assn, for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12]; see also <em>Markley </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 656, 671 [182 Cal.Rptr. 659].) Thus, when a project is approved that will significantly affect the environment, CEQA places the burden on the approving agency to affirmatively show that it has considered the identified means of lessening or avoiding the project\u2019s significant effects and to explain its decision allowing those adverse changes to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The writing of a perfect EIR becomes a futile action if that EIR is not adequately considered by the public agency responsible for approving a project. Indeed, it is almost as if no EIR was prepared at all. In the present case, there is no evidence that the board ever considered any EIR alternative to the project except the \u201cNo Development\u201d alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Additionally, even though the board may have fully considered the EIR and made a wise and eminently rational decision in approving the proposed project, the board\u2019s thinking process, its \u201canalytic route,\u201d has not been revealed. Only by making this disclosure can others, be they courts or constituents, intelligently analyze the logic of the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Respondents claim that CEQA requires only that there be a \u201cdiscernible balancing of the environmental consequences of the project against its benefits.\u201d Even were this the proper standard, which we do not think it is,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the board\u2019s findings are not sufficient. The conclusionary, almost boilerplate, language of the findings is insufficient evidence that such balancing occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The judgment is affirmed only insofar as it denies appellants\u2019 application for a writ of mandate commanding the board to set aside its certification of the EIR. In all other respects, the judgment is reversed. All parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Kaufman, J., and Trotter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-11\">\u201cAI1 references are to the Public Resources Code unless otherwise stated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">\u201cAll further references to the California Administrative Code will be cited as Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Because CEQA was modeled on the National Environmental Policy Act, judicial interpretation of the latter is persuasive authority in interpreting CEQA. <em>(Wildlife Alive </em>v. <em>Chickering </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 201 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537]; <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Coastside County Water Dist. </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 695, 701 [104 Cal.Rptr. 197].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">For example, in the discussion of the 10,000 home alternative, the EIR states, \u201cThe lower level of development would reduce vehicle trip generation and total vehicle miles traveled, thereby minimizing air quality impacts (Table IV-1) from the site.\u201d Table IV-1, in turn, informs the reader that the \u201cvehicle miles traveled\u201d would be 853,200 for the 7,500 home alternative, 1,097,300 for the 10,000 home alternative, 1,526,900 for the 20,000 home proposed plan, and 1,584,000 for the 25,000 home alternative. From this data, one could discern the vehicle miles traveled and the air quality impacts of a 16,000 home alternative relative to the proposed plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The assumptions are asserted to be questionable for the following reasons: (1) Construction of the transportation corridor is in doubt, because there is currently no funding for it; (2) the Greenbelt may not be preserved, because, although the company is required to enter into a 15-year offer of dedication to the county, the county is not required to accept the dedication; and (3) although many housing units are planned for moderate income persons, there is little resale control, so that the stock of affordable housing will likely decline as the original owners sell their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Respondents\u2019 defense of the EIR in this respect is based on showing the reasonableness of the assumptions. For example, they claim that the transportation corridor has been an important part of the county\u2019s master plan of arterial highways since 1976 and cannot be eliminated without an amendment to the general plan. However, as we explain, it is unnecessary in this case to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-13\">The findings discussed here are actually contained in a resolution of the Orange County Planning Commission recommending the adoption of the amendment of the general plan. However, the board of supervisors, in adopting the amendment, also adopted the findings of the planning commission. No question is raised as to the validity of this procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Respondents\u2019 support for this standard rests on <em>Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Com. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.3d 274. The court there held that the defendants were not required to make section 21081 findings because the project was approved pri- or to the enactment of section 21081 and that the presection 21081 CEQA indicated a legislative intent that findings not be required. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 282.) Near the end of the discussion of findings, the court stated, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 assertion that in the absence of findings, there was no <em>discernible balancing of the environmental consequences of the project against its benefits, </em>considered in the light of the lengthy proceedings held both by the Trustees and the Fresno State University administrators, is best characterized as a palpable distortion of the record.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 283, italics added.) We cannot accept as the standard for section 21081 findings a phrase taken out of context from a case that does not even interpret section 21081.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
