Code, \u00a7 187) with a special circumstance allegation that the murder was committed while lying in wait (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(15)), and two counts of attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 664.) At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate bound over each defendant on all charges and the special circumstance allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Defendants moved to dismiss the special circumstance allegation in superior court (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995; <em>Ghent </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 944, 954 [153 Cal.Rptr. 720]). The motion was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The People petitioned for relief from the trial court\u2019s ruling. We stayed the trial court proceedings and issued an alternative writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">At approximately 7 p.m. on August 10, 1981, Jose Gonzales<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> drove Gustavo Cordero\u2019s white Chevrolet northbound up an alley parallel to Koledo Street in Huntington Beach. Manuel Ocampo was seated in the right front passenger seat and Cordero was seated in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">As the vehicle proceeded past a row of carports, defendants and a fourth man jumped out from behind the wall of one of the carports, where they had been concealed for approximately 45 minutes, and surrounded the Chevrolet. The Chevrolet stopped and one of the men asked the driver, \u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d When Gonzales failed to respond, the man hit him on his left cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Two of the men jumped onto the hood of the vehicle and began kicking the windshield, while the other two men hit the vehicle with a baseball bat and a 20-inch long black rod or pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Cordero immediately exited the vehicle and ran back down the alley. At approximately 10 to 25 second intervals, Ocampo and then Gonzales exited the vehicle and fled in the same direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Robert Maciel threw a bat at Gonzales, which struck and wounded him. Louis Peralta passed a rifle to Vincent Maciel, who fired five rounds at the fleeing men, wounding Cordero and killing Ocampo. They had fled about a half block. The entire incident probably lasted between 45 seconds and a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Eighteen hours earlier, Huntington Beach Police Officer Monroe Mauney met Robert Maciel, Louis Peralta and a woman on Koledo Street. Robert Maciel reported that a beer bottle had been thrown through a nearby apartment window after a white 1965 or 1966 Chevy had been seen driving up and down Koledo Street with only its parking lights on. When Officer Mauney stated he would attempt to locate the Chevy, Robert Maciel responded that it was okay because he would eventually find the vehicle himself and kill the occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Half an hour later, Officer Mauney observed a vehicle matching the description given by Robert Maciel in an open carport off an alley west of Queens Street. It was later determined that this vehicle was Cordero\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The issue in this case is whether the special circumstance allegation that victim Ocampo was killed while defendants were lying in wait was properly stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Petitioner contends: (1) The special circumstance definition of \u201cwhile lying in wait\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not differ from the definition of \u201cby means of . . . lying in wait\u201d for first degree murder in Penal Code section 189<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; and (2) no cognizable interruption existed to separate the period of lying in wait from the period during which the killing occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Only one other California appellate court has addressed and decided the first issue. <em>(Domino </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 1000 [181 Cal.Rptr. 486].) After analyzing the \u201clegislative history\u201d of the \u201cwhile lying in wait\u201d special circumstance, which was added to the Penal Code by the 1978 Death Penalty Initiative (Prop. 7, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 1978)), popularly known as the \u201cBriggs Initiative,\u201d and analyzing the scanty case law defining \u201cby means of ... lying in wait\u201d in the first degree murder statute, the majority concluded in <em>Domino </em>that the \u201clying in wait\u201d special circumstance is more restrictive because \u201c. . . to ignore or minimize the importance of the word \u2018while\u2019 would violate the policy of construing penal statutes in favor of the accused and would invade the legislative province.\u201d (129 Cal.App.3d at p. 1011.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><em>Domino </em>reasoned: \u201cTo give proper impact to the term \u2018while\u2019 we read it as creating a requirement that where first degree murder has been \u2018perpetrated by means of .. . lying in wait,\u2019 the death penalty or life without possibility of parole may be imposed only if the appropriate temporal relationship exists between the killing and the lying in wait.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>To satisfy this temporal relationship \u201c... the killing must take place during the period of concealment and watchful waiting or the lethal acts must begin at and flow continuously from the moment the concealment and watchful waiting ends. If a cognizable interruption separates the period of lying in wait from the period during which the killing takes place, the circumstances calling for the ultimate penalty do not exist.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A clear, cognizable interruption was present in <em>Domino. </em>The court held that the victim was not killed \u201cwhile\u201d defendants were.\u201clying in wait\u201d because one to five hours elapsed between the \u201clying in wait\u201d and the killing. Also, the killing took place in an area geographically removed from the location defendants were \u201clying in wait.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Domino. </em> The evidence, when supported by every legitimate inference, shows no cognizable interruption.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Defendants concealed themselves behind a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>garage wall, rifle in hand. They intended to kill. They waited. The victims approached. Defendants ambushed the victims, attacked the car immediately, flushed the victims out of their vehicle, then gunned down Ocampo as he fled on foot, approximately 50 to 75 yards from the scene of the attack. The entire incident lasted about a minute. The events flowed continously. At no time was there any interruption of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Applying Domin\u00f3\u2019s interpretation of \u201cwhile lying in wait,\u201d the facts in this case show \u201c... lethal acts [which] begin at and flow continuously from the moment the concealment and watchful waiting ends.\u201d No \u201ccognizable interruption\u201d separated the period during which the killing took place from the period of concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The superior court erred in granting the Penal Code section 995 motion to dismiss the special circumstance allegation because the evidence was insufficient to support the special circumstance allegation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its order of March 22, 1982, granting the Penal Code section 995 motion to dismiss the Penal Code section 190.2, subdivision (a)(15) special circumstance allegation, to enter its order denying the motion and to proceed thereafter as provided by law. The stay order is vacated and set aside and is of no further force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The petitions of real parties in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied October 6 and October 8, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\"> Before Kaufman, Acting P.

Both courts act as reviewing courts, hence every legitimate factual inference must be drawn to uphold the magistrate\u2019s decision. <em>(Caughlin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 461, 464-465 [93 Cal.Rptr. 587, 482 P.2d 211] cert. den.

The evidence is sufficient to support a special circumstance allegation at this stage if it shows reasonable cause or \u201csome rational ground for assuming the possibility\u201d that the murder was committed while defendants were lying in wait. <em>(Ghent </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 90 Cal.App.3d 944, 955-957.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b668-13\">In all fairness, the superior court judge did not have the benefit of <em>Domino\u2019s </em>interpretation of Penal Code section 190.2, subdivision (a)( 15), at the time the motion was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
