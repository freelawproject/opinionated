We will issue the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Gerry L. Boles sued Harold E. Hand, Jr., M.D., an ophthalmologist, for malpractice. Hand sought to depose Boles\u2019 wife and gave notice of the deposition to her husband\u2019s attorney. He responded that he \u201c[did] not intend to have Mrs. Boles testify\u201d because of the spousal privilege of Evidence Code section 970.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hand sought a court order compelling the wife\u2019s attendance at the deposition. The court found the spousal privilege applicable and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Boles treats this case as tendering the spousal privilege not to testify against a spouse in any proceeding. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 970,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 971.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) Hand asserts the exception to the privilege contained in Evidence Code section 973, subdivision (b), for \u201ca civil proceeding brought ... by a married person for the <em>immediate benefit </em>of his spouse or of himself and his spouse.\u201d (Italics added.) (Evid. Code, \u00a7 973, subd. (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) We are, however, a procedural step removed from the spousal privilege. The question of spousal privilege is not tendered until the spouse having the privilege is properly noticed for a deposition and interposes the privilege. It then must be determined as a preliminary fact. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 405.) Here, the wife, whose privilege would be at issue, has not asserted it and her husband may not assert the privilege on her behalf. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 971; see also <em>Abar </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 862 [177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 655].) Rather, this is a case arising under Code of Civil Procedure section 2019, subdivision (a)(4), which permits service of a notice of deposition of <em>\u201ca </em>person for whose <em>immediate benefit </em>an action or proceeding is prosecuted\u201d upon the attorney for the plaintiff. (Italics added.) (See <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 832 [103 Cal.Rptr. 709, 500 P.2d 621].) Here, the husband\u2019s attorney refused to produce the wife and may do so if she is not an immediate beneficiary of the action. The procedural misstep occurred no doubt because the exception to the spousal privilege is measured by the same \u201cimmediate benefit\u201d test as the notice provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 2019, subdivision (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We turn to the question whether the husband\u2019s personal injury action is a proceeding for the \u201cimmediate benefit\u201d of the wife. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The leading case of <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 885, 897 [27 Cal.Rptr. 153, 377 P.2d 265], interpreting Code of Civil Procedure section 2019, subdivision (a)(4), says that \u2018\u201cimmediate benefit\u2019\u201d means \u201can immediate right to the amount recovered or some portion of it as soon as it was recovered by the nominal plaintiff.\u201d (Italics added.) (Accord, <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 839 [\u201cThere is probably no better way to construe \u2018immediate benefit\u2019 than as an immediate share in the recovery.\u201d]; see also <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Jergins </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 536 [271 P.2d 210] [interpreting the phrase in then Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2055 (now Evid. Code, \u00a7 776, subd. (d)(1))].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Before 1957, both the spouse\u2019s cause of action and any damages recovered were community property. (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Community Property, \u00a7 13, pp. 5104-5106; <em>Rothschild </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1930) 109 Cal.App. 345, 347 [293 P. 106].) In <em>Rothschild </em>the court said that in a husband\u2019s personal injury action, a wife was a \u201c\u2018person for whose immediate benefit\u2019\u201d the matter was prosecuted because \u201cany recovery for personal injuries to either spouse sustained during coverture as well as the chose in action to enforce recovery is community property.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 347.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It ruled, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the wife could exercise the privilege (former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1881, subd. (1), the predecessor to Evid. Code, \u00a7 970) because the law provided no exception to the privilege for an action involving community interests. The exception was provided in 1965, with the enactment of Evidence Code section 973, subdivision (b). <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 4.) But by then a personal injury cause of action and any resulting damages had become separate property. (Former Civ. Code, \u00a7 163.5 [added by Stats. 1957, ch. 2334, \u00a7 1, p. 4066]; 7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Community Property, \u00a7 14, pp. 5106-5107. )<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The law changed again in 1968 following a study and recommendations by the California Law Revision Commission. (See Law Revision Commission\u2019s Recommendation Relating to Damages for Personal Injuries to a Married Person as Separate or Community Property, 8 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1967) p. 1389 et seq. [hereafter Law Revision Report]; see also Reppy, <em>The Effect of the Adoption of Comparative Negligence on California Community Property Law: Has Imputed Negligence Been Revived? </em>(1977) 28 Hastings L.J. 1359, 1362-1375, 1382-1396.) The separate property status of personal injury damages was repealed and replaced by a complex treatment. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1608; compare p. 3312 with p. 3333.) In general, personal injury damages, save from interspousal actions, received during marriage were made community property, but amounts received after separation or dissolution became separate property. (See <em>In re Marriage of Jones </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 457, 463 [119 Cal.Rptr. 108, 531 P.2d 420]; see also Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, \u00a7 4800, pp. 3333-3334; \u00a7 5109, pp. 3338-3339; \u00a7 5112, pp. 3339-3340; and \u00a7 5117, p. 3340; Law Revision Report, at p. 1401.) Upon separation or dissolution of the marriage, however, the community property personal injury damages were required to be \u201cassigned\u201d to the spouse \u201cwho suffered the injuries\u201d unless \u201cthe court determine[d] that the interest of justice requires other disposition\u201d or the proceeds were commingled with other community property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>These provisions are retained in the Civil Code. Interspousal personal injury recoveries are the separate property of the injured spouse. (\u00a7 5126.) In general, all <em>other </em>property acquired during the marriage by a spouse domiciled in the state is community property. (\u00a7 5110.) Personal injury damages received or to be received from a cause of action arising <em>after </em>dissolution or separation are the separate property of the injured spouse. (\u00a7 5126.) By implication, damages received or to be received from a cause of action arising during marriage are community property. Upon dissolution or separation such damages, entitled \u201ccommunity property personal injury damages,\u201d are required to be \u201cassigned\u201d to the injured spouse unless \u201ccommingled with <em>other </em>community property\u201d or divided by the court. (Italics added.) (\u00a7 4800, subd. (c).) The amendments to the latter two sections (Stats. 1979, ch. 638, \u00a7 1, p. 1970; \u00a7 3, p. 1971), presumably made in response to <em>In re Marriage of Pinto </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 86 [104 P.2d 371], make clear that damages \u201cto be received\u201d from a \u201ccause of action\u201d arising during marriage, i.e., unliquidated claims, are community property. (See also <em>ante, </em>fn. 7.) Although such claims and recoveries are subject to assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ment to the injured spouse upon dissolution or separation, in the absence of that contingency the noninjured spouse retains a present interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Accordingly, the determination whether community property personal injury damages are for the \u201cimmediate benefit\u201d of the noninjured spouse turns upon the status of the marriage. If, as here, at the time that spousal testimony is sought, the marriage is intact, unliquidated claims for community property personal injury damages are community property in which the noninjured spouse has a present interest and entitlement to a share of the proceeds when recovered. They are for his or her \u201cimmediate benefit.\u201d (See <em>Rothschild </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App. at p. 347.) Consequently, the noninjured spouse is subject to deposition by notice upon the plaintiff spouse (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2019, subd. (a)(4)) and may not interpose the spousal privilege. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 973, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue compelling the trial court to vacate its order denying petitioner\u2019s motion for issuance of a subpoena compelling attendance of real party in interest at the deposition and to enter a contrary order directing issuance of the subpoena. The order to show cause is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Evans, Acting P. J., and Carr, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The letter read: \u201c1 do not intend to have Mrs. Boles testify in this action. You will be advised if this intention changes. [\u00b6] Please advise why you believe that Evidence Code Sections 970 and 971 are not applicable.

Proc., \u00a7 2016, subd. (d)(2)), which provided that a party could depose a \u201cperson for whose immediate benefit\u201d the action was prosecuted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The comment to Evidence Code section 973, subdivision (b), said: \u201cThis subdivision precludes married persons from taking unfair advantage of their marital status to escape their duty to give testimony under Section 776, which supersedes Code of Civil Procedure section 2055. It recognizes a doctrine of waiver that has been developed in the California cases.... (It should be noted that, with respect to damages for personal injuries, Civil Code Section 163.5 ... provides that all damages awarded to a married person in a civil action for personal injuries are the separate property of such married person.) ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The commission explained the purpose of the provision as follows: \u201cAlthough earnings from personal services often are the chief source of the community property, Civil Code Section 163.5 makes personal injury damages for the loss of earnings the separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>property of the injured spouse. As separate property, such damages are not subject to division on divorce or separate maintenance. This inflexible rule seems especially unjust in its application to cases in which a substantial portion of the damages was awarded to compensate the victim for lost earnings that would have been received during the period of the marriage prior to the divorce or separate maintenance action. These cannot be divided between the spouses even though the earnings themselves would have been subject to division.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4fc\">\u201cOn the other hand, enactment of legislation that would again make personal injury damages community property would make the award subject to division even though a substantial portion of the award represents the loss of earnings that would be received after the judgment of divorce or separate maintenance. This aspect of the Commission\u2019s previous recommendation caused it to be rejected by the Assembly because, under that recommendation, personal injury damages could have been apportioned between the spouses in a divorce action brought shortly after the damages were recovered. The Assembly concluded that it would be undesirable to create the. possibility that a court might award one spouse a share of the damages recovered by the other spouse under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\">\u201cTo overcome this problem, and because of the generally unique nature of property received as personal injury damages, the Commission recommends enactment of a special provision governing disposition of such property on divorce or separate maintenance. Even though such property should be made community property, all of it should be awarded to the spouse who suffered the injury unless the court determines from all of the facts of the particular case that justice requires a division. The decision whether a division is required should be made without regard to which spouse is granted the divorce or separate maintenance. Because of the variety of situations, the special provision should not undertake to provide exact rules for determining whether to make a division and, if so, what division to make. Rather, the statute should require the court to take into account the economic conditions and needs of the parties, the time elapsed since the damages were recovered, and any other pertinent facts in the case.\u201d (Law Revision Report, at pp. 1392-1393.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
