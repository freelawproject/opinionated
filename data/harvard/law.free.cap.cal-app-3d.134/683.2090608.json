Each was a beneficiary of the company\u2019s employees\u2019 pension plan. Doris\u2019 pension rights at the time of the trial had vested but not matured, while Karl\u2019s such rights were both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>vested and matured. Neither party was obliged to retire, and neither had plans to do so until required by the company\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The judgment, as relevant, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201c1. The court retains jurisdiction over both the petitioner\u2019s and respondent\u2019s pension funds with Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company pursuant to the <em>Brown [In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1976) 15 Cal. 3d 838 (126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561, 94 A.L.R.3d 164)] decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201ca. The court retains, jurisdiction over the pension fund of petitioner to distribute the same in accordance with the following formula: ...\u201d (There followed an erroneous formula for division of the parties\u2019 respective community and separate property interests in the retirement benefits.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The parties now agree (we think correctly) that their respective interests in the retirement benefits should have been determined as provided by <em>In re Marriage of Judd </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 515, 522 [137 Cal.Rptr. 318], and <em>In re Marriage of Freiberg </em>(1976) 57 Cal. App.3d 304, 310 [127 Cal.Rptr. 792] (disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Marriage of Gillmore </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 418, 425, fn. 5 [174 Cal.Rptr. 493, 629 P.2d 1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Doris states the remaining issue of her appeal as follows: \u201cWhether the court must distribute a vested, matured pension fund to the nonemployee spouse despite the employee spouse\u2019s election to continue working.\u201d She argues that in such a case, or at least this case, the community interest in the fund should have been distributed at the trial, as she had elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">We find merit in the contention. <em>In re Marriage of Gillmore, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 418, <em>passim </em>(decided after entry of the instant judgment), expressly holds that a nonemployee spouse may elect to take his or her community property share of the other\u2019s retirement benefits at the time of their marriage dissolution proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Indeed, it has been said that where possible, \u201cthe preferable mode of division would be to award the pension rights to the employee and property of equal value to the spouse.\u201d <em>(Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 32, 46 [89 Cal.Rptr. 61, 473 P.2d 765] [disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>proved on other grounds in <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 851, fn. 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">But nevertheless we discern what appears to be a contention of Doris\u2019 appeal that under <em>Gillmore </em>she had a right to, and did, elect at the time of the parties\u2019 marriage dissolution proceedings, to thereafter receive from Karl sums of money ($178.92 monthly) equal to what her community property interest in his monthly retirement benefits would have been, had he then been retired. In this, she is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We point out initially\u2014the absolute rule of Civil Code section 4800\u2014that in marriage dissolution proceedings, the community property of the parties <em>shall be divided equally. </em>(See <em>In re Marriage of Olson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 414, 421 [165 Cal.Rptr. 820, 612 P.2d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Equally well established is the rule that in marriage dissolution proceedings an employee spouse, eligible to retire as the beneficiary of a pension fund, who is not required to and wishes not to so retire, is under no legal compulsion to do so. \u201cHe is free to continue working\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Gillmore, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 418, 427), and \u201cThe time when the monthly retirement payments will commence . . ., as between the [employee] husband and the wife, [is] entirely within the control of the husband\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Freiberg, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 304, 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Doris\u2019 contention\u2019s nonconformity with the mandate of Civil Code section 4800, that community property be divided equally, will perhaps best be pointed up in this manner. Assuming, as was his right, that Karl wished not to retire until required to after 10 more years, under her contention he would be obliged over that period of time to pay her $21,384 ($178.20 x 120 mos.) while he, himself, received no retirement benefits. Only thereafter would they share the benefits according to their respective interests. The consequent frustration of section 4800\u2019s purpose is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Instead <em>Gillmore, </em>which beyond any doubt is the latest and leading case on the subject, provides that upon dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, Doris was entitled to immediate distribution of her community property share of Karl\u2019s pension fund. That distributive share consisted of an amount <em>equivalent </em>to her interest therein. The court did <em>not </em>create a fiction that Karl be deemed to have received his monthly pension payments, and was therefore bound to pay over to Doris her community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>property share of them. <em>Gillmore </em>says no more than that: \u201cIf he does not wish to retire, he must [upon dissolution of the marriage and her demand] pay her an amount <em>equivalent </em>to her interest.\u201d (29 Cal.3d p. 427; our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Upon determination of Doris\u2019 present community property interest in Karl\u2019s pension fund, its value will be affected by its inherent uncertainties such as the parties\u2019 probable life expectancies and their health, and the fact that an early death might preclude any pension payments at all. It will embrace everything that has reasonable relevancy to the expectancy\u2019s present value. See <em>In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal. 3d 838, 848. The judicial concern will be the \u201cpresent value of pension rights.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 848.) And it is settled that such present value will be <em>actuarially </em>determined, among other things, by considering the retirement benefit\u2019s uncertainties. The search will be for the <em>\u201cactuarial current value of the benefits.\u201d (Smith </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 349, 361 [118 Cal.Rptr. 621, 530 P.2d 589, 78 A.L.R.3d 231] [disapproved on other grounds <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal. 3d 838, 851, fn. 14]; and see <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Waite </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 461, 465 [99 Cal.Rptr. 325, 492 P.2d 13] [disapproved on other grounds <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 851, fn. 14]; <em>Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 32, 39; <em>In re Marriage of Forrest </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 850, 852 [159 Cal.Rptr. 229]; <em>In re Marriage of Samuels </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 122, 128 [158 Cal.Rptr. 38]; <em>In re Marriage of Judd, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 515, 519; <em>Bensing </em>v. <em>Bensing </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 889, 894 [102 Cal.Rptr. 255] [disapproved on other grounds <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 851, fn. 14].) Such an actuarial value determination will, of course, be a question of fact for the trial court. <em>(Bensing </em>v. <em>Bensing, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d p. 895.) And it would seem that, at least ordinarily, it would be the subject of expert testimony. (See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d p. 361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Upon determination of Karl\u2019s retirement benefit\u2019s present value (as of the date of the parties\u2019 separation; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 5118), the trial court will have broad discretion as to the manner in which Karl will be directed to pay Doris an amount equivalent to her community property interest in it. <em>(In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 848, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">For these several reasons, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>There appears yet another issue, unraised by the parties on the appeal, that will undoubtedly be presented upon remand to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">All community property interests in pension funds, \u201cwhether the benefits are vested or nonvested, matured or immature\u201d are subject to equal division upon dissolution of a marriage. <em>(In re Marriage of Gill-more, </em>supra, 29 Cal.3d 418, 422.) Doris\u2019 above-mentioned pension fund will accordingly, at Karl\u2019s request, also be subject to appropriate division between the parties, as an offset to Karl\u2019s pension fund obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The judgment is reversed. The superior court will take such further proceedings as are not inconsistent with <em>In re Marriage of Judd, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 515, 522, <em>In re Marriage of Freiberg, supra, </em>57 Cal. App.3d 304, 310, <em>In re Marriage of Gillmore, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d p. 425, and otherwise with the views we have here expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">On September 2, 1982, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
