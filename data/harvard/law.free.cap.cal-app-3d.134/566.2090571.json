They challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling that the policy in question could not possibly apply to indemnify the Banes for their liability arising out of an accident which occurred while the subject vehicle\u2014a motor home\u2014was in Mexico. We conclude the trial court correctly interpreted the territorial limitation clause in the policy as precluding coverage, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In February 1974, the Eanes loaned their motor home to Mr. and Mrs. Robert Horton and Virgil and Judith Folands for a trip the Hortons and Folands planned to make to Mexico. On February 14, the motor home apparently being driven by one of the Hortons was involved in an accident in Mexico in which the Hortons were killed and the Folands were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">At the time of the accident, an insurance policy issued by Foremost insured the Fanes with respect to the motor home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   On page two of the policy provisions under a heading \u201cPolicy Period, Territory, Purposes of Use,\u201d the policy stated, \u201cThis policy applies only to accidents which occur and to direct and accidental losses to the automobile which are sustained during the policy period, <em>while the automobile is within the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada </em>.... \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Fanes notified their insurance agent about the accident and, after Williams Fanes provided the company with a statement, Foremost paid the Fanes for the property damage which the motor home sustained.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Later, Virgil and Judith Folands attempted to collect under the medical payments portion of the policy for the injuries they sustained in the accident. Relying on the territorial limitation clause in the policy, Foremost refused to pay. The Folands then filed suit against the Fanes relying on the statutory vehicle owner liability provisions of Vehicle Code section 17150<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on theories of negligent entrustment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Banes were never served in that action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> apparently because the Folands were able to collect under the uninsured motorist provision of their own automobile policy issued by Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company. As a result, Fireman\u2019s filed a subrogation action against the Banes based on their payment to the Folands of an amount in excess of $28,000. When notified of the Fireman\u2019s suit, Foremost refused to defend and again cited the territorial limitation clause, this time in reference to the liability coverage of the policy. It then filed this action for declaratory relief to confirm its interpretation of the policy\u2019s inapplicability. The court below agreed, and entered judgment in favor of Foremost.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The issue in this case focuses on whether the facts give rise to potential coverage under the Foremost policy, obligating Foremost to defend the Banes against the Fireman\u2019s subrogation action. The Banes proffer three different theories under which Foremost might be obligated to indemnify the Banes for any liability resulting from the Fireman\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The Banes first argue that the word \u201caccident\u201d in the territorial limitation clause (see <em>ante, </em>p. 569) is ambiguous and undefined within the context of the policy, which requires ascertainment of the reasonable expectations of the insured as to the extent of coverage. (See <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>v. <em>Sam Harris Constr. Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 409, 412-413 [149 Cal.Rptr. 292, 583 P.2d 1335].) They go on to point to two cases which have held it was reasonable for the insured to expect that \u201caccident\u201d referred not just to the injury-causing event (e.g., collision, explosion, etc.) but also included the negligent or wrongful act of the insured which constituted the legal cause of the injury. Thus, where the insured\u2019s negligent manufacture of drilling mud in Los Angeles caused the mud to burst into flame while being stored in a warehouse in Venezuela, the \u201caccident\u201d occurred in Los Angeles within the policy\u2019s \u201ccontinental United States\u201d limitation. <em>(Oil Base, Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 378 [76 Cal.Rptr. 594].) And where a mechanic\u2019s negligence caused a vehicular collision five months later, the \u201caccident\u201d occurred during the servicing of the vehicle before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the insurance policy expired. <em>(Sylla </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 895 [127 Cal.Rptr. 38].)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">We have no quarrel with the basic proposition that use of the word \u201caccident,\u201d if undefined in the policy, may create some degree of ambiguity in certain circumstances necessitating ascertainment of the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. (See generally <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 269-270 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168].) But abstract ambiguity is not an authorization to ignore common sense. The insured\u2019s expectations of coverage must be <em>reasonable. </em>In order for this policy to provide coverage under the facts of this case, the \u201caccident\u201d must be viewed as having occurred at the Banes\u2019 home in Orange County when they loaned their vehicle to the Hortons and the Folands. To argue that the loan of the vehicle constituted <em>the </em>\u201caccident\u201d in this case strains credulity. \u201cAccident\u201d suggests a negative unexpected occurrence. (See <em>Geddes &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 558, 563-564.) While a manufacturing defect (see <em>Oil Base, supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 378) or a negligent repair (see <em>Sylla, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 895) may conceivably fit within this rubric, the intentional loaning of a vehicle to friends does not. This is especially true if there is no owner negligence involved and liability is premised on the strict liability provisions of Vehicle Code section 17150. Under such circumstances, we find it impossible to view the totally expected and totally reasonable actions of the vehicle owner as constituting an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We also note that the <em>Oil Base </em>and <em>Sylla </em>decisions have been severely criticized. In <em>Maples </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 641, 647-650 [148 Cal.Rptr. 80], the court concerned itself with a negligently installed residential heater which caused a fire almost four years after the installer\u2019s insurance policy expired. That policy contained a provision limiting coverage to \u201caccidents which occur during the policy period . .. . \u201d After considering numerous California cases bearing on the issue, the court concluded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u201cReview of [the] seemingly unbroken line of authority finding that the term \u2018accident\u2019 unambiguously refers to the event causing damage, not the earlier event creating the potential for future injury, leads to the question of how the courts in <em>Oil Base </em>and <em>Sylla </em>were able to reach results contradicting this line of authority. Neither <em>Oil Base </em>nor <em>Sylla </em>acknowledges any of the above-cited California or out-of-state authorities, which strongly suggest, that they were not briefed or argued.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>court then emphasized that the fact that the word \u201caccident\u201d may be ambiguous in some contexts does not make it ambiguous in all:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">\u201cThe rule of <em>Oil Base </em>and <em>Sylla </em>is acceptable only if it can truly be said that a person buying insurance to cover \u2018accidents\u2019 occurring during the term of the policy would reasonably conclude that the policy would apply to any damage or injury occurring in the future because of a negligent act during the policy period. The fact that there may be ambiguity in the question of whether a collision with two cars is one accident or two accidents [see <em>Hyer </em>v. <em>Inter-Insurance Exchange etc. </em>(1926) 77 Cal.App. 343 (246 P. 1055)], or the question of whether malicious prosecution is an accident [see <em>Maxon </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 603 (29 Cal.Rptr. 586)], or whether damage done by a defective door is an accident [see <em>Geddes &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., supra, </em>51 Cal.2d 558] does not mean that there is ambiguity in the question of whether the term \u2018accident\u2019 means the negligent installation of a heater or the fire six years later attributed to the negligent installation, which is our case at bench. Accepted popular, as well as legal definition, would call the latter event the \u2018accident.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We accordingly conclude that the policy\u2019s use of the word \u201caccident\u201d does not create an ambiguity in the context of the facts presented by this case. The Banes could not reasonably have expected coverage from this policy for liability arising out of a vehicular collision in Mexico. (See generally <em>California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>v. <em>Warwick </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 190, 195 [130 Cal.Rptr. 520, 550 P.2d 1056].)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The Banes next contend that the exclusionary effect of the territorial limitation clause is not \u201cphrased in clear and unmistakable language.\u201d <em>(California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>v. <em>Warwick, supra, </em>17 Cal. 3d 190, 194; see also <em>Samson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 220, 236 [178 Cal.Rptr. 343, 636 P.2d 32].) They argue that the size and type of print did not serve to alert the insured as to the limitations on coverage. (See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Elite Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 100 Cal. App.3d 739, 752 [161 Cal.Rptr. 322].) We cannot agree. The title of the clause\u2014\u201cPolicy Period, Territory, Purposes of Use\u201d\u2014was set off in bold face type and adequately indicated that the ensuing language would define the policy\u2019s territorial application. The first five words of the sentence\u2014\u201cThis policy applies only to ... \u2019\u2019\u2014clearly inform the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>sured that the clause is limiting coverage under the policy. We do not view the phrasing and/or physical layout of the clause as precluding its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The Banes finally point to Foremost\u2019s payment of the property damage claim and initial indication it would defend the Banes as constituting a waiver of any right Foremost might have to deny coverage under the policy. (See generally <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Federal Life Ins. Co. </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 384, 391 [19 Cal.Rptr. 258].) As to the intended provision of a defense to the Folands\u2019 complaint, Foremost never in fact defended the Banes since the complaint was never served, and in any case, Foremost\u2019s communication to the Banes explicitly reserved all its rights to contest the policy\u2019s applicability. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Foremost defends its payment of the property damage claim as being required under a separate \u201closs payable\u201d indorsement to the policy providing for payment to the loss payee despite any \u201cact or neglect\u201d by the owner. Foremost suggests that the \u201closs payable\u201d provision was designed so that the Banes\u2019 decision to lend the motor home to persons who planned to drive into Mexico could not deprive the bank-lender of its security on the loan. Regardless of whether the \u201closs payable\u201d provision required payment for the property damage claim despite the territorial limitations clause, we think the waiver principle is simply inapplicable here. Foremost\u2019s explanation establishes that it did not intend to relinquish its rights, and given the reasonableness of its interpretation of the \u201closs payable\u201d clause, Foremost\u2019s conduct was not \u201cinconsistent with the intent to enforce the right[s].\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Federal Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>200 Cal.App.2d at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Cologne, Acting P.
