Plaintiff appeals a partial summary judgment for defendants, which bars a large portion of her legal malpractice claims. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The following issue is dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Do genuine issues of material fact exist as to when the statute of limitations began to run, making partial summary judgment inappropriate?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">In December 1982, Craig Young, then thirty-one years of age, left his home in Missoula, Montana, on a business trip to Texas. Slightly over one month later, on January 12, 1983, his stabbed and gunshot body was found alongside a Texas roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Between Craig\u2019s departure for Texas and the discovery that he had been murdered, his family became concerned about his uncharacteristic failure to communicate with them. His parents and his younger brother and sister went through his personal and business papers in an effort to locate clues as to his whereabouts. They knew Craig had had a business association with Jack Dickie, who lived in Texas. The exact nature of that business was not known to the family. They did know that Craig was involved in the development of mining claims, that Craig and Dickie may have been operating in \u201cgray areas\u201d of the law, and that Craig never appeared to have much money.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">During the family\u2019s search through Craig\u2019s papers, they found newspaper clippings indicating that Dickie had been involved in murders committed to collect the decedents\u2019 life insurance policies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The family learned that a life insurance policy which Craig had obtained the previous summer was in the amount of $3 million. They also found evidence of promissory notes worth $2.5 million from Craig to Vanguard World Holdings (Vanguard), a Panamanian corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The family contacted the defendant law firm, knowing that the firm had done legal work for Craig. The law firm gave the family the name of a private investigator in Texas and also suggested that they contact the Texas Rangers. After Craig\u2019s body was found, the Youngs retained the defendant law firm to probate his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In his will, Craig had named his father, Charles E. Young, and Jack Dickie as co-personal representatives of his estate. The Young family objected to any involvement of Dickie, who they strongly suspected was responsible for Craig\u2019s death. According to Peggy Young, defendants Reep and Vancanagan, attorneys with the defendant law firm, advised her and Charles E. Young that there was no basis for opposing Dickie\u2019s appointment as co-personal representative unless a criminal investigation connected him to Craig\u2019s death. Though Dickie remained as a co-personal representative, he agreed to forego fees for acting as such and he did not participate actively in the probate of the estate. The estate did pay Dickie\u2019s attorney fees incurred during the dispute over whether he should remain as co-personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">United Pacific Insurance Company, which had issued the $3 million insurance policy on Craig\u2019s life, hired a private investigator who became convinced that Dickie had murdered Craig and that Dickie owned or controlled Vanguard. However, United Pacific eventually paid the face amount of the $3 million policy to the estate, and has never sought repayment. That life insurance policy was the only substantial asset of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The notes Craig had signed in favor of the Vanguard corporation had been issued in exchange for corporate stock and forty-nine Montana mining claims Craig had staked several years earlier. As part of a paper shuffle, Dickie and Craig had transferred these and other assets among several shell corporations, inflating their stated values with each transfer, until Craig\u2019s assets reached a paper value of over $10 million. This had been done to support the application for the insurance on Craig\u2019s life, which was a prerequisite to a $3 million loan Dickey ostensibly was arranging from a British labor union. Whether the Youngs understood all of this is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Peggy Young maintains that the members of the defendant law firm told the Youngs that absent evidence that Craig\u2019s signature had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>been forged, there was no basis for refusing to pay the $2.5 million promissory notes to Vanguard. The law firm contends that it advised the Youngs that a possible defense to the notes would be failure of consideration, but that because such a defense would challenge Craig\u2019s credibility in stating his net worth to the life insurance company to obtain the policy, the defense was not raised. Peggy Young maintains that no such advice was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">On January 30, 1984, Charles E. Young, as co-personal representative of Craig\u2019s estate, agreed to settle the Vanguard claim for $2.14 million. The amount of the settlement was, in fact, suggested by Peggy Young. The remaining $1 million in insurance money went to the Youngs, as Craig\u2019s heirs. The estate inventory eventually listed Craig\u2019s mining claims as having no actual value at all. On the advice of defendants, the estate also abandoned certain legal claims defendants had been litigating on Craig\u2019s behalf against defendants Shuman, Munro, and Jenkins. Dickie was subsequently convicted in federal court on racketeering charges, which included matters relating to Craig\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In October 1985, the Internal Revenue Service, in auditing Craig\u2019s estate\u2019s federal estate tax return, disallowed the deduction of the Vanguard claim from the estate assets due to failure of \u201cadequate and full consideration, since it was merely a paper transaction.\u201d A $1.2 million deficiency was assessed against the estate. The Youngs contacted separate counsel for assistance with the IRS matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">On September 3, 1987, the parties to this action executed an agreement to toll the running of the statute of limitations. Therefore, that is the effective filing date of the complaint, in which Peggy Young and Charles E. Young, as executor for the estate of Craig Young, were originally named as plaintiffs. In May of 1988, Charles E. Young died. His death further complicates the question of who knew what, and when. Peggy Young succeeded him as personal representative of Craig\u2019s estate and as the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The complaint alleges breach of contract, negligence, bad faith, negligent misrepresentation, and contractual bad faith. Peggy Young claims that the defendants committed legal malpractice by misadvising the Youngs or by failing to advise them properly concerning removal of Jack Dickie as a co-personal representative, the possible defense to the Vanguard claim of lack of consideration, and abandonment of the claims against Shuman, Munro, and Jenkins. She also asks for indemnity for the Youngs\u2019 attorney fees, costs, and expenses in defending against the IRS claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Defendants moved for summary judgment based on a statute of limitations defense; waiver, ratification and estoppel; and unclean hands, unjust enrichment, and <em>in pari delicto. </em>The District Court initially denied the motion. However, on the defendants\u2019 request for amendment of the order denying summary judgment, the court awarded defendants partial summary judgment on a theory that the statue of limitations for attorney malpractice had expired before the Youngs filed their complaint. The partial summary judgment dismissed all claims relating to the appointment and service of Jack Dickie as co-personal representative of Craig Young\u2019s estate, the settlement of the Vanguard claim against the estate, and the release of the legal claims Craig Young held against Shuman, Munro, and Jenkins. One claim survived the summary judgment: whether defendants were professionally negligent in failing to obtain an advance letter ruling on the deductibility of the Vanguard claim on the federal estate tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Do genuine issues of material fact exist as to when the statute of limitations began to run, making partial summary judgment inappropriate?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Summary judgment is proper only if no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. Our standard of review is the same as that employed by the district court. <em>McCracken v. City of Chinook </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 21, 24, 788 P.2d 892, 894. All reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the offered proof are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment. <em>Cereck v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 409, 411, 637 P.2d 509, 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Section 27-2-206, MCA, provides, in relevent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cAn action against an attorney licensed to practice law in Montana ... based upon the person\u2019s alleged professional negligent act or for error or omission in the person\u2019s practice must be commenced within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the act, error, or omission, whichever occurs last, but in no case may the action be commenced after 10 years from the date of the act, error, or omission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">While this statute incorporates the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d this Court has held that the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff has \u201cknowledge of the facts essential to the cause of action, not knowledge of the legal theories upon which an action may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>brought.\u201d <em>Burgett v. Flaherty </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 169, 173, 663 P.2d 332, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Defendants rely heavily upon <em>Burgett </em>and several other cases previously decided under \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. In <em>Burgett, </em>the claim was based on the conflict between the attorney\u2019s action in stipulating to a dissolution of marriage by default and his client\u2019s wishes not to have a dissolution so entered. In <em>Schweitzer v. Estate of Halko </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 283, 751 P.2d 1064, the claim was based on the conflict between the client\u2019s new will and his old will, both of which the attorney had drafted, and both of which the client had signed. In <em>Boles v. Simonton </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 394, 791 P.2d 755, the malpractice claimed was omission of a savings clause in a default clause in a contract for deed. The contract was admittedly read before it was signed and this Court stated that \u201c[t]he default clause, as here drafted, is not complex or beyond the understanding of a lay person.\u201d <em>Boles, </em>791 P.2d at 758. The Court held that the statute of limitations began to run at the signing of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Here, in contrast to the above cases, the claim of legal malpractice is not based upon the attorney\u2019s acts contrary to the clients\u2019 wishes. Rather, the Youngs took legal positions on the basis of the defendants\u2019 expertise in legal matters. While one may assume, where an attorney has acted contrary to a client\u2019s wishes in a matter which is within the understanding of a lay person, that the client would be cognizant of the facts which form the basis for a claim of malpractice, the same cannot be said here.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In <em>Schneider v. Leaphart </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 483, 743 P.2d 613, this Court held that the statute of limitations for legal malpractice began to run not when the attorney drafted the defective agreement, of which the client was presumably aware when he signed it, but two years later when the client was advised by an accountant that the agreement was flawed. As this Court stated in <em>Boles, </em>\u201cthe client became aware of the attorney\u2019s alleged negligence in including a maintenance provision in a property settlement when an accountant told him the provision was unnecessary; it was the discovery of this fact that triggered the statute....\u201d <em>Boles, </em>791 P.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In <em>McMillan v. Landoe, Brown, et al., P.C. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 483, 760 P.2d 758, this Court held that \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, commenced to run on a claim for malpractice in failing to exercise due care in prosecuting a sheriff\u2019s sale not from the date of the sheriff\u2019s sale, but when the client was forced to defend against an action based upon the sale. In <em>Peschel v. Jones </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 516, 760 P.2d 51, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>statute began to run on a claim on a misdrafted agreement not when the agreement was drafted, but when other parties to the agreement took action which the client had believed would be prohibited under the agreement and when the client learned of claims against him which he had expected the agreement to resolve. These cases do not conform to the defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The Youngs maintain that they were not aware that different legal positions could have been taken in the matters for which they claim attorney malpractice. They claim that, until they contacted separate counsel after receiving the IRS assessment in October 1985, they were not aware that defendants could have declined to represent Jack Dickie as a co-personal representatives of the estate, forcing Dickie to obtain separate counsel (who would normally receive part of the attorney fees for probating the estate). Further, they claim that until they contacted their present counsel they were not aware of the existence of a possible defense of lack of consideration for the Vanguard claim. They maintain that defendants told them that because Craig\u2019s signature on the Vanguard notes checked out as genuine, the notes would have to be paid out of Craig\u2019s estate. Finally, they claim that they were not informed that there was possibly remaining value in Craig\u2019s claims against Shuman, Munro, and Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Because Dickie did not take an active role as co-personal representative of Craig\u2019s estate and did not accept any fee for so acting, it initially appears that the actual damages for that aspect are limited to the amount of the attorney fees Craig\u2019s estate agreed to pay for Dickie\u2019s temporary separate counsel. But other damages are also claimed under the various counts of the complaint. The claim is that defendants failed to advise the Youngs that co-personal representatives could be represented by separate counsel or that Dickie\u2019s appointment could be challenged as not in the best interest of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We have real doubts there was any value in Craig\u2019s claims against Shuman, Munro, and Jenkins. But, again, the Youngs are claiming a failure to advise them properly on a matter not within the range of knowledge of the average lay person. That is a factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The substantive claim in this appeal appears to be the failure to pursue a defense of failure of consideration for the Vanguard claim. The Youngs were admittedly aware at the time Craig\u2019s body was found or shortly thereafter that their son may have operated in \u201cgray areas\u201d of the law; that he was not a wealthy man but that there was a $3 million policy of insurance on his life; that Jack Dickie was a prime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>suspect in Craig\u2019s murder; that Craig had executed $2.5 million in promissory notes payable to Vanguard; that Craig was afraid for his life. Mark Young, Craig\u2019s brother, knew that Dickie was associated with Vanguard and that Craig and Dickie had been engaging in stock shuffling on mining claims, for the purpose of increasing Craig\u2019s financial status. The Youngs also knew that Craig believed he would receive a large sum of money on his final fatal trip to Texas. Peggy Young admits that she was the one who suggested the amount of the eventual settlement with Vanguard and that she knew of the decisions made in probating Craig\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">We hold that material issues of fact are present as to when, as a result of all the other facts of which they were aware, the Youngs should have known or through the use of reasonable diligence should have known that defendants were omitting or failing to take certain actions, which omissions Peggy Young now claims constitute legal malpractice. The existence of the malpractice which is claimed may be in effect inherently unknowable to the lay client. When it was or should have been knowable is exactly the type of factual question appropriate for resolution by a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Conflicts in the deposition testimony illuminate another aspect of the issues of material fact. In his deposition, defendant Reep states that before the estate made its settlement with Vanguard he advised the Youngs of the possible defense of lack of consideration. Peggy Young, in her deposition, states that no such advice was given. If the trier of fact believes the defendants, that claim is precluded, because prior to the January 1984 settlement the Youngs had actual knowledge that such a defense was available and that their attorneys were not going to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We hold that material issues of fact are present in this case as to the claims upon which the District Court granted summary judgment. We reverse the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion. Because of our holding on that issue, it is not necessary that we consider the issue of whether defendants are estopped to assert the defense of the statute of limitations against their former clients.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-7\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, HON. JOHN C. McCARVEL, District Judge, sitting for JUSTICE GRAY, and HON. THOMAS C. HONZEL, District Judge, sitting for JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b497-8\">JUSTICE WEBER</author>\n<p id=\"AlK\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The majority has stated the following issue as dispositive: Do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>genuine issues of material fact exist as to when the statute of limitations began to rim, making partial summary judgment inappropriate? I agree with that statement of the issue. In considering that issue I conclude there are no issues of material fact in this case, only issues of legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Section 27-2-206, MCA, provides in substance that an action against an attorney must be commenced within three years after the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the act, error or omission. The majority opinion cites a number of Montana decisions and reaches a conclusion that the cases do not conform to the defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. I disagree with that conclusion. The key legal statement of the pertinent Montana decisions is contained in <em>Burgett v. Flaherty </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 169, 173, 663 P.2d 332, 334. The majority opinion refers to <em>Burgett </em>but fails to conform to its holding. I think; it appropriate to cite more fully to <em>Burgett </em>in which this Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cAs a matter of law, what is critical in determining when a legal malpractice action accrues is knowledge of the facts essential to the cause of action, not knowledge of the legal theories upon which an action may be brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s statute of limitations for legal malpractice is not identical to Section 27-2-206, MCA, but for the purpose of the discovery argument advanced by <em>Burgett, </em>its interpretation by the California Court of Appeals is persuasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201c \u2018The question here is whether appellant\u2019s alleged ignorance of her supposed rights against her former attorney is sufficient to toll the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201c \u2018The statute of limitations is not tolled by belated discovery of <em>legal theories, </em>as distinguished from belated discovery of <em>facts. </em>In legal and medical malpractice cases, the courts are often confronted with such claims that the statute of limitations has been tolled. However, the Supreme Court repeatedly has explained that it is the knowledge of facts rather than discovery of legal theory, that is the test. The test is whether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation. <em>(Sanchez v. South Hoover Hospital, </em>18 Cal.3d 93, 101, 132 Cal.Rptr. 657, 553 P.2d 1129.) ...\u2019, (Emphasis in original.) (Citations omitted.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">I emphasize that no Montana case has modified the <em>Burgett </em>holding as above stated. As a result I conclude that in Montana it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>knowledge of legal theories which is significant. The only test is whether the plaintiff had knowledge of facts essential to the cause of action. I will now review the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of facts essential to the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">To shorten this dissent, I discuss only the primary claim on the part of the plaintiffs, that being the claimed failure to pursue a defense of failure of consideration for the Vanguard creditor\u2019s claim. I think it important to emphasize the extent of the factual knowledge on the part of the plaintiffs as set forth by the District Court in its careful review of the facts and of the law. Following are pertinent\u2019 portions of the opinion of the District Court which has been reversed by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs assert that Defendants advised that the Vanguard promissory notes would have to be paid because they had been signed by Craig Young, that there was no viable defense to the claim and that the law required that the claim be paid. Plaintiffs further claim that Defendants did not tell them of a defense of insufficient or no consideration for the notes as a basis for denial of the creditor\u2019s claim</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\"... A careful review of the facts found herein, and Plaintiffs\u2019 alternative motion for partial summary judgment for Defendants, now cause the Court to hold that all of the facts which constitute the acts, errors or omissions which are the basis of the alleged professional negligence relating to the settlement and payment of the Vanguard claim were discovered, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have been discovered by January, 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\"><em>\u201cIn addition, no other facts relating to the settlement of the Vanguard creditor\u2019s claim have been discovered since January, 1984. </em>All of the advice, misadvice or omission to advise Plaintiffs on that subject was concluded by Defendants by January 30, 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cAgain Plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations on this issue did not commence until their consultation with present counsel in October of 1985 when they \u2018discovered\u2019 the alleged malpractice of Defendants. However, that is merely the date when the legal theory of Plaintiffs\u2019 suit was discovered and, as in the first claim set forth above, <em>no additional facts have been, or will be, discovered since September 14, 1984 </em>relating to the Vanguard creditor\u2019s claim settlement, and therefore Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint relating to such issue is likewise barred by the statute of limitations. (Emphasis added.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The District Court concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact, and therefore granted partial summary judgment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the defendants on the theory that each claim was barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The majority points to the contention by the plaintiffs that they were not aware of the different legal positions which could have been taken until after receiving the IRS assessment notice in October, 1985, and thereafter talking to their present counsel. The majority then concludes that material issues of fact are present as to when the Youngs should have known that defendants were failing to take certain actions which the plaintiffs now claim constitute legal malpractice. I am unable to find any facts in the majority opinion which fit within that definition. The critical question is when the Youngs obtained knowledge of the essential facts, not when they obtained knowledge of their legal theories. As quoted in <em>Burgett:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cIn legal and medical malpractice cases, the courts are often confronted with such claims that the statute of limitations has been tolled. However, the Supreme Court repeatedly has explained that it is knowledge of facts rather than discovery of legal theory, that is the test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Burgett, </em>663 P.2d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 primary contention is that until they talked to another firm of attorneys, they did not know of the failure to advise them of the legal defense of lack of consideration. The plaintiffs\u2019 contention has been rejected under <em>Burgett </em>and succeeding Montana cases. As pointed out by the District Court, all of the facts which were known at the time of the 1990 order were known to the plaintiffs in 1984. There are no additional facts which subsequently became known to the plaintiffs. I conclude that the majority has disregarded <em>Burgett </em>and subsequent Montana cases interpreting \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">I would affirm the determination by the District Court that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE WEBER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
