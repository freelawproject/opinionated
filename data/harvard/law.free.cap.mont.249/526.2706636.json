Lingscheit appeals the order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, granting summary judgment to the defendants, Cascade County and the Montana Department of Revenue and denying taxpayer\u2019s request for a refund of allegedly overpaid property taxes. Taxpayer requested a refund pursuant to \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA. The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The taxpayer is the former owner of the Holiday Inn motel in Great Falls, Montana. The property was appraised by the Department of Revenue (DOR) at $2,496,924 during the taxpayer\u2019s ownership. In 1986 and 1987, the Cascade County Commissioners levied taxes on the property based on that appraised value. Taxpayer paid the taxes based on that appraisal for those years without protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Taxpayer sold the real property on November 24, 1987. The new owner protested the appraised value for the 1988 taxable year and sought relief from the Cascade County Tax Appeal Board. A hearing took place on July 28, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">At that hearing, the DOR\u2019s appraiser testified that he had not followed the guidelines set forth under <em>The Marshall-Swift Valuation Service Manual. </em>The appraiser stated that the DOR\u2019s administrative regulation, A.R.M. 42.19.101(2) requires use of the manual. The manual requires an appraiser to use his independent judgment when appraising property. The appraiser also testified that he did not appraise the property by that method; rather, he utilized the DOR\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>policy statement 83-1, which includes appraisal guidelines for franchises and provides a cost ranking of Holiday Inns.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In its order, the County Tax Appeal Board did not address whether an incorrect appraisal method was used, but merely stated that \u201c[t]he Board feels this property should be given an additional 20% reduction for Functional Obsolescence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On September 29, 1988, following the issue of that order, the taxpayer plaintiff petitioned for a tax refund for the years 1986 and 1987. The County Commissioners took no action on the petition. On February 16, 1989, the taxpayer filed an action against the county and its treasurer. The DOR intervened as a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">On July 10, 1989, the DOR moved for summary judgment. The motion was briefed and argued on May 16,1990 and on May 23,1990 the District Court issued its order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Taxpayer now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The statute at the center of the issue here is \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201cAny taxes, interest, penalties, or costs paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected ... <em>may, </em>by order of the board of county commissioners, be refunded by the county treasurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Section 15-16-601, MCA. Taxpayer asserts that the relief afforded by the statute is available to him. In his complaint he alleges that due to the inconsistency between the policy incorporated by the DOR in <em>The Marshall-Swift Valuation Service Manual </em>and the DOR\u2019s internal policy statement 83-1, the taxes levied on his former property were either illegally or erroneously collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The taxpayer relies primarily on <em>Christofferson v. Chouteau County </em>(1937), 105 Mont. 577, 74 P.2d 427; <em>and Department of Revenue v. Jarrett </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 189, 700 P.2d 985, in support of his position. In <em>Christofferson, </em>the County erroneously required the plaintiff to purchase a tax sale certificate when purchasing a parcel of state land. Several months prior, the Commissioner of State Lands had directed the county treasurer to cancel any assessments as well as unpaid taxes against the land. The plaintiff requested a refund upon discovering that the land was state land, the certificate of purchase had been cancelled, and he could not have a tax deed. This Court reversed the denial of the refund, holding that the predecessor to \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, was enacted to avoid the harsh voluntary payment common law rule in the case of illegal and erroneous tax collections. The former rule provided that taxes voluntarily paid could not be recovered. <em>Christofferson, </em>74 P.2d at 431-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>In <em>Jarrett, </em>the DOR mistakenly appraised the taxpayer\u2019s lot at $14,510.00 for 1978 through 1981 under the erroneous belief that the lot was included in a special improvement district which provided sewer facilities. The lot was not located within the district. DOR discovered the error in 1982 and reappraised the lot at $7,418.00. Taxpayer had paid the taxes for 1978 through 1981 without protest. After the lower appraisal, the taxpayer filed a claim for a refund of the overpaid taxes with the County Commissioners pursuant to \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA. The commissioners denied his claim and he appealed to the County Tax Appeal Board. The County Tax Appeal Board awarded the refund as did the State Tax Appeal Board. DOR sought judicial review, and the district court affirmed the refund on summary judgment. This Court affirmed the district court. In <em>Jarrett, </em>we noted that \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, was only available to a taxpayer who has no recourse under \u00a7 15-1-402, MCA, which provides for payment of taxes under protest and an action to recover. <em>Jarrett, </em>700 P.2d at 988, see also <em>Montana Bank of Roundup, N. A. v. Musselshell County Board of Commissioners </em>(Mont. 1991), [248 Mont. 199,] 810 P.2d 1192, 1195, 48 St.Rep. 392, 394. In this case, the taxpayer argues that at the time in 1986 and 1987 when he would have had to commence the remedy process under \u00a7 15-1-402, MCA, by filing an administrative appeal with the Cascade County Tax Appeal Board, he did not know of the existence of the alleged illegal or erroneous valuation. The property no longer belonged to him in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In this case, we first note that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the statute does not mandate that the county commissioners order a refund in all cases of an erroneously or illegally collected tax. The statute is permissive rather than mandatory. See \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA. Thus, once a legal determination is made that taxes were erroneously or illegally collected, it is still within the discretion of the Board of County Commissioners to decide if the situation warrants a refund to the taxpayer. Hence, we review the denial of the refund under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the refund. While the case is similar to <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Christofferson, </em>both <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Christofferson </em>involved mistakes in appraisals that were clerical in nature. In both cases the assessments at issue should never have been made. In this case, the taxpayer does not allege that the assessment should never have been made; rather, he alleges an error in the methodology used by the appraiser and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>DOR. At the hearing on taxpayer\u2019s successor\u2019s refund, the DOR\u2019s appraiser gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cQ. So you didn\u2019t use your own independent judgment in arriving at that cost ranking, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cQ. And you have no alternative but to assign a 3 ranking to the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cA. It was my feeling that I was obligated to use their grade level, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The appraiser admitted that he used the DOR\u2019s cost ranking policy rather than exercising his own independent judgment in appraising the property. However, his testimony does indicate that he did use his independent judgment in deciding that he was obligated to follow the DOR\u2019s cost ranking. Thus, the alleged error here is not clerical, it involves the exercise of the appraiser\u2019s judgment in determining what method he should use. Furthermore, in its order reducing the taxes of the taxpayer\u2019s successor in interest, the board did not find that an incorrect appraisal method was used, but merely stated that \u201cthe Board feels this property should be given an additional 20% reduction for Functional Obsolescence.\u201d Thus, unlike <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Christofferson, </em>it is not certain that the taxes levied against the property during this taxpayer\u2019s ownership were in fact excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The case of <em>North Butte Mining Co. v. Silver Bow County </em>(1946), 118 Mont. 618, 169 P.2d 339, supports our decision in this case. There, the taxpayer sought refunds of net proceeds paid to the County in 1942 and 1943. The value of the net proceeds reported in 1942 and 1943 had included a \u201cgovernment bonus or subsidy\u201d which in 1945 this Court held was not part of the net proceeds of a mine. The County denied the refunds and this Court upheld the refusal stating that \u201c[a] mistake in the valuation of property resulting in an excessive tax is no ground of recovery under a statute such as section 2222 [the predecessor of \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA].\u201d <em>North Butte Mining Co., </em>169 P.2d at 341. This Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">\u201cIt is our view that neither the levy, assessment nor the collection of the tax was wrongful or illegal. To constitute a wrongful or illegal levy, assessment or collection there must have been unwarranted or illegal action on the part of the taxing officials. There is none such here. The only assessment and levy that could have been made under the facts contained in the statement furnished by the plaintiff was the assessment and levy which was made and the only proper tax to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>be collected from the statement furnished was that which was collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><em>North Butte Mining Co., </em>169 P.2d at 340. Here the taxpayer\u2019s allegations pertain strictly to the method used in appraising the property, there is no evidence that if the appraiser had followed the manual that a lower valuation would definitely have been reached. It is possible that use of his independent judgment may have resulted in a higher appraisal. The taxpayer each year was provided notice that he had available the administrative appeal procedures provided by \u00a7\u00a7 15-1-402,15-7-102, and 15-15-102, MCA, if he felt the valuation for any reason was not the fair market value. He failed to use these remedies. In fight of this and the discretion conferred by the statute to the County Commissioners, we conclude that the commissioners did not abuse their discretion in denying the refund. This being strictly a legal question, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the DOR and the County. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b555-7\">JUSTICE HARRISON,</author>\n<p id=\"Atn\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">I dissent. I would find that this case is controlled by our holding in <em>Department of Revenue v. Jarrett </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 189, 700 P.2d 985, where this Court interpreted \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, in favor of the taxpayer. In <em>Jarrett, </em>the taxpayer alleged that a portion of his taxes were erroneously collected from him. Under \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, that taxpayer in <em>Jarrett </em>was entitled to recover that portion of the tax based on the erroneous assessment which he voluntarily paid in prior years. <em>Jarrett, </em>700 P.2d at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">I would hold that under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jarrett, </em>and the interpretation of \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, the taxpayer in the instant case is entitled to the recourse provided under that code section. Here the taxpayer did not own the subject property at the time he learned that the erroneous or illegal taxes had been collected or at the time he made claim for the recovery of those taxes. Nor do I find it significant to the decision that the taxpayer\u2019s successor in interest and not the taxpayer made the appeal to the county board through which the erroneous or illegal tax collection was discovered. I would further note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>that in this decision the taxpayer has met the requirements in \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, for illegal or erroneously collected taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In an early case, <em>Christofferson v. Chouteau County </em>(1937), 105 Mont. 577, 74 P.2d 427, the Court recognized that the remedy created in \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, is an exception to the common law \u201cvoluntary payment rule.\u201d That rule does not and should not bar the taxpayer from a remedy in this case. As I view this section, it provides a taxpayer a remedy for illegally or erroneously collected taxes even though he or she voluntarily paid those taxes when they became due and believed at the time that the taxes were being lawfully and correctly collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I would reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and allow the taxpayer to present his case to the trier of fact for a decision on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b556-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AJE-\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">I dissent from the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">This case was dismissed by summary judgment for the wrong legal reasons. The majority treats it as if it went to trial and failed for lack of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in opposition to the Department of Revenue\u2019s motion for summary judgment, he pointed out that he owned the property in question from January 1, 1986, through November 24, 1987, but that it was not until late 1987, after he could no longer file an appeal under \u00a7 15-1-402, MCA, that he learned about the illegal and erroneous manner in which his property had been appraised. In late 1987, he learned that the Department of Revenue had issued Policy Statement 83-1 which resulted in an appraisal precluding independent judgment of the appraiser, contrary to the <em>Marshall Swift Valuation Service Manual </em>which had been adopted by the Department of Revenue by administrative regulation, A.R.M. 42.19.101, as the acceptable method for appraising commercial improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Upon learning about the irregularity and the method by which his property had been appraised, plaintiff consulted his attorney, who advised the party that had purchased plaintiff\u2019s property. That party then brought an administrative appeal before the Cascade County Tax Appeal Board, which resulted in a reduction of the appraised value.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">George Tyner, the person who had appraised plaintiff\u2019s property, testified at the appeal hearing before the Cascade County Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Appeal Board. A partial transcript of his testimony was provided to the District Court in opposition to the Department of Revenue\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and established the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\u201cQ. Anyhow, in evaluating this property for the current appraisal cycle, you then were given a directive by Helena to rank it as a 3, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. So the Department of Revenue in Helena just arbitrarily said that the particular franchise motel here will have a 3 regardless of what physical condition it\u2019s in, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201cA. They put out the policy. I don\u2019t how they arrived at it; if it was arbitrary, if they did some market analysis, or what they did. I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cQ. But somebody in Helena ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">\u201cQ. ... determined what the quality of this particular motel was here in Great Falls, is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">\u201cQ. Did you personally determine it to be a 3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">\"A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">\u201cQ. You were simply told by Helena that it was 3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-16\">\u201cQ. So you didn\u2019t use your own independent judgment in arriving at that cost ranking, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-17\">\u201cA. No. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-18\">\u201cQ. And you have no alternative but to assign a 3 ranking to the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-19\">\u201cA. It was my feeling that I was obligated to use their grade level, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-20\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t use of the <em>Marshall Valuation Service Manual </em>mandated by the Administrative Rules of the State of Montana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-22\">\u201cQ. And you\u2019re familiar with ... Does not the <em>Marshall Valuation Service Manual </em>require the use of independent judgment in arriving at the value of the subject property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-23\">\u201cA. That\u2019s my interpretation of it, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-24\">\u201cQ. Is it a fair statement then that the Department of Revenue has made no attempt to follow its own guidelines in the <em>Marshall Valuation Service </em>which requires an appraiser to use his own independent judgment when you\u2019ve arbitrarily taken the cost classification from Helena?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cA. I would say that\u2019s a fair statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s contrary to the manual, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cQ. Prior to this policy statement coming out, I would think that it\u2019s a fair statement that this office in Great Falls exercised its own independent judgment and found it to be a class 2 building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cA. They may have. I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t have a grade entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201cQ. At any rate, the DOR say in Helena to place it at a Class 3 building, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. How does Helena really know what the quality of that building is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m assuming before they put out the policy that they did some market analysis. I don\u2019t know if they did or not. I really don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">\u201cQ. If they did any market analysis, you don\u2019t know if it included the Great Falls property or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">\"A. No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">It is clear from Tyner\u2019s testimony that the taxes levied on plaintiff\u2019s property were based upon a method of appraisal which violated the Department of Revenue\u2019s own administrative rules. The method of assessment was, therefore, erroneous and illegal, and the County Tax Appeal Board found that the assessment which resulted from that method of appraisal was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">Plaintiff was not in possession of this information within the time allowed for filing appeals under \u00a7 15-1-402, MCA. Therefore, his situation is exactly the kind of situation for which \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">Section 15-16-601, MCA, provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-17\">\u201c(l)(a) Any taxes ... erroneously or illegally collected ... may, by order of the board of county commissioners, be refunded by the county treasurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">In <em>Department of Revenue v. Jarrett </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 189, 700 P.2d 985, the issue was simply whether the value of property can be changed for past tax years pursuant to \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA, when a taxpayer has not filed any administrative appeals as to those tax years. We held that it could. In disposing of the Department of Revenue\u2019s argument that the taxpayer was barred under \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA, by failing to have availed himself of the appeal process under \u00a7 15-1-402, MCA, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cThis statute is permissive not mandatory. A taxpayer can only use this protest procedure if he is aware that his taxes may be incorrect at the time he pays them. A taxpayer who does not know he is being overtaxed will not pay his taxes under protest and can not receive a refund under section 15-1-402, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cSection 15-16-601, MCA, provides the necessary relief for respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cClearly, section 15-16-601, MCA, was not meant to be used in lieu of the section 15-1-402, MCA, requirements of paying under protest, but when the recourse of section 15-1-402, MCA, is not available, a taxpayer can obtain a refund under section 15-16-601, MCA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2d\"><em>Jarrett, </em>216 Mont. at 192-94, 700 P.2d at 987-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Furthermore, even though the relief provided for by \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, is discretionary, this Corut found that the discretion of the county commissioners can be abused, and so held on appeal. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\u201cSection 15-16-601, MCA, provides that taxes paid erroneously may be refunded by the county treasurer, <em>\u2018by order of the board of county commissioners\u2019 </em>The Yellowstone Board of County Commissioners denied respondent\u2019s request for a tax refund. However, respondent has followed the proper procedure for appealing that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">\u201cThe Yellowstone County Tax Appeal Board properly reviewed the respondent\u2019s case and determined respondent was due a refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">\"... The state board found an erroneous appraisal resulted in a mistaken levy. This finding was contrary to the finding of the county commissioners. The evidence was in dispute and the finding could go either way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">\u201cIt is the opinion of the Court that under section 15-16-601, MCA, respondent should receive a tax refund for the erroneous assessment made on his land in 1978 through 1981. We remand to the Yellowstone Board of County Commissioners with instructions to order the Yellowstone County Treasurer to issue a refund to respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-11\"><em>Jarrett, </em>216 Mont. at 194-95, 700 P.2d at 988-989.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">In spite of the majority\u2019s efforts, the circumstances in <em>Jarrett </em>are indistinguishable from the circumstances in this case. In <em>Jarrett, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>taxpayer\u2019s land was erroneously appraised based on inaccurate factual information. In this case, the taxpayer\u2019s land was erroneously <em>and </em>illegally appraised, based upon an improper method of appraisal which was based upon arbitrary and inaccurate information about its true value. In both cases, the taxpayer was unaware of the error or irregularity until after the time had expired for filing appeals under \u00a7 15-1-402, MCA. Therefore, in neither case could the taxpayer avail himself of the administrative appeal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The majority emphasizes that the statute relied upon by plaintiff uses the word \u201cmay\u201d and is therefore permissive, rather than mandatory. However, the permissive language in the statute did not prevent this Court from reversing a decision of the county commissioners in <em>Jarrett </em>when its discretion was found to have been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Furthermore, the County Commissioners in this case failed to exercise the discretion which \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, requires that they exercise. The plaintiff filed a verified petition for a refund of taxes with the County Commissioners on September 29, 1988. As of February 16, 1989, five and one-half months later, the County Commissioners had taken no action on the plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On February 16, 1989, plaintiff filed a complaint in the District Court for review of the commissioners\u2019 inaction. However, the District Court did not review the commissioners\u2019 inaction to determine whether its discretion had been abused. The District Court erroneously dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint by summary judgment based upon its erroneous conclusions about the applicability of the <em>Jarrett </em>decision to this case. The District Court concluded that <em>Jarrett </em>was inapplicable for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">1. In <em>Jarrett, </em>the Department of Revenue discovered its own error;</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">2. In <em>Jarrett, </em>the same person owned the property at the time the error was made and at the time it was discovered; and</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">3. The person who succeeded plaintiff as the owner of the property in this case paid under protest and appealed to the County Tax Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">None of the factual distinctions relied upon by the District Court were in any way material to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jarrett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">The County Commissioners gave no reasons for not granting plaintiff\u2019s petition, and the District Court failed to review the County Commissioners\u2019 inaction to determine whether they abused their discretion. Therefore, the fact that \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, is permissive is irrelevant to our review of this case. How can we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>board did not abuse its discretion when the board never exercised its discretion and we have absolutely no record from which to determine how it arrived at its decision to ignore plaintiff\u2019s petition? We do not even have any basis to conclude that it decided to ignore plaintiff\u2019s petition. For all we know, and for all plaintiff knows, the petition could have been lost on a clerk\u2019s desk and the commissioners may have never seen it.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The majority tries to distinguish <em>Jarrett </em>on the ground that the mistake in that case was clerical in nature and resulted in an assessment which should never have been made. However, that is not correct. There was ultimately a correct appraisal from which a tax was levied. The problem with the original appraisal was simply that it was \u201cerroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case is that when the appraiser failed to use his own independent judgment while appraising his property, he violated the regulations, rules, and laws established by the Department of Revenue. Therefore, the appraisal was illegal and the tax levied pursuant to that appraisal was illegal and erroneous. The majority\u2019s effort to ignore that undisputed fact is at best a classic example of sophistic reasoning. The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cThe appraiser admitted that he used the DOR\u2019s cost ranking policy rather than exercising his own independent judgment in appraising the property. However, his testimony does indicate that he did use his independent judgment in deciding that he was obligated to follow the DOR\u2019s cost ranking. Thus, the alleged error here is not clerical, it involves the exercise of the appraiser\u2019s judgment in determining what method he should use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In other words, what Tyner did was okay because he used his own judgment in deciding not to exercise his own judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Next, the majority concludes that \u201c[t]hus, unlike <em>Jarrett </em>and <em>Christofferson, </em>it is not certain that the taxes levied against the property during this taxpayer\u2019s ownership were in fact excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Of course, it is not clear that they were excessive. We can presume that they were excessive by the mere fact that the County Tax Appeal Board reduced them by 20 percent when they were appealed. However, we cannot know they were excessive because plaintiff was denied an opportunity to prove what the results would have been had the correct appraisal method been used when bis claim was dismissed by summary judgment for the wrong legal reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Finally, this Court relies on its previous decision in <em>North Butte Mining Co. v. Silver Bow County </em>(1946), 118 Mont. 618, 169 P.2d 339. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>However, the facts on which that decision was based are in no way similar to the facts in this case. In <em>North Butte Mining </em>Co., plaintiff\u2019s net proceeds taxes were computed by the State Board of Equalization based upon figures submitted by plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s figures included government bonuses or subsidies which should not have been included. This Court found that any error in that case was a direct result of actions by the taxpayer and not by the government. That was the basis for our decision that \u00a7 2222, R.C.M. (predecessor to \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA), was inapplicable. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">\u201cTo constitute a wrongful or illegal levy, assessment or collection there must have been -unwarranted or illegal action on the part of the taxing officials. There is none such here. The only assessment and levy that could have been made under the facts contained in the statement furnished by plaintiff was the assessment and levy which was made and the only proper tax to be collected from the statement furnished was that which was collected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201cSince the statute does not authorize the refund of taxes voluntarily paid <em>through mistake of law on the part of the taxpayer, </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim was properly disallowed by the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\"><em>North Butte Mining Co., </em>118 Mont. at 620, 622, 169 P.2d at 340, 341 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In this case, unlike <em>North Butte Mining Co., </em>the error or illegality complained of was committed by the State\u2019s appraiser. The plaintiff had nothing to do with the conduct complained of. Therefore, <em>North Butte Mining Co. </em>has nothing to do with the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">For these reasons, I would find that, while the County Commissioners have some discretion under \u00a7 15-16-601, MCA, they have abused that discretion by failing to act in any way. I would reverse the District Court and remand this case to the Board of County Commissioners for Cascade County with instructions to properly consider plaintiff\u2019s petition, and either grant it, or in the event that it is denied, to set forth proper findings and conclusions which form the basis for its denial so that that decision can be properly reviewed by the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
