The District Court for the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, affirmed the decision of the State Tax Appeals Board to dismiss the challenge made by petitioners and appellants to the classification of their \u201cbeneficial use\u201d interest in electrical transmission lines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The issue is whether a taxpayer whose assessment has been revised by the Department of Revenue has a right to administrative review of the assessment in its entirety, or of only those aspects of the assessment which were changed in the revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Petitioners are investor-owned utility companies which use the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) 500 kV transmission lines and have been taxed by the State of Montana for their \u201cbeneficial use\u201d of the lines running through the state. Beginning in 1984, respondent Department of Revenue (DOR) has taxed the utilities for their \u201cbeneficial use\u201d of the BPA transmission lines between Townsend, Montana, and Garrison, Montana, and since 1986 petitioners have been taxed for use of portions of the lines west of Garrison. Since 1984, petitioners\u2019 \u201cbeneficial use\u201d has been classified as Class II property under \u00a7 15-6-141, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Each year since 1984, the petitioners have paid their taxes under protest and have filed suit to protest the taxes on constitutional grounds. In 1988, DOR revised the beneficial use tax assessments for 1986 and 1987. This revision resulted in additional taxes to the petitioners of approximately $1.8 million for the two tax years in question. Petitioners attempted to file amended complaints in District Court raising the issue of whether their \u201cbeneficial use\u201d interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>had been incorrectly classified as Class 11 property. The District Court ordered that the filing of amended complaints would not be allowed. The District Court\u2019s decisions in that case were affirmed in <em>Pacific Pow. &amp; Light </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue </em>(Mont. 1991), [246 Mont. 398,] 804 P.2d 397, 48 St.Rep. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">Following the 1988 DOR revision of their taxes, petitioners also filed this appeal to STAB. The appeal included a claim that the \u201cbeneficial use\u201d interest had been incorrectly classified as Class 11 property for the years 1986 and 1987. STAB granted DOR\u2019s motion to dismiss that claim on grounds that the petitioners had not challenged the classification in a timely manner and that STAB was therefore without jurisdiction to hear the issue. Petitioners appealed that ruling to District Comb.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The District Court affirmed STAB\u2019s ruling. It noted that \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA, requires that appeals to STAB must be made within thirty days of receipt of notice of a DOR decision. Because the revised assessments DOR sent out in 1988 for the years 1986 and 1987 did not change the property\u2019s classification, the court reasoned, the appeal of the classification was not timely. The appeals on the 1986 and 1987 classifications were not made until twelve and twenty-four months after DOR classified petitioners\u2019 property as Class 11 property for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The standards for judicial review of an agency decision are set forth in \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA. The petitioners argue that the standard applicable to this case is that the court may reverse or modify if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(i), MCA. Petitioners assert that, in this instance, \u201cthe usual application of administrative expertise which forms the underlying basis for the abuse of discretion standard is not present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The District Court pointed out that STAB <em>concluded </em>that it was without jurisdiction. The standard of review of conclusions of law is merely to determine if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(Mont. 1990), [245 Mont. 470,] 803 P.2d 601, 603, 47 St.Rep. 2199, 2200. We will apply that standard of review, which allows us to consider petitioners\u2019 arguments fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Section 15-2-302, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201c(1) A person may appeal to the state tax appeal board any action of the department of revenue involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u201c(a) property centrally assessed under chapter 23 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">\u201c(2) The appeal is made by filing a complaint with the board within 30 days following receipt of notice of the department action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Petitioners argue that, because the 1988 revisions significantly modified the DOR\u2019s overall assessment methodology, the entire tax assessment is open to appeal. They claim that complex tax assessments must be viewed as a whole, and cannot be separated neatly into distinct unrelated parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We disagree. The processes of assessment of property and classification of property are codified in different statutes. See Part 1, Chapter 6 of Title 15 and Part 1, Chapter 23 of Title 15. As this Court has stated, the process of classification is separate from the assessment of property or the determination of assessed value. <em>Butte Electric Ry. Co. v. McIntyre </em>(1924), 71 Mont. 21, 227 P. 61. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c[t]he right to sue for taxes paid under protest is purely statutory. Without the statute, the right would not exist. The same statute which confers the right, fixes the time within which it must be exercised and the grounds upon which the right may be asserted.\u201d <em>Dolenty v. Broadwater County </em>(1912), 45 Mont. 261, 266, 122 P. 919, 921.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The DOR\u2019s action in 1988 changed only the assessment of petitioners\u2019 property, not its classification as Class 11 property. The function of a court in construing a writing, including a statute, is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-4-101, MCA. We conclude that under \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA, the complaint filed with STAB was limited to the action taken by DOR in the revised assessment. Under that statute, any complaint based on alleged improper classification of petitioners\u2019 property must have been filed within thirty days of the department action so classifying the property. The petitioners\u2019 claim that their property was improperly classified was untimely, and STAB was correct in concluding that it was without jurisdiction to hear that portion of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-10\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and McDonough concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
