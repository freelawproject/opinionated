The District Court held that Scratch Gravel Landfill District was immune from suit. We reverse and remand to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The issue is whether the District Court erred in determining that, as an agent of a legislative body, Scratch Gravel Landfill District was immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">James and Kathy Sanders bought a home in Western Hills Subdivision, a few miles north of Helena, Montana, in 1987. In 1989 the couple learned that the aquifer from which they obtained their water had become contaminated with toxic chemicals which they alleged were leached from a nearby dump owned and operated by Scratch Gravel Landfill District. The Landfill District claimed that the chemicals came from a different source, namely from cleaning solvents dumped for years by laundry and dry cleaning establishments into a mine shaft above the property owned by the Landfill District.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Because of the contaminated water supply, the Sanders eventually moved from their home, even though they were unable to sell it. The Sanders filed suit against the Landfill District seeking to recover damages resulting from contamination of their water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The Sanders learned of the water contamination when the Landfill District called a meeting on January 24, 1989, to inform local homeowners that the aquifer from which they obtained their water had become contaminated with toxic chemicals. The Landfill District offered to provide bottled water for drinking and cooking to those who were using contaminated water. The contaminated water was said to be safe for bathing, washing dishes, and watering lawns and gardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The Landfill District held other meetings to keep property owners informed and eventually offered a plan to the affected landowners. In a written agreement signed by the Sanders and other homeowners, the Landfill District agreed to provide a new water source and delivery system. In exchange, the homeowners agreed to release the Landfill District from \u201cliability for inconvenience, mental anguish and temporary loss of property values resulting from alleged degradation of ground water.\u201d The agreement allowed the homeowners to retain all \u201crights to seek compensation for any long-term or permanent loss of property value...\u201d except for \u201cpotential personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>claims for damages due to alleged contamination of Homeowners\u2019 ground water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Before the Landfill District could implement a new water source and system, the Sanders decided in January 1990 to move from their home claiming they wanted to escape farther health risks. According to the Sanders, realtors refused to list their home until the new water supply was in operation. A realtor eventually agreed to list their house with the understanding that full disclosure of the toxic water problems be provided to potential buyers. When the Sanders were unable to sell their house, they filed suit against the Landfill District and \u201call unknown defendants Does One through Ten\u201d seeking damages for permanent or long-term loss of value to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The issue is whether the District Court erred in determining that Scratch Gravel Landfill District was immune from suit pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Landfill District argues that it is immune from suit according to our holding in <em>Burgess v. Lewis and Clark City-County Board of Health </em>(Mont. 1990), [244 Mont. 275,] 796 P.2d 1079, 47 St.Rep. 1619. In <em>Burgess, </em>we held that an employee of the Scratch Gravel Landfill District could not sue the Lewis and Clark City-County Board of Health, which serves as the board of directors of the Landfill District. The Board, as an agent of a legislative body, the Lewis and Clark County Board of Commissioners, was immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111(2), MCA, extending governmental immunity to a \u201clegislative body or a member, officer, or agent thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">For the past number of years this Court has been divided on the question of legislative immunity granted by \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, enacted in 1977. Case after case has brought dissent. See <em>Love v. Harlem Irrigation District </em>(Mont. 1990), [245 Mont. 443,] 802 P.2d 611, 47 St.Rep. 2190; <em>Koch v. Yellowstone County </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 447, 795 P.2d 454 (Judge Larry Moran, specially concurring); <em>Eccleston v. Third Judicial District Court </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 44, 783 P.2d 363; and <em>Peterson v. Great Falls School District No. 1 and A </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 376, 773 P.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">District Court Judge Larry W. Moran, sitting with the Court in <em>Koch, </em>noted in a concurring opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201cHow beneficial it would be to see (or to write) an opinion on governmental immunity considering provisions of \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, simply concluding: \u2018the act giving rise to the cause of action is clearly administrative or executive, not legislative. Hence, governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>immunity does not attach\u2019 \u2014 or the reverse, in applicable situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7z\">That day has now arrived. The 1991 legislature amended \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, by SB 0154 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\">\u201cImmunity from suit for legislative acts and omissions. (1) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">\u201c(a) the term \u2018governmental entity\u2019 means only the state, counties, municipalities, school districts, and any other local government entity or local political subdivision vested with legislative power by statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201c(b) the term \u2018legislative body1 means only the legislature vested with legislative power by Article V of The Constitution of the State of Montana and that branch or portion of any other local governmental entity or local political subdivision empowered by law to consider and enact statutes, charters, ordinances, orders, rules, policies, resolutions, or resolves;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201c(c)(i) the term \u2018legislative act\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201c(A) actions by a legislative body that result in creation of law or declaration of public policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201c(B) other actions of the legislature authorized by Article V of The Constitution of the State of Montana; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201c(C) actions by a school board that result in adoption of school board policies pursuant to 20-3-323(1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">\u201c(ii) the term legislative act does not include administrative actions undertaken in the execution of a law or public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">\u201c(2) A governmental entity is immune from suit for a legislative act or omission by its legislative body, or any member or staff of the legislative body, engaged in legislative acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">\u201c(3) Any member or staff of a legislative body is immune from suit for damages arising from the lawful discharge of an official duty associated with legislative acts the legislative body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">\u201c(4) The acquisition of insurance coverage, including self-insurance or group self-insurance, by a governmental entity does not waive the immunity provided by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">\u201c(5) The immunity provided far in this section does not extend to any tort committed by the use of a motor vehicle, aircraft, or other means of transportation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">\u201cSection 3. Effective date \u2014 retroactive applicability. [This act] is effective on passage and approval and applies retroactively, within the meaning of 1-2-109, to causes of action that have not been reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to final judgment on or before [the effective date of this act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Section 2-9-111, MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We conclude that <em>Burgess </em>is no longer controlling. In view of the revisions in \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, as above set forth, including the effective date, this issue must be reconsidered by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We reverse the decision of the District Court and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES GRAY, McDONOUGH, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
