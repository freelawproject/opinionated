We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Both parties raise the issue of whether the District Court erred in allocating the proceeds of certain stock in Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Bismarck, Inc. (Bismarck Bottling). John also raises the issue of whether the District Court erred in failing to take properly into consideration Mary\u2019s expected inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Mary Irene Johnston married John Richard Johnston on October 30, 1980, in Bellingham, Washington. Following their marriage, the couple resided in Bellingham. John was employed at a local Coca-Cola bottling company and Mary was employed at Rainier Brewing. The couple adopted one child who is now an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Mary\u2019s father, Carl Boustead, resided in Bismarck, North Dakota, where he owned and operated Bismarck Bottling, a closely-held corporation. It was Carl\u2019s desire to have his family close to him and he oftentimes expressed his wish that Mary and John move to Bismarck.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">In February 1982, Carl offered John employment at Bismarck Bottling. John accepted this offer and in June 1982, the parties moved to Bismarck. John proved to be a hard-working and diligent employee of Bismarck Bottling. He continually assumed more responsibility within the company and was eventually promoted to operations manager in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">In December 1982, Carl caused Bismarck Bottling to issue ten shares of its stock to John and Mary. A similar issue of ten shares was made to Mary\u2019s brother, Hunt, and his wife. Two years later, in December 1984, Bismarck Bottling issued another ten shares of its stock to John and Mary, and also to Hunt and his wife. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>October 1985, Bismarck Bottling issued twenty shares of its stock to John and Mary and twenty shares to Hunt and his wife. In total, John and Mary were issued forty shares of Bismarck Bottling stock, which amounted to 11.85% of the issued stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In 1982, the value of Bismarck Bottling was between $3.2 and $4 million. Carl sold Bismarck Bottling in 1986 for approximately $10 million. John and Mary\u2019s 11.85% interest in Bismarck Bottling generated proceeds of $889,000 pre-tax and $689,000 after tax. The proceeds were placed in an investment account at First Bank in Bismarck. By way of additional deposits and reinvestment of earnings, the account grew in value to $866,071.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">After Carl sold Bismarck Bottling in 1986, the new owners hired John as the plant manager. John remained as plant manager for approximately one year. Thereafter, John and Mary relocated to Billings, Montana. In August 1988 the couple separated, and in July 1989 the District Court dissolved their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In determining the property settlement, the court noted that Carl gave numerous gifts to the couple over a four-year period, and, at the time of the dissolution, the value of these gifts exceeded the net worth of the couple. In addition to the Bismarck Bottling stock, these gifts included 1) cash used for payments on the parties\u2019 home in Bellingham; 2) the equity in a home in Bismarck owned by Carl, which the parties later sold, using the proceeds as a down-payment for another home; 3) automobiles; 4) cash used to purchase certificates of deposit; 5) cash used to build a garage; 6) cash used for home renovations; and 7) an educational trust for the parties\u2019 son.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In its findings, conclusions, and order dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage, the court awarded Mary, <em>inter alia, </em>all of the value of the Bismarck Bottling stock at the time the stock was sold and the proceeds invested. It awarded John half of the appreciation in the investment account which arose after the Bismarck Bottling stock was sold in 1986 and the proceeds thereof invested, totaling $82,581.29. The court later amended this property allocation and awarded John an additional $141,360 from the investment account \u201cafter consideration of the marital appreciation of the parties\u2019 ownership interest in [Bismarck Bottling] and [John\u2019s] marital contribution to that appreciation\u201d from 1982 to 1986. From this order, Mary appeals and John cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Did the District Court err in allocating the proceeds of the sale of the Bismarck Bottling stock?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In determining the division of assets in a marriage dissolution, each case must be examined individually, with an eye to the unique circumstances before the court. <em>In re Marriage of Jorgensen </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 294, 299, 590 P.2d 606, 610 (citation omitted). A court must also consider the statutory criteria under \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, and <em>equitably </em>apportion the marital assets. It is not necessary that an equitable distribution be an equal division of the marital assets. E.g., <em>In re Marriage of Myers </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 173, 682 P.2d 718. Regarding marital assets traceable to gifts, \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cIn dividing property... acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent ... the court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201c(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201c(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201c(c) whether or not the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Our standard of review is whether the District Court\u2019s distribution is based on substantial credible evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Johns </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 256, 258, 776 P.2d 839, 840. This Court will only overturn the findings of a district court where they represent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Johns, </em>776 P.2d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Mary argues that the District Court erred when it awarded John an additional $141,360 based on marital appreciation of the Bismarck Bottling stock and John\u2019s marital contribution to that appreciation from 1982 to 1986. She asserts that because the stock was a gift from her father, it should be considered as principally a gift to her. Furthermore, she argues that the appreciation in the value of the stock occurred in 1986 and was substantially due to the unique franchise agreement held by her father, and not to any contribution John made to Bismarck Bottling from 1982 to 1986. Accordingly, she maintains that John is not entitled to any marital appreciation of the Bismarck Bottling stock for these years.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Mary cites <em>In re the Marriage of Herron </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 396, 608 P.2d 97. In <em>Herron, </em>this Court reversed a district court, holding that it abused its discretion when it allocated a 50/50 property division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>where most of the property of the marital estate was traceable to gifts or bequests from the wife\u2019s father. This Court further provided in <em>Herron:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cGeorge Robbins thus gifted or bequeathed over a quarter of a million dollars to the Herrons dining the course of their marriage. The property was given to the Herrons jointly, but Mr. Robbins certainly did so to provide for his only daughter. The property should be considered as principally gifts to Mrs. Herron.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Herron, </em>608 P.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In the present case, there was a clear conflict in the evidence on the nature of the gifts of Bismarck Bottling stock from Carl to Mary and John. Carl testified that the stock was a gift intended for Mary\u2019s comfort and to effectuate his own estate plan. However, John testified that the stock was given to him and Mary in recognition of his hard and diligent work in improving the financial position and the case sale position of Bismarck Bottling. The court initially agreed with Mary, as indicated in finding #22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201c[tjhese gifts from Carl and his wife to John and Mary were motivated by Carl\u2019s desire to provide for his daughter\u2019s comfort and to effectuate an estate plan. The gifts were given to them jointly, but Carl did so to provide for his only daughter. Carl\u2019s gifts totaled more than the net worth of the parties. Accordingly, the marital estate should be considered as principally gifts to Mary ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support this finding. However, in its amended findings of fact and judgment, at additional finding #18, the court casts doubt on the continued vitality of its earlier finding by stating that John \u201cwas a joint recipient of the stock.\u201d John argues that, as a joint recipient of the stock, he was an acquiring spouse and is entitled to one-half of <em>all </em>of the investment account traceable to the proceeds of the Bismarck Bottling stock, not just the appreciation of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">There were clear conflicts in the evidence on the reasons for the increased value of Bismarck Bottling between 1982 and 1986. Mary\u2019s expert testified that the increase in the value of the business occurred precipitously in 1986 due to the unique nature of the franchise agreement. In addition to his own testimony, John presented the testimony of the district manager for Coca Cola during the years 1983 to 1986, who testified that, in his opinion, Carl was essentially retired from the business during those years and that John worked very hard at Bismarck Bottling as \u201can integral part of what happened there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The District Court found, in its amended findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>judgment at \u201cadditional finding of fact\u201d #18, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArV\">\u201c[gliven the clear record as to respondent\u2019s contribution to the preservation and appreciation of the parties\u2019 stock in Coca-Cola Bottling of Bismark [sic], Inc., and the fact that the husband was a joint recipient of the stock, the Court finds it equitable to allocate one-half the appreciation to the husband, being $141,360.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">That finding is supported by substantial evidence presented by John and supports the court\u2019s award to John of half of the marital appreciation of the parties\u2019 ownership in Bismarck Bottling. However, the court also left standing its finding #22 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201c... John also asserts that he had contributed to the increase in value of the Carl\u2019s [sic] Coca-Cola business in Bismarck and that he increased the annual case sale by over 300,000 cases between 1982 and 1985. However, this was only a 7.4 percent average annual case sale increase as compared to an average annual case sale increase of 11 percent for the period 1974 through 1982. The substantial increase in the value of the company was related to the unique franchise agreement held by Carl, as well as other market conditions prevailing at the time of the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The above findings of the District Court are internally inconsistent. However, the court did make findings which support its division of the marital estate. It found that the Bismarck Bottling stock should be considered as principally a gift to Mary. It also found that John contributed to the preservation and appreciation of the stock. The absence of a 50/50 property distribution and the finding that John contributed to the preservation and appreciation of the stock distinguish this case from <em>Herron. </em>Without approving of the court\u2019s contradictory findings, we affirm the District Court\u2019s allocation of the proceeds of the Bismarck Bottling stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Did the District Court err in failing to take properly into consideration Mary\u2019s expected inheritance?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, provides that the court shall consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfuture acquisition of capital assets and income\u201d when apportioning a marital estate in a dissolution proceeding. Here, John argues that the court failed to adequately consider Mary\u2019s expected future inheritance upon Carl\u2019s death. Carl testified that he gave all the generous gifts to Mary and John for Mary\u2019s comfort and to effectuate an estate plan. He further testified that Mary could expect a \u201cpittance\u201d of any future inheritance following his death as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>planned to devise his remaining estate, if any, to \u201csome of my favorite charities and a fine hospital in Bismarck.\u201d Basing Mary\u2019s future acquisition on an inheritance to be received upon the death of her father is highly speculative and thus, inappropriate. We therefore hold that the District Court did not err regarding consideration of Mary\u2019s expected inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-5\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, GRAY, McDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b328-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s failure to equally divide the proceeds from the sale of stock in the Bismarck Bottling Company, which was jointly owned by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The disposition of the disputed property is controlled by \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, which requires that district courts <em>\u201cequitably </em>apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">That portion of \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, which relates to the interest \u201cof the other spouse\u201d in property acquired by gift is not applicable to this case because the District Court made a specific finding of fact that the parties were joint recipients of the stock. The proceeds from the sale of the stock were deposited in a joint account and at all times dealt with as a marital asset prior to the entry of the divorce decree. To deny John any interest in the proceeds from the sale of jointly owned stock which had an after-tax value of $689,000 at the time of sale, was not equitable and was a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The following facts illustrate the inequity of the property distribution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">When John and Mary were married, John was employed by a Coca-Cola bottler in Bellingham, Washington. However, Carl Boustead preferred that his daughter return to Bismarck. Therefore, John and Mary were persuaded to return to Bismarck where John took a reduction in salary to take a position in top management of Bismarck Bottling.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">John worked in the sales department, the delivery force, the production team, the management team, and in the warehouse. He eventually became operations supervisor, and by 1985 was promoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>to the position of operations manager. For all practical purposes, the day-to-day operations were managed by John while Mary\u2019s father spent more and more time relaxing at his winter home in Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">From 1982 to 1985, John and Mary were jointly given 40 shares of stock in Bismarck Bottling which represented 11.85 percent of the total outstanding stock. In its Amended Findings of Fact, the court specifically found that the parties were j oint recipients. It did not find that the stock was given to Mary alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">There is no question that John contributed to the appreciation of the stock. The District Court specifically found that the value of total outstanding stock in Bismarck Bottling increased from $4 million in 1982, when John went to work for the company, to $10 million in 1986, when the company was sold. In other words, the value of the company increased by 150 percent under John\u2019s leadership.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">There was no evidence, nor any specific findings by the District Court, that Mary did anything to contribute to the appreciation of Bismarck Bottling or the stock that was issued to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">John was described by other employees at the plant as a hard worker who brought professionalism to the bottling business, while Mary\u2019s father and brother were depicted as being superficially and irregularly involved in the business\u2019s management.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">After the Bismarck Bottling Company was sold in 1986, the new owners hired John as the plant manager. During the 12 months of operation prior to the sale, with Mary\u2019s family members involved in its management, the company produced profits in the neighborhood of $700,000. However, during the 12 months after acquisition, under John\u2019s sole management, the profits increased to $1.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">When the bottling company was sold in 1986 for approximately $10 million, the parties\u2019 11.85 percent interest generated proceeds of $889,000, which netted them $689,000 after taxes. The proceeds were placed in an investment account at First Bank of Bismarck.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">As part of the sale, John executed a non-compete agreement, as well as a consulting agreement. The total contributions to the sale proceeds from John\u2019s consulting and non-compete agreements amounted to $112,157, which was also placed in the parties investment account. These proceeds had nothing to do with the stock gifted to Mary and John, and had nothing to do with any efforts on the part of Mary. Yet, the District Court\u2019s decree totally deprives John of this income which resulted directly and exclusively from his efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Less than two months ago in In <em>re Marriage of Keedy </em>(Mont. 1991), [249 Mont. 47,] 813 P.2d 442, 48 St.Rep. 572, we affirmed a District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Court decree which awarded Carol Keedy 50 percent of the appreciated value of baseball cards acquired by her husband as an 11-year-old boy which, for the most part, had been stored in his mother\u2019s garage in Nebraska during the couple\u2019s marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">It has been said that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. However, it certainly has a place in jurisprudence. If so, it would not be apparent to the average lawyer in Montana who tries to reconcile our two most recent decisions on the division of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In the <em>Keedy </em>case, pre-acquired marital property was, for all practical purposes, divided equally between the parties, even though the non-acquiring spouse contributed nothing to its appreciation. In this case, property which was given jointly to both parties was distributed exclusively to the spouse who contributed nothing to its appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">I believe the district courts of this state deserve better guidance than this regarding future disposition of marital and non-marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">For these reasons, I would reverse the District Corut\u2019s disposition of the parties\u2019joint investment account, and divide it equally between Mary and John.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
