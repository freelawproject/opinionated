We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">We frame the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">1. Should the District Court have set aside the February 20,1991, order under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. because of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, or any other reason justifying relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">2. Does a State District Court have the authority in a dissolution action to order the United States Office of Personnel Management to pay directly to a former spouse a share of a civil servant\u2019s monthly disabihty retirement annuity payments?</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by ordering Mrs. Castor to deliver all personal property in her possession awarded to Mr. Castor by the dissolution decree, after she had received in full her share of retirement benefits, past-due maintenance payments, and attorney\u2019s fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding $250 in attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Castor?</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">After 28 years of marriage, on April 1, 1988, Gavin D. Castor and Shirley M. Castor were granted a dissolution of marriage. Mr. Castor was required to pay $675 per month spousal maintenance until the couple\u2019s home in Utah was sold. Maintenance would then be reduced to $300 per month until Mrs. Castor became eligible for Social Security retirement benefits. Mr. Castor was ordered to pay $4,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to Mrs. Castor as her share of his civil service retirement pension. The parties were allowed to keep certain personal property then in their possession, and Mrs. Castor was ordered to turn over certain personal property to Mr. Castor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">On October 15, 1990, Mr. Castor moved to modify the dissolution decree by reducing the amount of spousal maintenance payments and moved to require Mrs. Castor to turn over titles to vehicles and other personal property awarded to Mr. Castor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On December 6, 1990, Mrs. Castor requested a continuance of the hearing on the motion for modification of the dissolution decree because notice of the hearing scheduled for that date was not received until November 30, 1990. The motion was granted, and the hearing was reset for January 23, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">On January 22, 1991, the District Court ordered the January 23 date for the hearing to be vacated because of a conflict in the court\u2019s calendar and rescheduled the hearing for February 14, 1991. Both parties received written notice of the continuance. Although Mr. Castor\u2019s counsel received the notice, he failed to see the new date of the hearing. As a consequence, neither Mr. Castor nor his attorney appeared at the hearing on February 14. After waiting for forty minutes, the District Court heard testimony from Mrs. Castor and entered judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In its February 20, 1991 order, the District Court required the United States Office of Personnel Management to continue to pay Mrs. Castor $582 per month from Mr. Castor\u2019s monthly retirement benefits until March 1991. At that time, the Office of Personnel Management was ordered to withhold $500 per month for Mrs. Castor. Of the $500 withheld, $300 was for spousal maintenance and $200 was to be applied to the balance of Mrs. Castor\u2019s $4,000 share of retirement benefits, $6,066 in past-due spousal maintenance, and $250 in attorney\u2019s fees. In approximately three years when these obligations to Mrs. Castor had been paid in full, the Office of Personnel Management was ordered to withhold $300 per month for spousal maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In addition, after Mrs. Castor\u2019s share of retirement benefits, past-due maintenance, and attorney\u2019s fees were paid in full, Mrs. Castor was required to deliver to Mr. Castor the personal property and title to vehicles awarded to him by the dissolution decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">On March 13,1991, the District Court denied Mr. Castor\u2019s motion to set aside the order modifying the dissolution decree. From these judgments, Mr. Castor appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Should the District Court have set aside the February 20, 1991, order under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R for mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, or other reason justifying relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Sections (1) and (6) of Rule 60(b), M.R.CivR. provide that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment for \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\u201d or \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Mr. Castor\u2019s counsel argues that he is \u201conly human\u201d and that his mistake in failing to notice the rescheduled date of the hearing on Mr. Castor\u2019s motion should not have been imputed to his client. Mr. Castor\u2019s counsel maintains that medical evidence of his client\u2019s disability would have changed the outcome of the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">If the district court exercises its discretion in appraising or weighing facts of a particular case, on review this Court determines whether the district court, in varying degrees, has abused or misused its discretion. See <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(Mont. 1990), [245 Mont. 470,] 803 P.2d 601, 603-04, 47 St.Rep. 2199, 2200. If the district court\u2019s decision does not involve the public policy that cases should be tried and decided on their merits, then the scope of review is the standard abuse of discretion test.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">When the district court sets aside a default judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), allowing the case to be tried on its merits, a showing of great abuse of discretion is necessary to reverse the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Graham v. Mack </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 165, 172, 699 P.2d 590, 594. But when the district court has refused to set aside a default judgment, \u201cno great abuse of discretion need be shown to warrant reversal.\u201d <em>Lords v. Newman </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 359, 364, 688 P.2d 290, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Generally, \u201cmistake,\u201d \u201cinadvertence,\u201d and \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d require some justification for an error beyond mere carelessness or ignorance of the law on the part of the litigant or his attorney. <em>Lomas and Nettleton Co. v. Wiseley </em>(7th Cir. 1989), 884 F.2d 965, 967. Mr. Castor\u2019s counsel has not offered an explanation other than his failure to note the rescheduled date of the hearing. Such a mistake is not enough to require setting aside a judgment under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. See <em>Watson v. Fultz </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 364, 369, 782 P.2d 361, 364 (no relief from judgment when attorney failed to notice hearing date in opponent\u2019s motion to amend findings); <em>Griffin v. Scott </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(1985), 218 Mont. 410, 710 P.2d 1337 (no relief from judgment when attorney failed to read mail for five weeks because of work accumulated during his absence).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The general ride is that neglect of an attorney is attributable to the client. <em>Myers, </em>235 Mont. at 236, 766 P.2d at 866. Mr. Castor\u2019s counsel relies on <em>Lords v. Newman </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 359, 688 P.2d 290, in which we held that attorney neglect can be excusable on the part of the client upon the proper showing. The attorney in <em>Lords, </em>after making a general court appearance, \u201ctotally abandoned his clients and disappeared from sight.\u201d <em>Lords, </em>212 Mont. at 367, 688 P.2d at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In <em>Paxson v. Rice </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 521, 706 P.2d 123, we distinguished <em>Lords </em>because, although the attorney in <em>Paxson </em>failed to act in response to numerous requests by opposing counsel, he had not abandoned his client and left the state. We held that the attorney\u2019s procrastination in filing answers and other documents was \u201ca type of neglect which is properly attributable to a client, and which we distinguish from the abandonment in Lords.\u201d <em>Paxson, </em>217 Mont. at 525, 706 P.2d at 126. Similarly, the neglect in this case is properly attributable to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In addition, the judgment of a district court can be set aside for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Rule 60 (b) (6), M.R.Civ.P. Generally, relief is afforded under subsection (6) of Rule 60(b) in extraordinary situations when circumstances go beyond those covered by the first five subsections or when a party in whose favor judgment was entered has acted improperly. <em>Fuller v. Quire </em>(6th Cir. 1990), 916 F.2d 358, 360; <em>In re Marriage of Tesch </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 240, 245, 648 P.2d 293, 296. We hold that Mr. Castor has not shown that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the order of February 20, 1991 under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Does a State District Court have the authority in a dissolution action to order the United States Office of Personnel Management to pay directly to a former spouse a share of a civil servant\u2019s monthly disability retirement annuities?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Mr. Castor claims that under \u00a7 25-13-608, MCA, his retirement benefits, as \u201cdisability benefits,\u201d are exempt from execution; therefore, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to order the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>States Office of Personnel Management to pay a share of his disability retirement benefits directly to Mrs. Castor. Mrs. Castor counters that according to an Arizona case, <em>Villasenor v. Villasenor </em>(App. 1982), 134 Ariz. 476, 657 P.2d 889, the civil service retirement annuities Mr. Castor receives do not constitute \u201cdisability benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The issue of apportionment of civil service pensions between civil service \u201cretirement\u201d benefits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336 or \u00a7 8338 and civil service \u201cdisability\u201d benefits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337 has been addressed in cases relating to division of property between spouses in community property states. See <em>Levy v. Office of Personnel Management </em>(Fed. Cir. 1990), 902 F.2d 1550; <em>Villasenor v. Villasenor </em>(App. 1982), 134 Ariz. 476, 657 P.2d 889. Although Mr. Castor asserts that these cases do not apply because Montana is not a community property state, the cases are instructive regarding apportionment of retirement and disability benefits as part of disability retirement annuities. Under \u00a7 25-13-608, MCA, although veterans\u2019 and social security benefits are subject to execution if they are levied for child support or spousal maintenance, \u201cdisability or illness benefits\u201d are exempt. Section 25-13-608(l)(d), MCA. If the monthly benefits Mr. Castor is currently receiving qualify as \u201cdisability\u201d benefits, such payments are exempt from execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The California Supreme Court addressed apportionment of military retirement and disability pay in <em>In re Marriage of Sternquist </em>(Cal. 1978), 21 Cal.3d 779, 148 Cal.Rptr. 9, 582 P.2d 96. The husband became disabled, but remained in military service for twenty-six years. His regular \u201clongevity\u201d retirement annuity consisted of 65 per cent of his base pay; his \u201cdisability\u201d retirement annuity was 75 per cent of his base pay. Consequently, the husband elected to receive disability retirement. The court recognized that the husband\u2019s disability pay not only compensated him for loss of earnings because of compelled early retirement and personal suffering, but \u201calso serves the objective of providing support for the serviceman and his spouse after he leaves the service.\u201d Sternquist, 582 P.2d at 101. The court awarded half of the annuity which was construed as the \u201cretirement\u201d component of the husband\u2019s retirement disability annuity to the wife and ruled that the \u201cdisability\u201d component was the husband\u2019s separate property. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In <em>Levy v. Office of Personnel Management </em>(Fed. Cir. 1990), 902 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>F.2d 1550, the court applied the principles set forth in <em>Sternquist </em>to civil service pensions. The court recognized that retirement pay based on disability has two components: (1) compensation to the civil servant for loss of earning power and personal suffering; and (2) retirement support. <em>Levy, </em>902 F.2d at 1553. Accordingly, the rule for apportionment of retirement benefits is that the amount the civil servant receives each month as disability over and above what would have been received as longevity retirement benefits is the civil servant\u2019s separate property; the remainder is divisible community property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The formula applicable to civil service retirement benefits was detailed in <em>Villasenor. </em>A civil service employee can receive retirement and disability benefits under Chapter 83, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8301-8351 (1986), of the Civil Service Code. <em>Villasenor, </em>657 P.2d at 891. A civil servant can qualify for Chapter 83 benefits in several ways. When a civil service employee meets the criteria for age and length of service, he or she is entitled to \u201cimmediate retirement\u201d benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336. One who is separated after completing at least five years of civil service also qualifies for an annuity, but payments do not begin until the employee is 62 years old, referred to as \u201cdeferred retirement.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8338. Finally, an employee with at least five years of civil service who becomes disabled is eligible for \u201cdisability retirement,\u201d with benefits payable immediately. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337. Mr. Castor is receiving the third type of benefits, \u201cdisability retirement,\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Annuities for immediate, deferred, and disability retirement are all paid from the same fund, consisting primarily of contributions in the form of deductions from employees\u2019 pay. The annuity amounts for all three forms of retirement are calculated by use of the same basic formula, based upon the employee\u2019s average annual pay for the three highest-earning years and years of service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339; <em>Villasenor, </em>657 P.2d at 891. Disability retirement is earned during years of service just as any other retirement pension, and disability is but one of several conditions causing rights in the plan to vest. Villasenor, 657 P.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Depending on how many years of service the civil servant has, disability retirement can have both a \u201cretirement\u201d component and a \u201cdisability\u201d component. The \u201cdisability\u201d component becomes proportionately smaller as the years of service increase and \u201cdisappears altogether for those who \u2018fall through the cracks\u2019 by, for example, having served more than 21.9 years but being too young to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>immediate retirement, or being over 60 years but having too few years of service to take immediate retirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Castor, age 58 with 28 years of civil service employment, is one for whom the \u201cdisability\u201d component disappears.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">From the analysis presented in <em>Villasenor, </em>we conclude that Mr. Castor\u2019s monthly annuity is accurately characterized as \u201cretirement\u201d benefits, rather than \u201cdisability\u201d benefits. Hence, the District Court is not precluded by \u00a7 25-13-608, MCA, from ordering the United States Office of Personnel Management to pay Mrs. Castor a share of Mr. Castor\u2019s monthly disability retirement annuity. We note that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8345(j)(l) allows civil service retirement benefits to be paid directly to a former spouse as provided by a court decree of dissolution. We hold that the District Court did not err in ordering the United States Office of Personnel Management to pay directly to Mrs. Castor a share of Mr. Castor\u2019s monthly disability retirement annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion by ordering Mrs. Castor to deliver all personal property in her possession awarded to Mr. Castor by the dissolution decree, after she had received in full her share of retirement benefits, past-due maintenance payments, and attorneys fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Mr. Castor alleges that the District Court should have ordered Mrs. Castor to turn over personal property awarded to him by the dissolution decree because no Montana statute allows the court to order the items to be held until his obligations are paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Section 40-4-209, MCA, allows the court to order a person obligated to pay maintenance who is delinquent in an amount equal to the total of six months of support payments to \u201cpost bond, give a mortgage, or provide security or guaranty for so long as there is a support delinquency.\u201d Section 40-4-209(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Mr. Castor\u2019s support obligation for six months was $4,040; the court found that he owed $6,066 in past-due maintenance payments. Allowing Mrs. Castor to keep personal property awarded to Mr. Castor in the dissolution decree until support obligations have been paid can serve as \u201csecurity or other guaranty\u2019 as provided for by \u00a7 40-4-209, MCA. We hold that the District Court stayed within the guidelines of \u00a7 40-4-209, MCA, and did not abuse its discretion in ordering Mrs. Castor to deliver personal property belonging to Mr. Castor after the delinquent support obligation had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding $250 in attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Castor?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Mr. Castor contends that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding attorney\u2019s fees without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The court may award attorney\u2019s fees in dissolution cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201cThe court from time to time, after considering the financial resources of both parties, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under chapters 1 and 4 of this title and for attorney\u2019s fees ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Section 40-4-110, MCA. Mr. Castor asserts that the District Court did not properly consider the \u201cfinancial resources of both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Since the statute is permissive, the appropriate standard of review is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Sullivan </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 292, 299-300, 794 P.2d 687, 691-692. We have previously stated that because an award of $400 in attorney\u2019s fees approaches <em>de minimis, </em>were we to reverse, the costs on remand could easily exceed the amount originally awarded. We thus upheld the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>In re Marriage of Chapin </em>(1982), 202 Mont. 153, 156, 655 P.2d 991, 992. The same principle applies in this case. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by awarding $250 in attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Castor.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES GRAY and McDonough concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\"> In Montana disability benefits may be included in the marital estate. <em>In re Marriage of Cooper </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 175, 179, 793 P.2d 810, 812.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b528-12\">JUSTICE WEBER,</author>\n<p id=\"AU_F\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">On October 15, 1990, Mr. Castor moved to modify the dissolution decree. The petition was set for hearing on December 6,1990. On the date of that hearing, Mrs. Castor requested a continuance of the hearing because notice of hearing was not received until November 30, 1990. The motion was granted and the hearing was reset for January 23,1991. On January 22,1991, the District Court, on its own order, vacated the hearing of January 23, 1991, and rescheduled the hearing for February 14,1991. As pointed out in the majority opinion, both parties received written notice of the continuance. The counsel for Mr. Castor who had initiated the proceeding failed to note the new date of the hearing. As a result neither Mr. Castor nor his attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>were present at the hearing; and after waiting 40 minutes, testimony was taken from Mrs. Castor, and judgment was entered in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Counsel for Mr. Castor admits that it was his own failure to note the February 14 hearing which caused Mr. Castor, his client, and himself to miss the hearing. He does not in any way attempt to cover this up. He points out that his practice was to maintain two calendars with notes of scheduled court appearances and filing deadlines and to notify clients promptly when they must attend a hearing. He failed to follow that practice in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The majority points out that it will not review a decision to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion absent abuse of discretion. That is only a partial statement of the rule as we have most recently applied it. Using a federal Seventh Circuit Court case as authority, the majority further states that generally mistake, inadvertence and excusable neglect require some justification beyond an error, mere carelessness or ignorance of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">This Court\u2019s 1990 authority on the same issue is set forth in <em>Blume v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 465, 791 P.2d 784. In <em>Blume </em>the plaintiff filed a complaint against Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (Metropolitan) and service was made on the State Auditor and Commissioner of Insurance. The complaint, summons and discovery documents were mailed by certified mail and were received by Metropolitan. Apparently the same were lost. Metropolitan failed to file an answer and a default judgment was eventually entered in the amount of $185,986.43. In <em>Blume </em>we cited the following as the controlling standard to be applied in considering the District Court\u2019s refusal to set aside the default judgment entered against Metropolitan. The unanimous Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cWhere a trial court denies a motion to set aside a default judgment the standard of review is that <em>no great abuse of discretion need be shown to warrant reversal, </em>or, alternatively, <em>\u2018slight abuse\u2019is sufficient to reverse an order refusing to set aside a default. </em>The <em>Lords </em>court, which drew a distinction between the standards of review applied to cases where motions to set aside default judgments had been granted and those that had been denied based its holding on two basic tenets: (1) every litigated case should be tried on its merits and default judgments are not favored and (2) trial courts have a certain amount of discretion when considering a motion to set aside a default judgment ...\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\"><em>Blume, </em>791 P.2d at 785. The Court then set forth a great deal of the evidence submitted by Metropolitan to support its motion to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the default judgment, including the entry from the Metropolitan log which showed that the mail was received from the Commissioner on February 9, 1989; and affidavits of various other persons who normally would have received information and acted in connection with litigation, but all failed to do so. The Court concluded that the evidence produced by Metropolitan demonstrated that its failure to appear was not due to any inexcusable neglect or disrespect for court or judicial process. They pointed out that it was a mystery what happened to the summons and complaint after it arrived at Metropolitan \u2014 although there is no argument that it did arrive at Metropolitan. The majority in <em>Blume </em>then quoted from a 1905 Montana case which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><em>\u201cNegligence or inadvertence directly traceable to a party litigant or his attorney, </em>no less excusable than that disclosed by this record, <em>has many times been held sufficient to warrant the opening of a default, </em>and trial courts have not infrequently been reversed for their refusal to set aside defaults under such circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq-\"><em>Blume, </em>791 P.2d at 787. <em>Blume </em>then concluded that the neglect in the 1905 case, where an inexperienced stenographer signed an acceptance of service and then misplaced a complaint and summons, was comparable to the loss of summons and complaint in <em>Blume. Blume </em>then pointed out that the judgment would adversely effect Metropolitan because the amount of the judgment exceeded $185,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In 1990, we concluded in <em>Blume </em>that an unexplained loss of a summons and complaint and subsequent failure to appear was excusable neglect. Under the present majority opinion, we are concluding that the unexplained failure to appear for a continued hearing was somehow more reprehensible than the loss of a summons and complaint. I find no basis for such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">I conclude that the neglect on the part of counsel for Mr. Castor was excusable in the same manner that the neglect on the part of Metropolitan and its various personnel was excusable. As in <em>Blume, </em>the judgment here adversely effected Mr. Castor. As in <em>Blume </em>Mr. Castor\u2019s counsel moved promptly to set aside the default. In addition, we point out that Mr. Castor in this case was the party who originally petitioned for the modification and who has been denied his opportunity to present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Based upon <em>Blume </em>I would conclude that the District Court abused its discretion and vacate the default judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
