The District Court denied the motion on the grounds that it was untimely and it would impeach the plaintiff\u2019s principal\u2019s deposition testimony. The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Hobble-Diamond\u2019s motion to amend its complaint and the pretrial order, and, if so, whether such error was harmless. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">On January 2, 1986, Hobble-Diamond filed a complaint against Triangle seeking damages allegedly sustained as the result of deficiencies in the design, installation, and repair of a pivot sprinkler system at the plaintiff\u2019s ranch property. Trial was held on July 19, 1989, and the court entered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law against Hobble-Diamond on all issues on November 16, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Hobble-Diamond\u2019s complaint alleges damages resulting from the malfunction of two main components in the irrigation system installed by Triangle, namely irrigation pivot Nos. 3 and 6. The complaint does not allege any damages arising from the malfunction of pivot No. 5. In his deposition taken February 13, 1987, Hobble-Diamond\u2019s principal, \u201cMonty\u201d Kimble gave the following testimony regarding pivot No. 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201cQ. Mr. Kimble, directing your attention to pivot No. 5. Are you claiming to have had some problems with surging and with the pump on Pivot No. 5?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cA. That was a problem that we had for some time, yes. It was \u2014 I\u2019m going to say it probably went on for almost the full season of\u201984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201cQ. Describe for me those problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cA. Well, I\u2019m not an engineer, so \u2014 hydraulic engineer, so I don\u2019t really know the cause of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cQ. I just want to know what you perceive the problem to have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cA. The water would surge, and the pump \u2014 The pivots would stop. We had a surge, and I understand the surge was because the pump wasn\u2019t adequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201cQ. And according to the contract, Pump No. 5 was rated a thousand gallons per minutes; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201cA. I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">\u201cQ. Has that pump ever been changed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">\u201cA. Pump has not been changed, but the nozzles, unbenounced [sic] to me, with one of Triangle\u2019s or whatever the case may be, employees. His name is Blain \u2014 I don\u2019t know his last name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">\u201cQ. Leninger [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">\u201cA. He stated to me that in order to stop the pump from surging, that they lowered the capacity of the nozzles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">\u201cQ. And did that take care of the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">\u201cA. Yeah, I haven\u2019t had any problem since that has been done, and I really don\u2019t know when it was done. It was done unbenounced [sic] to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">\u201cQ. But it was done by Triangle personnel, to the best of your recollection, \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">\u201cQ. or their predecessor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-20\">\u201cQ. Are you claiming to sustain any crop loss of any sort with respect to the surge in the season of 1985?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-21\">\u201cA. No, my claim is, we had to spend a lot of time there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-22\">\u201cQ. My inquiry must be directed to what, if any, amount of money damages are you claiming as a result of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-23\">\u201cA. <em>I don\u2019t think I am</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-24\">\u201cQ. You\u2019re not claiming anything ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-25\">Prior to trial, Hobble-Diamond filed two motions to amend its pleadings. On January 11, 1989, some twenty-three months after Kimble was deposed and one week prior to the original trial date, Hobble-Diamond moved to amend its complaint to include crop loss under pivot No. 5. Hobble-Diamond alleges that at this time it became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>aware of damages resulting from problems with this system. That month Hobble-Diamond received two reports \u2014 the first prepared by Triangle\u2019s employee, Mr. Lininger, the second prepared by an independent engineering consultant \u2014 discussing the inadequacies associated with pivot No. 5 of the system. On January 19, 1989 the District Court denied this first motion and continued the trial date to July 19,1989. On March 3,1989, Hobble-Diamond again moved to amend its complaint to allege crop loss due to pivot No. 5. Along with this motion, Hobble-Diamond filed the affidavit of Kimble, alleging that he had believed low crop yields in the vicinity of pivot No. 5 had been due to factors other than inadequate watering but now believed \u2014 based on the reports \u2014 that the reduced yields were directly a result of the inadequate system. The reports were filed as exhibits to the affidavit. The District Court denied the motion on the grounds that it was (1) untimely and (2) it would impeach Kimble\u2019s deposition testimony. Hobble-Diamond only appeals the order of the District Court denying its second motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.R controls amendments to pleadings. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">\u201cRule 15(a). Amendments. A party may amend his pleadings once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, he may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. <em>Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires </em>... (Emphasis added.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We have interpreted the Rule liberally, allowing amendment of pleadings as the general rule and denying leave to amend as the exception. <em>Priest v. Taylor </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 370, 377-78, 740 P.2d 648, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Although leave to amend is properly denied when the amendment is futile or legally insufficient to support the requested relief, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend where it cannot be said that the pleader can develop no set of facts under its proposed amendment that would entitle the pleader to the relief sought. <em>Letizia v. Prudential Bache Securities, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1986), 802 F.2d 1185, 1189 (construing the nearly identical Federal Rule). Here, Hobble-Diamond supported its motion to amend with evidence that it had new information available to it regarding possible crop loss due to an inadequate pivot No. 5. To what extent the proposed amendment would impeach Kimble\u2019s prior deposition testimony is relevant to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>credibility as a witness rather than the merits of the amendment. Generally, the merits of a proposed amended claim are not to be considered, unless the claim is frivolous, meritless, or futile. <em>Davis v. Coler </em>(N.D. Ill. 1984), 601 F. Supp. 444, 447. Hobble-Diamond was precluded from introducing evidence \u2014 including the engineering reports \u2014 at trial regarding pivot No. 5. We cannot determine, based on the record developed at trial, whether the amendment was frivolous, meritless, or futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Furthermore, \u201c[l]eave of court to amend a complaint in order to correct a mistake should be freely given when the amendment will not mislead defendants to their prejudice.\u201d <em>Haugen Trust v. Warner </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 508, 512, 665 P.2d 1132, 1135. In <em>Haugen Trust, </em>the defendants inadvertently failed to allege damages for a particular year in their third party complaint. The District Court denied the defendants leave to amend, and this Court reversed holding that such denial was an abuse of discretion. <em>Haugen Trust, </em>665 P.2d at 1135. While in this case the mistake was not inadvertent, it appears to have been based on a lack of information that later became available to Hobble-Diamond regarding the specific inadequacies of pivot No. 5. The District Court denied the first motion on January 19, 1989, and in the same order continued the trial date until July 19. Hobble-Diamond filed its second motion on March 3, some four months prior to the rescheduled trial date. If the amendment were granted, defendants would have had sufficient time to conduct additional discovery, and would not have been prejudiced by the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201cRefusal to permit an amendment to a complaint which should be made in the furtherance of justice is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Haugen Trust, </em>665 P.2d at 1135. We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Hobble-Diamond leave to amend its complaint. Furthermore, we see no merit in Triangle\u2019s contention that the error was harmless. Hobble-Diamond was precluded from asserting a cause of action based on inadequacies in pivot No. 5, and suffered obvious prejudice due to the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The order of the District Court is REVERSED and the cause REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER, and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
