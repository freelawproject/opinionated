And if any portion of his estate thus held, be included in the proceedings, it vitiates the whole, although the other tenant in common assents to it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-9\">APPEAL by John Romig and David Romig, intermarried with two of the daughters of Philip Rudy, deceased, from the decree of the orphans\u2019 court, of <em>Union </em>county, confirming the proceedings upon a proceeding by writ of partition and valuation of the real estate of the said deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-10\">In the petition presented to the court for the writ of partition and valuation, it was set out that the said Philip Rudy, deceased, died seised of several tracts of land, and also \u201c an undivided moiety of a tract of land containing three acres.\u201d This tract he held as tenant in common with Michael Obermyer, who, upon the writ of partition, after it went into the hands of the sheriff' for execution, made an endorsement, \u201cagreeing that the jury of inquest may divide and appraise the whole.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-11\">The inquisition was held, the land appraised and awarded by the court to one of the heirs, who entered into recognizances for the payment of the shares of the other heirs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-12\"><em>Donnel, </em>for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVt\">cited 3 <em>Penn.

The proper course, to divide the estate of an intestate tenant in common, was pointed out in Feather a. Stroh\u0153cker, 3 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>505, and ought .to have been pursued here; for the consent of the other tenant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>common could not give the orphans\u2019 court a jurisdiction which the legislature had withheld from it. As then we cannot, quash the writ and inquisition in part, the whole must be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"ArI\">Proceedings quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
