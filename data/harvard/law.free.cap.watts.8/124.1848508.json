This suit was referred to arbitrators under the arbitration law of 181Q. On the 30th of October 1819, the arbitrators awarded for the plaintiff 517 dollars 50 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-13\">On the 20th day of December, 1826, the said George Michael Brobst died intestate, seised of certain real estate which descended to his heirs, viz.

No statute limits the lien of a judgment in favour of the heirs of the debtor; nor is there reason or necessity for it. After a reasonable time for the presentment of demands, it is proper to secure the heirs from secret debts, that they may improve their estates without risking the expenditure; but the propriety of it vanishes before a debt of record, and the plaintiff, here, was clearly entitled to execution of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
