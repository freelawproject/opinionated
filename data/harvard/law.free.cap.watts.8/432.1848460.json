The .testator surely never contemplated that issue, left by either devisee before the age of twenty-one, should be disinherited; and the estate must have vested to preclude th\u00e9 possibility of it. It is plain, however, that the interest given for the support of the family, was a particular one; and that the rule operated on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
