This may have been one of the conditions on which the party stipulated to accept the note. It has been held that an agreement of this nature, if made in writing, and constituting part of the record, is binding. 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle. </em>Here the agreement is. in writing, and appears on the note sued upon and in the record. It constitutes, therefore, <em>prima facie, </em>a bar to this appeal. At the same time it is very possible that a party might make out a special case, which should entitle him to an appeal, notwithstanding such a stipulation as the present one: in the same manner as where a judgment is entered by warrant of attorney, the court- will, -notwithstanding, open it, and let the party into a defence under certain special circumstances. If the contract were illegal, as for instance where it was given for a gambling or wagering debt, or as a consideration for the commission of a crime, or upon any other consideration, either <em>malum prohibitum, </em>or <em>malum in se, </em>no admission or waiver of the parties would avail to enforce an illegal transaction, by excluding the right of appeal. 1 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>P. </em>261; 2 <em>East, </em>34. Various other cases may be put where the appeal would not be taken away by such a clause in a note. These, however, are exceptions. As a general rule, it would seem that, by such stipulations the maker of the note gives up his right to an appeal as a matter of course, under the provisions of the acts of assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
