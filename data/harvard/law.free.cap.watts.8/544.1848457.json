Bollman against Doctor A. Walter. This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for boarding and lodging the defendant. The defendant pleaded a set-off, and alleged that while he boarded with the plaintiff, he rendered services, as a physician, by attending the plaintiff\u2019s family. On the trial, he produced a paper writing of original entries; and, having been sworn, he answered as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-11\">\u201c This paper contains my original entries of professional services rendered to Mr Bollman (the plaintiff). The entries are in my own handwriting. About a couple of days elapsed, sometimes, after the services were rendered, before the entries were made: generally, .the entry was made on the day I rendered the service. I made an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>entry at the time; I had no book. I did not intend to charge Mr Bollman any thing at the time, although I made the entry, provided his conduct towards me should be what was right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">The defendant then offered the entries in evidence, which was objected to by plaintiff, and the court (Dallas, president) rejected the same, which was the subject of the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-7\">Vanamridge, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar3u\">cited 13 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>127; 4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>3.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>M'Candless, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADtO\">cited 1 Rawle 435; 2 Watts 441; 4 <em>Rawle </em>291.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b545-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"As7\">This paper is not such a book as the law requires. The entries ought to be made in the course of the parties\u2019 business; and here the defendant would seem not to have been in business at all, for he did not seek it. They ought also to be made with an intent to charge, and such an intent is disproved by the defendant\u2019s own oath. Besides, the entries were not made regularly as the services were rendered. A day-book ought to be a register of the day\u2019s transactions, but cannot be a safe one if they are not registered at the close of the day, or during the succeeding one. Certainly more than-one day ought not to intervene, unless there were something very peculiar in the nature of the business. Here there was nothing to require or excuse postponement, and yet two days were sometimes suffered to intervene, and it would be dangerous to give the usual effect to entries thus deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
