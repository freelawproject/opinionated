(Dkt. No. 25 (\"FAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7-22.) Glaser raises tort claims, as well as claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20290\">\n    N.Y.

Nos. 39, 52, 64.) For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motions to dismiss are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and are presumed true for purposes of the instant motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Aaron Glaser is a 31-year-old male and was a resident of the State of New York at all relevant times. (FAC \u00b6 6.) Defendant Upright Citizens Brigade LLC (\"UCB LLC\") is a New York company that operates comedy theatres and training centers in New York City and Los Angeles. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.) Upright Citizens Brigade Training Center, LLC (\"UCBTC LLC\") is a separate entity, also incorporated in New York, that operates two Manhattan theatres together with UCB LLC and that provides training in improvisational and sketch comedy. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.) Glaser refers to these two entities collectively as the \"New York Entities.\" (FAC \u00b6 12.) Defendant Shannon Patricia O'Neill serves as the New York Entities' Artistic Director, and Alex Sidtis serves as UCB LLC's Managing Director, which also entails managing the operations of UCBTC LLC. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Glaser was a student of the New York Entities from 2006 to 2010, and he served as an intern for the New York Entities\n   from 2007 to 2008. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42, 47.) Following the conclusion of his time as a student in 2010, Glaser continued to perform at the New York Entities' theatres; at the time of the August 2016 meeting that gave rise to this suit, Glaser was producing and hosting his own monthly stand-up comedy series. (FAC \u00b6 49.) Glaser alleges that his stand-up show was a \"hit,\" and that the New York Entities took advantage of his show's popularity by advertising their products at his performances and by requesting that he provide his services to a private client. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.) During this period, Glaser \"several times\" assisted the New York Entities' teachers in the execution of their curricula by performing student works at their classes. (FAC \u00b6 52.) Glaser represents that he was compensated for his efforts during this period in the form of free drinks, free admission tickets to shows hosted by the New York Entities, and the opportunity to showcase his work for casting directors. (FAC \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Glaser alleges that various entities in Los Angeles, California, also operate under the Upright Citizens Brigade umbrella. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 7, 16.) These entities, which Glaser collectively refers to as the \"California Entities,\" include Defendants Upright Citizens Brigade Training Center LA, LLC; UCB Inner Sanctum, LLC; and UCBTLA, LLC. (FAC \u00b6 17.) Defendant Susan Hale is the Managing Director of the California Entities. (FAC \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant 5419 Sunset Properties, LLC (\"5419 Sunset\") is an entity that owns a theatre and office space that it leases to the California Entities. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Glaser alleges that 5419 Sunset and the New York and California Entities (collectively, the \"UCB entities\" or \"UCB\") all operate \"as one unified entity.\" (FAC \u00b6 35.) More specifically, he alleges that these entities all share common employees, management, and staff (FAC \u00b6 23), including Hale, who serves as \"an owner, employee and/or representative of 5419 Sunset, in conjunction with her duties as Managing Director of the California Entities\" (FAC \u00b6 22). Glaser further alleges that 5419 Sunset is a \"dummy entity\" created by the New York and California Entities in order to evade the constraints placed on educational institutions by Title IX. (FAC \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The August 11, 2016 Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 9, 2016, Glaser received an email inviting him to attend an August 11, 2016 meeting at \"UCB's main offices\" in Manhattan. (FAC \u00b6 59.) Present at that meeting were Glaser and Defendants O'Neill and Sidtis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the meeting, O'Neill and Sidtis told Glaser that he had been accused of having committed one or more rapes sometime prior to 2011, and that following an investigation into those accusations, the New York and California Entities had resolved to ban Glaser from their properties and from attending or performing at any of their shows or classes. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Glaser maintains that he is innocent of the rapes he has been accused of. (FAC \u00b6 94.) Glaser alleges that UCB erroneously found him to be culpable for this conduct because UCB conducted a one-sided investigation in which he played no part, and because he was not afforded a hearing at which he could contest those allegations or confront his accusers. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 61, 90.) Sidtis also allegedly never delivered on a promised opportunity for Glaser to appeal his ban. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Glaser alleges that the New York and California Entities declined to afford him these procedural protections because of their bias against men, a bias that stemmed from UCB's effort to refute public accounts of its past failures to properly address allegations of male-on-female sexual violence. (FAC \u00b6 66-67.) In support of\n   these allegations of gender bias, Glaser has attached to his First Amended Complaint a news article from the week following his ban that describes a long history of ignored allegations of male-on-female sexual harassment at UCB. (FAC \u00b6 66 n.1; Dkt. No. 25-2 at 3-4.) The article also details the widespread and heated public reaction that followed on the heels of Glaser's ban. (Dkt. No. 25-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Aftermath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite Defendants' promises that the allegations against Glaser would remain confidential (FAC \u00b6 62), internet users began sharing that information on Twitter within days of the August 11, 2016 meeting (FAC \u00b6 68). Plaintiff alleges that either Sidtis or O'Neill must have leaked that information, because they \"were in such a ready position to do so,\" presumably because they had been the only others present at the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As news of the allegations against Glaser spread, one UCB performer eventually generated a \"fake press release,\" purportedly authored by UCB, that described Glaser as a rapist. (FAC \u00b6 69.) Though UCB served cease and desist letters on the author of the fake press release, UCB declined to publicly rebut or comment on the allegations against Glaser, and it instead issued only a generic statement confirming that UCB takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 71, 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Glaser alleges that the phrase \"Aaron Glaser is a rapist\" ultimately \"went viral across the internet.\" (FAC \u00b6 72.) His First Amended Complaint describes in detail the negative impact this public notoriety had on his life and career. For example, following the public disclosure of the contents of the August 11, 2016 meeting, Glaser was no longer able to book comedy venues for his shows (FAC \u00b6 77), one business entity for which Glaser had recorded a commercial pulled his content from the internet (FAC \u00b6 78), his roommates (who were also UCB students) expelled him from his residence (FAC \u00b6 79), and he received death threats by phone and via his social media accounts (FAC \u00b6 80). Glaser eventually became suicidal, and he began taking antidepressant medications \"to get him through such dark times.\" (FAC \u00b6 83.) He alleges that he will now live the rest of his life bearing the false label of \"rapist.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Glaser commenced this action by filing a complaint against Defendants UCB LLC, O'Neill, and Sidtis (\"the Initial Defendants\") on February 4, 2018. (Dkt. No. 1.) After the Initial Defendants moved to dismiss Glaser's claims against them (Dkt. No. 15), Glaser filed the operative First Amended Complaint, this time asserting claims against the Initial Defendants, the California Entities, Hale, 5419 Sunset, and UCBTC LLC. (FAC \u00b6 1.) Before the Court now are three motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint: (1) the Initial Defendants' motion, filed on August 1, 2018 (Dkt. No. 39); (2) the California Entities, Hale, and 5419 Sunset's motion, filed on August 20, 2018 (Dkt. No. 52); and (3) UCBTC LLC's motion, filed on October 1, 2018 (Dkt. No. 64). The Court is now prepared to rule on Defendants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Glaser's First Amended Complaint asserts federal claims under Title VII (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 188-212) and Title IX (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 117-55), as well as various state- and city-law claims (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 156-87, 213-49). All Defendants move to dismiss Glaser's Title IX claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 41 at 34-39; Dkt. No. 54 at 22-25; Dkt. No. 66 at 10-12.) They also, collectively, move to dismiss each of Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. No. 41 at 10-34; Dkt. No. 54 at 17-22; Dkt. No. 66 at 4-9.) Finally, the California Entities, Hale, and 5419 Sunset move to dismiss Plaintiff's claims against them pursuant to Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(5) for improper service and for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 54 at 6-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court concludes that while Defendants have failed to identify any basis for calling into question this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction over Glaser's Title IX claims, Defendants are correct that Glaser has failed to state a claim for relief under either Title VII or Title IX. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Glaser's remaining state- or city-law\n   claims or to address the California Entities, Hale, and 5419 Sunset's Rule 12(b)(2) and Rule 12(b)(5) motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Each of the Defendants moves to dismiss Glaser's Title IX claims against them for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 41 at 34-39; Dkt. No. 54 at 22-25; Dkt. No. 66 at 10-12.) According to Defendants, Glaser has failed to demonstrate that any of them operates an \"education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\" which is a statutory requirement for any Title IX claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Defendants maintain that Glaser's \"conclusory assertion[s]\" to the contrary are \"insufficient to meet Plaintiff's burden\" of demonstrating subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims. (Dkt. No. 41 at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants' contention amounts to a merits-based challenge to the sufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations, rather than an attack on this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. \"[W]hen Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\"\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh v.

Indeed, the tax deductions and clerical support obtained by the volunteer appear\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   valuable than the drinks and tickets Glaser obtained for his work, yet the Second Circuit rejected even the former as insufficient for Title VII remuneration purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940813\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/122/#p126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And because the Second Circuit has held that the networking opportunities that came along with volunteering in a local professional organization were incidental to that volunteering, so too here must this Court hold that the opportunities for professional growth that came along with Glaser's stage time at a local comedy theater were incidental to his performances.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940813\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/122/#p126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, a brief comparison of Glaser's allegations with the types of non-financial compensation the Second Circuit has described as sufficiently substantial to qualify as remuneration confirms the insufficiency of the former for purposes of Title VII. In\n   <em>\n    Pietras\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit described a mix of benefits composed of \"(1) a retirement pension, (2) life insurance, (3) death benefits, (4) disability insurance, and (5) some medical benefits\" as a sufficient basis for finding Title VII employee status.\n   <em>\n    Pietras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663685\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/468/#p473\">\n    180 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   471 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663685\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/468/#p473\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663685\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/468/#p473\">\n    at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that a Title VII plaintiff's receipt of \"cash payments and food stamps in return for [ ] work,\" where those \"payments\n   equaled the minimum wage times the number of hours [ ] worked,\" along with \"other benefits including transportation and child care expenses and eligibility for workers' compensation,\" were sufficiently \"substantial\" to qualify as remuneration.\n   <em>\n    City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9282567\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/83/#p91\">\n    359 F.3d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Glaser has not alleged facts sufficient to show that the compensation he received from UCB LLC is in any way comparable to the benefits received by the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Pietras\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, Glaser has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that he was compensated in a manner sufficient to qualify him as an \"employee\" of UCB LLC at the time of the conduct at issue in this suit. All of his Title VII claims must therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Title IX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Glaser's Title IX claims are similarly deficient. Because Glaser's allegations establish that he was neither a student nor an employee of Defendants as of August 2016, the period in which he was allegedly discriminated against on the basis of gender, he fails to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that Title IX affords him a right to relief for that discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Glaser has expressly pleaded that his time as a student at UCB ended years before Defendants' allegedly discriminatory conduct. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42, 49.) In response to Defendants' argument that this Court should dismiss Glaser's Title IX claims because he was not a student in any of their educational programs at the time of their allegedly discriminatory conduct (Dkt. No. 41 at 25-26; Dkt. No. 54 at 21; Dkt. No. 66 at 8-9), Glaser contends that because\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   alleged misconduct occurred while he was still a student at UCB, he should be entitled to sue Defendants under Title IX for their disciplinary treatment of him a number of years later (Dkt. No. 67 at 26-27; Dkt. No. 81 at 16). Glaser's argument misses the point. The incident giving rise to Glaser's Title IX claims is Defendants' allegedly discriminatory disciplining of Glaser, not Glaser's alleged rapes. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 131 (\"[T]he New York Entities and California Entities and 5419 Sunset's disciplinary process violated ... Title IX....\"); 135 (\"[T]he New York Entities and California Entities and 5419 Sunset's actions in the investigation and adjudication of the allegations against Plaintiff Glaser were ... in clear violation of Title IX's requirements....\").) The proper question before the Court is thus whether Title IX provides a person in Glaser's position as of August 2016 a private cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Title IX has been construed to prohibit gender discrimination against both students enrolled in federally supported educational programs and employees involved in such programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

No. 80 at 10).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Glaser does not argue that his continued involvement in Defendants' educational programs after his time as a student had ended was sufficient by itself entitle him to sue under Title IX. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Dkt. No. 67 at 26-27.) Nor could he, at least given the factual allegations in his First Amended Complaint. His allegation that he had \"several times during the latter part of his tenure with the New York Entities\" volunteered to perform at their classes (FAC \u00b6 52) lacks the specificity needed to support the conclusion that he remained a participant in their educational program as of August 2016, particularly because that \"tenure\" appears to refer to a six-year period spanning from 2010 to 2016 (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    FAC \u00b6 49). Similarly, Glaser's broad allegation that the \"New York Entities and California Entities' curriculum is intimately bound with its performances\" (FAC \u00b6 55) does nothing to establish\n    <em>\n     his\n    </em>\n    right to sue under Title IX. Other than his allegation that he had at \"several [unspecified] times\" assisted with Defendants' classes following his time as their student (FAC \u00b6 52), Glaser alleges no facts regarding\n    <em>\n     his own\n    </em>\n    continued involvement with Defendants' educational program. There is thus no plausible basis, based on the facts alleged in the First Amended Complaint, for concluding that Defendants' August 2016 conduct resulted in Glaser's being \"subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity\" in violation of Title IX.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Glaser concedes that his \"claim for employment discrimination ... under Title IX\" may be made subject to the \"same employment relationship analysis applied above to [his] Title VII claims,\" and he articulates no basis for applying any different definition of \"employee\" in the contexts of Title VII and Title IX. (Dkt. No. 67 at 26.)
