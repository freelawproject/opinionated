ECF No. 1-2. The defendants, The Phoenix Insurance Company (\"Phoenix\") and The Travelers Insurance Company (\"Travelers\"), timely removed the civil action to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1. The plaintiff alleges that it was provided insurance under a policy for the Monongalia County Commission (\"County Commission\") sold and serviced by the Dyer Insurance Group (\"Dyer\"). ECF No. 1-2 at 7. MCDA was also allegedly insured under a separate Travelers policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   SouthCo Development LLC (\"SouthCo\") had previously filed a civil action against MCDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff contends that the County Commission, on behalf of MCDA filed a claim under Travelers Policy # ZLP-14T25627 seeking indemnification and defense from defendants in the SouthCo action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The plaintiff further alleges that Phoenix summarily denied coverage under that policy, and transferred the claim to Travelers Policy # 680-241L2418.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Travelers purportedly denied the claim stating that the alleged injury did not fall under the coverage, and that Phoenix later provided a detailed denial of coverage under Travelers Policy # ZLP-14T25627.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Phoenix allegedly determined that MCDA was not entitled to insurance coverage since it was not a \"board\" of the County Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff alleges claims based on breach of contract, unfair trade practices in violation of West Virginia Code \u00a7 33-11-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , bad faith, and promissory estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-13. The plaintiff seeks damages, interest, attorneys' fees, and all costs of the action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 26, 2018, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 35. The defendants assert that the sole issue in this case is whether MCDA would constitute a \"board\" and, therefore, would be insured under the County Commission's policy with Phoenix. ECF No. 36 at 10. The defendants cite the insurance contract language which defines \"board\" as \"any board, commission, or other governmental unit or department that: (1) is under your jurisdiction; and (2) is funded and operated as part of your total operating budget.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The defendants conclude that MCDA is not an insured under the Public Entity Management Liability Coverage Form of Phoenix's policy insuring the County Commission, because it is not under the County Commission's jurisdiction, and is not funded and operated as part of the County Commission's total operating budget.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For support that MCDA is a public corporation which is not under the jurisdiction or control of the County Commission, but rather is an autonomous public corporation managed and controlled by its board of members, defendants cite the following: the enabling statute for the Development Authority,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-21-1\">\n    W.

Moreover, defendants assert that the doctrine of estoppel cannot extend insurance coverage since there was no representation of coverage made by Phoenix or its agent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 18-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 41. In its response to defendants' motion for summary judgment, plaintiff asserts that there are factual issues that preclude ruling on coverage, namely that defendants' representatives were found to have affirmatively stated to the County Commission that MCDA was covered by the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff further contends that MCDA falls under the County Commission's jurisdiction, arguing, among other things, that: (1) MCDA is a creation of the County Commission, (2) that the County Commission is the only entity that is capable of appointing or removing members from MCDA's Board of Directors, and (3) that certain expenditures of development funds require the approval of the County Commission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, plaintiff argues that with regards to funding, there is no policy provision requiring that the entirety of funds spent by MCDA come from the County Commission or a provision that defines funding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Referencing the County Commission's annual budget, plaintiff asserts that the County Commission provides funding to MCDA in a variety of ways.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff further contends that defendants have waived the right to raise other policy exclusions, because they failed to list the exclusions in its declination of coverage letter that found MCDA not insured under the County Commission's policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 13-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, plaintiff asserts that, with respect to the underlying claims in the SouthCo civil action, the negligence claims are distinct enough from the contract claims under West Virginia law to allow for coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants then filed a reply to plaintiff's response in opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 42. In their reply, defendants state that there are no material issues of fact precluding summary judgment on MCDA's reasonable expectations or estoppel claims for coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, defendants state that MCDA failed to provide proof of a representation, to offer any evidence of prejudice, and that it had been issued a separate policy of insurance through Travelers from 2001 to 2016, in which it had property coverage and general liability coverage on a building that it owned and out of which it operated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 2-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, defendants reiterate that MCDA is not under the jurisdiction of the County Commission and is not funded and operated as part of the County Commission's total operating budget.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, defendants indicate that MCDA failed to address: (1) the County Commission's jurisdictional statute that fails to specifically list MCDA; (2) MCDA's broad range of powers granted by statute; (3) that MCDA is a legal entity being a public corporation by statute; and (4) that the County Commission does not have the power to manage and control MCDA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, defendants state that plaintiff fails to explain how MCDA is operated out of the County Commission, and to provide sufficient evidence of funding that it received that enables it to function.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants further argue that principles of contract interpretation do not support a finding that MCDA is insured under the County Commission's policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1-3\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to plaintiff's argument that defendants waived their right to raise other policy exclusions, defendants note that Phoenix determined that MCDA was not an insured and so those other potential exclusions were moot and that MCDA's attempt to create coverage by an implied waiver runs against law set forth in Syl. Pt. 6,\n   <em>\n    Potesta v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11776079\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/202/308/\">\n    202 W.

Lastly, defendants assert that the underlying claims in the SouthCo civil action are barred by breach of contract, fraudulent conduct, and unlawful personal gains policy exclusions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff also filed a motion and memorandum in support of summary judgment on the issue of insurance coverage. ECF Nos. 37 and 38. First, plaintiff asserts that insurance coverage was denied based upon an erroneous belief that MCDA is not funded or under the jurisdiction of the County Commission. ECF No. 38 at 4. With respect to the jurisdictional issue, plaintiff asserts that the County Commission created MCDA, is the sole entity capable of appointing and removing members of the Board of Directors of MCDA, and that certain expenditures of development funds require the explicit approval of the County Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. With respect to the funding issue, plaintiff contends that MCDA is funded by the County Commission in a variety of ways (i.e. grants of real estate and the partial payment of the salary of MCDA's director).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12. Plaintiff also references the County Commission's annual budget to support its conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Plaintiff then states that coverage exists even if MCDA is not a \"board\" under the policy, because MCDA and the County Commission reasonably expected insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants Phoenix and Travelers filed a memorandum in opposition to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of insurance. ECF No. 40. First, defendants assert that MCDA is not insured by Phoenix since it is not under the jurisdiction of the County Commission and since\n   MCDA is not funded and operated as part of the County Commission's total operating budget.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-16. Second, defendants argue that the doctrine of reasonable expectations does not afford coverage to MCDA under the County Commission's policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Specifically, defendants refer to plaintiff's complaint which alleges a claim based on promissory estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. But, even if asserted correctly, defendant contends that MCDA has not met the elements under either estoppel or the reasonable expectations doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a reply to defendants' response to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of insurance. ECF No. 43. First, plaintiff asserts that MCDA is under the jurisdiction of the County Commission and that it is funded by the County Commission; therefore, it qualifies as an insured under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-6. Second, plaintiff asserts that defendants raised factual issues that preclude summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By court order, counsel for the parties appeared before the Court to present oral argument on the fully briefed motions for summary judgment on March 22, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of showing the absence of any genuine issues of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

To qualify under this provision, does MCDA have to receive direct funding from the County Commission? Or can the County Commission provide indirect funding to MCDA? Does MCDA have to be totally funded by the County Commission or can it be partially funded? Based upon the words of the insurance policy alone, it is impossible for this Court to determine what is meant by the phrase \"is funded and operated as part of your total operating budget.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for both parties indicated that they have not found any case law, treatise, or other authority to clarify the ambiguity in \"funded and operated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Therefore, the ambiguities in the policy's definition of \"your boards\" with respect to \"is funded and operated as part of your total operating budget\" creates a question of fact as to the objectively reasonable expectations of the parties when the insurance contract was entered into. However, the next section of this opinion explains why despite this ambiguity, this Court finds MCDA is not an insured under the Public Entity Management Liability Coverage Form of Phoenix's policy insuring the County Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    MCDA is not \"under the jurisdiction\" of the County Commission\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although the Public Entity Management Liability Policy Coverage Form insuring agreement does not define \"jurisdiction,\" the term should be given its plain, ordinary meaning, and the court may turn to dictionary definitions for instruction.\n   <em>\n    Grand China Buffett &amp; Grill, Inc. v.

The alleged representations occurred after the issuance of the policy and cannot give rise to an estoppel claim. ECF No. 35-12 at 5-6.

Va. Mar. 4, 2008). Here, plaintiff must show that a genuine issue of material fact exists relating to the argument that defendants\n   created a misconception about the insurance policy coverage that the County Commission purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In support of its claim that the reasonable expectations doctrine does not apply to the facts of this case, defendants point to the testimony of Eldon Callen, who served on the County Commission from 2011 through 2016. ECF No. 40 at 20-22. Mr. Callen stated that he could not say with certainty whether any of Travelers representatives ever made any representation concerning whether MCDA would be covered under Travelers policy insuring the County Commission. ECF No. 40-4 at 32. Mr. Callen stated that he does not recall whether prior to the SouthCo suit being filed, any representations were made by Mr. Horton that MCDA would be covered as an insured under the County Commission's policy with Travelers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. He further stated Fred Horton of Dyer did not make any representations to him about MCDA coverage under Travelers policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-35. Defendants assert that Mr. Callen's testimony shows that he had concluded that MCDA was covered on his own accord. ECF No. 40 at 20-21. Defendants further note that plaintiff has not provided any information in its responses to discovery that would show representations made by Phoenix or its authorized agent at the policy's inception that MCDA was insured as a \"board\" under the County Commission's policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff also points to Mr. Callen's testimony and specifically references a portion of his testimony that states he did not understand the type of insurance the County Commission had through Travelers. ECF No. 38 at 17. Plaintiff references the following portion of Mr. Callen's deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q. Were there any sort of bid packages that the County Commission was provided?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A. In my recollection, there was. But I remember specifically questioning in great detail that the coverages were complete and all the entities were covered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q. What entities are you referring to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A. The Development Authority specifically, and all the other things that were to be covered that were - to my knowledge, was all part of the County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Plaintiff explains that Mr. Callen stated that his belief predated his term on the County Commission and that Mr. Callen asked insurers whether \"everything is covered\" during a work session/bid process related to the County Commission's possible purchase of insurance, which took place in late 2014 or 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 43 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This Court believes that Mr. Callen's conclusion that he thought MCDA would be covered under the County Commission's policy seems to be based upon his own assumptions and beliefs about coverage and MCDA's relation to the County Commission rather than on any reasonable expectations created by the words or conduct of defendants' agents or other representatives. Consequently, this Court concludes that the doctrine of reasonable expectations does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 35 ) is GRANTED and plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 37 ) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    At oral argument, on March 22, 2019, counsel for the plaintiff indicated that it is his understanding that \"Phoenix is a wholly owned subsidiary of Travelers, or at least a related company, and they jointly market and serve insurance.\" Counsel for the defendants did not object to this characterization, and stated \"Phoenix is a subsidiary of the Travelers umbrella.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    After the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 35 ), counsel for the plaintiff and counsel for the defendants filed a stipulated dismissal without prejudice of The Traveler's Insurance Company of Connecticut and The Traveler's Insurance Company as parties in the above-styled action.

ECF No. 39.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Defendants indicate that MCDA was insured under a separate policy with Travelers for almost 15 years on a building that it owned, located on Hartman Run Road.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 35-16. However, MCDA's coverage with Travelers on that building is not relevant for determining whether or not MCDA reasonably relied on representations of defendants regarding coverage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
