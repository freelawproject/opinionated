(\"Border Transfer\"). They claim Border Transfer improperly treated them as independent contractors when they were, in fact, employees and that, as a result, Border Transfer unlawfully deducted certain business expenses from their pay. Plaintiffs bring claims under the Massachusetts\n   Wage Act against Border Transfer and its former president Patrick McCluskey on behalf of a certified class of individuals who entered into contracts with Border Transfer to provide delivery services, personally provided such services for Border Transfer for at least forty hours per week, and were classified as independent contractors. Defendants move for summary judgment on the class claims on the basis that, even if Border Transfer misclassified its drivers as independent contractors, they are not entitled to recover the various deductions they seek. Defendants also move for summary judgment on the individual claims of class member Humberto Chantre. Finally, Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on whether Border Transfer misclassified the class members as independent contractors and whether McCluskey is individually liable for Border Transfer's alleged Wage Act violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 108) and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on liability (Docket No. 122). The Court also\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   as moot Plaintiffs' motions to strike the testimony of Thomas N. Hubbard (Docket No. 115 and Docket No. 145) because resolution of the motions for summary judgment does not depend on his expert opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Headquartered in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Border Transfer is a property broker registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). As a broker, Border Transfer arranges home delivery services for large retail stores like Sears.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Border Transfer itself does not deliver goods. Instead, it contracts with FMCSA-authorized motor carriers to perform home deliveries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14). It has around fourteen motor carriers working at any given time out of its Westwood, Massachusetts facility. It runs between fifteen and twenty delivery routes per day and a few more around the holidays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Border Transfer contracts with its motor carriers through \"Contract Carrier Agreements\" (\"CCAs\"). It has used two standard CCAs during the period at issue in this case, one until early 2017 and the other since. Each CCA states that the motor carrier is an independent contractor of Border Transfer and that none of the motor carrier's personnel are Border Transfer employees. The motor carriers must own their own trucks and are responsible for all operating expenses. The CCAs permit Border Transfer to deduct from its payments to the motor carriers for any liability it incurs for property loss or damage. The motor carriers must carry certain types of insurance, including for cargo damage and workers' compensation for all of their workers. The motor carriers cannot subcontract deliveries. The CCA in use through early 2017 includes detailed instructions on how drivers are to perform their deliveries, but the newer CCA does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Border Transfer only enters into CCAs with corporate entities. Some drivers\n   formed corporate entities specifically to contract with Border Transfer. Others did so before contracting with Border Transfer. New drivers must submit their company name, information on their compliance with Department of Transportation requirements, and proof of insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In some cases, Border Transfer contracts with motor carriers that consist of a single driver who personally performs the delivery services. That was the case with class representative Marcos DaSilva, who entered into a CCA with Border Transfer through Alpha Logistics Trucking, LLC (\"Alpha Logistics\") and worked for Border Transfer between November 2014 and July 2015. He formed Alpha Logistics because Border Transfer told him he needed a corporate entity to work for it; a Border Transfer representative even helped him fill out the paperwork to form his LLC and get FMCSA approval. DaSilva worked five to six days a week as a driver during his time with Border Transfer. He did not work for any other company, and all of his income came from Border Transfer deliveries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In other cases, Border Transfer contracts with motor carriers that employ multiple drivers. That was the case with Matteus Ferreira, the other class representative. Ferreira was the joint owner of Father &amp; Son Transporting LLC (\"Father &amp; Son\") with his father, Marcos Ferreira. Ferreira worked full-time for Border Transfer from May 2012 until November 2015, during which he did not do work for any other company. Ferreira worked as a driver for the duration of the contract, and Father &amp; Son operated two other trucks during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Working for Border Transfer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Daily Schedule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Drivers perform their deliveries from Sears' Westwood, Massachusetts warehouse. Each day, Border Transfer calls its motor carriers to offer routes for the following day. Motor carriers can accept or decline a route. Some drivers are assigned to standby shifts and will only receive a route if there is an issue with another driver. Sometimes Border Transfer gives a driver a different route than the one he signed up for the prior day. The parties dispute whether a carrier is charged for declining a shift. Border Transfer often offers drivers extra deliveries in the middle of the day. Drivers can turn down these deliveries or negotiate for additional pay beyond the regular per-stop rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Most mornings when drivers arrive for their routes, Border Transfer holds a short \"stand-up\" meeting. At the meeting, Sears and Border Transfer personnel go over new products, give demonstrations on how to install products, provide delivery instructions, and discuss safety. Drivers must attend these meetings, but the parties dispute whether there are consequences for not doing so. Some drivers claim they were assigned to standby shifts as punishment for missing the meetings. Drivers also receive a penalty on their customer ratings scores if they are late to the meetings. However, according to other drivers and Rogerio Matos, an assistant manager for Border Transfer, Border Transfer does not take attendance and does not impose any consequences if a driver misses a meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the meeting, Border Transfer gives each driver a manifest with his delivery route. Sears prepares the manifests, and Border Transfer assigns them to specific drivers. After loading packages into the truck and receiving a signoff from Border Transfer, the driver leaves on his route. The manifest contains the order of deliveries and time windows for each delivery,\n   which the driver must follow. Border Transfer dispatchers monitor each driver's progress throughout the day. If a driver is not making his deliveries on time, a dispatcher will check in with him and notify Border Transfer managers. Because some deliveries involve replacing old products, drivers must return to the Westwood facility at the end of the day to return the \"haulaway\" products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is disputed whether there are consequences for failing to follow the manifest. According to Matos and DaSilva, there are not, though DaSilva testified that he did not deviate from the manifest because it always gave the most efficient route. On the other hand, Ferreira was chastised for making deliveries out of order and said Border Transfer did not pay for a stop if a customer complained that he missed a delivery window. There is also conflicting evidence about how easy it is to switch routes. Some drivers reported that, although they can switch routes, they generally do not because Border Transfer attributes any issue to the originally assigned driver. But two drivers that worked for Father &amp; Son said the Ferreiras decided which routes each driver got and always gave the easy route to Matteus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The CCA Border Transfer used before early 2017 provides detailed guidelines for how to deliver and install various products. Drivers must call each customer thirty minutes before arrival. They must log when they arrive at and complete each delivery and secure a signature from the customer. Beyond logging their progress, drivers only have to contact Border Transfer if there is a problem with a delivery. The parties dispute whether drivers can contact a customer directly if they are running late for a delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A route consists of fifteen to twenty stops and takes at least ten hours to complete. Drivers work between four to six days per week. They generally remain available every day of the week since they only learn one day in advance of a shift. However, some motor carriers that own multiple trucks have contracts with other delivery companies and assign some of their trucks to other routes. Border Transfer's contract with Sears forbids it from allowing the drivers to \"co-load\" their trucks with deliveries for other companies while they are on a route for Border Transfer without Sears' permission. It is unclear whether Border Transfer enforces this prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Other Aspects of the Job\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Border Transfer requires its drivers to wear a uniform consisting of a blue shirt, blue pants, a blue jacket, and an armband containing an\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The uniform says \"Delivery Pro\" on it. Motor carriers order their uniforms from Border Transfer. Delivery teams cannot leave the warehouse without the uniform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Many motor carriers hire workers of their own as helpers to assist with delivery routes and/or as secondary drivers to drive additional trucks. The CCA gives Border Transfer \"the right to request that any personnel of [a motor carrier] not perform Carrier Services\" on its behalf. Dkt. No. 110-4 \u00b6 6(E). Any secondary driver or helper must pass a background check and drug test. Motor carriers generally make hiring, firing, and pay decisions for their secondary drivers and helpers on their own. The parties dispute, however, whether Border Transfer requires motor carriers to run hires by it for approval or has ever told a carrier it could not hire someone. One driver picked up and dropped off his helper outside the warehouse after Border Transfer told him not to use that helper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Motor carriers own their own trucks, which must be at least twenty-six feet long. Although the CCA requires trucks to be white, Border Transfer does not enforce this requirement. Motor carriers can put only their own names, not Border Transfer's, on their trucks. Drivers can park their trucks wherever they want overnight, though many park at the warehouse with Border Transfer's permission. They can also take their trucks anywhere for maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After each delivery, Sears asks the customer to rate the driver. Sears sends ratings on each driver to Border Transfer, which posts them daily at the warehouse. The top six drivers are called the \"Top Dogs,\" and their carriers can choose their routes for the next day. Matos stated that drivers do not have to maintain high ratings to receive routes, but one driver claimed that Border Transfer assigns standby shifts or no route at all for low ratings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Border Transfer does not limit the amount of vacation its drivers may take. A driver taking time off can either hire another driver to cover his routes or notify Border Transfer that he will not pick up routes for a certain period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Border Transfer pays the motor carriers a flat, non-negotiable rate per stop. It makes a number of deductions from these payments. First, when a motor carrier starts driving for Border Transfer, Border Transfer deducts $ 200 weekly until it has a $ 3,000 \"performance bond\" per truck. Border Transfer keeps the bond until the motor carrier terminates its contract, uses the bond to cover any remaining property damage claims, and eventually returns the remainder to the motor carrier. Second, if a customer complains about product or property damage, Border Transfer pays her and then deducts the amount from its payment to the motor carrier whose driver performed the delivery. Third, Border Transfer makes \"No Bill\" (\"N/B\") deductions to its motor carrier payments if a scheduled delivery is cancelled or a driver does not complete a delivery because the customer is not home, the customer rejects the shipment, or the driver does not install the product properly. Finally, Border Transfer deducts the costs of uniforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a proposed class action complaint on June 23, 2016. The original complaint named Border Transfer as the sole defendant and contained claims for violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act and unjust enrichment. Border Transfer moved to dismiss both claims. On January 5, 2017, the Court held that the Wage Act claim was not preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (\"FAAAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), but dismissed the unjust enrichment claim because the Wage Act provided an adequate remedy at law.\n   <em>\n    DaSilva v.

In substance, Plaintiffs allege that their misclassification as independent contractors resulted in unlawful deductions from their pay for uniforms, property damage claims, performance bonds, and N/B adjustments, as well as unlawful requirements that they pay for workers' compensation and cargo insurance. On November 9, 2017, the Court certified the following class for liability: \"[a]ll individuals who 1) entered into a Contract Carrier Agreement (or similar agreement) directly or through a business entity; 2) personally\n   provided delivery services for Border Transfer on a full-time basis in Massachusetts (at least 40 hours per week); and 3) who were classified as independent contractors, at any time since June 23, 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    DaSilva v.

Under the CCA Border Transfer used until early 2017, a motor carrier is entitled to payment \"based on stop count\" at a specified rate \"per Stop.\" Dkt. No. 110-4 at 25. A \"Stop\" could reasonably be construed to include an unsuccessful delivery. However, the payment is due within two weeks of when the driver \"completes delivery,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4(A), which suggests that the delivery must be successful for the driver to earn payment. The contractual language is therefore ambiguous as to when a driver earns a payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Given this ambiguity and the fact that Border Transfer did not negotiate its CCAs with its drivers, the term \"Stop\" should be construed against Border Transfer in accordance with the meaning a reasonable driver would give to it. A reasonable driver would believe he would be paid each time he arrives at a home regardless of whether he successfully delivers the product. Otherwise, through no fault of his own, he would risk driving for hours and receiving no pay if multiple customers are not home or ordered products that do not fit. Under this construction, class members can recover for at least the second category of N/B deductions, i.e., unsuccessful deliveries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants' argument that the FAAAA preempts claims to recover N/B deductions\n   because they aim to expand the wages the class members agreed to in their CCAs is without merit. Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens\n   </em>\n   , which states that ADA or FAAAA preemption \"confines courts, in breach-of-contract actions, to the parties' bargain, with no enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/#p232\">\n    513 U.S. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232-33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/#p232\">\n    115 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/#p232\">\n    130 L.Ed.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). As an initial matter, these claims seek to recover only wages class members have earned according to the terms of the CCAs. Additionally, the class consists of purported employees seeking to enforce an obligation of an employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martins v. 3PD, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-11313-DPW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201320454\">\n    2013 WL 1320454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (D. Mass. Mar. 28, 2013). As with the claims for property damage deductions, the only connection between N/B deductions and Border Transfer's prices and services is the pressure to raise prices that comes from any cost a service provider bears. Such a tenuous connection does not suffice to trigger FAAAA preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Chantre's Individual Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants also seek summary judgment on the individual claims of class member Humberto Chantre on two grounds. First, they point out that he contracted with Border Transfer through an LLC, Chantre Delivery. Second, they contend he was an independent contractor, not an employee. Under Prong A of the Independent Contractor Statute, they note that Chantre decided which loads to accept, provided drivers and ensured they met safety standards, secured and maintained equipment, and bought insurance. Under Prong C, they emphasize that Chantre Delivery had the opportunity to provide deliveries for other companies and did in fact do so after Chantre stopped driving personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The class is limited to drivers who personally performed deliveries for Border Transfer on a full-time basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DaSilva II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523948\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/389/#p407\">\n    296 F.Supp.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Chantre may have been engaged in a legitimate business-to-business relationship with Border Transfer when he did not personally drive a truck and instead employed other drivers to perform his deliveries, he is not a class member during that period. Defendants put forth no evidence about Chantre's relationship with Border Transfer that is specific to the period during which he drove personally. Furthermore, Chantre contracted with Border Transfer under the first CCA, which, as discussed below, renders him an employee as a matter of law for any period in which he drove personally on a full-time basis. Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Chantre's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Independent Contractor Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on whether Border Transfer misclassified the class as independent contractors. Defendants respond that there are disputed material facts that prevent the Court from determining as a matter of law that it cannot meet its burden of satisfying both Prong A and C of the Independent Contractor Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Additionally, Defendants suggest that, although they must prove proper classification of a single worker, Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that misclassification occurred on a class basis. This is incorrect.

Analysis of Right to Control Under the CCAs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Border Transfer has used two standard CCAs, switching from the first to the second in early 2017. The first CCA gives Border Transfer the right to control many details of its drivers' performance. Drivers must use white trucks of a certain size. They must wear a uniform consisting of a light blue shirt with navy stripes, navy blue pants, a black belt, black shoes, a navy blue jacket, and an ID badge stating \"Sears-Authorized.\" Any secondary driver or helper must be employees of the motor carrier and pass a background check. Border Transfer can bar a secondary driver or helper from working on its deliveries. Drivers may not subcontract their delivery routes. Motor carriers must obtain certain types of insurance, including workers' compensation and cargo insurance, and must name Border Transfer or Sears as the beneficiary of some policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The first CCA also requires that drivers attend a daily \"stand-up\" meeting at which Sears and Border Transfer provide instructions. Drivers must make deliveries in the order and time windows specified in their manifests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Driscoll v.

App. Ct. 2008). They must call each customer thirty minutes before arrival to verify the address and confirm the delivery. Otherwise, except to resolve property damage claims or update delivery times, carriers cannot contact customers directly. When a delivery is complete, a driver must secure a signature from the customer.

Why Border Transfer controls its drivers, however, is irrelevant to the inquiry under Prong A. Defendants cite no case in which a Massachusetts court has excused a level of control sufficient to make a worker an employee simply because the requirements of the employer's customers or the nature of its business necessitated that control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scantland v.

It is disputed, for example, whether drivers had to show up at daily \"stand-up\" meetings and stick to their manifests and whether Border Transfer actually prevented its motor carriers from utilizing specific secondary drivers or helpers. Defendants argue that, when all inferences are drawn in its favor, it did not exercise as much control over its drivers as the CCA suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   A worker does not qualify as an independent contractor merely because his employer declines to exercise an extensive right to control reserved in an employment\n   contract. The SJC has focused the Prong A analysis on evidence of actual control,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sebago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20N.E.3d%201139\">\n    28 N.E.3d at 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and has noted that \"the terms of an employment contract are not, on their own, dispositive\" on the question of control,\n   <em>\n    Machado v.

But the focus on the actual relationship between the worker and his employer aims to avoid use of \"artful contract drafting ... as a subterfuge to avoid liability ... when the agreement lacks any real foundation in the facts of the actual working relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Bos. Bicycle Couriers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20N.E.2d%20964\">\n    778 N.E.2d at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the Independent Contractor Statute expanded the control inquiry to include an analysis of the parties' actual relationship, it did not eliminate the common-law rule that a worker qualifies as an employee when the employer retains \"the right to control the details of the performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Athol Daily News\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n    786 N.E.2d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plain language of the statute bolsters this interpretation, as it requires the employer to prove that the worker is free from control \"\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   under his contract of the performance of service and in fact.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, \u00a7 148B(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The second CCA Border Transfer began using in early 2017 is a different story. Unlike the first CCA, it does not include detailed instructions on how drivers are to perform their deliveries. For example, it does not explain the specific steps for installing various types of products, provide rules on when driver can communicate with customers, require attendance at a daily meeting, or specify the type of truck drivers must use. Accordingly, for class members who signed the second CCA, the Court cannot conclude they are employees based solely on Border Transfer's contractual right to control their performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   c. Analysis of Control in Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For class members who signed the second CCA, Plaintiffs can still prevail on the misclassification issue if they show that Border Transfer controlled the details of their performance as a matter of fact. In Plaintiffs' favor, Border Transfer controls much of the daily routine of its drivers. As required by the CCA, Border Transfer provides them with a daily manifest that lays out the order and times for their deliveries, and drivers must wear uniforms and attend regular stand-up meetings. After a carrier accepts a route, Border Transfer sometimes changes the assignment. Drivers must log their progress via an app, and Border Transfer dispatchers monitor them throughout the day. Drivers must call Border Transfer about any issue with delivery. Border Transfer reviews the customer ratings it receives from Sears and provides an incentive to drivers to improve those ratings by offering the \"Top Dogs\" their choice of route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   On the other hand, Border Transfer leaves certain aspects of the job to drivers' discretion. Drivers own their own trucks and can park and maintain them where they like. Border Transfer does not in practice require trucks to be white, and drivers can put their motor carriers' names on the trucks. The uniforms do not say \"Border Transfer\" on them. Drivers do not have to accept the routes Border Transfer offers them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sebago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20N.E.3d%201139\">\n    28 N.E.3d at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that taxi drivers' ability to choose their shifts and decline dispatches meant the cab owners, radio associations, and garages did not control their work). They can also accept or reject new deliveries Border Transfer offers throughout the day or negotiate for more pay for those new deliveries. Border Transfer does not limit how many days drivers can take off and permits drivers to\n   either send replacement drivers to cover their routes or simply not take routes for those days. Drivers can hire and fire helpers and secondary drivers and decide how much to pay them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In light of these conflicting factors, the factual disputes over other indicia of control are dispositive of this inquiry. It is unclear, for example, whether Border Transfer penalizes drivers for rejecting a route, failing to make deliveries in conformance with the manifest, receiving low customer ratings, or not attending the morning stand-up meeting. Although swapping routes appears to be allowed, some drivers said it is impractical because of Border Transfer's policies. The parties dispute whether drivers have to clear their hires with Border Transfer and whether Border Transfer has ever told a carrier not to hire anyone and enforced that prohibition. In addition, while Border Transfer promised Sears it would not allow its drivers to \"co-load\" other companies' products, it is unclear whether Border Transfer enforces this requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Athol Daily News\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n    786 N.E.2d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing an agency's decision that newspaper delivery carriers were employees under the unemployment statute in part because the carriers could deliver for other customers at the same time).

For the periods in which he has been merely a director, however, Plaintiffs must show that he was an agent of Border Transfer with significant management responsibilities. Plaintiffs point out that McCluskey was involved in a market study to determine how much to pay drivers, drafted the standard CCAs, and reviews the company's financials and tracks its performance. Plaintiffs do not differentiate, however, between his time as director and president. They also provide no evidence that McCluskey was an agent of Border Transfer during the periods in which he served as a director.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20N.E.3d%20560\">\n    87 N.E.3d at 570-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, except in unique circumstances, a director is not an agent of the corporation). Plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to summary judgment on McCluskey's individual liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 108). The Court also\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on liability (Docket No. 122) as to class members subject to the first CCA and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the motion as to class members subject to the second CCA and as to Defendant Patrick McCluskey's individual liability. Finally, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   as moot Plaintiffs' motions to strike the testimony of Thomas N. Hubbard (Docket No. 115 and Docket No. 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Border Transfer's current contract is with Innovel Solutions, Inc. (\"Innovel\"), which used to be known as Sears Logistics Services, Inc. Innovel manages deliveries for a number of retailers. There is no evidence that Border Transfer's relationship with its drivers differs depending on which retailer's products they are delivering. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, the Court refers throughout this opinion to deliveries made on behalf of Sears.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The two standard CCAs Border Transfer has used contain Tennessee and Michigan choice-of-law provisions. Given the unequal bargaining power between Border Transfer and the class, it is unclear whether a Massachusetts court would enforce these provisions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Taylor v. E. Connection Operating, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275679\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/191/\">\n     465 Mass. 191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20N.E.2d%20408\">\n     988 N.E.2d 408\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 411 n.8 (2013). In any event, the same principles of contract law govern this issue regardless of which state's law applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Although the standard CCA Border Transfer has used since early 2017 contains slightly different payment terms, it is similarly ambiguous on when a driver earns a per stop payment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
