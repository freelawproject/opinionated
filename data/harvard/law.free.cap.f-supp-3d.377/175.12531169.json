Consequently, as a threshold matter, to the extent that Dr. Russo failed to provide treatment, he may nonetheless be found to satisfy the personal involvement requirement.

June 7, 2013) ). To determine the effect of this decision following two amendments of the complaint and the appointment of counsel, the Court will analyze the relevant precedents rather than simply rely on Judge Gleeson's decision as the law of the case.

This, along with Judge Gleeson's earlier decision, suggests that to hold Dr. Geraci liable, Singletary must show that Dr. Geraci \"participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation\" or \"created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412071\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/865/#p873\">\n    58 F.3d at 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As plaintiff has not alleged that Dr. Geraci created a policy or custom under which the purported constitutional\n   violations occurred,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 9 (\"With respect to Dr. Geraci, there is ample evidence that he treated Mr. Singletary and was personally involved in his care ....\"), the Court will focus only on Dr. Geraci's direct involvement, as opposed to his involvement in supervisory duties that may have impacted Singletary's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dr. Geraci did not treat Singletary at any point, but there are several instances of his participation in Singletary's course of care. First, Dr. Geraci reviewed Singletary's medical intake form, on March 13, 2012, Geraci Tr. at 128:12-23, and renewed a prescription for Singletary's medication, on May 25, 2012, Geraci Tr. at 144:11-21. However, each of these occasions falls well before April 8, 2013, on which the first alleged constitutional violation began. Therefore, they cannot constitute personal involvement in the violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Geraci also was involved in the relevant occurrences insofar as he saw at least one of Singletary's medical grievance forms. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 74; Geraci Tr. at 86:2-87:12. Upon seeing this form, Dr. Geraci wrote \"S/C\" on it, indicating that Singletary was to be put on sick call. Geraci Tr. at 86:2-87:12. Whether his failure to follow up constituted deliberate indifference is a substantive question addressed below, but this notation constitutes some personal involvement. Finally, there is a dispute as to whether Dr. Geraci was personally involved in the referral to Dr. Ruffo and the alleged failure to follow up on that referral. Dr. Geraci testified that he was responsible for reviewing requests for outside care,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 159:15-18, which suggests that he reviewed the request for Singletary to see a gastroenterologist. However, this was a mere supervisory function and thus represents the sort of involvement that is insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   . Singletary does not claim that Dr. Geraci failed to approve the specialist visit or delayed approval of the referral. Rather, he seeks to hold Dr. Geraci liable solely on the ground that his subordinates did not promptly provide adequate care. As a result, Dr. Geraci was not personally involved, within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , and cannot be liable with respect to this claim. Consequently, the only point of potential liability for Dr. Geraci is the alleged failure to follow up on a medical grievance form.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Plaintiff might argue that these events put Dr. Geraci on notice of Singletary's condition and created an obligation to follow up, but if that were the case, then the alleged constitutional violation would have occurred much earlier. Absent personal involvement following the flare-up of Singletary's symptoms on April 13, 2013, no liability can attach to Dr. Geraci's acts or omissions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Deprivation of Adequate Medical Care\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Plaintiff's claim arises from defendants' alleged \"deliberate indifference to [his] serious medical needs.\" Opp'n at 7.

Therefore, the issue is whether defendants provided reasonable care here, a question that is disputed by the parties' conflicting expert reports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Plaintiff claims that he was first deprived of a constitutionally protected right when defendants failed to refer him to a specialist between April 8, 2013 and May 7, 2013. As noted above, Singletary has not shown that Dr. Geraci had sufficient personal involvement to face liability, given that Dr. Geraci never treated him during this period of time. Although Dr. Russo may have been personally involved, insofar as he treated Singletary and waited one month before referring him to a specialist, this does not constitute a deprivation of care. Each party relies on a single expert report opining as to whether this failure constituted a deprivation of care. Singletary's expert, Dr. Stuart I. Finkel, makes only the general claim that \"[a]s [Singletary's] treating physician, it was [Dr. Russo's] obligation to ensure ... that his patient was referred for necessary and appropriate medical care, including timely consultations with the appropriate specialist(s).\" Decl. of Stuart I. Finkel at 6 (ECF No. 73-31, at 9) (\"Finkel Decl.\"). Contrarily, defendants' expert, Dr. Frank T. Sconzo, speaks specifically to the one-month delay, from April to May, in referring Singletary to a specialist. Dr. Sconzo opines that after Singletary's JMU visit, in April 2013, \"no urgent treatment [was] needed.\" Decl. of Frank. T. Sconzo at 1 (ECF No. 73-49, at 1) (\"Sconzo Decl.\"). In light of the parties' sole reliance on these reports, a reasonable jury could not find that a one-month delay in referring Singletary to a specialist constituted a deprivation of adequate medical care. Although Dr. Finkel explained that Dr. Russo was bound to refer Singletary to a specialist in a timely fashion when necessary, he did not conclude that Singletary needed urgent care as of April 8, 2013 or that a one-month delay was a failing of constitutional magnitude. Plaintiff has not produced evidence to meet defendants' showing, and defendants are thus entitled to summary judgment with respect to this alleged deprivation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Singletary's next alleged deprivation arises from defendants' failure to ensure that he saw a specialist after Dr. Russo made a referral marked \"urgent.\" Singletary, as mentioned earlier, has adequately demonstrated the personal involvement of only Dr. Russo, given that Dr. Geraci played only a supervisory role in the referral. Neither the briefing nor the\n    expert reports speak directly to this whether Dr. Russo's failure constituted a deprivation of adequate medical care. However, courts in this circuit have held that failure to see that a detainee receives a prescribed course of treatment, resulting in delay, may constitute a constitutional deprivation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Price\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030469\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/697/344/#p366\">\n     697 F.Supp.2d at 361-62\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that delay in arranging a kidney transplant test can constitute deliberate indifference);\n    <em>\n     Lloyd v.

Notably, in\n    <em>\n     Lloyd\n    </em>\n    , the court denied summary judgment on a deliberate indifference claim, even though the defendants had submitted and re-submitted MRI request forms.\n    <em>\n     Lloyd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748539\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/570/556/#p569\">\n     570 F.Supp.2d at 569\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, although Dr. Russo submitted a referral to an outside specialist and marked it urgent, this is not a complete defense. Consequently, he is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that no actual deprivation had occurred. This claim, however, is stranded there since, for reasons discussed later, Singletary falters at the subjective prong and summary judgment for defendants is awarded on that basis.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section II(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The third purported constitutional violation occurred when Dr. Russo and Dr. Geraci failed to follow up with Dr. Ruffo and to implement his recommendations. For plaintiff, Dr. Finkel opines that this constituted a deprivation. Finkel Decl. at 7. Defendants' expert did not speak directly to this issue, although he alluded to an \"appropriate specialist consult.\" Sconzo Decl. at 2. With only this minimal discussion and conflicting expert opinions, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on this ground. Moreover, \"[f]ailure to heed a physician's recommendation ... may in some circumstances constitute deliberate indifference on the part of prison officials.\"\n    <em>\n     Demata v. N.Y.S. Corr.

Failing to follow up on Singletary's referral to Dr. Ruffo and consequently failing to implement his recommendations is closely analogous, and a reasonable jury could find it to be an actual deprivation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Next, Singletary alleges that he was denied adequate care when defendants failed to respond to two medical grievance forms. However, he has made no showing that Dr. Russo saw these forms or was responsible for responding to such forms. Absent personal involvement, there can be no \u00a7 1983 liability, so Dr. Russo is entitled to summary judgment with respect to this claim. Dr. Geraci unquestionably saw the second medical grievance form, and there is a dispute as to whether he saw the first form. Therefore, there is a triable issue as to Dr. Geraci's personal involvement. There is a further triable issue as to whether his actions constituted a deprivation of adequate medical care. Dr. Finkel opines explicitly that Dr. Geraci's referral of Singletary to sick call was an inadequate response to the second grievance form,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Finkel Decl. at 7, whereas Dr. Sconzo does not directly address this incident.

Defendants first argue that there is no right to the completion of a medical information form upon transfer to a different custodial authority. Defs.' Mem. Supp. at 26 (ECF No. 29-30 ). However, although they have declined to impose liability, given the lack of resulting harm, courts in this circuit have several times recognized that lapses in recordkeeping could constitute deprivations of adequate medical care.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Davis v.

Mar. 11, 2009) (\"[T]he Court declines to conclude, as a matter of law, ... that 'not forwarding the plaintiff's medical records' or medication ... cannot plausibly rise to the level of a 'deliberate indifference' ....\"). Furthermore, defendants identify no law requiring a constitutional right to be defined as specifically as the right to the completion of a medical information form. A detainee's right to adequate medical care has been indisputably established,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Estelle v.

There is no indication that these defendants were involved with the completion of this form, which was prepared by Nurse Paula Mecagni. Plaintiff's expert, however, suggests that each defendants' alleged failures to follow up on Singletary's condition led to the incompleteness of the transfer form. Finkel Decl. at 7.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, there appears to be a triable issue as to whether a deprivation occurred. But, as to these issues, and all those issues found triable up to this point, they are immaterial if defendants succeed on another issue that is essential to Singletary's claims. Failure of a claimant to survive summary judgment on a matter essential to his claim renders all other issues immaterial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    , 477 U.S. at 248,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     106 S.Ct. 2505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Celotex Corp.\n    </em>\n    , 477 U.S. at 323,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n     106 S.Ct. 2548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Here, plaintiff was provided some treatment for his ulcerative colitis. It is undisputed that plaintiff was seen at the JMU several times and received medications for his condition, except when he missed them on the days of his trial.

Therefore, it is not the case that \"prison officials ... failed to provide general treatment\" but rather that plaintiff suffered \"a temporary delay or interruption in the provision of otherwise adequate medical treatment.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"268800\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/143/698/#p702\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As a result, the Court must analyze \"the particular risk of harm faced by [plaintiff] due to the challenged deprivation of care, rather than the severity of [his] underlying medical condition.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 186.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Nonetheless, although this standard is less favorable to Singletary than the alternative, there is at least a triable issue as to whether Singletary suffered a sufficiently serious deprivation. Singletary unquestionably suffered a painful condition for several months following the alleged onset of the constitutional violation. The undisputed facts do not settle whether prompter medical treatment would have avoided this pain. Although the colonoscopy that was ultimately conducted found Singletary's colitis to be in remission, the disease goes in cycles of activity and remission, and an earlier colonoscopy, performed while Singletary was suffering a flare-up, might have led to medical changes that could have alleviated the condition. The same uncertainty exists with regard to the implementation by JMU of the specialist's recommendations. Although causation is unclear, because these disputed factual questions require medical expertise, summary judgment on this ground is not appropriate. Although Dr. Sconzo opined that the alleged inadequacies did not result in \"permanent worsening of the patient UC,\" Sconzo Decl. at 2, he did not dispute that Singletary suffered significant pain due to his uncontrolled condition, even if the condition did not permanently worsen.

The arguments of the parties come to a head here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Court's analysis begins with Dr. Russo, who, as discussed earlier, actually deprived Singletary of care but only insofar as he did not ensure that Singletary saw a specialist after being referred and did not follow up with the specialist or implement his recommendations. However, there is no indication in the record that Dr. Russo was aware that the appointment with Dr. Ruffo had not been scheduled promptly. Although, in certain circumstances, failure to follow up may constitute deliberate indifference,\n    <em>\n     cf., e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Lloyd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748539\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/570/556/#p569\">\n     570 F.Supp.2d at 569\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that failure to follow up on an MRI request could be deliberate indifference), the present case is distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Lloyd\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Price\n    </em>\n    . In\n    <em>\n     Lloyd\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff repeatedly complained to the physician who had referred him for an MRI during the nine months that passed before the MRI was scheduled.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748539\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/570/556/#p569\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748539\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/570/556/#p569\">\n     at 562-63, 569\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Price\n    </em>\n    lodged repeated complaints about his doctor's failure to schedule a prescribed x-ray exam.\n    <em>\n     Price\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030469\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/697/344/#p366\">\n     697 F.Supp.2d at 363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Moreover, there is no evidence that Dr. Russo otherwise learned that the appointment had not been arranged. Absent any indication that the appointment had not been scheduled, Dr. Russo could not have been expected to know that a risk of substantial harm existed. Plaintiff was required to show that Dr. Russo \"acted with a mental state more blameworthy than negligence,\"\n    <em>\n     Lloyd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748539\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/570/556/#p569\">\n     570 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    567 (citing\n    <em>\n     Hernandez v.

Dr. Finkel opined that Dr. Russo was obliged to ensure that the specialist appointment was scheduled and that Dr. Russo was aware of the seriousness of plaintiff's condition. Finkel Decl. at 6-7. However, Dr. Finkel's report in no way suggests that Dr. Russo was aware that the appointment had not been scheduled or that he should have been aware of what was apparently a clerical error. Absent actual awareness or a duty to monitor scheduling matters, even when a patient does not complain, Dr. Russo was not reckless and is entitled to summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The next issue centers on Dr. Russo's\n    <em>\n     mens rea\n    </em>\n    with respect to his failure to implement Dr. Ruffo's recommendations. Here, Dr. Russo claimed that he was not aware of Dr. Ruffo's recommendations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Russo Tr. at 68:13-15. Although he admitted that it was his responsibility to follow up with Dr. Ruffo,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 69:6-9, falling below the medical standard of care or neglecting his vocational duties does not transform Dr. Russo's omission into a constitutional violation,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p103\">\n     429 U.S. at 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p103\">\n     97 S.Ct. 285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.\"). Even assuming, without deciding, that Dr. Russo was professionally obligated to follow up with Dr. Ruffo and was negligent for failing to do so, it does not follow that he was reckless or deliberately indifferent\n    to Singletary's medical needs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Furthermore, no evidence suggests that Dr. Russo was aware of either the medical grievance forms or the medical transfer form. Nor does the record reveal that he had a duty to be aware of such forms. With respect to the transfer form, the record does not even indicate that Dr. Russo knew Singletary was to be transferred. Therefore, plaintiff has not adequately established Dr. Russo's\n    <em>\n     mens rea\n    </em>\n    , and summary judgment is appropriate on this claim too.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    As for Dr. Geraci, clearly, he was aware of the flare-up of plaintiff's ulcerative colitis when he received and made a notation on Singletary's second medical grievance form.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Geraci Tr. at 86:2-87:12. Nevertheless, that does not mean that Dr. Geraci was reckless. When confronted with plaintiff's second medical grievance form, Dr. Geraci placed Singletary on sick call. Even if, as Dr. Finkel contends, it was professionally irresponsible for Dr. Geraci not to follow up on the referral to sick call, nothing suggests that Dr. Geraci was reckless. In support of his claim, plaintiff cites\n    <em>\n     Grimmett v. Corizon Medical Associates of New York\n    </em>\n    , No. 15-cv-7351 (JPO) (SN),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274485\">\n     2017 WL 2274485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y. May 24, 2017). In\n    <em>\n     Grimmett\n    </em>\n    , the court found that a plaintiff had sufficiently pled recklessness when he alleged that a doctor had omitted facts from his medical records and utterly refused to respond to numerous medical grievances.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *4. Here, there is no indication that Dr. Geraci deliberately prevented Singletary from receiving care, and by plaintiff's admission, Dr. Geraci did respond to Singletary's second medical grievance by placing him on sick call. Absent any indication that Dr. Geraci was reckless, as opposed to merely negligent, in failing to ensure that Singletary was eventually seen by a doctor, plaintiff's claim cannot, and does not, survive summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Furthermore, as with Dr. Russo, there is no indication that Dr. Geraci was aware of the medical transfer form or had a duty to monitor the completion of such a form. The Court, moreover, cannot infer such a duty from Dr. Geraci's title alone. Therefore, and since \u00a7 1983 does not otherwise admit of the imposition of supervisory liability, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted in its entirety.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court certifies, pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), that any appeal from this Memorandum and Order would not be taken in good faith and, therefore,\n    <em>\n     in forma pauperis\n    </em>\n    status is denied for the purpose of an appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coppedge v.

However, although this framing of Dr. Finkel's opinion might overcome defendants' argument that they are not liable because they were not involved in completing the form, it would not overcome the issue that the record does not reveal that defendants were even aware that Singletary was being transferred. Plaintiff does not contend that defendants were under a duty to monitor his whereabouts. Therefore, if they were unaware of his pending transfer, they cannot be liable for failure to transmit his medical records upon said transfer.
