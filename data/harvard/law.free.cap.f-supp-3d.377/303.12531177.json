(\"CCTI\" or \"Plaintiff\") and Leidos, Inc. (\"Leidos\"). In this most recent action, CCTI brings claims for breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage against Leidos, and brings the latter two claims against a Leidos employee, Dr. Anton Dilo Paul (together with Leidos, \"Defendants\"), in his personal capacity. Both Defendants have moved to dismiss the claims against them in CCTI's Amended Complaint. For the reasons that follow, Dr. Paul's motion is granted in part, and Leidos's motion is granted in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For purposes of the instant motions, the Court accepts as true the well-pleaded allegations of the Amended Complaint. CCTI is a coal technology company incorporated in Nevada with a principal place of business in New York. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12). Leidos is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). Leidos is an engineering advisory firm. (Paul Br. 1). Dr. Paul is an employee of Leidos and a resident of Pennsylvania; he also holds restricted shares of CCTI stock. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Pilot Plant Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The business dealings underlying the instant dispute relate to the development of a pilot plant for CCTI's coal dehydration technologies in Shady Point, Oklahoma (the \"Pilot Plant\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-104). In May 2015, CCTI entered into an Amended and Restated Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management Contract (the \"Construction Contract\") with Benham Constructors, LLC (\"Benham\"), which was previously known as Leidos Constructors, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-15). Benham was a Leidos subsidiary at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 14, 2015, Leidos and CCTI entered into a Professional Services Agreement (the \"Services Agreement\") by which Leidos would assist CCTI with the development of the Pilot Plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 16, 2016, Leidos announced that it had completed the sale of Benham to The Haskell Company (\"Haskell\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 19). Around the same time, Benham informed CCTI that it had completed testing at the Pilot Plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). On April 15, 2016, Leidos informed CCTI that it was closing out the Construction Contract, as Leidos did not wish to have the contract assigned to Haskell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Leidos stated at the time that the payment to close out the construction contract was $ 96,893.64. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The sale of Benham to Haskell closed in July 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). CCTI, however, consistently disputed the final invoice that Benham provided to it to close out the Construction Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Paul Email\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 28, 2016, Dr. Paul sent an email to CCTI regarding progress on the Pilot Plant (the \"Paul Email\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 23). The Paul Email was described as a \"draft response to potential investors [in CCTI] that were following CCTI's progress on the pilot plant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Generally speaking, it provided an optimistic report regarding the CCTI's technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-31). CCTI states that the email led it to believe \"that it had a 'fully validated technology' and available data that could be used to encourage investors and other business partners to support CCTI's efforts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Construction Contract Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An orderly dissolution of the Construction Contract proved elusive. CCTI claims that Leidos or Benham removed a password for the computer system at the Pilot Plant, along with materials identified as \"Carrier CDs\" and a Secure Digital (or \"SD\") card containing data for the Plant's control system (the \"SD Card\") - all despite the Construction Contract's provision of title in these items to CCTI. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-37). In June 2017, CCTI requested that Leidos provide the password and the SD Card to it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38). CCTI states that, instead, between June 7, 2017, and July 14, 2017, Leidos maintained the SD Card and then improperly provided it to Benham rather than CCTI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 14, 2017, Benham stated that it would not return the Carrier CDs or the SD Card until CCTI made a $ 425,979.51 payment to Benham under the Construction Contract. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41). CCTI alleges that Benham's refusal to return this material left it unable to operate the Pilot Plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 28, 2017, CCTI and Benham reached a settlement agreement by which Benham would provide CCTI with the password, Carrier CDs, and the SD Card, and CCTI would release its claims against Benham. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-55). CCTI hired a different firm, Kiewit Engineering Group, Inc. (\"Kiewet\"), to re-start the plant and run additional tests, and CCTI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   claims that these actions led to the discovery of additional breaches by Benham of the Construction Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57). CCTI further states that it discovered that a second Leidos employee, Tom Ezel, had billed time for services he did not perform under the Construction Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62). CCTI states that, ultimately, it was required to pay $ 2 million to bring the Pilot Plant to the proper operating condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Services Agreement Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CCTI further alleges that Leidos and Dr. Paul communicated false or misleading information to investors and potential investors in CCTI regarding CCTI technology. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 84). CCTI states that Dr. Paul reached out to investors who relied on the Paul Email, and that he also traveled to New York on May 13, 2016, in order to make a presentation on behalf of CCTI to potential investors from Shenuan, China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 85-86). However, CCTI was unable to obtain investments from potential investors in October 2016 and November 2016, due to Leidos's failure to provide testing data that was required under the Services Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87-88). CCTI does not allege that either of these two potential investors was the Shenuan investor group. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CCTI claims that Dr. Paul, on behalf of Leidos, billed CCTI for numerous services that he did not perform, and that CCTI discovered this malfeasance when it regained the password to the Pilot Plant in August 2017. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-69). CCTI also alleges that Dr. Paul refused to produce a comprehensive report on tests of CCTI's technology for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\"), as the Services Agreement required, until CCTI delivered an additional $ 70,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 76-78). On August 31, 2017, in response to CCTI's assertions that Leidos's failure to produce Dr. Paul's report would be a breach of the Services Agreement, Dr. Paul produced a report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-80). CCTI alleges that the report was not compliant with the Services Agreement and contained numerous inaccuracies, but, due to Dr. Paul's prior assurances to DOE that it would receive a report, CCTI was forced to submit the report to DOE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80). After DOE itself noticed inaccuracies in the report, CCTI was required to pay Kiewet to prepare a new report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The DOE Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   More broadly, CCTI alleges that Leidos and Dr. Paul interfered with CCTI's relationship with DOE. CCTI alleges that while it was negotiating with a potential investor in October 2016, Dr. Paul requested that CCTI issue him stock before the deal closed. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-94). And when CCTI declined to issue stock, Dr. Paul told DOE that CCTI was financially unstable, in order to poison that relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95-97). CCTI alleges that the relationship between it and Dr. Paul became even more strained when Dr. Paul requested a \"reliance\" letter to make the CCTI shares he owned unrestricted, and CCTI refused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98-100). CCTI alleges that this dispute led Dr. Paul to provide his inaccurate August 31 report, which report contradicted the earlier Paul Email and damaged the relationship between CCTI and DOE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 101-04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    7. The New York State Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 21, 2017, Leidos sued CCTI in New York State Supreme Court, in an action styled as\n   <em>\n    Leidos Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clean Coal Technologies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 505651/17 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (the \"New York State Action\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 105). On March 23, 2017, the parties to that action stipulated that the balance owed to Leidos under the Services Agreement was $ 131,539.06. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   at \u00b6 106). Leidos filed the stipulation and obtained a judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109). CCTI now argues that this judgment was improperly obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff filed a summons with notice in New York State Supreme Court on October 27, 2017. (Dkt. # 1). On December 8, 2017, Leidos, with the consent of Dr. Paul, removed the action to this court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 13, 2017, Defendants filed an Answer with Counterclaims (Dkt. # 4), and, on March 15, 2018, Plaintiff filed its Complaint (Dkt. # 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following a conference on June 12, 2018, this Court issued a scheduling order for motion practice and discovery. (Dkt. # 42). Pursuant to this Order, CCTI filed its First Amended Complaint on July 9, 2018. (Dkt. # 43). The First Amended Complaint brings four causes of action: (i) breach of contract against Leidos for breach of the Services Agreement; (ii) tortious interference with the Construction Contract against Leidos; (iii) tortious interference with the Services Agreement against Dr. Paul; and (iv) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage against Leidos and Dr. Paul. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 111-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 6, 2018, Leidos and Dr. Paul filed separate motions to dismiss. (Dkt. # 49-54). Leidos and Dr. Paul both moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, and Dr. Paul also moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leidos Br. 1; Paul Br. 7). On October 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed memoranda of law in opposition to Defendants' motions to dismiss. (Dkt. # 61, 62). On October 19, 2018, Leidos and Dr. Paul filed their respective replies in support of their motions to dismiss. (Dkt. # 67, 68). The Court begins by addressing the antecedent issue of jurisdiction, and then addresses the four causes of action alleged in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Dr. Paul Transacted Business in New York, and the Claims at Issue Are Substantially Related to Those Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Paul does not dispute for the purposes of his motion that he transacted\n   business within New York, and therefore, the principal question is whether CCTI's claims against him arise from these transactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paul Br. 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   CCTI makes two claims against Dr. Paul: that he tortiously procured the breach of the Services Agreement and that he tortiously interfered with CCTI's relationships with prospective investors and DOE. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 125-41). On the issue of personal jurisdiction, CCTI alleges that Dr. Paul transacted business by presenting to CCTI on the Pilot Plant's technology in New York, pitching potential investors on CCTI's technology in New York, raising money for CCTI in New York and attending its shareholder meetings, and attending New York-based conference calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). CCTI further alleges that these activities were substantially connected to Dr. Paul's tortious behavior, including in particular his decision to sabotage the Services Agreement when CCTI failed to provide him assurances related to his restricted stock holdings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-83). The Court agrees that the allegations suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Assuming that these allegations are true, as the Court must at this stage, Dr. Paul engaged in an ongoing business relationship with CCTI involving numerous activities in New York, and then sabotaged that relationship in response to CCTI's failure to enrich him personally. The tortious actions alleged are closely related to, and indeed arose from, the breakdown of an ongoing New York-based contractual relationship. The \" 'arising from' prong of section 302(a)(1) does not require a causal link, but rather requires 'a relatedness between the transaction and the legal claim such that the latter is not completely unmoored from the former[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingenito\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Riri USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308256\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/89/462/#p477\">\n    89 F.Supp.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Licci ex rel.

Here, it is alleged, Dr. Paul repeatedly traveled to New York to support CCTI's business, and only after CCTI rejected his requests for financial enrichment did he sabotage the relationship that he had carefully cultivated. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74-83).

While these actions may have occurred outside New York, they were a response to the breakdown of a New York-based relationship.

In particular, he claims that the alleged financial injury to CCTI does not suffice to create personal jurisdiction over him because \"a plaintiff is injured 'where the event giving rise to the injury occurred,' the so-called 'situs of injury.' \" (Paul Reply 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pramer S.C.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abaplus Int'l Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.D.3d%2089\">\n    76 A.D.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3985790\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/76/89/3985790/#p160\">\n    907 N.Y.S.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (1st Dep't 2010) ) ). Plaintiff responds by arguing that the inaccurate report and unperformed tests for which it was billed led to the loss of potential customers in New York. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74-88). The Court does not find that the events leading to these injuries occurred in New York.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 105-06; Fallati Decl., Ex. 11). The parties also do not dispute that the litigants were the same parties; that the court was of competent jurisdiction; and that the action reached a conclusion with the stipulation of the parties. (Fallati Decl., Ex. 11). Instead, the parties dispute whether the claims in this case are claims made \"on the basis of a pre-existing claim for relief that would impair the rights or interests established in the first action.\"\n   <em>\n    Classic Autos.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1168754\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/204/209/\">\n    612 N.Y.S.2d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Leidos's argument on this point is straightforward: CCTI agreed to a stipulation, by which it acknowledged that it owed Leidos outstanding payments for work performed under the Services Agreement. Therefore, CCTI could not keep silent regarding claims related to improper billing (Am. Compl. \u00b6 116), failure to perform (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115), or failure to deliver a report (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113) in that proceeding, and then bring the instant claims for relief, all of which bear directly on the required payments, in a separate suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Leidos points to numerous decisions from state and federal courts in New York concluding that a party cannot relitigate contractual performance when it has already agreed to make payments on the disputed performance in a prior action. (Leidos Br. 9-10). In\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the court refused to allow a plaintiff's claims against his mortgage servicing company for failing to comply with its contractual obligations to go forward, when the plaintiff failed to bring those claims in a prior foreclosure action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306139\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/156/491/#p509\">\n    156 F.Supp.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509-10 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).

Using the analysis of the cases just cited, CCTI \"remain[ed] silent\" in the New York State Action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry Modell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2347857\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/68/456/#p461\">\n    68 N.Y.2d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20N.Y.S.2d%2063\">\n    510 N.Y.S.2d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=502%20N.E.2d%20978\">\n    502 N.E.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but now seeks to litigate the same issue of performance here. The Court agrees that CCTI is foreclosed from raising arguments that Leidos failed to perform under the contract, having previously stipulated to owing Leidos payments for that same performance in the New York State Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CCTI counters that it did not remain silent, but rather discovered new facts after the stipulation was entered in the New York State Action. The Court finds this argument without merit. CCTI maintains that it could not have known about the failure to perform until it recovered the password that provided access to the Pilot Plant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-60). CCTI argues, therefore, that it \"did not 'remain silent' in the prior action because, at the time, it did not and could not have known there was anything to say.\" (CCTI Leidos Opp. 6). In examining the Amended Complaint, the Court agrees with Leidos that at numerous points CCTI appears to undercut its own argument with references to disputes that existed between the parties prior to the New York State Action. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 33 (referring to Benham's \"subpar performance of the Construction Contract\" and \"various issues that had arisen during the performance of the Construction Contract\"),\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 113-15 (alleging that an element of the breach was Leidos's failure to \"supervise Benham in the performance of the Construction Contract\") ). Elements of this dispute clearly existed prior to the stipulation, but were not raised in the New York State Action. This alone negates Plaintiff's claims that it could not have known of Leidos's deficient performance at the time it filed the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, even accepting that CCTI was unaware of certain breaches, the Court does not agree that these gaps in knowledge would defeat the preclusive effect of the New York State Action. Plaintiff relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Mason Tenders Dist. Council Pension Fund\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Messera\n   </em>\n   , No. 95 Civ. 9341 (RWS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20578048\">\n    1996 WL 578048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 8, 1996), where a court in this District declined to find preclusive effect where, \"according to Plaintiffs' allegations, ... Defendants ... concealed from Plaintiffs the kickback and embezzlement scheme from which those claims arose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20578048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Significantly, however, the\n   <em>\n    Mason Tenders\n   </em>\n   decision does not suggest that lack of knowledge will overcome the otherwise preclusive effect of failure to bring a claim; rather, it emphasizes that defendants are not entitled to preclusion where they have concealed material giving rise to the claims at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Separately, CCTI fails to plead concealment with particularity under any standard. The parties dispute what standard to apply to pleadings regarding the potential concealment of breaches in the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   context. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leidos Br. 10-11; CCTI Leidos Opp. 8-9; Leidos Reply 5). However, the Court does not find it necessary to resolve this dispute. The pleadings do not provide evidence of any affirmative misstatements regarding performance of the contract beyond the conclusory allegation that \"[Dr. Paul] and others had not in fact\n   performed the services indicated on the invoices.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 107). This does not constitute active concealment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ningbo Prod. Imp. &amp; Exp. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eliau,\n   </em>\n   No. 11 Civ. 650 (PKC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205142756\">\n    2011 WL 5142756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 31, 2011) (\"[A] party's mere intent not to perform is not sufficient to establish fraudulent conduct.\" (citation omitted) ). CCTI also provides a long description of how it discovered that it did not have the password and SD Card required to operate the Pilot Plant in June 2017, and could not discover certain failures to perform until it regained those items. (CCTI Leidos Opp. 8-9). However, CCTI does not explain why it did not know about the missing password and cards at the time it entered into the stipulation, nor does it offer any suggestion that Leidos concealed these items during the pendency of the New York State Action. Nothing in these allegations resembles an undisclosed \"kickback and embezzlement scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason Tenders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20578048\">\n    1996 WL 578048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The Court does not find that the Amended Complaint demonstrates that CCTI could not have known of Leidos's breach when it entered the stipulation, and accordingly finds that CCTI is foreclosed from bringing claims for breach of contract when it entered into a stipulation acknowledging that it owed money under that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   CCTI quotes from another district court decision in arguing that such a finding would gut New York's permissive counterclaim rules: \" 'To hold otherwise would have the effect of rendering New York a compulsory counterclaim jurisdiction, because any counterclaims not asserted would be barred in subsequent actions.'\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   [No. 13 Civ. 1552 (PKC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204662247\">\n    2014 WL 4662247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] at *3 (E.D.N.Y.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As to this claim as well, the parties agree that certain elements are not in dispute. Leidos does not argue that CCTI has failed to allege the existence of a valid contract between it and Benham, Leidos's knowledge of said contract, the breach of said contract, or damages resulting from that breach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leidos Br. 14). Instead, Leidos argues that CCTI fails to allege plausibly that Leidos either intentionally procured the breach or was the but-for cause of the breach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   CCTI offers two mechanisms by which Leidos procured Benham's breach of the Construction Contract: CCTI alleges that Leidos refused to provide it with the password and SD Card, and instead delivered them to Benham. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-44). CCTI also alleges that Ezel, a Leidos employee, billed CCTI for work that he did not perform under the Construction Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62). Much of CCTI's briefing describes these allegations in substantial detail. (CCTI Leidos Opp. 14-15). Even with such detail, however, the allegations remain inadequate to state an intentional procurement of a breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   CCTI's Amended Complaint makes clear that Benham made an independent decision to withhold the password and SD card. For starters, the allegations regarding the password and the SD Card are that Leidos possessed them and turned them over to Benham rather than CCTI. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41). The Complaint then alleges that Benham refused to provide these items to CCTI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. \u00b6\u00b6 41-48). There is no allegation that this refusal to provide the items was done at Leidos's instruction; that Leidos conceived of this plan; or that Leidos even suggested that Benham withhold these items. Instead, the Amended Complaint alleges that Benham refused to turn over the items until CCTI made a payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49). And Ezel's alleged breach is similarly untethered to Leidos's relationship with Benham. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62). The Ezel allegations merely state a manner in which the Construction Agreement was breached, and not a manner in which Leidos procured that breach. The Court does not find that CCTI has plausibly alleged anything other than an independent decision by Benham to breach the Construction Agreement, which may have been eased by certain actions taken by Leidos. Tortious interference requires more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   These pleading deficiencies are highlighted when this case is compared to the cases cited by CCTI.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 34-60), and there is no allegation that Leidos directed or commanded Benham to breach. None of CCTI's cases involves a plaintiff alleging both that a contractual counterparty deliberately and independently breached an agreement for its own economic benefit and that a third party was liable for procuring that breach. All of them involve a defendant directing or setting in motion the alleged breach. For all of these reasons, the Court finds that CCTI has failed to allege adequately that Leidos procured or caused Benham's alleged breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Aug. 18, 2017). Dr. Paul argues that the allegations show nothing other than that he took actions within the scope of his employment at Leidos, actions that CCTI now claims to be in breach of its agreement with Leidos. (Paul Br. 18-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   CCTI argues that it has adequately alleged that Dr. Paul took actions for purely personal gain or, in the alternative, actions beyond the scope of his employment with Leidos. As support, CCTI points to allegations in the Amended Complaint that Dr.\n   Paul chose to sabotage the Services Agreement in the face of CCTI's refusal to provide releases for his restricted stock or to provide him a $ 70,000 payment. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-104, 132). As further support, CCTI points to a text message from Dr. Paul to CCTI that allegedly read, \"Any progress on the issuing of stock before the deal closes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94). Dr. Paul offers alternative explanations for this text (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Paul Br. 19), but at the pleading stage, drawing all inferences in favor of CCTI, the Court cannot rule out the possibility that Dr. Paul acted for his own personal gain in failing to perform until CCTI acceded to his demands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Island Two LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Island One, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13 Civ. 2121 (LGS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205380216\">\n    2013 WL 5380216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2013) (finding at the motion to dismiss stage that similar \"allegations [were] sufficient to support a claim\" that a corporate officer acted \"outside the scope of [his] employment\" and sought to \"personally profit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   However, the claim fails for a separate reason: The Amended Complaint fails to allege that Dr. Paul's actions, whether personally motivated or otherwise, were the but-for cause of any breach of the Services Agreement. Dr. Paul argues, similarly to Leidos's argument in the context of Benham, that the Amended Complaint cannot state a claim for tortious interference, because it specifically alleges that Leidos elected to breach the Services Agreement independently of any action by Dr. Paul. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-78 (\"Leidos took the position that it was not even required to provide a 'comprehensive report,' pursuant to the Services Agreement and manufactured reasons by which it was supposedly unable to do so. ... Leidos took this position notwithstanding [Dr Paul's ... [contrary] position[.]\") ). It is obvious that if Leidos elected to breach independently, Dr. Paul cannot be the but-for cause of that breach. The Court finds that the inclusion of these allegations in the Amended Complaint foreclose CCTI's tortious interference of contract claim against Dr. Paul.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RSM Prod.

Here, CCTI clearly alleges that Leidos acted in numerous ways to frustrate the Services Agreement on its own and not at the direction of Dr. Paul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Try as it might, CCTI cannot have it both ways: The breach of contract allegations in the Amended Complaint make clear that CCTI believes Leidos breached through failing to provide the final report when required to do so. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 113). In its opposition, CCTI states for the first time that \"but for [Dr. Paul's] conduct, the Services Agreement would have been performed.\" (CCTI Paul Opp. 20).

Further, CCTI has alleged that Leidos, through its employee, maliciously interfered with CCTI's relationship with the DOE by inaccurately and unnecessarily representing to the DOE that CCTI was financially unstable, thereby damaging CCTI's relationship with the DOE.

It is true that the allegations of malice are minimal in the Amended Complaint. However, unlike the Leidos allegations, CCTI has alleged facts concerning Dr. Paul that, taken as true, transcend mere breach of contract. Specifically, CCTI states that Dr. Paul maliciously misrepresented data that he knew would be transmitted to DOE (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-26, 28, 92-104); demanded personal payment for a report DOE required (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 92-104, 132); and planted false expectations with DOE (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 73-83, 90-104). At this stage of the case, these allegations of intentionally false communications in the service of personal gain suffice to state that Dr. Paul \"engage[d] in conduct for the sole purpose of inflicting intentional harm on\" CCTI.\n   <em>\n    Carvel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456434\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/182/#p189\">\n    3 N.Y.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456434\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/182/#p189\">\n    785 N.Y.S.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456434\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/182/#p189\">\n    818 N.E.2d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freedman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pearlman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"267455\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/271/301/\">\n    271 A.D.2d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"267455\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/271/301/\">\n    706 N.Y.S.2d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (1st Dep't 2000) (\"[W]e find that plaintiff[ ] set forth sufficient allegations of an intentionally fallacious communication with prospective [contractual partners] to\n   survive dismissal at this juncture.\").

CCTI responds that the Amended Complaint makes clear that Dr. Paul was involved in soliciting investors from Shenuan, China, as well as unnamed potential investors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86, 102). The Court does not find that the Amended Complaint specifies that Dr. Paul interfered with a potential investment from the Shenuan investors, as the paragraphs at issue do not refer back to this group. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87-88 (referencing two \"potential investors\" seeking to buy \"70% of CCTI\", but leaving unmentioned the Shenuan investors) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Amended Complaint also does not contain any allegations that Dr. Paul knew of the potential purchasers of 70% of CCTI or that he directed any action at them. In opposition, CCTI argues again that it stated a claim for interference with the Shenuan investors, but the Court again finds that CCTI is seeking to amend its pleadings through opposition briefing. The Court rejects this argument, which is contradicted by the text of the Amended Complaint. In consequence, the Court does not find that the Amended Complaint has adequately alleged that Dr. Paul was aware of the potential investors or directed any action at them. Therefore, the Court finds that CCTI has failed to state a claim against Dr. Paul for tortious interference with potential investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In sum, the Court dismisses CCTI's claims for tortious interference with the sole exception of the claim against Dr. Paul for tortious interference with CCTI's prospective relationship with DOE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Leidos's motion to dismiss is GRANTED. Dr. Paul's motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

The Court also draws from certain documents that the parties agree are incorporated by reference in the Amended Complaint and that are attached as exhibits to the Declaration of Thomas R. Fallati (\"Fallati Decl.\" (Dkt. # 51) ).\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    For ease of reference, the Court refers to the parties' briefing as follows: the Memorandum of Law in Support of Leidos, Inc.'s Motion for to Dismiss as \"Leidos Br.\" (Dkt. # 50); Defendant Dr. Anton Dilo Paul's Memorandum of Law in Support of His Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint as \"Paul Br.\" (Dkt. # 52); Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Leidos's Motion to Dismiss as \"CCTI Leidos Opp.\" (Dkt. # 61); Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Dr. Anton Dilo Paul's Motion to Dismiss as \"CCTI Paul Opp.\" (Dkt. # 62); Leidos's Reply Memorandum of Law as \"Leidos Reply\" (Dkt. # 67); and Dr. Paul's Reply Memorandum of Law as \"Paul Reply\" (Dkt. # 68).\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Dr. Paul also do not argue any violation of due process, and therefore the Court does undertake a separate analysis of this point.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Because the Court finds the breach of contract claim to be barred by\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    , it does not reach Leidos's arguments regarding failure to state a claim. Leidos largely focuses its briefing on\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    and spends only a paragraph on the failure to state a claim argument in both its initial motion and its reply. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Leidos Br. 13; Leidos Reply. 6). The Court also notes the difficulty of dismissing a breach of contract allegation for failure to state a claim.
