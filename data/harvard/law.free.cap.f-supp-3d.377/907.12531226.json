Pl.'s Resp. to Def. National Casualty's SUMF \u00b6 11. During a game on or about February 10, 2012, a player for the opposing team, the Akwesasne Warriors, allegedly struck Moje in the face with a hockey stick, thrusting the blade under Moje's helmet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The pending motions for summary judgment in this diversity case raise choice of law questions and questions of substantive\n   insurance law.

National Casualty Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"SUMF\") \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, ECF No. 95. His injuries resulted in his being placed on the League's 30-day injured reserve (\"IR\") list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.

Compl. Ex. A (\"Policy\"), ECF No. 13-1. The policy identifies defendant The David Agency Insurance, Inc. as the policy's producer, National Casualty as the insurer, and the Federal Hockey League (\"the League\") and its commissioner, defendant Dan Kirnan (\"Kirnan\"), as the insureds.\n   <em>\n    Moje v. Fed. Hockey League LLC\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Moje II\n   </em>\n   ],\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272623\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/833/#p836\">\n    207 F.Supp.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836 (N.D. Ill. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In count two of his Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), Moje seeks a declaratory judgment against The David Agency. He alleges that the League communicated to The David Agency the type of insurance it needed to insure against the injury he sustained, that The David Agency knew what type of policy the League wanted, and that the League \"was under the impression that the policy at issue covered personal injury losses, such as that sustained by plaintiff.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 38-41 (quotation in \u00b6 41). Moje has since made clear his theory: that The David Agency negligently failed to procure the insurance the League wanted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Slip Op. at 8. This court has not decided whether the policy covers Moje's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Separate motions for summary judgment filed by National Casualty and The David Agency are before the court. National Casualty contends that Kirnan and the League failed to comply with the policy's notice provisions. The David Agency argues that Moje cannot come forward with sufficient evidence to require a trial on his claim that The David Agency negligently procured the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procurement of the Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The David Agency is an Illinois insurance producer with a principal place of business in Elmhurst. Pl.'s Resp. to The David Agency SUMF \u00b6 1, ECF No. 98. Jo Ellen Weldon, a David Agency employee, produced the policy at issue here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, 8. Someone other than Kirnan associated with the League may have initially contacted The David Agency about procuring insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Following the initial contact, Weldon communicated beginning in October 2011 with Kirnan by phone and email about procuring insurance; Kirnan served as the \"primary contact\" for the League.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kirnan and Weldon had \"several conversations\" before the policy was issued. Pl.'s Resp. to The David Agency SUMF \u00b6 14. The two discussed the possibility of obtaining coverage for certain teams in addition to the League itself, but Weldon told Kirnan that The David Agency could not procure that kind of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Regarding the League, Kirnan told Weldon \"that he wanted to purchase general liability insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18 (testimony that Kirnan was \"just looking for a general liability policy\") (quoting Weldon Dep. 18:18-19:4, The David Agency SUMF Ex.

Tab D, ECF No. 94-1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Weldon sent Kirnan a quote for general liability coverage; the quote outlined the policy's coverage and limits.

Pl.'s Resp. to The David Agency SUMF \u00b6 22. At some point Weldon told Kirnan that \"the policy contained \"an extra coverage for liability, tort liability.\" Def. The David Agency Resp. to Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 4 (quoting Weldon Dep. 15:8-12). She did not tell Kirnan that claims made by players against the League would be excluded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Nor did Weldon advise Kirnan that he had to give prompt notice of a claim or lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kirnan did not know what a \"general liability\" policy would cover and relied on The David Agency to procure a policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12. He \"is the only person with knowledge of any requests from the FHL to The David Agency to procure insurance coverage for the FHL,\" and he is the \"only person with knowledge of any communications between the FHL and The David Agency relating to the procurement of insurance coverage for the FHL.\" Pl.'s Resp. to The David Agency SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16 (undisputed); accord\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Weldon sent Kirnan a copy of the policy on November 2, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The second paragraph of her transmittal letter reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I have reviewed your policy but ask that you please take time to examine it carefully to make sure the limits of coverage meet your needs and that no items have been omitted.

Supp. Mot. for Summ. J. Tab H, ECF No. 94-1 ). Kirnan read and understood the letter when he received it on or around the same day. Pl.'s Resp. to The David Agency SUMF \u00b6 25 (citing Kirnan Dep. 113:22-114:8). Kirnan testified that he was \"not aware of any errors with respect to the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. \"Kirnan does not have any criticisms of The David Agency's conduct in connection with the procurement of the Policy and has no complaints about the Policy that was provided by The David Agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The policy contains language that National Casualty argues precludes coverage for any claims based on Moje's injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. The David Agency Resp. to Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 15. \"The first exclusion to which National Casualty points precludes coverage for 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" Def. The David Agency Resp. to Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 7 (quoting Policy pp. 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An endorsement to the policy states that National Casualty \"will pay those sums that the Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' to any 'participant' to which this insurance\n   applies.\" Pl.'s Resp. to The David Agency SUMF \u00b6 28. The term \"participant\" is defined as 'players, coaches, managers, staff members, team workers, officials, media personnel, Very Important Persons and other personnel who have been granted proper authorization to enter any restricted area.' \" Policy 40; Def.

The League has never offered a reason. After a co-defendant told the League that no answer had been filed on its behalf, it did not take precautions such as notifying the insurer, engaging counsel in Chicago, or checking the district court's docket (which can be done from any desktop computer). A check of the docket would have revealed that LoFaro did not file an appearance as the League's attorney and did nothing to protect its interests. Because LoFaro had not filed an appearance, Moje's lawyer would have sent all filings, such as the request for a default judgment and his proof of damages, directly to the League, which sat on its hands.

The preference for resolution on the merits serves the interests of plaintiffs and defendants alike, as the facts of this case illustrate.

We will never know whether Moje would have been successful if his claim against the League had been litigated on its merits or whether the League's insurance policy would have afforded coverage. We will never know because the League made the decision not to give reasonable notice to its insurer and instead hired a lawyer who never defended the suit and who was not licensed to practice before this court. That led to the entry of a default judgment that for Moje is probably the practical equivalent of losing on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the reasons explained above, neither National Casualty nor The David Agency can be held liable to Moje in these circumstances.
