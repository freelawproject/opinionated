Cynthia Bashant, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Harper Construction Company, Inc. built a $ 35 million training facility for the U.S. Army's Patriot Missile System. Less than two years later, the Government informed Harper of cracked walls and binding doors at the facility. The Government demanded that Harper Construction investigate and repair the facility's defects, and the company has incurred nearly $ 2 million in costs to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA, issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to Harper Construction. National Union's insurance policy names the other Plaintiff in this action, Harper Mechanical Contractors, LLC, as an additional insured. This insurance coverage dispute turns on whether National Union has a duty to defend and indemnify Plaintiffs in\n   connection with the defects at the military training facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Presently before the Court is National Union's motion for partial summary judgment. (ECF No. 16.) National Union argues its insurance policy does not establish a duty to defend or indemnify Plaintiffs in these circumstances. The Court heard oral argument on the motion. (ECF No. 29.) For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Union's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Patriot Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Harper Construction is a general contractor whose primary client is the U.S. Government. (J. Harper Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 17-1.) In 2007, the Government awarded Harper Construction a contract to build a U.S. Army training facility for the Patriot Missile System in Fort Sill, Oklahoma (\"Project\"). (Joint Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"JSUF\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 20.) The scope of work for the Project contemplated a 148,900 square-foot facility that includes classrooms, various training and simulation areas, and administrative offices. (Patriot General Instructional Facility Contract \u00a7 00050, J. Harper Decl. Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To complete the Project, \"Harper Construction hired design and engineering professionals, suppliers, and various subcontractors.\" (JSUF \u00b6 2.) These subcontractors included Plaintiff Harper Mechanical Contractors, which was formerly known as Harper Grading, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:4-6, \u00b6 2.) Harper Construction hired Harper Mechanical to perform demolition, grading, and other work at the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Over the next year and a half, Harper completed the Project, and the Government \"conducted a Final Inspection of the Project on February 4, 2009.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. National Union's Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant National Union issued Commercial General Liability Policy No. GL 161-74-28 (\"Policy\") to Harper Construction. (JSUF \u00b6 7; Policy, Counterclaim Ex. 1, ECF No. 4 at 27-103.) The Policy was effective from January 1, 2008, to January 1, 2009, and it provides for up to $ 1 million in coverage for each occurrence, with a $ 2 million general aggregate limit. (Policy at 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   An endorsement to the Policy names Harper Mechanical as an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Policy's Insuring Agreement provides that National Union \"will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies.\" (Policy \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1.) National Union has \"the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That said, an endorsement to the Policy modifies the Insuring Agreement's coverage by limiting the amount National Union is obligated to expend for defense costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-52.) The Defense Costs Within Policy Limits Endorsement (\"Defense Costs Limits Endorsement\") provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Our right and duty to defend such claims or \"suits\" end when we have exhausted the limits available ... for either payments of judgments or settlements or defense costs, as such costs are described in ... this endorsement....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) The Policy also contains numerous other endorsements that expand or\n   limit the Insuring Agreement's coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Problems at the Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"After the Project was constructed and turned over to the U.S. Government [in February 2009], Harper Construction was informed in December 2010 of property damage at the Project including, but not limited to, gypsum wallboard cracks and binding doors.\" (JSUF \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) In early 2011, Harper conducted repairs at the Project, but the problems \"continued to appear after the corrective [action].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Then, in July 2013, the Government sent two letters to Harper Construction requesting an investigation of the problems at the Project and asking that the company propose a plan to correct the issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Several months later, \"Harper Construction and U.S. Government personnel participated in a mutual agreement meeting to establish a methodology for monitoring the Project to determine the cause of gypsum wallboard cracks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) During 2013 and 2014, Harper also \"conducted on-site investigations and third-party reviews to determine the cause of the cracks and binding doors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In August 2014, as Harper continued to investigate the cause of the problems, one of the Government's engineers threatened to escalate matters, expressing to Harper:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I understand the need for due diligence and am trying to be reasonable in affording ample opportunity for so doing but lack of action is resulting in loss of patience on this end. Should you not close in on resolution and lay out a prudent plan to remediate in a prompt and orderly manner, I will be left with little recourse but to initiate pursuit of more formal administrative recourse. Need your help bringing this to a head quickly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Counterclaim Ex. 9; JSUF \u00b6 18.) Harper Construction's President also submits a declaration stating that the \"Government advised that if Harper Construction did not repair the property damage, the U.S. Government would demolish the Patriot Project and force Harper Construction to re-build the facility from the ground up at its own cost.\" (J. Harper Decl. \u00b6 9.) \"The U.S. Government also threatened to lodge complaints with Harper Construction's bonding company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, in a \"letter dated January 20, 2015, the U.S. Government requested, in part, that Harper Construction develop a definite plan of action and a timeline for conducting testing and analysis.\" (JSUF \u00b6 19.) In response, on April 10, 2015, Harper Construction submitted a corrective action plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Harper's Claim with National Union\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 2, 2015-approximately four years after the Government first notified Harper of problems at the Project-Harper Construction's insurance broker submitted a claim to National Union by e-mail, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In 2008 Harper Construction built a project called the Patriot Training Facility. They used a grading contractor, Harper Grading, to do the grading. Harper Grading is NOT owned by Harper Construction. Recently, small cracks appeared in some of the building's walls. It appears water runs under the building causing the building to move up and down. Upon investigation, it appears the fill used in the grading was partially good and partially bad. In order to stop the water from going under the building, Harper Construction is looking at different options. Harper Construction is looking at Harper Grading for the cost of repairs. Harper Grading was insured by [National Union] during the grading work, (see attached certificate), and\n   Harper is looking to [National Union] for the needed work costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (JSUF \u00b6 21.) On May 7, 2015, National Union acknowledged receipt of the claim and requested documents and information from Harper Construction, including \"contract documents,\" \"[a]n explanation of the nature of the alleged damages related to Harper's work,\" and \"[a] summary of any corrective work Harper may have done after completion of its original contracts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) National Union further stated that it would investigate the claim, but cautioned that it was \"reserving all of its rights and defenses based upon the Policy and/or applicable law.\" (Counterclaim Ex. 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JSUF \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Over the next year and a half, Harper Construction corresponded \"numerous times\" with National Union to provide the insurer with more information to support Harper's claim. (J. Harper Decl. \u00b6 21, Ex. G.) During this time, Harper periodically updated National Union regarding the costs the construction company claimed it had incurred to investigate and repair the Project's problems, which soon ballooned to well over a million dollars. (JSUF \u00b6\u00b6 23-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Toward the end of 2016 and early 2017, Harper Construction increasingly pressed National Union regarding the status of Harper's claim. (JSUF \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Then, on March 27, 2017, National Union sent Harper a letter denying coverage for the claim, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on the information received to date, it does not appear that this matter involves a lawsuit or any legal obligation of Harper Construction or Harper Grading to pay damages because of \"property damage\" to which the Policy applies, or any judgment against Harper Construction or Harper Grading. Further, even in the event this matter involved such a claim, it does not appear that this matter involves any \"property damage\" that took place during the effective dates of the Policy. Finally, it appears based on the information available to date that the wrap exclusion to the Policy would preclude coverage for claims arising out of Harper Construction's work at the Project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Counterclaim Ex. 19; JSUF \u00b6 29.) National Union further explained its decision regarding the potential duty to defend Harper:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   National Union has not been provided with any information indicating that the Claim at issue involves a \"suit\" within the meaning of Policy. Harper Construction has instead provided National Union with information indicating that the Army is allowing Harper Construction to propose remedies to the soils issues and that Harper Construction is voluntarily performing investigation of the issue and providing estimates to [remedy the Project's problems]. Accordingly, National Union has no duty to defend or indemnify Harper Construction and/or Harper Grading....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Counterclaim Ex. 19; JSUF \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 30, 2018, Harper commenced this action in San Diego County Superior Court. (Compl., ECF No. 1-2.) The Complaint asserts various claims against National Union, including breach of contract, declaratory relief, and intentional misrepresentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-65.) The gravamen of Harper's claims is that National Union wrongfully denied coverage and failed to defend and indemnify Harper with respect to the Government's demands to investigate and repair the problems at the Project. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Harper states it has incurred $ 1,809,029.43 in costs to respond to the Government's demands as of September 2018. (J. Harper Decl. \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   National Union removed the action to this Court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 2-3.) National Union then filed a Counterclaim against Harper that raises several claims for declaratory relief. (Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 42-52, ECF No. 4.) National Union now moves for summary judgment on several of Harper's causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense-or the part of each claim or defense-on which summary judgment is sought.\" Fed.

(Mot. 1:8-2:13.) Harper argues this Court should adopt a different interpretation of the Policy that would preclude summary judgment. (Opp'n 8:15-21.) Accordingly, the Court first reviews the framework for interpreting insurance policies under California law. The Court then analyzes the text of the Policy to determine whether Harper's dispute with the Government triggered National Union's duties to defend and indemnify Harper.

Aside from arbitration, the Policy's \"suit\" definition encompasses ADR \"proceeding[s]\" only when \"the insured submits\" to the ADR proceeding with National Union's \"consent.\" (Policy \u00a7 V, \u00b6 18.) It follows that National Union has no obligation to defend an ADR proceeding based on this portion of the \"suit\" definition unless the insurance company first provides its consent to the proceeding. Thus, even if Harper's interactions with the Government amounted to a type of ADR \"proceeding,\" Harper does not introduce evidence upon which a reasonable factfinder could conclude Harper submitted to this ADR proceeding with National Union's consent-a prerequisite to the insurer's defense obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Harper, the evidence does not demonstrate that Harper faced a civil proceeding seeking damages under the Policy or that Harper submitted to an ADR proceeding with National Union's consent. Consequently, the Court rejects all of Harper's arguments concerning the duty to defend that are based on the Policy's definition of \"suit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defense Costs Limits Endorsement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Harper's second theory concerning the duty to defend centers on the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement. As mentioned, this endorsement modifies the extent of National Union's duty to defend. In the body of the Policy, the Insuring Agreement provides that National Union's \"right and duty to defend ends when\" the insurer has \"used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under\" the Policy. (Policy \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1.) In the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement,\n   that provision is replaced with the following text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Our right and duty to defend such claims or \"suits\" end when we have exhausted the limits available, as provided under [the Policy] for either payments of judgments or settlements or defense costs, as such costs are described in ... this endorsement ... This applies both to claims and \"suits\" pending at that time and those filed thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) The effect of this amendment is to change the Policy into a \"burning limits\" policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Under most liability policies, the insurer's duties to indemnify and to defend are separate obligations. Thus, amounts spent in defense of a third party claim do not reduce the indemnity limits available to settle the claim or pay an adverse judgment.... However, under some policies, the indemnity limits\n   <em>\n    are reduced\n   </em>\n   by the legal fees and other defense costs expended. I.e., as the costs to defend the third party claim increase, the indemnity coverage available to settle that claim\n   <em>\n    decreases.\n   </em>\n   (These are commonly referred to as \"self-consuming\" or \"burning limits\" provisions.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Hon.

Harper focuses on the endorsement's initial phrase, \"Our right and duty to defend such claims or 'suits' ....\" (Policy at 50.) Harper argues this \"conspicuous and unambiguous\" language expands National Union's duty to defend \"suits\" to also include a duty to defend any potential \"claims\" under the Policy. (Opp'n 17:5-24:2.) And, to the extent that this portion of the endorsement conflicts with the Policy's remaining text, Harper argues the endorsement should control and be construed in favor of the insured and its reasonable expectations regarding coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The effect of this interpretation would be that National Union had the obligation to step in and defend Harper from the Government's demands once the insurer became aware of the Government's \"claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court is not convinced. The fragment of the Policy's text that Harper relies upon is found in a provision that plainly addresses when National Union's duty to defend ends-not when the duty arises. Indeed, this text must be interpreted \"in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513955\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/221/#p201\">\n    17 Cal. App. 5th at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court may also rely upon the Policy's structure and organization to interpret the relevant endorsement's text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins. Exch. v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"462663\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/116/446/#p459\">\n    116 Cal.

And when the endorsement is placed into context, the fragment at issue cannot be reasonably interpreted to broaden National Union's duty to defend to include any \"claim\" that has not yet ripened into a \"suit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As described above, the insurer's duty to defend is first mentioned at the start of the Policy's Insuring Agreement. In tracking the language found in standard CGL policies, the Insuring Agreement states that National Union has \"the right and duty to defend the insured against\" suits seeking damages to which the Policy applies, but has no obligation to defend suits not seeking such damages. (Policy \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1.) The insurer also has the \"discretion\" to \"investigate any 'occurrence' and settle any claim or 'suit' that may result.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This language plainly obligates National Union to defend \"suits,\" but does not require\n   the insurer to defend claims that have not yet ripened into suits, which the insurer nonetheless has the discretion to investigate and settle.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Foster-Gardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344194\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/18/857/#p886\">\n    18 Cal. 4th at 879-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20107\">\n    77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=959%20P.2d%20265\">\n    959 P.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The provision of the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement at issue does not amend this language in the Insuring Agreement. Rather, as mentioned above, the endorsement amends a subsequent section that discusses when the duty to defend terminates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   1. Insuring Agreement\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages ... to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages.... We may, at our discretion, investigate any offense and settle any claim or \"suit\" that may result. But:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (1) The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section Ill - Limits Of Insurance; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (2)\n   <s>\n    Our right and duty to defend end when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under Coverage C.\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    Our right and duty to defend such claims or \"suits\" end when we have exhausted the limits available, as provided under SECTION III - LIMITS OF INSURANCE for either payments of judgments or settlements or defense costs....\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under Supplementary Payments - Coverages A and B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1, &amp; at 50.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As seen, the endorsement specifically amends a section of the Policy that limits coverage by providing the duty to defend terminates when the Policy's limits have been exhausted to pay settlements or judgments. The endorsement does not amend the grant of coverage and the initial discussion of the duty to defend in Section 1.a. Thus, when placed into context, the \"intended function\" of the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement is to modify when the duty to defend terminates-not when it arises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513955\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/221/#p201\">\n    17 Cal. App. 5th at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Placing the provision into context also undercuts Harper's interpretation because the amended text follows a \"But\" at the end of the umbrella paragraph of the Insuring Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1, &amp; at 50.) This word indicates that the following two sections limit-not expand-the grant of coverage in the Insuring Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Further, because placing the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement into context renders Harper's interpretation unreasonable, the Court is unmoved by Harper's reliance on other principles of insurance policy interpretation to support its strained reading of the Policy. For instance, in arguing that the endorsement expands coverage to include a defense of claims, Harper relies on the rule that provisions granting coverage are to be interpreted broadly to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured. (Opp'n 14:20-23, 17:17-18 (citing\n   <em>\n    White v. W. Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"404436\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/40/870/#p881\">\n    40 Cal. 3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20509\">\n    221 Cal.Rptr. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=710%20P.2d%20309\">\n    710 P.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) ).) But the Defense\n   Costs Limits Endorsement is not a provision granting coverage. As shown above, the intended function of the amendment is plainly to limit coverage under the Policy by circumscribing the insurer's obligation to pay defense costs. Hence, this principle does not support Harper's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Harper also highlights that \"a specific provision relating to a particular subject governs in respect to that subject as against a general provision, even though the latter, standing alone, would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more specific provision relates.\" (Opp'n 15:7-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jane D. v. Ordinary Mut.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2407666\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/32/643/#p651\">\n    32 Cal.

Yet this principle, too, fails to substantiate Harper's interpretation. The Policy's specific provisions that address when National Union's duty to defend arises are found in the initial paragraph of the Insuring Agreement, and they are left unchanged by the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1, &amp; at 50.) The fragment relied upon by Harper is part of a provision that addresses a different \"particular subject\"-when the duty to defend terminates. Indeed, the provision more generally refers back to \"such claims or 'suits' \"-items that are first mentioned in the prior provisions of the Policy's Insuring Agreement. Hence, the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement is not the more specific provision addressing the issue at hand, and this principle does not validate Harper's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In addition, Harper places stock in the rule that \"the provisions of an endorsement prevail over conflicting provisions in the body of the policy, if the relevant language of the endorsement is conspicuous and free from ambiguity.\"\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"801087\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/32/1198/#p1217\">\n    32 Cal. 4th at 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2068\">\n    13 Cal.Rptr.3d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20P.3d%20381\">\n    89 P.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 14:13-16, 15:1-3, 22:3-5.) But when the phrase at issue is interpreted in context, the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement does not plainly conflict with the Policy; the endorsement amends a provision limiting coverage for defense costs and does not change the provisions addressing when the duty to defend arises. Regardless, the fragment at issue also does not conspicuously provide that National Union assumes the duty to defend any claim that has not ripened into a \"suit\" under the Policy. Accordingly, this principle does not persuade the Court to abandon the interpretation that is reached when the endorsement's text is read \"in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513955\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/221/#p201\">\n    17 Cal. App. 5th at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, the Court considers Harper's contention that the word \"and\" in the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement's phrase \"right\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   duty to defend such suits and claims\" means National Union has assumed the duty to defend claims. (Policy at 50 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 15:15-21, 17:17-20, 18:3-12, 20:1-9.) The endorsement's use of an \"and\"-instead of an \"or\"-implicitly suggests that National Union has already agreed to assume the duty to defend both claims and suits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Nat'l Interstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4212286\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/180/1319/#p1336\">\n    180 Cal.

The Court is not convinced, however, that the presence of an \"and\" in the endorsement changes the outcome. Harper's interpretation is unreasonable notwithstanding this conjunction because the endorsement does not conspicuously provide that National Union is assuming the duty to defend pre-suit claims. Rather, the endorsement specifically addresses when the duty to defend elapses and does not amend the Insuring Agreement's prior provision regarding the defense of \"suits\" and investigation of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   That said, even if Harper's interpretation of the Policy was reasonable, this interpretation would be but one of two reasonable constructions of the text. To resolve the resulting ambiguity, the Court would next determine whether coverage is consistent with Harper's objectively reasonable expectations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Robert S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456846\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/26/758/#p763\">\n    26 Cal. 4th 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20844\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20P.3d%20889\">\n    28 P.3d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Harper argues reading the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement to expand coverage would be consistent with its expectations because Harper \"would otherwise never receive benefits under the Policy for which it paid a premium.\" (Opp'n 20:10-13.) Harper explains that it would never receive benefits under the policy because it would have to invite a suit to obtain coverage and jeopardize its relationship with the Government, its primary client.

Harper does not highlight any other express terms of the Policy that it believes National Union breached. (Opp'n 26:19-30:19.)

There is no triable issue because Harper's asserted belief that National Union was providing coverage for Harper's claim is not reasonable as a matter of law. The insurer's initial response to Harper provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   By investigating this matter, National Union is reserving all of its rights and defenses based upon the Policy and/or applicable law. This letter is not, and should not be construed as, a waiver of any terms, conditions, exclusions or other policy provisions of the Policy, or any other insurance policies issued or allegedly issued by National Union or any of its affiliates. Furthermore, to the extent National Union determines, after its review of the information requested above, that Harper is entitled to a defense in connection with the above-referenced matter, National Union expressly reserves any and all rights and defenses in connection with the defense of Harper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (JSUF \u00b6 22, Counterclaim Ex. 13.) Harper submits evidence demonstrating that it cooperated with National Union's requests for information for the insurer's investigation, and that the insurer's adjuster informed Harper that it was \"running this up the ladder\" before National Union finally provided a negative coverage decision. (Opp'n 10:25-12:7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Harper Decl. Ex. G.) Harper Construction's President also submits a declaration stating that he \"was led to believe that National Union was acting in good faith and that it would pay Harper Construction, in full or in part, for the costs incurred as a result of the U.S. Government's demand.\" (Harper Decl. \u00b6 21.) But his belief alone is insufficient. There must be sufficient evidence to conclude National Union's conduct caused Harper to \"reasonably\" believe National Union was providing Harper with coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jioras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4565116\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/24/1619/#p1628\">\n    24 Cal.

Having reviewed Harper's evidence, including the communications from National Union's claims adjuster, it is not reasonable as a matter of law to believe that National Union had shifted from investigating Harper's claim under a reservation of rights to \"providing coverage\" before the insurer ultimately denied\n   the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20840\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Harper fails to raise a triable estoppel claim that would prevent National Union from asserting its coverage defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Future Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Harper also requests that the Court defer a decision on National Union's motion to allow Harper to obtain information from pending document requests and future discovery regarding National Union's claim file. (Opp'n 31:21-32:7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kim Decl. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 17-2.) Harper's counsel further declares: \"Harper anticipates that in addition to the National Union claim file, future discovery regarding the underwriting of the Policy and any setting of reserves will be relevant to issues in this motion including, in part, Harper's reasonable expectations of coverage and the parties' course of performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Harper's Opposition does not invoke Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), but the Court construes Harper's request as arising under this provision. Rule 56(d) provides that if a party opposing summary judgment demonstrates it \"cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\" Fed.

Although Harper generally identifies the needed discovery as the insurer's claim file and \"future discovery regarding the underwriting of the Policy and any setting of reserves,\" Harper does not convincingly explain why these items \"would preclude summary judgment\" on the claims at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518955\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/823/#p833\">\n    906 F.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The interpretation of the Policy is question of law, and the Policy's text does not provide that National Union has a duty to indemnify or defend Harper in these circumstances. Therefore, the Court is unpersuaded that its interpretation of the Policy would be affected by any information regarding National Union's setting of reserves or its claim file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prudential Sec., Inc. v.

In addition, although Harper mentions a need for \"future discovery regarding the underwriting of the Policy,\" Harper's affidavit does not identify with specificity the facts that such discovery would reveal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kim Decl. \u00b6 8).

In particular, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of National Union on Harper's claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Further, to the extent that Harper's declaratory relief claim\n   is predicated on National Union's duties to defend or indemnify Harper under the Policy, the Court also grants summary judgment on this claim in favor of National Union. The Clerk shall not enter judgment because Harper still has several claims pending against National Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Where appropriate, the Court collectively refers to Plaintiffs Harper Construction and Harper Mechanical as simply \"Harper.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The Court cites to the Policy's paragraph and section numbers when available.

(ECF No. 19-1.) Having reviewed these objections, they do not impact the Court's ruling on National Union's motion. For example, even assuming that the Government made additional threats to Harper regarding the Project, these threats are not a \"suit\" under the Policy that trigger National Union's duty to defend. Hence, the Court denies as moot National Union's evidentiary objections seeking to exclude this evidence and other items.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Harper claims in its Opposition that it incurred \"substantial costs to meet the U.S. Government's demands\" with National Union's \"knowledge and consent.\" (Opp'n 7:6-7.) Yet Harper does not provide a citation to the record for its claim that National Union consented to its expenditures, and the Court rejects Harper's unsupported claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1) (requiring a party asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed to support it by \"citing to particular parts of materials in the record\"). The Court notes that Harper's brief does not otherwise mention the term \"consent.\" In any event, when Harper submitted a claim to National Union, Harper had already been engaged in a conciliation effort with the Government for several years. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JSUF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, 21.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The strikethrough portion of this quotation is the original text of the Policy, which is deleted by the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement. The underlined portion is the amendment added by the endorsement in place of the original text. Like the parties, the Court combines these two items to illustrate how the Insuring Agreement reads after the endorsement is inserted into the Policy. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. 12:25-13:18; Opp'n 18:13-28.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Harper also relies on another excerpt of the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement to support its interpretation. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp'n 17:13-18:2.) This subsequent portion of the endorsement provides: \"[National Union] will pay, as part of the limit of insurance, as described in Section C. - Limits of Insurance Revision (below),\n    <em>\n     with respect to any claim or 'suit' the following defense costs\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Policy at 51 (emphasis added).) When read in context, this excerpt similarly does not broaden National Union's duty to defend to include pre-suit claims. The excerpt is part of a provision addressing what defense costs National Union will pay when the insurer is providing a defense-not when the duty to defend arises. Indeed, like the other fragment of the endorsement Harper relies on, this second excerpt does not amend the portion of the Insuring Agreement that addresses the insurer's duty to defend \"suits\" and its discretion to investigate and settle claims. Further, yet another prior portion of the endorsement provides National Union will pay the costs addressed in this second excerpt when it is \"control[ing] the defense of a claim or 'suit.' \" (Policy at 50.) Thus, for many of the same reasons discussed previously, this segment of the Defense Costs Limits Endorsement also does not make Harper's interpretation of the Policy reasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The Court notes that the California Court of Appeal suggested in a footnote that an \"insurance company might be liable if it unreasonably delayed in performing an investigation of a claim before concluding there was no coverage and the insured suffered consequential loss as a result of the delay.\"\n    <em>\n     Murray v.
