The manufacturer, which was incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York, argued that the Superior Court lacked specific jurisdiction as to the claims of nonresident plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Superior Court concluded that it had such specific jurisdiction, and the California Court of Appeal and California Supreme Court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n    at 1778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In affirming the lower court's decision, the California Supreme Court applied a \"sliding scale approach\" to specific jurisdiction, in which \"the more wide ranging the defendant's forum contacts, the more readily is shown a connection between the forum and the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the United States Supreme Court rejected this approach and concluded that the Superior Court lacked specific jurisdiction over the nonresident claims. The Court found no \"adequate link\" between California and the nonresidents' claims when \"the nonresidents were not prescribed Plavix in California, did not purchase Plavix in California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n    at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The mere fact that other plaintiffs \"were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California-and allegedly sustained the same injuries as did the nonresidents\"-did not allow California to \"assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   applies to mass tort actions, not class actions. The Court agrees. Although the Ninth Circuit has not addressed this question, the weight of authority examining this issue has concluded that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   does not apply to class actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cabrera v.

Cal. Mar. 6, 2019) (collecting cases). In reaching this conclusion, courts have relied on two key distinctions between a class action and a mass tort action. First, a plaintiff in a mass tort action is named as a plaintiff, making each \"a real party in interest.\" In contrast, only the proposed class representative is actually named on the complaint in a class action. Accordingly, while the claims of nonresident plaintiffs were pertinent to the issue of specific jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , the claims of unnamed class members are not implicated in the question of specific jurisdiction in a class action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

Second, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 imposes additional due process safeguards on class actions that do not exist in the mass tort context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (requiring that there are common questions of law or fact, that the class representative's claims are typical to the class's claims, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy). Mass tort actions, like the one in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , do not-and generally cannot-meet the requirements of Rule 23, because there are typically significant variations in the plaintiffs' claims. At its core, \"[p]ersonal jurisdiction is rooted in fairness to the defendant, and Rule 23 provides significant safeguards to that end.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v. ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206460451\">\n    2018 WL 6460451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (N.D.

In\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , Justice Sotomayor's dissent explicitly noted that \"[t]he Court ... does not confront the question whether its opinion here would also apply to a class action in which a plaintiff injured in the forum State seeks to represent a nationwide class of plaintiffs not all of whom were injured there.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1781\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1789 n.4 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \"The class-action device was designed as 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only,' \" enabling both courts and parties to save resources by permitting an issue potentially affecting every class member to be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    Gen.
