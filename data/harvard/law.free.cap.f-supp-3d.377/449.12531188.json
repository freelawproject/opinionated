Relevant to the instant action, the 2014 Consent Decree included a modification provision which stated that, if any of the parties believed \"that modification of this Consent Decree would be in the public interest, ...

The 2014 Consent Decree also stated that the Commonwealth Court would retain jurisdiction over the matter for the duration of the decree's existence \"to enable any party to apply to [the Commonwealth Court] for such further orders and directions as may be necessary and appropriate for the interpretation, modification, and enforcement of this Consent Decree.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280114,6766917\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/441/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis removed).

Shapiro (\"Defendant\" or \"General Shapiro\") invited representatives from UPMC to his office in Harrisburg. At the meeting, General Shapiro \"asserted that he has 'vast authority' over all Pennsylvania nonprofit entities\" and that he intended to implement various changes to how Pennsylvania nonprofit health insurers and healthcare providers like UPMC operate. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 27). On December 14, 2018, Executive Deputy Attorney General James Donahue III sent UPMC an outline of the changes General Shapiro envisioned, framed as proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree. (Doc. 1-3). The document was titled\n   <em>\n    Modified Consent Decree\n   </em>\n   and bore the same caption as the 2014 Consent Decree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In a cover letter accompanying that document,\n   Executive Deputy General Donahue stated that, \"[i]f we reach agreement with you on a modified consent decree, we will announce that the consent decree embodies the principles we expect to apply to all nonprofit charitable health systems.\" (Doc. 3-3). This was concerning to UPMC because, at the November meeting, General Shapiro informed UPMC that \"[n]on-compliance [with his proposed changes] would constitute a violation of Pennsylvania nonprofit laws.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 27). Furthermore, because UPMC is obligated to submit its insurance-policy offerings to various regulatory agencies for approval well before those policies become active, General Shapiro's remarks injected a fear that UPMC would be obligated to adjust its policies to comply with General Shapiro's intended changes, even if UPMC's policies had already been approved by federal regulators-and implemented for consumers-and even if the Commonwealth Court refused to accept General Shapiro's proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree. (Doc. 51 at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 20, 2018, UPMC sent Executive Deputy General Donahue a series of questions concerning General Shapiro's proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree. UPMC noted, \"[w]e have been working diligently to determine UPMC's position on the proposal set forth in your letter of December 14 and want to provide you with several questions that we have about that proposal.\" (Doc. 3-5 at 1). Throughout their questions, UPMC consistently referenced the \"proposed Modified Consent Decree\" and the \"principles\" contained therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Relevant to the instant motion, among other questions, UPMC asked, \"[d]oes [General Shapiro] contend that [his] authority over nonprofit charitable health systems supersedes the non-interference provisions of the Social Security Act\" and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's \"preemption clause[?]\" (Doc. 3-5 at 3). In a letter dated January 2, 2019, Executive Deputy General Donahue responded \"yes\" to both questions. (Doc. 3-6 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 18, 2019, UPMC sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Keli Neary requesting that General Shapiro stipulate that he \"does not have authority under Pennsylvania law or independent of the modification provision [outlined in the 2014 Consent Decree] to impose the terms set forth in ... the Proposed Modified Consent Decree\" and that certain provisions in \"the Proposed Modified Consent Decree ... are not legally enforceable.\" (Doc. 51-2 at 1). General Shapiro did not respond to UPMC's request. Relatedly, in connection with the instant motion to dismiss, UPMC sought early discovery and submitted several requests for admissions and interrogatories for General Shapiro to complete related to General Shapiro's authority to implement the changes he envisioned without the Commonwealth Court's approval. Although General Shapiro timely responded to UPMC's requests and interrogatories, UPMC moved to compel additional responses, contending that General Shapiro's responses were \"inadequate\" and that General Shapiro's invocation of various privileges was \"meritless.\" (Doc. 55 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 7, 2019, General Shapiro filed a petition in the Commonwealth Court to modify the 2014 Consent Decree. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 33). General Shapiro's petition also included a request to extend the 2014 Consent Decree indefinitely.\n   <em>\n    UPMC\n   </em>\n   , No. 334 MD 2014, slip op. at 34-35. On February 21, 2019, UPMC filed an answer to General Shapiro's petition in the nature of a motion to dismiss. The matter was fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While UPMC's motion to dismiss General Shapiro's petition was pending in the Commonwealth Court, on February 21, 2019, UPMC filed a complaint in this Court seeking a declaration that General\n   Shapiro's proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree are preempted by the Medicare Act, the Affordable Care Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Sherman Act. UPMC also lodged various constitutional challenges, contending that General Shapiro's intended modifications amount to a regulatory taking and violate the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, equal protection, as well as substantive and procedural due process. (Doc. 1). On the same day, UPMC filed a preliminary injunction seeking several declaratory judgments and seeking to enjoin General Shapiro's efforts. (Doc. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 1, 2019, General Shapiro filed a motion to dismiss UPMC's federal complaint, (Doc. 36), and a brief in support thereof on March 15, 2019. (Doc. 42). UPMC filed a brief in opposition on March 25, 2019, (Doc. 51), and General Shapiro filed a Reply on March 29, 2019. (Doc. 56). On April 2, 2019, UPMC requested, and was granted, leave to file a Sur-Reply. (Docs. 57, 58).\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   Highmark Health filed a brief in support of General Shapiro's motion to dismiss. (Doc. 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 1, 2019, Dr. Robert B. Sklaroff, MD, filed a motion for permission to intervene. (Doc. 35). On March 25, 2019, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (\"HAP\") filed a motion to intervene. (Doc. 49). On March 8 and March 27, 2019 respectively, the Court suspended briefing as to both motions to intervene until disposition of Defendant's motion to dismiss. (Docs. 39, 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 3, 2019, the Commonwealth Court sustained in part and overruled in part UPMC's objections to General Shapiro's petition to modify the 2014 Consent Decree. In short, the Commonwealth Court sustained UPMC's objections as to Count 1 of General Shapiro's petition to the extent that Count 1 sought an indefinite extension of the 2014 Consent Decree. The Commonwealth Court deferred ruling upon UPMC's other bases to dismiss General Shapiro's petition and, \"decline[d] to state with certainty that, at this stage of the proceeding, all the requested modifications are impermissible.\"\n   <em>\n    UPMC\n   </em>\n   , No. 334 MD 2014, slip op. at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 16, 2019, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted General Shapiro permission to appeal the Commonwealth Court's order concerning Count 1.

April 17, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   General Shapiro's motion to dismiss UPMC's complaint before this Court has been fully briefed and is ripe for disposition. For the reasons that follow, General Shapiro's motion to dismiss shall be granted and UPMC's complaint shall be dismissed without prejudice. Because we shall dismiss UPMC's complaint, UPMC's motion for preliminary injunction, (Doc. 3), Dr. Sklaroff's motion for permission to intervene, (Doc. 35), HAP's motion to intervene, (Doc. 49), and UPMC's motion to compel discovery, (Doc. 55), shall be dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his motion, General Shapiro first argues that UPMC's complaint must be dismissed because it is not ripe. According to General Shapiro, \"[a] claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\" (Doc. 42 at 9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503533\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/296/#p300\">\n    523 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503533\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/296/#p300\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503533\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/296/#p300\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ) ). In this case, General Shapiro posits, UPMC's claims are predicated upon the Commonwealth Court accepting his proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree. \"Because the Commonwealth Court has not yet ruled on the [merits of the] Petition to Modify and neither party has exhausted its remedies in state court, UPMC's claims simply are 'not ripe for adjudication' [because t]hey 'res[t] upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.' \" (Doc. 42 at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503533\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/296/#p300\">\n    523 U.S. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503533\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/296/#p300\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (some alterations in original) ). \"The Attorney General has not created new principles or requirements. He has simply asked the Commonwealth Court to grant a petition, something that the court may, or may not, do.\" (Doc. 42 at 10). Until the Commonwealth Court acts, General Shapiro reasons, \"he is tasked with\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   of existing laws, not with making new ones.\" (Doc. 56 at 3) (italics in original). Thus, General Shapiro represents, UPMC faces no threat of enforcement (and therefore no ripe controversy) until the Commonwealth Court accepts his proposed\n   modifications or his intended changes are supported by the force of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Likewise, General Shapiro argues, even if the Commonwealth Court agrees to modify the 2014 Consent Decree to include his recommended changes, \"no controversy could actually exist unless and until [he] would\n   <em>\n    seek to enforce\n   </em>\n   the terms of any Modified Consent Decree against UPMC.\" (Doc. 42 at 10 (italics in original) ). In fact, General Shapiro points out, \"UPMC candidly acknowledges that it is too early to know how any such hypothetical enforcement will play out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (citing Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40 (\"General Shapiro has not yet identified to Plaintiffs what specific actions he intends to take to ensure that his new rules apply to all nonprofits;\" \"General Shapiro has not yet identified to Plaintiffs what specific actions he intends to take to force Plaintiffs to open their doors to insurers and providers who do not agree to be bound by his arbitration procedures.\") ) ). Accordingly, General Shapiro concludes, \"UPMC fails to present a ripe controversy for adjudication and the Complaint should be dismissed.\" (Doc. 42 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, UPMC contends that their claims are ripe for review under the Third Circuit's three-part test for ripeness in the declaratory judgment context. According to UPMC, under the test outlined by our Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    NE Hub Partners\n   </em>\n   , this Court must consider only: \"(1) the adversity of the parties' interests, (2) the probable conclusiveness of the judgment, and (3) the practical utility of the judgment to the parties.\" (Doc. 51 at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    NE Hub Partners, L.P. v.

UPMC avers that its claims meet all three benchmarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, UPMC reasons, it is \"unquestionable\" that General Shapiro's interests are adverse to UPMC's. (Doc. 51 at 12). This is so, UPMC avers, even if it has not yet \"suffered a completed harm ... so long as there is a substantial threat of real harm that remains throughout the course of the litigation.\" (Doc. 51 at 12-13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Surrick v. Killion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5411915\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/520/#p527\">\n    449 F.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (3d Cir. 2006) ) ). In this case, UPMC asserts, it faces \"imminent government filing deadlines ... that will lock in premium rates for the coming year. If General Shapiro's new requirements take effect, it will force unanticipated changes to [UPMC's] provider networks and negate all of the work done to accurately set premiums so as to cover costs.\" (Doc. 51 at 6-7). Accordingly, UPMC reasons, \"there is a substantial threat of real harm that remains throughout the course of the litigation\" and federal \"[c]ourts have thus repeatedly rejected ripeness challenges under circumstances identical to those alleged here\" where a complaining party asserts that a state or local governing body intends to enforce an otherwise-federally preempted provision.

In this case, UPMC reiterates, \"General Shapiro has announced legal principles for nonprofit healthcare providers that conflict with Plaintiffs' rights under federal law,\" \"[h]e has further made clear that Plaintiffs' status as nonprofits and/or subsidiaries of a nonprofit places them in violation of state law unless they conform to these new requirements,\" (Doc. 51 at 13-14), and \"[t]he Attorney General has contended in correspondence and communications with UPMC, as well as in its claims in the Commonwealth Court, that [UPMC's 2020 insurance] plans will violate state law if they do not include certain providers.\" (Doc. 61). Thus, UPMC deduces, its interests\n   are adverse to those of General Shapiro, and its claims are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   UPMC identifies several of General Shapiro's statements in support of its view that General Shapiro intends to enforce the terms of the proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree even if the Commonwealth Court refuses to so modify the 2014 Consent Decree. First, UPMC points to General Shapiro's statements at the November 2018 meeting asserting that he has \" 'vast authority' over all Pennsylvania nonprofit entities,\" that he intends to implement various changes to how nonprofit health insurance providers like UPMC operate, that \"he was preparing a formal list of terms by which all nonprofits must abide,\" and that \"[n]on-compliance would constitute a violation of Pennsylvania nonprofit laws.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31, 32). Second, UPMC cites General Shapiro's affirmative indication that his \"authority over nonprofit charitable health systems supersedes the non-interference provisions of the Social Security Act\" and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's \"preemption clause.\" (Docs. 3-5, 3-6). Third, UPMC cites Executive Deputy General Donahue's cover letter that accompanied the mailed copy of General Shapiro's proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree which stated that \"[i]f we reach agreement with you on a modified consent decree, we will announce that the consent decree embodies the principles\n   <em>\n    we expect to apply to all nonprofit charitable health systems.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 3-3 (emphasis added) ). Fourth, UPMC cites General Shapiro's failure to respond to its requested stipulation and failure to fully answer the interrogatories and requests for admission concerning General Shapiro's authority to implement his changes absent approval by the Commonwealth Court. Thus, UPMC concludes, General Shapiro's statements and attitude suggest that he intends to act even without the Commonwealth Court's approval and, thereby, he has \"present[ed] a substantial threat of sanction\" which renders General Shapiro's interests adverse to UPMC's and \"makes Plaintiffs' claims for relief ripe.\" (Doc. 51 at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   UPMC also posits that its claims meet the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    NE Hub Partners\n   </em>\n   test because \"a decision in this case would provide conclusive guidance concerning Plaintiffs' rights and obligations under federal law,\" and because \"[t]his factor is almost always satisfied in preemption cases....\" (Doc. 51 at 14). Likewise, UPMC argues, its claims satisfy the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    NE Hub Partners\n   </em>\n   test because \"a decision in this case would have practical utility for the parties,\" inasmuch as \"[j]udgment for Plaintiffs in this case will provide certainty that federal law preempts contrary state regulation.\" (Doc. 51 at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, UPMC avers, \"General Shapiro's evasiveness as to his own intent is an obvious ploy to avoid federal scrutiny.\" (Doc. 51 at 15-16). According to UMPC, \"[i]t makes no sense to withhold this Court's review on the mere possibility that the Attorney General might-or might not-follow ... constraints voluntarily.\" (Doc. 52 at 16). In their Sur-Reply, UPMC also argues that, because there exists a question of fact as to whether General Shapiro intends to impose new obligations upon UPMC absent the binding force of the proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree, and because General Shapiro is otherwise \"refusing to respond to all discovery intended to illuminate that factual dispute,\" dismissal is not warranted at this stage.

We address each of UPMC's assertions in this vein\n   <em>\n    seriatim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, UPMC's reliance upon General Shapiro's statements that he has \" 'vast authority' over all Pennsylvania nonprofit entities,\" that he intends to implement various changes to how all nonprofit health insurance providers like UPMC operate, that \"he was preparing a formal list of terms by which all nonprofits must abide,\" and that \"[n]on-compliance would constitute a violation of Pennsylvania nonprofit laws\" is misguided. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31, 32). Each of these statements was made in the context of General Shapiro's proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree. The same goes for General Shapiro's affirmative indication that his \"authority over nonprofit charitable health systems supersedes the non-interference provisions of the Social Security Act\" and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's \"preemption clause.\" (Docs. 3-5, 3-6). That is, General Shapiro only contended as much within the context of the proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree. UPMC acknowledges in its letter wherein these questions were presented to General Shapiro, that \"General Shapiro delivered this list of new requirements on December\n   14, 2018,\n   <em>\n    in the form of a proposed Consent Decree.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 28 (emphasis added) ). Clearly, the proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree formed the basis of UPMC's interactions with General Shapiro and, thus, UPMC surely must recognize that the modified Consent Decree-if accepted by the Commonwealth Court-would serve as General Shapiro's basis to enforce the principles outlined therein. Indeed, had General Shapiro believed that he was authorized to act pursuant to Pennsylvania's non-profit laws and did not believe that modifying the 2014 Consent Decree was necessary, we see no reason why he would have petitioned the Commonwealth Court to modify it. It is for this reason that General Shapiro's cover letter accompanying the mailed copy of his proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree stated that, \"\n   <em>\n    [i]f we reach agreement with you on a modified consent decree\n   </em>\n   , we will announce that the consent decree embodies the principles\n   <em>\n    we expect to apply\n   </em>\n   to all nonprofit charitable health systems.\" (Doc. 3-3 (emphasis added) ). Clearly, it is not until the Commonwealth Court rules in his favor that General Shapiro \"expect[s] to apply\" these principles to UPMC, and it is not until that point that General Shapiro could \"expect to apply\" these principles \"to all nonprofit charitable health systems\" who may or may not be subject to the 2014 Consent Decree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is of no moment that the 2014 Consent Decree includes only UPMC and Highmark and does not bind \"all nonprofit charitable health systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To be clear, whether General Shapiro \"expect[s] to apply\" these principles \"to all nonprofit charitable health systems\" does not mean that these principles\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   apply \"to all nonprofit charitable health systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). General Shapiro's stated expectations cannot support the inference that he is \"about to commence proceedings,\" and, thus, cannot support the inference that UPMC's and General Shapiro's interests are sufficiently adverse such that UPMC's claims are ripe for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/\">\n    504 U.S. at 382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by UPMC's contention that General Shapiro's failure to respond to its requested stipulation and answer its interrogatories and requests for admission to its own satisfaction support the inference that General Shapiro believes that he is authorized to act upon his stated intentions without the Commonwealth Court's approval and that he is about to \"commence proceedings\" to enforce his changes. Although, at this juncture, we are obliged to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of UPMC as the nonmoving party,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645156\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/224/#p231\">\n    515 F.3d at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[e]ven on a motion to dismiss, we are not required to credit mere speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Zavala v.

To hypothesize that General Shapiro's failure to respond amounts to a flat-out refusal (and, therefore, to assume\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   that General Shapiro believes that he is authorized to act in conformity with the proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree even absent Commonwealth Court approval) is wholly speculative, implausible, and too attenuated to be credited at this juncture. Indeed, drawing such an inference flies in the face of the fact finding and litigation processes wherein there may be countless reasons for not responding to a requested stipulation, both legal and personal. For the same reason, we are not persuaded by UPMC's argument that we must find adversity and ripeness simply because UPMC believes that General Shapiro's responses to its discovery requests were \"inadequate\" and that his invocation of various privileges was \"meritless.\" (Doc. 55 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , General Shapiro has not \"made clear that [he] would seek to enforce the challenged\" provisions of the proposed modifications to the\n   2014 Consent Decree absent approval by the Commonwealth Court.

AEI Life, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340529\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/99/#p111\">\n    800 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (3d Cir. 2015) ) ). As we have already noted, whether General Shapiro\n   <em>\n    intends\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    hopes to\n   </em>\n   impose new obligations upon UPMC and other non-profit healthcare providers does not answer the question of whether he actually\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   imposed those obligations or whether he is authorized to\n   do so. Until the Commonwealth Court agrees to General Shapiro's proposed modifications to the 2014 Consent Decree or until General Shapiro actually acts, General Shapiro's proposed changes constitute no more than his stated intentions. General Shapiro's stated intentions are not binding law. Were we to find as much, this Court's docket would be overwhelmed with ripe controversies anytime a politician opened his or her mouth. Thus, UPMC's claims are, by definition, contingent and unripe.
