The plaintiffs, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Liberty Insurance Corporation, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and LM Insurance Corporation (collectively herein \"Liberty\" or the \"Liberty entities\"), contend that there is diversity of citizenship between the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000.00 excluding interest and costs, satisfying the requirement that independent subject matter jurisdiction exist for this court to \"declare the rights and other legal relations\" of the parties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Brotherhood Mut.

Bobzien (\"Michael\" or the \"son\" herein), do not challenge the assertion of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Liberty entities are each alleged to be organized under the laws of states other than Kentucky and to have principal places of business outside the Commonwealth. Complaint, DN 1, pp. 2, PageID #2. They are all licensed to do business in Kentucky. Hugo's Estate is capable of being sued by and through its Administratrix, Theresa B. Hart, who is a citizen of Kentucky. Michael is a citizen of the state of Florida and the plaintiff in the underlying lawsuit brought in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The court thus finds that there is complete diversity between the parties. The allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000.00 is unchallenged and will therefore be accepted for purposes of finding that this court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter. We note that the allegations in the underlying state court complaint claim Michael suffered numerous and significant bodily injuries which could yield a damage award in excess of $ 75,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon a finding of subject matter jurisdiction, the court must determine, in its discretion, whether the case is an appropriate one for declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The principal considerations in making this determination are (1) whether the judgment would settle the controversy; (2) whether the declaratory action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations in issue; (3) whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for purposes of \"procedural fencing\" or \"to provide an arena for a race for\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   \"; (4) whether the use of a declaratory action would increase friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach upon state jurisdiction; and (5) whether there is an alternative remedy that is better or more effective.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Michael resided in his father's household under his father's care, control and dominion, from birth until he reached the age of majority in approximately 1976. In the FAC, Michael recites the following events:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   From the date of his birth until he reached the age of majority, [Michael] was repeatedly, forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically, recklessly, grossly negligently and/or negligently exposed and subjected to [his father's] hazardous cigarette smoke while he necessarily lived at his childhood residence under the exclusive control and dominion of [his father], primarily in this county.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As a direct, natural and foreseeable result of [Hugo's] decisions to repeatedly, forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically, recklessly, grossly negligently and/or negligently expose and subject [Michael] to his hazardous cigarette smoke, and as a substantial factor and proximate cause of such decisions, [Michael] has recently, and within one year from commencement of this action, been caused to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteopenia (with 2 chronic compression fractures of his L2 and T2 vertebrae, osteoarthritis in hips and knees, chronic back pain and/or degenerative disc disease, cataracts, past and future medical costs, past and future pain and suffering, past and future loss of enjoyment of life, permanent impairment of the power to labor and earn money, loss of future life expectancy, past and future inconvenience and other serious injuries and harms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The conduct of [Hugo] as herein alleged was committed intentionally, knowingly, wantonly, recklessly and/or with gross negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hugo died on March 30, 2016. After his father's death, Michael filed claims for bodily injury in the probate action, but his claims were disallowed. He then filed a state court action [Civ. Action No. 17-CI-002751] containing the above factual allegations and presenting three claims for\n   relief: negligence, negligence per se, and premises liability. Each claim articulates a duty owed by the father to the son: a common law duty owed by Hugo to exercise ordinary care for the protection of his son (negligence); a statutory duty owed by Hugo to exercise ordinary care for the protection of his son (negligence per se); and a duty owed by Hugo to exercise ordinary care to make his property reasonably safe for invitees, including his then minor son (premises liability). The claims are identically written, with the exception of the particular duty to which the claim refers. Representative of the claims,\n   <strong>\n    Count 1 - Negligence\n   </strong>\n   alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   At all times relevant, [Hugo] had a common law duty to exercise ordinary care for the protection of his son, [Michael], which included the duty to refrain from repeatedly, forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically, recklessly, grossly negligently and/or negligently exposing and subjecting his minor son, the Plaintiff, to unsafe, dangerous, neglectful, abusive and/or harmful conditions, including his hazardous cigarette smoke.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   At all times relevant, [Hugo] breached the foregoing common law duty by repeatedly, forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically, recklessly, grossly negligently and/or negligently exposing and subjecting his son to his hazardous cigarette smoke.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As a direct, natural, foreseeable, factual and proximate cause of [Hugo's] breaches of the foregoing common law duty, [Michael] has been seriously injured and harmed as herein previously alleged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The conduct of [Hugo] as herein alleged was undertaken intentionally, knowingly, wantonly, recklessly and/or with gross negligence, thereby entitling [Michael] to an award of punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DN 23-2. Michael's illnesses and conditions allegedly resulted from his childhood exposure to secondhand smoke. The FAC frames the claims to allege breaches of duty as a result of Hugo's\n   <em>\n    decisions\n   </em>\n   to expose his son to that hazardous condition. Hugo's Estate has answered and denied these claims. The state action is ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hugo's Estate provided notice of the suit to the Liberty entities. They are defending the state court action under a reservation of rights while seeking a declaration from this court that they have no obligation to indemnify or further defend Hugo's Estate under any of the policies issued to Hugo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exercise of Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n   -\n   <strong>\n    Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties assert that adjudicating the coverage issues \"by comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint with the terms of the insurance policy\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   will not require any fact-finding. The question as to the obligations, if any, of the insurer to the insured are generally matters of law, and thus may be decided by this court.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Ins. Co. v.

So, too, would a finding in favor of Hugo's Estate\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the grounds articulated by\n   the Liberty entities do not constitute an impediment to the Estate's demand for a defense and indemnification. In the event the court were to conclude that one or more of Michael's claims \"potentially, possibly or might come within the coverage of the policy,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Liberty entities' duty to defend would be clear with respect to all of Michael's claims in the state court suit.\n   <em>\n    James Graham Brown Found.\n   </em>\n   , 814 S.W.2d at 279-80 ;\n   <em>\n    Martin County Coal Corp. v.

Of course, this court cannot find that indemnity is owed to Hugo's Estate. If the policy terms are not preclusive, any obligation to indemnify would flow from the state court action. The parties recognize this and seek only a determination whether any of the policy terms preclude indemnity and relieve the Liberty entities of the duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Therefore, this action serves a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations between insurer and insured. A declaratory judgment in this regard would not encroach upon the state court's functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There is no question of \"procedural fencing here\" or a \"race for\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   \" The Liberty entities simply wish to know whether they must remain engaged. The fleche\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   has occurred in the state court action. The matter before this court is no feint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but rather a parry\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   from which the Liberty entities can discern their obligations to their insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There are no novel questions of state law raised in this declaratory action. There is sufficient Kentucky case law from which we can readily discern the principles upon which our analysis must be based, as well as the policy considerations undergirding those state court decisions. Further, the issues of coverage are not dependent upon any resolution of facts in the state court. Thus, we conclude that state court would be no better equipped than this court to decide the questions before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court also concludes that there is no alternative to this declaratory action which is superior to the declaratory judgment process. The Liberty entities could file a declaratory action in the state court, either separately or by intervention in the state case, or wait and file an indemnity action after the liability question has been determined in the state court action. Neither option offers any advantage over the declaratory relief sought presently in this forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins. Co. v.

Overview of Coverage Arguments on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Liberty seeks a declaration that the policy precludes coverage for all of Michael's claims and, concomitantly, Liberty has no duty to defend Hugo's Estate in the state court action. Liberty asserts three grounds for the relief it seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   First, Liberty notes that Michael alleges in the FAC that he was repeatedly exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke while he was a resident of his father's household many years prior to issuance of any of the policies in question. It contends that Michael claims he was harmed during his childhood by the repeated exposure to secondhand smoke, despite the fact that he received diagnoses of various illnesses which developed after he reached adulthood and was no longer living in the family home. Thus, Liberty contends that the \"occurrence\" Michael alleges resulted in his \"bodily injury\" occurred before the effective dates of the policies. Liberty contends that scientific evidence supports a finding that harm occurs immediately upon exposure to secondhand smoke. It contends, therefore, that \"bodily injury,\" defined as \"harm, sickness or disease,\" occurred outside the policy periods, regardless of later developments of illness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Hugo's Estate counters that Liberty conflates exposure with injury in order to conclude that the FAC alleges \"bodily injury\" which occurred outside the policy period. The Estate argues that the focus must be on Michael's \"bodily injury\" in 2016, not the exposure when he was a child. It notes that an \"occurrence\" under the policies is an \"accident\" which results in \"bodily injury\" during the policy period. It contends that an \"accident\" is an unintended and unexpected result, and that the development of Michael's illnesses and conditions was unexpected and unintended by Hugo, and thus Michael's later development of illnesses and conditions was an \"accident.\" The Estate contends that, despite the repeated exposure to a harmful condition decades before any policy period, there is potential for coverage because he does not allege he suffered any \"bodily injury\" from the exposure until 2016 and thus his \"bodily injury\" occurred during the policy period, as required as a condition for potential coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Liberty rejoins that \"bodily injury\" under the policies must result from an \"occurrence.\" In this instance, the only event alleged in the FAC was Hugo's act of repeatedly exposing Michael to secondhand smoke when Michael was a minor living in his father's household. The Estate contends that no event is alleged to have occurred after the exposure to secondhand smoke. Therefore, the exposure is the only possible \"occurrence\" alleged in the FAC causing Michael's \"bodily injury.\" The fact that Hugo's Estate contends that Hugo never intended for his son to become ill does not alter the fact that Hugo's smoking was an intentional act, not a fortuitous event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Further, Liberty notes that an \"insured\" under the policies includes a relative residing in the \"insured\"'s (Hugo's) household. It argues that Michael would have been excluded from coverage for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"bodily injury,\" had any one of the policies been in effect at the time of the repeated exposure to this harmful condition, and therefore a finding of possible coverage would essentially afford \"claims made\" coverage under these \"occurrence-based\" policies in contravention of the intent of the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The parties disagree on the appropriate authority for determining whether an \"accident\" has been alleged, under the definition of \"occurrence.\" Liberty contends that the FAC does not allege \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence,\" as required for coverage under the policies, because the complaint does not allege that Hugo's exposure of his son to secondhand smoke was a fortuitous event, as defined by Kentucky's most recent case addressing what constitutes an \"accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Hugo's Estate counters that, under Kentucky law, the term \"occurrence\" is to be construed broadly and liberally in favor of extending coverage to the insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argues that the injury, not the negligent act, is the \"accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It contends that it was never part of Hugo's plan, design or intent to cause injury to any of his children by exposing them to secondhand smoke, and\n   that he could not have so planned or intended because such harm was not yet known to medical science. It argues that if the resulting damages were unintended, they were accidental, even though the original acts were intentional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, Liberty argues that the FAC alleges \"bodily injury\" arising from \"physical abuse,\" a term with a common dictionary definition of \"physical maltreatment,\" conduct which is excluded from coverage under the policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Estate urges that Michael does not allege cruelty in his father's smoking habits, and thus his father's smoking around his children does not meet the common and ordinary understanding of \"abuse.\" Further, he contends that the term \"physical abuse\" connotes an illegal activity in common thought. It contends that even if it was reasonable to construe the term \"physical abuse\" as physical maltreatment also, two reasonable interpretations exist, and therefore the court must construe the term in a manner favorable to the insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

[Michael] to...hazardous cigarette smoke, and as a substantial factor and proximate cause of\n   <em>\n    such decisions\n   </em>\n   ,...[Michael] has recently, and within one year from commencement of this action,\n   <em>\n    been caused to develop\n   </em>\n   [various illnesses].\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The FAC alleges that Michael's bodily injury resulted from Hugo's decisions, and\n   that Hugo's decisions were the proximate cause of Michael's bodily injury. Decisions to act and actions are not synonymous. An \"occurrence\" under the policies is a happening or event which constitutes an \"accident\" resulting in \"bodily injury.\" The \"accident\" and the \"bodily injury\" cannot be separated, as the causal element that one result in the other is an integral component of the definition. Decisions not acted upon are a nullity and thus allege no connection to \"bodily injury.\" Had Hugo made the decision to smoke in the presence of his son, but not gotten around to buying cigarettes, for example, there would be no act by Hugo having any connection to the development of Michael's illnesses and conditions, and coverage under the policy would not be implicated at all. While negligent decisions can, from a legal standpoint, be found to have proximately caused or have been a substantial factor in bringing about an act or event that results in bodily injury, the fact that the FAC articulates a legal theory alleging tort liability for Hugo's decisions does not answer the question whether the FAC alleges a covered \"occurrence.\" It is not the allegation of a theory of tort liability or the potential success or failure of such a claim which is relevant. To conclude there is potential coverage, there must be an allegation of an \"occurrence\" during the policy period alleged in the FAC. The facts alleged must articulate a happening or event constituting an \"accident,\" something which can result in \"bodily injury.\" We agree with Liberty that if the FAC is not read as marrying the exposure to the bodily injury, it lacks any connection to Hugo's decision to smoke, and thus does not meet the definition of \"occurrence\" under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Liberty argues that a finding that the \"occurrence\" alleged in the FAC was the exposure to secondhand smoke when Michael was a child is supported by scientific evidence that immediate harm occurs from such exposure. Hugo's Estate contends that the scientific evidence on the effects of secondhand smoke is contested and thus a fact not within the province of this court to decide. We agree. However, resolution of this fact is unnecessary to a determination of the coverage issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Under no plain reading of the FAC does Michael allege an \"occurrence\" under the policies. While he alleges an act of exposure (Hugo's exposure of Michael to secondhand smoke during Michael's childhood) and \"bodily injury\" (illnesses and conditions which developed in 2016), the FAC does not allege that the one caused the other. Thus the requisite allegation of an \"occurrence\" is absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Even under a reading of the FAC that accepts as implicit that Hugo's alleged negligent decision to smoke in the presence of his children resulted in his smoking,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is not the metaphysical decision to smoke\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , but rather the physical act of smoking to which the FAC alleges Michael was exposed. Even if negligence in deciding to smoke around the son is alleged to set the stage, so to speak, for his action in actually smoking, the repeated exposure to secondhand smoke during Michael's childhood is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   event alleged in the FAC, and thus the only event to result from Hugo's decisions from which the later-developed illnesses and conditions could possibly be alleged to flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Taken to its logical extreme, many decisions (the decisions to get married, have children, buy a house, or to address a\n   tobacco addiction, to name a few) could all be said to have in some way influenced the course of the family's life events. However, the personal liability coverage contained in Hugo's homeowners' policies is not insurance for Hugo's wise \"life choices\" except to the extent that any of those life choices are alleged to have proximately resulted in an \" 'accident' which resulted in 'bodily injury' \" occurring during the policy period to someone who may recover under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Estate notes that the FAC alleges that Michael suffered \"bodily injury\" in 2016 and not before. But the FAC must present some allegation by which Hugo's decision to smoke resulted in \"bodily injury\" to Michael, otherwise Hugo's personal liability coverage is not implicated. \"The primary purpose of a homeowner's policy is to provide package coverage for the insured in the insured's capacity as a homeowner. [citation omitted]. The general liability provisions of a homeowner's policy provide insurance against liability arising from the condition of the insured premises, and liability stemming from the insured's tortious personal conduct which may occur at any place on or off the insured premises. [citation omitted].\" 46 C.J.S. Insurance \u00a7 1354, XVI. Risks or Causes of Loss, G. Homeowner's Insurance, 1. In General (2019). The FAC embodies no such theory, even taking the allegations to the limit of reasonable interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Hugo's Estate argues, under a series of cases, that there was no \"occurrence\" until 2016 because there was no \"accident\" until Michael developed various illnesses and conditions in that year, and his tort claim for \"bodily injury\" then became ripe. Under basic tort principles, an injury must occur before a cause of action in tort accrues; that is, a compensable bodily injury must exist for which the injured party may seek compensation. However, as noted in\n   <em>\n    Forty-Eight Insulations\n   </em>\n   , \"There is a clear distinction between when bodily injury occurs and when the bodily injury which has occurred becomes compensable.\" 633 Fed.2d at 1223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Estate urges that the development of various illnesses and conditions alleged in the FAC constitutes the \"accident\" which resulted in illnesses and conditions constituting Michael's \"bodily injury.\" Thus, it contends that the FAC alleges a covered \"occurrence.\" For the following reasons, we conclude that the Estate's argument under the cases cited cannot be squared with the facts alleged in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   While the court is limited to the facts alleged in the FAC, it is not required to accept conclusions drawn from those facts in the parties' summary judgment arguments. Additionally, the court cannot add to or alter the facts alleged in the FAC. A reasonable reading of the FAC as a whole does not reveal an allegation on an \"occurrence\" which potentially, possibly or might come within the terms of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Estate relies on\n   <em>\n    Monticello Ins.

The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   ...[T]he time an accident \"occurs\" is the time when the complaining party is actually injured...The plaintiffs admit that they sustained no damages until October of 1987 when they turned on their furnace...Because the Transamerica policy only covers \"occurrences\" that occur within the policy period, and the plaintiffs did not sustain an injury within that period, Transamerica is not obligated either to defend or indemnify against the plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069991\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/736/201/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069991\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/736/201/\">\n    at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   With regard to\n   <em>\n    Stillwell\n   </em>\n   and its holding, the Estate suggests that \"the same rationale [for determining when an accident occurs] holds true, but the effect for the insurer and insured is the opposite.\" DN 24-1, p. 11, PageID # 310. This attempt at turning the\n   <em>\n    Stillwell\n   </em>\n   case on its head, and its comparison to \"negligent decision\" cases does not work, and here is why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Stillwell\n   </em>\n   , the re-roofing occurred when there was coverage for Brock Brothers' negligent roofing job, but no coverage for Brock Brothers at a later time when the furnace was turned on and resulted in\n   injury caused by furnace gases. Thus the alleged negligent re-roofing by Brock Brothers would have potentially been covered, but for the fact that the roofing job did not injure the Stillwells directly and immediately. Rather, the act of re-roofing set the stage for the furnace gas accident which directly injured them. The claim against the Brock Brothers was for the roofing job which covered the furnace exhaust vents, making the accident and resulting injury possible, but there was no Brock Bros. policy in force at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Monticello\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Asbury College\n   </em>\n   , the alleged negligent placement and negligent hiring, respectively, set the stage for a later sexual assault by the alleged perpetrator negligently placed or hired. The decision to place or hire which resulted in the hiring of alleged sexual predators did not directly cause injury. The alleged sexual assaults enabled by the placement/hiring resulted in \"bodily injury\" to the victims. There was potential coverage for the placement and the hiring which was unavailable when the event causing the \"bodily injury\" occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   By contrast, there was never potential coverage for the exposure to secondhand smoke during Michael's childhood as there was no policy in force during that time. The FAC seeks to create a covered \"occurrence\" which falls under the later-purchased policies. In the\n   <em>\n    Monticello, Asbury College\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Stillwell\n   </em>\n   cases, the intent of the parties to provide coverage for the events in question was clear, but the causes of action did not accrue until after the policies lapsed. Here, there was no coverage at the time of exposure and the policy clearly precludes coverage under these homeowners' policies for \"occurrences\" outside the policy period. The cases cited by the Estate thus do not support the proposed \"inverse theory\" of their application in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   We thus come full circle to our prior reasoning that the FAC does not allege an \"occurrence\" within the policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Monticello\n   </em>\n   , a negligent decision to place resulted in a placement which enabled the placed individual to commit the injury-producing sexual assault. In\n   <em>\n    Asbury College\n   </em>\n   , the decision to hire resulted in a hiring which enabled the employee to commit the injury-producing sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In Michael's case, the FAC alleges a negligent decision to repeatedly expose Michael to secondhand smoke. The decision to expose resulted in the exposure during his childhood when Hugo had no personal liability coverage. The FAC alleges that Michael was \"caused to develop\" various illnesses and conditions in 2016 when there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   personal liability coverage for \"occurrences\" during the policies' periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Hugo's Estate alleges that the covered \"accident\" identified in the FAC is Michael's development of illness and disease in 2016, and the illness and disease which thus developed is the \"bodily injury\" he suffered from the development, all occurring during the policy periods, and thus affording him potential coverage. The FAC alleges that Michael was \"caused to develop\" the listed illnesses and conditions. The Estate contends that the development constitutes an \"accident\" because it was unintended and unexpected from Hugo's standpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Estate's classification of the FAC's allegations of the \"development of disease\" and the \"disease thus developed\" as \"accident\" and \"resulting bodily injury,\" respectively, is problematic under the cases relied upon by the Estate. In each of those cases, there was an act by the insured which enabled a subsequent, separately identifiable accident to occur which resulted in bodily injury for which the injured party sought to hold the insured liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Monticello\n   </em>\n   , the negligent placement of the perpetrator set the stage for the sexual assault which caused the bodily injury for which compensation was sought from the insured. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Asbury College\n   </em>\n   , the negligent hiring of the perpetrator set the stage for the sexual assault which injured the victim. In\n   <em>\n    Stillwell\n   </em>\n   , the negligent re-roofing enabled the furnace gas exposure incident to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The FAC states that \"As a direct, natural and foreseeable result of [Hugo's] decisions...to...expose...[Michael] to his hazardous cigarette smoke, and as a substantial factor and proximate cause of such decisions, [Michael] has recently, and within one year from commencement of this action, been caused to develop [various illnesses and conditions]...\" and he alleges that [Hugo] did, repeatedly expose Michael to secondhand smoke. The FAC identifies the causative agent of the development of the illnesses, repeated exposure to secondhand smoke, which is akin to the sexual assaults in\n   <em>\n    Asbury College\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Monticello\n   </em>\n   , and the trapped furnace gases from the use of the furnace, which resulted in injuries in those cases. The problem is that the exposure to secondhand smoke occurred outside the policy period and cannot therefore constitute a covered \"occurrence\" in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   But the Estate urges the court to find that the \"accident\" was the development of the illnesses themselves. The language of the FAC cuts across the Estate's \"accident\" argument as it alleges that Michael was \"caused to develop [various illnesses and conditions]\" as \"a direct, natural and foreseeable result of [Hugo's] decisions...\" If the development of Michael's maladies was the direct, natural and foreseeable result of\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   , how could the development be an \"accident?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Further, the Estate cannot manipulate the timing of the \"occurrence\" by employing the passive voice in the FAC in such a way that Michael's \"bodily injury\" is alleged to have resulted from unidentified causes, thus avoiding a verbal collision between the exposure and the later development of illnesses and conditions. The FAC must allege sufficient facts from which to find that a covered \"occurrence\" is alleged. The only \"decision\" made by Hugo for which the FAC seeks to hold him responsible is the decision to repeatedly expose Michael to secondhand smoke. The FAC indicates that the decision was acted upon by Hugo, as he is alleged to have, in fact, exposed Michael to secondhand smoke. This exposure occurred at a time prior to the policies' periods. The FAC alleges that Michael was \"caused to develop\" the listed maladies later in life without explicitly identifying what caused the development. This use of the passive voice in describing Michael being \"acted upon\" cannot alter the fact that nothing other than exposure to secondhand smoke is alleged by the FAC to have been the subject of a decision by Hugo related to Michael. Therefore, either (1) Hugo's decision to smoke in the presence of his children resulted in repeated exposure to secondhand smoke which played a substantial role in Michael's later development of illnesses and conditions, but the exposure constitutes an \"occurrence\" outside the policies' periods or (2) the development of illnesses and conditions in 2016 was not causally connected to the repeated exposure to secondhand smoke which would then not implicate any responsibility flowing from Hugo's decision to smoke in the presence of his children and there could be no liability coverage therefore. In either event, a reasonable reading of the FAC as a whole does not reveal an allegation which potentially, possibly or might come within the coverage of the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As noted in\n   <em>\n    Liberty Ins.

In\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   , a young girl was sexually abused by her grandfather in her grandparents' home from 2001 to 2004. He pled guilty to criminal charges in 2010. Three years later, the victim, then an adult, filed an action against her grandfather for willful sexual abuse and against her grandmother for failure to properly supervise and/or to protect her from the abuse. The grandparents had no homeowners' insurance during the period of the abuse. They obtained a \"Condominium Unitowners\" policy from State Farm which became effective in 2007 and was renewed annually. State Farm sought a declaratory judgment that it need not indemnify or defend the grandparents in the underlying suit against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   State Farm argued, among other grounds, that the harm to the victim occurred outside the policy period and thus there was no coverage, despite the victim's contention that she continued to suffer injury in the form of mental anguish through 2009 at the hands of her grandmother. The granddaughter, contending that she suffered bodily injury at the hands of her grandfather, claimed that her grandmother's invitations to the home where the abuse occurred from 2001 through the period of abuse and, thereafter, through 2009 caused her to suffer mental anguish associated with the physical abuse during and beyond the period of physical abuse. The court held, in part, that the emotional harms were connected to physical injuries which occurred years before the policy came into effect. Therefore, as the claim for bodily injury at the hand of her grandfather were outside the policy period, \"there [wa]s no bridge that would bring the later-suffered emotional harm [at the hands of her grandmother] under the Policy's umbrella.\"\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157552\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/893/#p897\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

We conclude that the FAC alleges intentional conduct by Hugo in exposing his son to secondhand smoke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Estate urges that Michael's development of various illnesses and conditions was an \"accident\" as he was randomly unlucky in becoming sick. However, Liberty urges that there is no \"chance event\" alleged in the FAC because it states that \"as a direct, natural, and foreseeable result of [Hugo's] decision to...expose and subject [Michael] to his hazardous cigarette smoke, and as a substantial factor and proximate cause of such decisions, [Michael] has recently...been caused to develop [various illnesses and conditions].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   We reiterate our earlier conclusion that whatever the cause of Michael's maladies, the FAC clearly alleges that his \"bodily injury\" was directly, naturally and foreseeably caused, and not mere happenstance. As an \"accident\" under\n   <em>\n    Martin/Elias\n   </em>\n   must be both unintended by the insured and a chance event, the court concludes that the FAC does not allege a happening or event which constitutes an \"accident,\" and thus there is no covered \"occurrence\" under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Should coverage be excluded for claims brought by a relative of the insured who resided in the insured's household at the time of the \"occurrence?\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Liberty contends that there should be a declaration of no coverage for Michael's claims against Hugo because at the time Hugo exposed him to secondhand smoke Michael lived in his father's home and thus was, an \"insured\" within the meaning of the policy's definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Hugo's Estate argues that the household exclusion reads in the present tense. However, the exclusion states that\n   <strong>\n    Coverage E - Personal Liability\n   </strong>\n   does not apply to:...Bodily injury to you or an 'insured' within the meaning of part a...of 'insured' as defined.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Insured\" is defined as \"you and residents of your household who are your relatives...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The parties both recognize that the purpose for such household exclusions is to prevent collusive claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tower Ins.

We conclude that the household exclusion evidences an intent to exclude the type of relational claim raised here and therefore coverage should be precluded in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Does the physical abuse exclusion preclude coverage in this case?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Finally, Liberty argues that the FAC alleges injuries resulting from physical abuse and thus Michael's claims are subject to the exclusion for \"sexual molestation, corporal punishment or physical or mental abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Liberty contends that the dictionary definitions of \"abuse\" include \"physical maltreatment,\" which is alleged in the FAC as \"repeatedly,\" \"forcibly,\" and \"chronically\" exposing Michael to \"hazardous cigarette smoke.\" The FAC alleges that Hugo breached various duties to properly care for and protect his son, alleging that \"he expos[ed] and subject[ed] his minor son...to unsafe, dangerous, neglectful, abusive and/or harmful conditions[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   While a plain reading of the FAC reveals allegations of reprehensible conduct, as artfully described through the employment of numerous adjectives. However, the question is whether the term \"physical abuse\" under the policies is clear and unambiguous, and if not, whether more than one reasonable understanding of the term exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The court agrees with the Estate that the meaning of the term \"physical abuse,\" undefined in the policy, is not clear and unambiguous and is susceptible to more than one reasonable ordinary meaning. The term may constitute, as suggested by Liberty, physical maltreatment in the generic sense, and thus might arguably include Hugo's repeated exposure of Michael to secondhand smoke. However, it is also reasonable to ascribe a more specific meaning with a criminal overtone, as the term is included in a string of actions (\"sexual molestation, corporal punishment, or physical or mental abuse\") the commission of which may, and often do, have criminal ramifications. The exposure of a child to secondhand smoke may or may not meet a more restrictive definition of the term, were it to be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   As the term \"physical abuse\" is undefined in the policies, and the common usage unclear, we find that coverage is not precluded by application of the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Summing up, the court concludes that the FAC does not allege a covered \"occurrence,\" as Michael's exposure to secondhand smoke occurred outside the policy period and no event alleged in the FAC constitutes an \"accident\" resulting in \"bodily injury\" under the policies' terms. Hugo's conduct in exposing his son to secondhand smoke was an intentional act and the FAC alleges that Michael's \"bodily injury\" was a \"direct, natural and foreseeable result\" of Hugo's decisions to smoke, thus precluding a finding that the FAC alleges a \"chance event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In keeping with the purpose and intent of the homeowners' policies, the household exclusion should operate to preclude coverage for claims made by Michael against Hugo for exposure to secondhand smoke which occurred while Michael was a child residing in his father's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Finally, we conclude that despite the language in FAC, the \"physical abuse\" exclusion would not prevent coverage under the policy for an \"occurrence,\" as the term \"physical abuse\" is undefined and more than one reasonable meaning exists, neither of which clearly indicate that secondhand smoke exposure would constitute \"physical abuse\" under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   For these reasons, Liberty's motion for summary judgment will be granted and Hugo's Estate's motion for summary judgment will be denied. The court will enter a declaratory judgment that there is no possibility of coverage under the policies for claims made in the FAC and that Liberty has no duty to defend or indemnify Hugo's Estate in the underlying state court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    These \"facts\" are primarily gleaned from the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") in\n    <em>\n     Michael J.
