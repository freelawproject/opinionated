No. 18-MC-103), and one filed by Witness 2 and together with Witness 1 the \"Movants\"), (D.I. 6, Misc. No. 18-MC-230). The Court has previously deemed both men to be material witnesses\n   in this grand jury matter, and has ordered that they be released from custody on certain conditions; among these conditions are that, absent further order of the Court or permission of the United States of America (the \"Government\" or the \"United States\"), the men must reside in Delaware and may not leave the United States while the grand jury investigation (the \"investigation\") is proceeding. (D.I. 4, Misc. No. 18-MC-103; D.I. 7, Misc. No. 18-MC-230) With their Motions, both men seek an order directing that they be deposed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 15(a)(2), so that they can thereafter be repatriated to their home countries. For the following reasons, the Court hereby DENIES the Motions without prejudice, in the manner set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

No. 18-MC-230) The Government has identified two sets of targets (the \"targets\") of the investigation: (1) the ship's owner [redacted] and its manager/operator, (the corporate targets); and (2) the ship's Chief Officer, the Chief Officer The Government has not indicated to the Court that there are any other current targets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 7, 2017, United States Coast Guard (\"Coast Guard\") inspectors boarded the ship in Delaware and interviewed members of the ship's crew, including Witness 1 who is a Greek citizen, and Witness 2 a citizen of the Philippines. (D.I. 3 at Affidavit at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 19-20, Misc. No. 18-MC-103; D.I. 2 at Affidavit at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 19, Misc. No. 18-MC-230) Witness 1 worked aboard the ship during one of the suspected discharges of oil and has knowledge of statements made by the Chief Officer about the alleged offenses; he is said to have heard the Chief Officer make statements acknowledging the illegal discharge and is said to be able to prove that certain entries in the ship's logs relevant to the discharge are false. (D.I. 3 at Affidavit at \u00b6 19, Misc. No. 18-MC-103) Witness 2 worked as the pumpman on the ship; he is said to have been ordered by the Chief Officer to open certain valves that discharged oil on November 2, 2017 from the ship's pumps and to have witnessed crewmembers cleaning up oil discharge from the side of the ship on the next day (as well as on a prior occasion). (D.I. 2 at Affidavit at \u00b6 15, Misc. No. 18-MC-230)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Coast Guard prohibited the ship from leaving Delaware until corporate targets entered into a security agreement (the \"agreement\") with the United States that required corporate targets to, among other things: (a) leave in the United States 10 crewmembers (including the Movants and the Chief Officer); (b) continue to pay the salaries for those crewmembers; (c) provide the crewmembers with a $ 50 per diem for their meals; (d) house the crewmembers in the District of Delaware; and (e) obtain and hold the crewmembers' passports. (D.I. 10 at 4-5, D.I. 11 at Memorandum at 2 &amp; ex. C, Misc. No. 18-MC-230) The parties did enter such an agreement in December 2017; on or about December 28, 2017, the crewmembers were paroled into the United States, placed in hotels in or around Wilmington, Delaware and were informed that they were not\n   permitted to leave the District of Delaware until the Government agreed to their release.

No. 18-MC-230)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the agreement, if one of the crewmembers requests return of his passport from the corporate targets is to provide the Government with advance notice before handing over the passport, (D.I. 11 at Memorandum, ex. C at 10, Misc. No. 18-MC-230), so that the Government could (if it wished to do so), move to have the crewmember deemed a material witness to the investigation. By its terms, the agreement (to which Movants were not a party), remains in effect until all criminal proceedings arising from this case have been completed, or a security bond is returned by the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also on December 28, 2017, nine of the 10 crewmembers (all but the Chief Officer) were served with grand jury subpoenas relating to the investigation. (D.I. 10 at 5 &amp; n.5, D.I. 17 (\"Tr.\") at 9-10, Misc. No. 18-MC-230) To date, however, no charges have resulted from the investigation, and neither Movant has provided testimony before a grand jury. (D.I. 6 at 2, Misc. No. 18-MC-103; D.I. 11 at Memorandum at 2, Tr. at 38, Misc. No. 18-MC-230)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2018 (as to Witness 1) and July 2018 (as to Witness 2), the Government filed motions with the Court seeking to have the men deemed material witnesses pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203144\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 3144\"), after each man requested that his passport be returned to him.

No. 18-MC-230) Section 3144 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   If it appears from an affidavit filed by a party that the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding, and if it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena, a judicial officer may order the arrest of the person and treat the person in accordance with the provisions of [ 18 U.S.C. \u00a7] 3142 [.] No material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately be secured by deposition, and if further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice.

But instead of seeking the Movants' detention (i.e., that they be jailed) pursuant to Section 3144, the Government asked the Court to issue conditions of release regarding both men; among the requested conditions were that Movants must allow corporate targets to hold Movants' passport and that Movants' travel would be restricted to this District (unless Movants received prior permission from the Coast Guard to the contrary). The Court granted the Government's request in both cases (without objection from Movants) and issued the requested conditions of release on April 5, 2018 (as to Witness 1) and July 26, 2018 (as to Witness 2). (D.I. 4, Misc. No. 18-MC-103; D.I. 7, Misc. No. 18-MC-230)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 6, 2018 (in Witness 1 case) and on July 23, 2018 (in Witness 2 case), the Movants filed the instant Motions. (D.I. 6, Misc. No. 18-MC-103; D.I. 6, Misc. No. 18-MC-230) The Government and the Chief Officer oppose the Motions. Corporate targets does not oppose the Motions (so long as the Court orders that certain other procedures be followed, including that all of the ship's remaining crewmembers in Delaware also be deposed). Briefing on the Motions was completed on August 6, 2018, and the Court held a hearing on the Motions on August 8, 2018. (D.I. 23, Misc. No. 18-MC-103; D.I. 12, Misc.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Motions are brought pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), which works in conjunction with Section 3144. Rule 15(a) reads as follows in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) When Taken.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) In General.\n   </strong>\n   A party may move that a prospective witness be deposed in order to preserve testimony for trial. The court may grant the motion because of exceptional circumstances and in the interest of justice. If the court orders the deposition to be taken, it may also require the deponent to produce at the deposition any designated material that is not privileged, including any book, paper, document, record, recording, or data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Detained Material Witness.\n   </strong>\n   A witness who is detained under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203144\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   may request to be deposed by filing a written motion and giving notice to the parties. The court may then order that the deposition be taken and may discharge the witness after the witness has signed under oath the deposition transcript.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The burden of proof as to a Rule 15(a) motion rests with the movant, who must demonstrate the necessity for preserving a prospective witness' testimony by deposition.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ismaili\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747831\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/153/#p159\">\n    828 F.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (3d Cir. 1987). And in assessing a Rule 15 motion, \"considerations of materiality (of the testimony) and unavailability (of the witnesses) remain critical.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747831\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/153/#p159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties disagree over what is the appropriate legal standard that the Movants must meet in order to prevail on their Rule 15(a)(2) Motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some (the Government,\n   Witness 2) suggest that the Movant must show \"exceptional circumstances\" are present and that it is in the \"interests of justice\" that a deposition take place (the \"exceptional circumstances\" standard), pointing to language to that effect found in Rule 15(a)(1). (D.I. 9 at 3-4, D.I. 12 at 4, Misc. No. 18-MC-230) Others Witness 1, corporate targets, the Chief Officer assert that because these are Rule 15(a)(2) Motions, Rule 15(a)(1)'s language does not apply. Instead, they argue that the appropriate standard is drawn from Section 3144's requirement (referenced in Rule 15(a)(2) )-that Movants show that their testimony \"can be adequately be secured by deposition,\" and that further detention would not be \"necessary to prevent a failure of justice.\" (D.I. 11 at Memorandum at 3, Misc. No. 18-MC-230; Tr. at 54-55, 99)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court concludes that the \"exceptional circumstances\" standard does not apply, for a few reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an initial matter, that standard, while found in the text of Rule 15(a)(1), simply is not included in Rule 15(a)(2). And though the heading of Rule 15(a)(1) states that its contents apply \"In General[,]\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(a)(1) (emphasis omitted), it is sensible to read this as a statement by the drafters that \"In general, the requirements of Rule 15(a)(1) apply to depositions in a criminal case, except for what we are about to say about the special category of material witness depositions in Rule 15(a)(2).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, it makes sense\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   a material witness would not have to show \"exceptional circumstances\" to prompt a Rule 15 deposition, while parties to the case would need to make that showing. Depositions in criminal cases are disfavored,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ismaili\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747831\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/153/#p159\">\n    828 F.2d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so it is understandable why the Government or a defendant might need to meet a very high\n   bar to prompt the taking of such a deposition. But material witnesses are in a unique and difficult position as compared to others involved in a criminal case, in that material witnesses are detained (or, here,\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detained) but have not been charged with any crime. It stands to reason that someone in those shoes would have to meet a lesser burden than would parties to the case (i.e., than the Government, who otherwise controls the prosecution of the case and is not subject to detention at all, or a defendant who, though he might face pre-trial detention in a jail, is also someone as to whom a grand jury has found there is probable cause to believe he has committed a federal crime). (Tr. at 55)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lastly, the Court notes that numerous other courts that have considered the question have determined that the \"exceptional circumstances\" standard does not apply to Rule 15(a)(2) motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lai Fa Chen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"741240\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/214/578/\">\n    214 F.R.D. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579-80 &amp; n.2 (N.D. Cal. 2003) (\"A party seeking to take a Rule 15 deposition must make a showing of 'exceptional circumstances' as required by Rule 15(a)(1). Where a material witness, instead, moves for a Rule 15 deposition, he need not show such 'exceptional circumstances.' Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(a)(2).\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mercator Lines Ltd. (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , Misc.

This too has impacted the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, in considering the Motions, the Court will look to the standard set out by Section 3144, incorporated by reference into Rule 15(a)(2). In that regard, it will assess whether the testimony of the Movants \"can adequately be secured by deposition, and [whether] further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203144\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Resolution of the instant Motions is difficult, because the parties on both sides make compelling arguments. The Court will take some time to lay out those arguments, as they inform its decision below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the one hand, the Government and the Chief Officer point to a number of reasons why pre-indictment depositions might be inadequate and could (depending on what happens in the future) prompt a failure of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, it is clear that the witnesses each have material testimony. Indeed, neither Movant challenges the Court's prior determinations that they both have material testimony as to this criminal case. It is surely preferable that witnesses in criminal cases with material testimony are available to testify at any future criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, in terms of the Movants' potential unavailability, Movants are unlike a witness who is ill and who will likely have died by the time of trial.\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030136\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/697/262/#p273\">\n    697 F.Supp.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273-75 (D.R.I. 2010) (granting the government's motion to take Rule 15 depositions of material witnesses who were terminally ill and who were unlikely to be alive by the time of a future criminal trial). If these Movants are required to remain in the United States under their current conditions of release, there is every reason to believe that they then will be available to provide testimony at a future criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In contrast, the Court has already determined that if the Movants are permitted to leave the United States, it \"may be impracticable to secure\" their presence at a\n   future trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203144\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is undoubtedly so as to Witness 2, who has candidly acknowledged that if he is paroled from this country, he will not be coming back in the future. (Tr. at 34, 36) As for Witness 1, he has submitted an affidavit in which he states that he\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   return to the United States and make himself available for any future deposition or court proceeding, if he is requested to do so by the Government, corporate targets or the Chief Officer. (Hearing Exhibit 1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But there is still sufficient reason for the Court to find that Witness 1 future return to the United States is unlikely. The Government would not be able to force him to return. (Tr. at 36-37) Nor has he agreed to the posting of any security (e.g., a secured cash bond) that would be forfeited were he to fail to return upon request (and that therefore would provide increased incentive for him to appear). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26) Moreover, there is reason to be skeptical that a Greek citizen-someone not likely familiar with the laws of the United States and who has previously been held in this country against his will for nearly nine months-would, after being released and permitted to return home, later willingly re-enter said country to testify at a trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third-and relevant to the questions of whether Movants could be adequately deposed and whether further detention would not be necessary to prevent a failure of justice-the Court must assess how the use of any Rule 15 deposition could impact a future defendant's (i.e., corporate targets or the Chief Officer) Sixth Amendment rights (and their related Fifth Amendment rights), or impact the Government's ability to hold persons accountable for criminal wrongdoing. If Movants were deposed (and assuming that they later left this country, never to return), Rule 15 makes it clear that such a deposition is not automatically admissible at trial. Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(f) (noting that any such deposition may be used only as permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201196022\">\n    2011 WL 1196022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citing cases). Rule 804(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that such a deposition would amount to hearsay and would be precluded from use, unless the Movants are \"unavailable\" at trial and unless the party against whom the testimony is offered (e.g., the targets) had an opportunity and \"similar motive\" to develop the testimony by direct, cross or redirect examination at the time of that testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, what if Movants are deposed now, but then in a few months, the Government brings charges invoking legal theories or factual issues that were previously unknown to targets' counsel or that could not have been reasonably contemplated at this stage? The targets' counsel would not have known to ask questions about such theories or facts at the prior deposition. (D.I. 9 at 5, D.I. 11 at Memorandum at 3-4, Misc. No. 18-MC-230 (the Chief Officer noting that \"[t]argets-not yet defendants-cannot seek to illicit testimony based on\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   charges or\n   <em>\n    conceivable\n   </em>\n   facts in a non-existent indictment\") (emphasis in original); Tr. at 74-75) Or what if Movants are deposed now, but thereafter targets' counsel develops evidence that calls into question some aspects of Movants' testimony? Or if at trial, another testifying witness says something that is inconsistent with what Movants said in their deposition? (Tr. at 64, 76) Targets' counsel would not be able to ask questions of Movants as to this new evidence or witness statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In these scenarios, were the Government permitted to introduce the Rule 15 depositions at trial, that could prejudice the targets to a great degree.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030136\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/697/262/#p273\">\n    697 F.Supp.2d at 274-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[p]ermitting pre-indictment depositions places citizens, who are under the spotlight of investigation but not yet formally accused, in the dangerous position of having to defend against what is intended to be trial testimony, before any formal adversary proceeding has been triggered, and without the benefit of knowing precisely the basis of the government's allegations or its legal theories[,]\" and finding it a \"close call\" as to whether such depositions should be permitted, even where the material witnesses were terminally ill and might not survive until a future trial). Alternatively, if the Government were not later permitted to introduce such depositions (because a Court were to find that doing so would violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights), then it would not only have been a \"waste of judicial resources to order\" the depositions, (D.I. 9 at 4, Misc.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-76)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   And most significantly, Movants are seriously burdened in light of their current conditions of release. They are not suspected of having committed any crime, or having done anything wrong, and yet they have been required to remain in the United States (either due to the agreement between corporate targets and the Government, or, much more recently, due to a Court order) for nearly nine months. They cannot return to their home.

If no further action is taken by the Court, they face the prospect of indefinite\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detention in this country, presumably until either the Government concludes its investigation without bringing charges, or until all future-charged defendants see their cases completely resolved. That could be months, or even years from now.
