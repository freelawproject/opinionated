Fourteen named plaintiffs have brought claims for negligence; negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ; breach of implied contract; unjust enrichment; and violation of various state unfair competition, data breach, consumer protection, and consumer fraud statutes. (Doc. No. 51.) Before the Court is Saks' Motion to Transfer Venue (Doc. No. 55) to the Southern District of New York pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), to which Plaintiffs have responded in opposition (Doc. No. 57) and Saks has replied (Doc. No. 58). The parties have also submitted supplemental authority. (Doc. Nos. 87, 89, 90.) For the following reasons, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Allegations and Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 1, 2018, Saks announced that it \"became aware of a data security issue involving customer payment card data.\" (Doc. No. 51 at \u00b6 3.) On April 27, 2018, Saks disclosed that hackers had placed malware on Saks' retail systems in order to collect customer payment card information, including cardholder name, payment card number and expiration dates, when shoppers used their credit and debit cards at its stores. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 4.) The Amended Complaint alleges that this data breach was enabled by Saks security failures and failure to abide by best practices and industry standards concerning the security of payment systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Saks is a Tennessee corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 11.) However, Saks has no offices or employees in Tennessee. (Doc. No. 56-9 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) Saks does not own or operate any of its Saks Fifth Avenue or Saks OFF 5TH stores in Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 7.) There is no Saks Fifth Avenue store within 100 miles of Nashville, Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8.) There is one Saks OFF 5TH store in Tennessee, but it is not owned or operated by Saks (rather, by another entity not party here and not itself incorporated in Tennessee). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 9.) The headquarters and principal place of business of Saks and its corporate parent, Hudson's Bay Company, is in New York. (Doc. Nos. 2 at \u00b6 5; 56-9 at \u00b6 3.) Saks operates 29 Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks OFF 5TH stores in New York. (Doc. No. 56-9 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There are fourteen named plaintiffs in this action. None of them reside in Tennessee or within 100 miles of Nashville. None of the named plaintiffs is alleged to have shopped at the one Saks OFF 5TH store in Tennessee. (Doc. No. 51.) Five of the named plaintiffs live in New York and are alleged to have shopped at Saks stores in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) Two additional named plaintiffs reside nearby in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) The remaining named plaintiffs reside in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 24, 25.) The named plaintiffs\n   seek to represent a national class of persons who used a credit or debit card at a Saks store from May 1, 2017 to April 1, 2018, or, in the alternative, sub-classes of those persons across eight different states, none of which is Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    . at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Saks data breach incident led to multiple lawsuits. Two of the named plaintiffs filed suit here in the Middle District of Tennessee. At the same time, five similar actions were filed in the Southern District of New York.\n   <em>\n    Four\n   </em>\n   of those actions were filed by seven current named plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   action (Vains, Lefkowitz, Tafet, Carthan, Levitt-Raschella, Joseph, and Wade). On April 18, 2018, Vains - now a plaintiff in this action - filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (\"JPML\") to transfer the then-pending (and any subsequent) data breach cases to a single judge in the\n   <em>\n    Southern District of New York\n   </em>\n   pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. No. 56-2.) The motion argued that consolidation in the Southern District of New York was appropriate because that was where the defendants \"maintain their headquarters and central operations in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 10.) The motion highlighted that the actions all sought national classes for Saks and Lord &amp; Taylor shoppers based on the data breach incident under the common law and state statutory theories of liability. (Id.) Further, the Motion stated: \"Absent transfer and consolidation, there is a substantial risk of inconsistent rulings on issues ranging from discovery to class certification in each case. Centralization would eliminate that risk, conserve judicial resources, reduce litigation costs, and permit the cases to proceed to trial in a more efficient manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 9.) Eight other plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   action supported that motion for consolidation in the Southern District of New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 56-3, 56-4.) In one filing, some of those plaintiffs said that the Southern District of New York is \"the most appropriate forum\" and \"the preferable court\" because it is accessible, the defendants maintained their headquarters there, and witnesses and evidence were present. (Doc. No. 56-4 at 5.) Those eight plaintiffs noted that the Middle District of Tennessee might \"also be appropriate\" in the alternative. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 56-3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 1, 2018, the JPML declined to centralize the cases under \u00a7 1407. (Doc. No. 56-1.) It did so because \"centralization under Section 1407 should be the last solution after considered review of all other options.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1.) The JPML explained, \"where 'a reasonable prospect' exists that the resolution of a Section 1404 motion or motions could eliminate the multidistrict character of a litigation, transfer under Section 1404 is preferable to Section 1407 centralization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) After specifically noting that one California district court had already transferred a Saks data breach case to the Southern District of New York under \u00a7 1404, the JPML observed that \"although no Section 1404 motion has yet been filed in the Middle District of Tennessee action, those plaintiffs also are New York residents and support centralization in either the Southern District of New York or the Middle District of Tennessee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.) But the likely future for these cases in New York that the JPML seems to have anticipated never came. Within two weeks of the JPML's decision, four of the Saks data breach actions pending in the Southern District of New York were voluntarily dismissed. (Doc. No. 56 at 7 (collecting cases).) All but one of the plaintiffs from those dismissed New York actions were added to this action in Tennessee, and they now resist transfer to the Southern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While this case has been pending, several other Saks data breach cases have been transferred. In a case similar to this in the Central District of California,\n   <em>\n    Mekerdijian v. Saks Fifth Avenue LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , the court considered a similar motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) and was presented essentially the same declarations that now accompany the motion before this Court. The court concluded that, despite the fact that the complaint alleged extensive violations of California law, transfer to the Southern District of New York was clearly warranted under the relevant considerations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 56-7.) After\n   <em>\n    Mekerdijian\n   </em>\n   was transferred to New York, the plaintiffs dismissed the case. (Doc. No. 56 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Three months later, another case from California was transferred by stipulation under \u00a7 1404(a) to the Southern District of New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 56-8);\n   <em>\n    Rudolph v. Hudson's Bay Co., et al\n   </em>\n   . (S.D.N.Y. Case No. 1:18-cv-8472 (PKC)). The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   action recently attempted to intervene in the\n   <em>\n    Rudolph\n   </em>\n   case so they could move to dismiss, stay, or transfer it. Their motion was denied. (Doc. No. 87-1.) As the Court considers this \u00a7 1404(a) motion, the\n   <em>\n    Rudolph\n   </em>\n   putative class action based on the same data breach actively proceeds in the Southern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, there is an additional case against a related entity arising from the data breach that has been proceeding outside of the Middle District of Tennessee. Up until very recently, a putative class action against Lord &amp; Taylor has been pending in the District of Delaware.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris, et al., v. Lord &amp; Taylor LLC\n   </em>\n   (D. Del. Case No. 1:18-cv-00521). Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   involves some of the\n   <em>\n    very same named plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   as this case against Saks. On April 25, 2019, the District of Delaware granted the \u00a7 1404(a) motion of Lord &amp; Taylor, which is incorporated in Delaware, to transfer the\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   case to the Southern District of New York. (Doc. No. 90-1.) After noting that none of the named plaintiffs lived or were alleged to have shopped in Delaware, the court found that there was \"no indication that any of the claims arose in Delaware\" and rejected the named plaintiffs' argument that this action arose outside of New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 6-7.) The court also found that the convenience of the parties weighed in favor of transfer because \"the substantial majority of the parties \"are in and around New York and \"all would have to travel\" to Delaware for litigation purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7-8.) Finally, the court concluded that transfer was appropriate so one district court could resolve similar claims arising from the same underlying events. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10-11.) Accordingly, the Southern District of New York is now home to two putative class actions arising from the data breach incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Relevant Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Saks seeks transfer of this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which provides that, \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\" With this statute, \"Congress intended to give district courts the discretion to transfer cases on an individual basis by considering convenience and fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Kerobo v.

It further argues that, for the sake of efficiency and consistency, this case should be litigated where two other class actions concerning the data breach are now pending. Plaintiffs respond that Saks elected to be incorporated in Tennessee and that they are entitled to deference of their choice of that valid forum for a national class action. Plaintiffs do not argue that this case could not have been brought in the Southern District of New York, which is a prerequisite for transfer under \u00a7 1404(a). Indeed, because Saks has its headquarters in New York, it \"resides\" there for purposes of the venue statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

First, \"when plaintiffs do not reside in their chosen forum, their choice should be given less weight than would otherwise be the case.\"\n   <em>\n    W.H. by and through M.H. D.R. v. Tenn.

These witnesses include all Saks executives; all Saks employees with knowledge of information security policies and procedures; all Saks employees relevant to the data breach and Saks' response; and all third-party consultants and information security experts who discovered, analyzed, and managed the data breach for Saks. (Doc. No. 56-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). While it is generally true that \"a corporation is expected to make its employees available to testify,\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Dollar Gen.

They are employed at Verizon PCI Forensic Investigation in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, which is 40 miles from New York City. (Doc. No. 56-5 at \u00b6 7.)

It would clearly be more convenient for Saks to conduct discovery and litigate in New York, where all of the evidence and its personnel are located, than to engage in the extra steps necessary to participate in a protracted litigation in the Middle District of Tennessee. At the same time, Plaintiff have not established that it is any more inconvenient for them to litigate in New York. Five of the named plaintiffs live in New York and two live in adjacent New Jersey, and eight of them originally filed suit against Saks in New York. Again, it is important that none of the named plaintiffs lives in Tennessee. Any inconvenience that plaintiffs' counsel - who are spread throughout the country and have represented that they are willing to travel to New York for discovery in any event - might encounter in litigating in New York as opposed to Nashville is minimal. Indeed, the docket reflects that 7 of 17 counsel of record for Plaintiffs are\n   <em>\n    located in New York.\n   </em>\n   Nine of the remaining 10 counsel are located in Illinois; Pennsylvania; New York; Washington, D.C.; Tampa, Florida; and Cincinnati, Ohio, which are no more convenient to Nashville than to New York. Plaintiffs have simply not demonstrated that the Middle District of Tennessee is any way more or less convenient for any party such that transfer to New York would impermissibly shift the burden of litigating in an inconvenient forum.

However, this case involves a high-level breach of corporate systems and attendant relevant corporate policies and practices.

Feb. 5, 2010) (\"A fundamental principle guiding the Court's analysis of a motion to transfer is that litigation should proceed in that place where the case finds its center of gravity.\") (citation omitted). Plaintiffs focus on their allegations that the putative class members made purchases throughout the United States and the cyberthieves made illicit purchases throughout the United States, in contending that the \"scope\" of the case is nationwide. However, while it may be true that the data breach drew from nationwide transactions and its aftereffects were felt nationwide, the core of this case is about the data breach\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   , what\n   <em>\n    at Saks\n   </em>\n   led to it, and what\n   <em>\n    at Saks\n   </em>\n   happened after it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51.) The allegations in the Amended Complaint case therefore revolve around the data breach itself (resulting from a penetration of Saks' cyber infrastructure), the degree to which Saks's corporate policies and practices \"enabled\" the theft of purportedly protected data, and how Saks responded to the breach. Plaintiffs do not seriously contend that these policies, actions, or statements arose from anywhere other than Saks' operational headquarters. The locus of the breach and the policies and practices at issue is therefore in New York, not at purchase terminals throughout the United States where shoppers bought clothing or thieves bought loot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because the \"center of gravity\" of this case is in New York, this factor favors transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   g.\n   <em>\n    Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When a company is incorporated in a state, there can sometimes be a compelling public interest in deciding a controversy at home.\n   <em>\n    North v.

But Plaintiffs do not explain any benefits that Saks currently receives from its incorporation or any public or local interest that is implicated by this action. While Saks is indeed a Tennessee corporation, it does not pretend to do any measurable business here that would trigger a persuasive local interest in deciding this controversy.

Second, plaintiffs' arguments concerning the two districts' docket congestion and time to trial are not particularly compelling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, no argument has\n   been made about the relative means of the parties - i.e., that transfer would cause a substantial financial hardship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, neither party has identified any important public policies dictate a particular result here. Remarkably, Plaintiffs argue that a \"public policy\" that weighs against transfer is that the law is more favorable to them in Tennessee than in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 57 at 14-15.) Plaintiffs contend that this Court should review the substantive law they may face elsewhere and base its \u00a7 1404(a) decision on their likelihood of success. This type of consideration is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   part of the \u00a7 1404(a) analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Job Haines Home for the Aged v.
