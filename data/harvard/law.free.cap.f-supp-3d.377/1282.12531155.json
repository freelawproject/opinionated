No. 20]. Plaintiff George Andrew Morgan (\"Morgan\") filed a Preliminary Objection [Doc. No. 31]. State Farm replied [Doc. No. 32]. Plaintiff filed an Amended Objection [Doc. No. 36] and State Farm has filed an Amended Reply. [Doc. No. 39].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This lawsuit arises from State Farm's failure to protect a workers compensation carrier's statutory subrogation/lien interest and failure to pay the resulting judgment against its insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   State Farm insured Morgan under an automobile insurance policy (\"Policy\") which provided liability coverage limits of $ 100,000.00. The Policy obligates State Farm to pay \"damages an insured becomes legally liable to pay because of ... bodily injuries.\" Motion, at 3 (quoting Policy\n   [Doc. No. 20-1] ). On June 16, 2009, Morgan left a bar intoxicated. Despite his intoxication, Morgan chose to operate a vehicle and struck pedestrian Jesse Atkins as he was crossing the street. Jesse Atkins was a Kansas resident in Oklahoma for a job with a Kansas company. After striking Mr. Atkins, Morgan left the accident scene. Mr. Atkins was seriously injured and underwent extensive medical treatment totaling over two million dollars in medical expenses. Morgan subsequently pled no contest to charges of: (1) driving under the influence causing great bodily injury; and, (2) leaving the scene of an injury accident. Morgan received a suspended sentence but was eventually incarcerated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   State Farm received notice of the accident on August 3, 2009, and began its investigation. On September 10, 2009, State Farm sent a letter to Morgan informing him that \"it is possible the injuries claimed against you may be in excess of the protection afforded by the policy.\" Letter from Todd Towe to Morgan [Doc. No. 20-11]. The letter went on to state that State Farm \"will do everything possible to protect you within those limits, however, you may be held personally responsible for any judgment in excess of those limits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 19, 2010, Mr. Atkins' attorney provided Michael Feldman, State Farm Claim Representative, with Mr. Atkins' medical bills. These bills totaled $ 2,119,506.30. Mr. Feldman then requested authority to offer the policy limits of $ 100,000.00 to settle Mr. Atkins' claim against Morgan. This request was granted and Mr. Feldman made the policy limits offer on February 25, 2010. The offer was accepted with instructions to make the settlement check out to \"Jesse Atkins and Medicaid.\" Letter from Bretz to Feldman [Doc. No. 20-18]. The check was issued and mailed by State Farm to Mr. Atkins' attorney on March 30, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Atkins' attorney informed State Farm on April 6, 2010, that Mr. Atkins had filed a workers compensation claim against Mr. Atkins' employer and its workers compensation carrier, Kansas Building Industry Workers Compensation Fund (\"Fund\"). Mr. Atkins' attorney further informed State Farm that workers compensation would pay all of Mr. Atkins' medical bills. This was State Farm's first notice that workers compensation was involved. On the same date, Mr. Atkins' attorney provided State Farm with a copy of the workers compensation \"Order for Compensation\" which stated that Mr. Atkins' medical treatment was covered by workers compensation. No lien had yet been asserted on behalf of the Fund. On April 22, 2010, State Farm received a release of all claims from Mr. Atkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Order for Compensation included a preliminary finding that Mr. Atkins' claim was covered by workers compensation. It was not a final order. The Fund ultimately appealed on the basis that Mr. Atkins was not in the course of his employment when he was struck by Morgan and, therefore, was not entitled to workers compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 21, 2010, State Farm received Mr. Atkins' signed release discharging any claims he might have against Morgan as a result of the accident. Fifteen months later, on June 15, 2011, New York Marine (\"NYM\"), as the subrogee for the Fund, brought suit against Morgan in Garfield County, Oklahoma. Morgan first learned of NYM's claims in January 2012. Complaint at \u00b6 19; Motion, Exhibit 28, Claim File Activity Log [Doc. No. 20-28]. Morgan was served on January 6, 2012. Amended Objection\n   at 6; Amended Objection, Exhibit Claim File Activity Log [Doc. No. 20-28].&lt;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm learned of the lawsuit on January 30, 2012. State Farm retained legal counsel to represent Morgan in the lawsuit. Morgan also retained his own counsel. Ultimately, the Garfield County judge denied a motion for summary judgment filed on behalf of Morgan as to NYM's subrogation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to trial, State Farm offered to pay NYM $ 100,000.00, the same amount of the policy limits already paid to Atkins. NYM rejected the offer. NYM counteroffered to settle for $ 700,000.00. The case went to trial on February 26, 2014. The jury returned a verdict in favor of NYM and against Morgan in the amount of $ 844,865.89 on February 27, 2014. Judgment was entered on April 8, 2014. After the judgment was entered, State Farm continued to attempt negotiations with NYM and again offered NYM the policy limits of $ 100,000.00 for a release of the judgment against Morgan. The offer was rejected. State Farm continued to defend Morgan through post-trial motions and appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In December 2014, the Kansas Workers Compensation Appeals Board ruled on the Fund's appeal of Mr. Atkins' workers compensation claim. The Board found that Mr. Atkins was not entitled to workers compensation because he was not in the course and scope of his employment when he was struck by Morgan's vehicle. This ruling is pending further appeal in Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 10, 2016, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the Garfield County judgment in favor of NYM. The Oklahoma Supreme Court denied certiorari on February 21, 2017. The mandate was issued on March 23, 2017. Morgan filed the instant action on May 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Okla. Stat. tit. 12 \u00a7 95(A)(3). The parties disagree on when that statute of limitations began to run in this case. Morgan argues his bad faith claim is one for excess judgment as a result of State Farm's failure to protect a workers' compensation interest, and therefore the statute of limitations commenced on March 23, 2017, when appeals were exhausted on the state court judgment in favor of NYM. Amended Objection at 19. State Farm contends that the bad faith claim is not an excess judgment claim and the statute of limitations began to run from the time of the alleged offending conduct. State Farm asserts that all such conduct occurred more than two years prior to May 23, 2015. Motion at 17, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As mentioned, Morgan characterizes State Farm's alleged bad faith as having \"failed to protect a workers' compensation interest resulting in an excess judgment.\" Amended Objection at 19. However, all of the cases to which Morgan points in support of the later running of the statute involve claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in which the insurer \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     unreasonably refused to accept\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   a settlement offer within policy limits\" resulting in the entry of a judgment in excess of policy limits against the insured.\n   <em>\n    Torrez v.

Moreover, none of these cases involve any other underlying breach of duty and none involve an insurer's bad faith failure to protect a subrogee's interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Morgan does not dispute that State Farm offered to settle for full policy limits twice before any excess judgment was entered -- once to Mr. Atkins, which was accepted, and later to NYM prior to trial on its subrogation claims. Nor does Morgan dispute that State Farm attempted to settle for full policy limits a third time after the judgment was entered in favor of NYM in state court. State Farm's undisputed willingness, and multiple attempts, to settle for policy limits precludes characterization of this case as an excess judgment case. Therefore, the statute of limitations did not begin to run on March 23, 2017, when appeals were exhausted on the state court judgment in favor of NYM. Instead, the statute of limitations began to run upon accrual of Morgan's cause of action, viz., \"when the insurer breached the implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with its insured.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Trinity Baptist Church v.

State Farm contends the period began at the time of breach which is alleged to have occurred in 2010, more than five years before Morgan filed this action. Morgan asserts the statute did not begin to run until all appeals were complete on the state court judgment.

Motion at 5-6, 8; Amended Objection at 10, 12, 15.

Morgan was served on January 6, 2012, and, with due diligence, could have obtained the information necessary to bring suit against State Farm at that time. Therefore, the statute of limitation on Morgan's breach of contract claim began to run on January 6, 2012, and expired January 7, 2017. Morgan's breach of contract claim is, thus, untimely, having been filed after January 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Morgan asserts that the \"no action\" clause tolled the statute of limitations until all appeals of NYM's judgment against him were complete.
