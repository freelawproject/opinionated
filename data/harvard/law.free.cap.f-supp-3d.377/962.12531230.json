Mr. Nation has now filed a \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At the previous revocation hearing, Mr. Nation admitted to law violations. They were convictions in Iowa for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and simple assault of his girlfriend. He did not appeal the revocation or sentence I imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following initial review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I now dismiss with prejudice and deny the \u00a7 2255 motion. From the records, it plainly appears that Mr. Nation is not entitled to relief. I also refuse to issue a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Nation first claims that the period of supervised release I imposed (5 years) following revocation was not authorized. He is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 3583(k)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Title 18 of the United States Code provides a period of supervised\n   release of 5 years (and up to life) in cases such as this involving failure to register. Thus, \u00a7 3583(k) trumps\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cheeks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922698\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/647/310/\">\n    647 F. App'x 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2016) (where government petitioned to revoke supervised release of defendant previously convicted of failure to register as sex offender, United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi ordered revocation and imposed 11-month prison term followed by life term of supervised release; defendant appealed, challenging term of supervised release, but Fifth Circuit affirmed). Moreover, the period of supervised release I imposed is consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(c) (\"The term of supervised release imposed shall be not less than any statutorily required term of supervised release.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The remainder of Mr. Nation's claims are essentially meritless rambling. As the lengthy hearing record will reveal, I carefully considered the relative merits of imposing the sentence I decided upon and clearly expressed my reasons for the sentence at the time I imposed it. (Filing No. 124.) Despite enormous efforts by the supervising probation officer (like finding Mr. Nation free or nearly free housing at Dismas Charities where he resided at the time of his third violation), Mr. Nation's repeated violations of his conditions of supervised release warranted the high-end Guideline prison sentence of 14 months and the 5 years of supervised release. While it may seem to Mr. Nation that he is caught in a revolving door from which there is no escape, that figurative door continues to revolve because of the actions of Mr. Nation. The way to stop the revolving door is for Mr. Nation to stop drinking while driving and assaulting his girlfriend and otherwise abiding by the conditions of supervised release. To be utterly frank, but not intending to be unkind, we are as sick of Mr. Nation as he is sick of us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, a defendant cannot appeal an adverse ruling on a \u00a7 2255 motion unless he or she is granted a certificate of appealability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) &amp; (2) ; Fed.
