On August 19, 2016, Plaintiff requested Appeals Council review of the ALJ's decision. Doc. 8-1 at PageID 76. On September 10, 2016, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ's non-disability finding the final administrative decision of the Commissioner. Plaintiff then filed this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   appeal on November 18, 2016, when he moved for leave to file his complaint\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"IFP\").

Ohio May 28, 2009) (dismissing complaint filed three days late).

Ohio Sept. 17, 2012) (dismissing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's complaint for failure to comply with \u00a7 405(g)'s filing deadline)\n   <em>\n    Report and Recommendation adopted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204920798\">\n    2012 WL 4920798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Ohio Oct. 16, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, the Appeals Council's notice is dated September 10, 2016. Under the Commissioner's regulations,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff presumptively received that notice in the mail on or before September 15, 2016. Assuming Plaintiff received the notice by September 15, 2016, his appeal was due to be filed on or before November 14, 2016. Again, Plaintiff did not initiate this appeal until November 18, 2016,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , four days\n   after expiration of the presumptive deadline for filing an appeal. Doc. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff presents evidence reasonably rebutting-and in fact contradicting-the presumption that he received the Appeals Council's notice on or before September 15, 2015. In fact,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff presents a copy of the envelope in which the Appeals Council's notice was contained. Doc. 9-5 at PageID 94. That envelope is postmarked September 15, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, since the letter was not postmarked until September 15, 2015, Plaintiff obviously did not receive such notice on or before that date. Instead, Plaintiff's representation that he actually received the notice on September 19, 2016 is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the Court finds Plaintiff received the Appeals Council's notice on September 19, 2016, the 60 day deadline for filing an appeal in this Court was November 18, 2016. Because Plaintiff initiated his appeal on November 18, 2016, it was timely filed. Accordingly, the undersigned\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that the Commissioner's motion to dismiss (doc. 8) be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Attached hereto is a NOTICE to the parties regarding objections to this Report and Recommendation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \"[W]hen a petitioner files for permission to file IFP, a complaint is considered filed on the day the clerk's office receives both the complaint and the application to proceed IFP, even if the complaint is not formally stamped 'filed' until a later date when the IFP application is granted.\"\n    <em>\n     Scott v.
