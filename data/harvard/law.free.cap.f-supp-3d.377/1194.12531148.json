Before the Court is Defendant Geico Indemnity Company's (\"Geico\") motion \"to dismiss the second cause of action in Plaintiff's complaint, or in the alternative, to sever/bifurcate and to stay claims for bad faith.\" (ECF Nos. 6, 7.) The Court has reviewed Plaintiff Michael Hendon's response (ECF No. 13 ) as well as Geico's reply (ECF No. 15 ). For the following reasons, the Court grants Geico's motion and dismisses Plaintiff's second cause of action for violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts come from the Complaint (ECF No. 1-1 ) unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff suffered personal injuries in a car accident on July 19, 2017, including \"a closed head injury with positive loss of consciousness, cervical strain, thoracic strain, lumbar strain, and mental anguish.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Plaintiff's insurance policy (\"Policy\")-provided by Geico-included uninsured motorist's coverage with limits of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Plaintiff received a settlement from the at-fault driver's insurance policy and then made a claim under his uninsured motorist's coverage with\n   Geico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Geico offered to settle Plaintiff's claim for $ 27,067. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed the Complaint in the Second Judicial District Court (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 2), and Geico removed based on diversity jurisdiction (ECF No. 1 at 2 ). Plaintiff asserts two claims: breach of contract and violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310. (ECF No. 1-1 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff's complaint alleges facts that allow a court to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Geico moves to dismiss Plaintiff's claim under NRS \u00a7 686A.310.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6 at 8.) The parties seem to agree that Plaintiff alleges violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310(1)(b), (e), (f), and (n) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at 5-7 ; ECF No. 15 at 3-5 ), even though the Complaint does not expressly\n   identify these provisions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 6-7 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court agrees with Geico that Plaintiff's Complaint fails to allege a plausible claim for relief under NRS \u00a7 686A.310. In support of this claim, Plaintiff alleges nothing more than that Geico \"failed to provide adequate insurance coverage to Plaintiff ... and has failed to settle Plaintiff['s] ... insurance claim in good faith.\" (ECF No. 1-1 at 6.) These allegations amount to \"a bare recital of the elements of the claim without any supporting factual allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Dearaujo v.

Plaintiff asserts that his counsel \"engaged in lengthy negotiations and permitted [Geico] to conduct an interview of the Plaintiff as additional material for consideration of his claim,\" but Plaintiff does not identify how those negotiations or Plaintiff's interview would support a larger settlement than Geico offered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at 6-7.) Plaintiff also alleges that Geico's counsel generally has been unresponsive to Plaintiff's counsel (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), but the litigation conduct of Geico's counsel is not material to the motion before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff attaches a proposed amended complaint to his response (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13-2 ), but that proposed complaint suffers from the same defects as the operative complaint before the Court. It seems that the only material difference between the two complaints is that the proposed amended complaint specifically alleges violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310(1)(b), (e), (f), and (n) rather than violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310 generally. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 6\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13-2 at 6.) Based on Plaintiff's apparent failure to allege a plausible claim for relief, the Court finds that amendment would be futile. Thus, Plaintiff's request (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at 8 ) for leave to file an amended complaint is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, the Court grants Geico's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claim for violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motions before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is therefore ordered that Geico's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 6 ) is granted. Plaintiff's claim for violation of NRS \u00a7 686A.310 is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is further ordered that Geico's motion to stay (ECF No. 7 ) is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Geico also moved for dismissal of Plaintiff's second claim to the extent that it might be construed as a tort claim for bad faith. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 6.) But Plaintiff clarified in his response that his second claim is a claim for violations of NRS \u00a7 686A.310 -not a claim for bad faith. (ECF No. 13 at 2 (\"The Plaintiff avers that the Complaint does expressly refer to 'bad faith,' but his second cause of action is firmly grounded in NRS \u00a7 686A.310, not tortious bad faith ....\").)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
