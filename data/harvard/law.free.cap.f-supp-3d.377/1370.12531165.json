For the following reasons, Defendants ADT LLC's and The ADT Corporation's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Safe Streets USA, LLC's motion (Doc. 17) is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED AS MOOT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from the circumstances surrounding the death of Jearlene Johnson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 7 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-18.) On September 16, 2017, Decedent Johnson entered into a contract for monitoring and home security services with Defendant Safe Streets USA, LLC, an authorized dealer of Defendant ADT, LLC (\"ADT\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) In reaching the agreement, Defendants were informed that Decedent Johnson suffered from Alzheimer's disease and had a tendency to wander from her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) In the event that the alarm was triggered at Decedent Johnson's home, Defendants were instructed to contact Decedent Johnson's niece and neighbor, Sheila Archie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) On several occasions, Defendants contacted Ms. Archie when the alarm was triggered at Decedent Johnson's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 10, 2017, the alarm was activated at Decedent Johnson's home between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) Despite the alarm, Defendants failed to notify Ms. Archie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The next morning, Ms. Archie went to check on Decedent Johnson and found that Decedent Johnson had succumbed overnight to hypothermia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 10, 2018, Decedent's brother, Allen Johnson, initiated this action on the behalf of all of Decedent Johnson's beneficiaries and Decedent Johnson's estate. (Doc. 1.) In his initial complaint,\n   Plaintiff brought suit against Defendants ADT and John Does 1-10 for negligence, gross negligence, negligent training and supervision, breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, and wrongful death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As relief, Plaintiff sought \"to recover pre-death pain and suffering, funeral and burial expenses, medical expenses, and any and all other available estate claims and expenses, resulting from the death of Jearlene Johnson.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Additionally, Plaintiff requested punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On review, this Court identified deficiencies with respect to the jurisdictional allegations in Plaintiff's initial complaint and directed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint addressing those deficiencies. (Doc. 4.) On December 27, 2018, Plaintiff complied with this Court's directive and filed an amended complaint reasserting his previous allegations against Defendants ADT and John Does 1-10. (Doc. 7.) In the amended complaint, Plaintiff also added Defendants The ADT Corporation and Safe Streets USA, LLC as defendants in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants have now filed two motions to dismiss. (Doc. 16; Doc 17.) In their nearly identical motions, Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to establish any possible basis for recovery and that the entirety of Plaintiff's complaint must be dismissed. Defendants allege that Plaintiff's claims fail because (1) the contract signed by Decedent Johnson bars this lawsuit, or, alternatively, limits Plaintiff's potential recovery; (2) Plaintiff's lawsuit is untimely; (3) Plaintiff's claims based on Defendants' negligence arise solely out of the contract between Decedent Johnson and Defendant ADT; and (4) Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim is inefficiently pled and substantively insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) (2) requires a complaint to contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" \"[T]he pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(Doc. 22 at 1 n.1.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a) (1) (A) (i), parties are permitted to dismiss a defendant from an action if the dismissal is requested \"before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klay v.

In this case, no Defendant has filed an answer or motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Defendants The ADT Corporation and Safe Streets, LLC are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   from this action.

Accordingly, the Court will now consider the merits of Defendant ADT's Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Timeliness of this Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendant ADT argues that Plaintiff's lawsuit must be dismissed because it is untimely. Defendant contends that Plaintiff filed this lawsuit one day after the one-year limitations period agreed to by the parties in the contract between Defendant ADT and Decedent Johnson. In response, Plaintiff disagrees and asserts that this lawsuit, filed on the one-year anniversary of Decedent Johnson's death, was properly filed on the last day of the filing period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   From this Court's assessment of the contract\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this case, Defendant's position\n   is untenable. The contract between Decedent Johnson and Defendant ADT provides that\n   <strong>\n    \"NO SUIT OR ACTION SHALL BE BROUGHT AGAINST [ADT] AFTER THE SHORTER OF (1) ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF LOSS OR (2) THE TIME ALLOWED BY LAW.\"\n   </strong>\n   (Doc. 16, Attach. 1 at \u00b6 5(f) (emphasis in original).) Based on a plain reading of the contract, Plaintiff was required to file his lawsuit within one year after the day of Decedent's death on December 10, 2017. Plaintiff filed this suit on December 10, 2018, exactly 365 days after the death of Decedent Johnson. Because Plaintiff filed this lawsuit within the one-year period provided in the contract, the Court finds that Plaintiff's lawsuit complies with the terms of the contract and is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant attempts to complicate the plain reading of the contract provision by arguing that the contract terms provide that the calculation of the one-year filing period actually began on the date of the incident and that any resulting lawsuit should have, therefore, been filed by December 9, 2018. Further, Defendant asserts that Georgia state courts enforce filing limitations contained in contracts and that no federal rule or statute would impact the calculation of the filing period agreed to in the contract. As a result, Defendant contends that the Court must enforce the contract terms in this case, which, in Defendant's view, dictate that the filing period for this action began on the day of the incident and expired before Plaintiff filed this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While Defendant is correct that the filing-limitations period agreed to in the contract should be enforced in this case, the Court disagrees with Defendant's interpretation of the language in the contract. Contrary to Defendant's argument, the contract does not plainly state that the day of the incident in question counts in the calculation of the limitations period or that the lawsuit must be filed less than a year of the date of the incident. Instead, the contract plainly provides that Plaintiff must file this lawsuit v/ithin \"one year after the date of loss.\" (Doc. 16, Attach. 1 at \u00b6 5(F).) Using common sense to interpret the plain meaning of the contract terms, Plaintiff had one year, or 365 days, from the date of Decedent Johnson's death to file this lawsuit. By filing the lawsuit on the anniversary of the Decedent's death, this action is plainly timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Exculpatory Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite this Court's conclusion that Plaintiff's complaint is timely, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's complaint must also be dismissed because Plaintiff's suit is barred by the contract at issue in this case. Defendant contends that Decedent Johnson expressly waived the ability to file suit against Defendant ADT in the initial contract that she signed to obtain home security services. Because Decedent Johnson knowingly waived any opportunity to bring suit against Defendant ADT, Defendant asserts that this action must be dismissed. Alternatively, Defendant contends that Decedent Johnson agreed to limit any potential recovery from any lawsuit to $ 500. In response, Plaintiff asserts that the contract\n   terms are unenforceable and should not bar this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Georgia, courts are instructed to \"respect[ ] the parties' sacrosanct freedom of contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Monitronics Intern., Inc. v.

Moreover, the font of the subparagraphs at issue in this case are bolded and capitalized. Although many of provisions in section 5 are capitalized and bolded, most of the other 27 sections of the contract are not.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the exculpatory provisions of the contract are enforceable.

Accordingly, while the exculpatory language in the contract between Decedent Johnson and Defendant ADT bars many of Plaintiff's claims, the contract's exculpatory language cannot bar Plaintiff's claim that Defendant ADT acted with gross negligence by failing to contact Ms. Archie or the appropriate authorities on the night of Decedent's death.

Co. v. ADT, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177630\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/194/1331/#p1339\">\n    194 F.

Ga. 2016) (finding no extra-contractual duty where plaintiff's property was damaged when defendant failed to properly install a water sensor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As a final attempt to save his claims, Plaintiff argues that this Court should deny Defendant's motion and permit discovery in order to allow Plaintiff the opportunity to fully develop his claim that Defendant ADT owed Decedent Johnson a duty independent of the contract. Plaintiff contends that evidence may come to light as to the whether there were any communications between Defendant ADT and Decedent Johnson on the night of her death that would constitute a voluntary undertaking or give rise to an extra-contractual duty. Although it is impossible to know at this stage whether Defendant did have any communications with Decedent Johnson on the night of her death, this Court will not allow Plaintiff's claims to remain simply to allow Plaintiff to pursue discovery in the hopes that evidence supporting an extra-contractual duty may arise. Plaintiff has failed to establish any evidence of an extra-contractual duty in his complaint and, therefore, any claim based on Defendant's gross negligence must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Fraudulent Misrepresentation Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On a final note, the Court will address Plaintiff's claim that \"Defendant[ ] committed fraudulent misrepresentation when Defendant[ ] failed to contact Ms. Archie on December 10, 2017, ... despite assurances that Ms. Archie would be contacted when the alarm was triggered.\" (Doc. 7 at \u00b6 39.) This Court has already found that this claim is barred by the exculpatory language in the contract signed by Decedent Johnson. Even if the contract in this case did not bar Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim, however, Plaintiff's claim would still fail because it is insufficiently pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 9(b), \"[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" To satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b), \"[p]laintiffs must allege (1) the precise statements, documents, or misrepresentations made; (2) the time, place, and person responsible for the statement; (3) the content and manner in which these statements misled the [p]laintiffs; and (4) what the defendants gained by the alleged fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim fails unless Plaintiff is able to demonstrate that Defendant ADT made the promise with no intention of ever fulfilling the contractual obligation. In the complaint, Plaintiff provides a naked allegation that Defendant ADT had no intention of contacting Ms. Archie in the event that the Decedent's alarm was triggered. (Doc 7 at \u00b6 40.) Other allegations in Plaintiff's own complaint, however, plainly contradict Plaintiff's assertion. According to Plaintiff's own allegations, Defendant ADT intended to fulfill its contractual obligations and actually did so when Defendant ADT contacted Ms. Archie on several prior occasions when the alarm was triggered at Decedent's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Upon review, the Court is unable to reconcile the inconsistencies between Plaintiff's claim that Defendant ADT never intended to comply with its promise to contact Ms. Archie and the facts detailed in the complaint. In this Court's view, these inconsistencies demonstrate that even if Plaintiff\n   was given an opportunity to amend his complaint, Plaintiff would still be unable to establish a viable claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to convince this Court otherwise. Plaintiff has not provided any argument as to why he should be provided with an opportunity to amend his complaint. In his briefing, Plaintiff has made no reference to how his claim can be pled with more particularity or how his claim would survive if given the opportunity to amend. Due to Plaintiff's lack of argument and this own Court's assessment of the complaint, this Court finds that allowing Plaintiff to amend the complaint in this case would be futile. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim for fraudulent misrepresentation is dismissed and Plaintiff will not be given an opportunity to amend his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Remaining Counts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In his complaint, Plaintiff also details various other \"counts.\" These include: Count III for vicarious liability, Count VII for punitive damages, Count VIII for pre-death injury and pain and suffering, and Count XI for wrongful death. (Doc. 7.) Although listed as individual claims, none of these counts constitute an independent cause of action. Instead, these counts are dependent on Plaintiff's other allegations. Because Plaintiff has failed to properly allege any independent claim for relief, Plaintiff's remaining counts also fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Safe Streets, LLC's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 17) is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   and Defendant ADT's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Defendants Safe Streets, LLC, The ADT Corporation, and ADT LLC are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   from this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   SO ORDERED this\n   <em>\n    2\n    <sup>\n     ND\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of May 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    For the purposes of this order, the Court will accept all factual allegations in the amended complaint as true and construe all allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Timson v.

If the Court had concluded that the terms of the contract did not bar these claims, the Court would have still dismissed these claims due to Plaintiff's failure to establish any duty that Defendant ADT owed Decedent Johnson independent of the contract.
