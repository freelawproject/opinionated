ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   came before the Court on Plaintiff, George Bentley's Motion for Remand and Attorney's Fees [ECF No. 12 ], filed February 2, 2019. Defendant, Miami Air International, Inc. filed a Response [ECF No. 13 ], to which Plaintiff filed a Reply [ECF No. 15 ]. The Court has carefully considered the Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1 ], the Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 1-1] 6-10\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), the Removal Status Report [ECF No. 7 ], the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law. For the following reasons, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff used to work for Defendant as a pilot at Defendant's principal place of business in Miami, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 6-8). On December 12, 2018, Plaintiff filed a\n   <strong>\n    one count\n   </strong>\n   Complaint in the Eleventh Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County against Defendant, alleging retaliation in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act (\"FCRA\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 18, 2019, Defendant filed its Notice of Removal, stating the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint under 28 U.S.C. sections 1331\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   1332(a)(1). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal). First, as to federal question jurisdiction under section 1331, Defendant stated \"[b]ecause the Complaint\n   <em>\n    asserts claims under federal law\n   </em>\n   , the Court has original subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [section] 1331.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3 (alterations and emphasis added) ). Second, as to diversity jurisdiction under section 1332(a)(1), Defendant stated Plaintiff \"was no longer\n   residing in Florida\" but was rather \"a resident of Maine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). According to Defendant, because it is a Florida corporation with a principal place of business in Miami, Florida, there is complete diversity between the parties, and removal was appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant then filed a Removal Status Report on January 24, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Removal Status Report). In it, Defendant referred to an earlier action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\") and the FCRA before another judge in this District in case number 16-cv-24607 (the \"Initial Action\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   1). Defendant explained that Plaintiff's claim here arises out of Defendant's retaliatory conduct after Plaintiff filed the Initial Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   2). As for the grounds of removal for this action, Defendant again stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. Federal question. The complaint asserts claims\n   <em>\n    under federal law\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. Diversity Jurisdiction. Plaintiff and Defendant are citizens of different states -- Maine and Florida. Damages calculated from the prior litigation would exceed $ 75,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed the present Motion for Remand, contending the action properly belongs in state court. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.). Plaintiff also seeks attorney's fees and costs, asserting Defendant's removal was objectively unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under 28 U.S.C. section 1447(c), a federal court must remand an action that has been removed from state court if it appears the removal was improper. \"[I]n removal cases, the burden is on the party who sought removal to demonstrate that federal jurisdiction exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirkland v. Midland Mortg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11126836\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/243/1277/\">\n    243 F.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281 n.5 (11th Cir. 2001) (alteration added; citation omitted). Due to federalism concerns, federal courts strictly construe the requirements of removal jurisdiction and remand all cases in which jurisdiction is doubtful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Christenberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142912\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/1290/#p1293\">\n    327 F.3d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1293 (11th Cir. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of S.

The Court thus focuses on jurisdictional facts as they existed when Defendant filed its Notice of Removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531716\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/1092/#p1095\">\n    31 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1097 n.13 (\"Jurisdictional facts are assessed on the basis of plaintiff's complaint as of the time of removal.\" (emphasis and citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties' Briefing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's argument is straightforward. First, Plaintiff contends there is no federal question jurisdiction as a \"cursory review of Plaintiff's Complaint reveals that there are no allegations of or claims brought pursuant to the ADEA or any other federal law; rather, Plaintiff's Complaint includes only a single cause of action under Florida Law.\" (Mot. 2). Next, Plaintiff points out that after he apprised Defendant \"of the impropriety of removal on that basis under the Forum Diversity Rule, Defendant ultimately conceded that this was not a proper basis for removal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nevertheless, Defendant still \"refused to concede [ ] there [was] also no basis for removal based on federal question, despite the fact that the Plaintiff's\n   claim ha[d] been brought solely under state law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning to whether removal based on federal question jurisdiction was proper, Plaintiff's counsel informed Defendant's counsel that no federal law claim was alleged in the Complaint, and that the mere reference to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") charge or previous federal ADEA lawsuit did not create a federal question. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 6-7). Defendant again reiterated its opposition, forcing Plaintiff to file the present Motion to Remand. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its Response, Defendant abandons its conclusory assertion federal question jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. section 1331 through an express claim under federal law made by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 1). Instead, recognizing that Plaintiff only alleges a single claim under\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law, Defendant insists the state-law claim necessarily raises substantial federal issues under the ADEA to confer federal question jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To justify removal, Defendant points to state courts' reliance on federal courts' interpretations of federal discrimination laws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   1). Defendant also asserts the following issues derive \"from a common nucleus of operative facts\" to an ADEA claim: whether Plaintiff complied with the EEOC's administrative procedures and adhered to them prior to filing suit; whether Plaintiff's lawsuit should be allowed considering the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars the suit; whether Defendant was under any obligation to employ Plaintiff after his mandatory retirement at age 65; whether Plaintiff should be barred from filing suit because the retaliatory conduct arose before the Initial Action had concluded; and whether Defendant unlawfully retaliated against Plaintiff in violation of the ADEA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   5-6 (citing cases) ). Defendant contends these are federal questions \"disputed and substantial and will not tilt any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial power.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5 (citing cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Merits of Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Diversity Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court agrees with the parties that under the forum defendant rule, diversity jurisdiction cannot serve as the basis for removal here. Defendant's counsel, for good reason, conceded this fact in an email to Plaintiff's counsel on January 28, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 6). Because Defendant is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Miami, Florida, any removal based on diversity jurisdiction was clearly improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tillman v. R.J.

First, \"a case arises under federal law when federal law creates the cause of action asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Second, \"where a claim finds its origins in state rather than federal law ... [the Supreme Court] has identified a special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n    at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations added; internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In establishing the \"contours of this slim category,\" the Supreme Court has set out a four-element inquiry, each element of which needs to be established before conferring federal question jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: \"(1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial,\n   and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court addresses both possible bases for federal question jurisdiction in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   a. Whether Federal Law Creates the Cause of Action Asserted\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first way federal question jurisdiction may exist can be dispensed with easily here. Defendant concedes the Complaint only alleges one FCRA claim, a state law claim. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp.). That claim evidently does not find its \"origins\" in federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   b. Whether Plaintiff's FCRA Claim Necessarily Depends on Resolution of a Substantial Question of Federal Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second way federal question jurisdiction may be conferred fares no better. In a last-minute effort to salvage its removal, Defendant now asserts a basis never previously referenced -- that Plaintiff's state law claim in his Complaint necessarily raises substantial federal issues. The Court first addresses whether any federal issues are \"necessarily raised,\" and then turns to whether any necessarily raised federal issues are \"substantial\" and \"capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    i.

Fla. 2004) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   An objectively reasonable basis for removal is lacking here. Remarkably, and rather tellingly, Defendant seems to have recognized the error of its removal in its Answer [ECF No. 17 ] filed just last week. In it, Defendant asserts the \"Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of [sic] Plaintiff's [C]omplaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 (alteration added) ). The Court has painstakingly outlined every basis Defendant has asserted to justify removal -- since the filing of the Notice of Removal over a month ago, up until Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Remand. At no point has Defendant supplied an \"at least arguably rational\" basis for removal.\n   <em>\n    In re Trasylol Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268877\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/1331/#p1338\">\n    754 F.Supp.2d 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1338 (S.D. Fla. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, as to Defendant's reliance on diversity jurisdiction for removal, the Court takes notice that Defendant's recognition of the forum defendant rule came after its counsel filed a Notice of Removal and Removal Status Report. In both, Defendant\n   represented that removal was proper because there was complete diversity between the parties and the amount-in-controversy requirement had been met. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Removal Status Report 2). As Defendant now recognizes, this showing is plainly insufficient for removal purposes as Defendant, the removing party, is a Florida citizen. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 1441(b)(2) could not be clearer: \"A civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title\n   <em>\n    may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought\n   </em>\n   .\" 28 U.S.C. section 1441(b)(2) (emphasis added). Because Defendant is a Florida corporation with a principal place of business in Miami, Florida, Defendant is a Florida citizen and removal from Florida state court was clearly improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, with respect to Defendant's assertion of federal question jurisdiction, the Court again looks to the remarkably inaccurate claims Defendant made\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff filed his Motion to Remand. In its Notice of Removal, Defendant first asserted \"[b]ecause the Complaint\n   <em>\n    asserts claims under federal law\n   </em>\n   , the Court has original subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [section] 1331.\" (Notice of Removal \u00b6 3 (alterations and emphasis added) ). Of course, and as noted, Plaintiff's single claim arises under the FCRA, a claim stemming from Florida state law. At best, Defendant made a typographical error in filing its Notice of Removal. At worst, Defendant was entirely unaware that the one claim in Plaintiff's Complaint arose under\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Regrettably, Defendant doubled-down on this factually incorrect assertion in its Removal Status Report. As the basis for federal question jurisdiction, Defendant stated the \"complaint asserts claims under federal law.\" (Removal Status Report 2). Again, this was either a careless submission, or a disregard for the actual allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint. Neither scenario tilts in favor of objective reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, as to Defendant's newest assertion that Plaintiff's FCRA claim necessarily raises substantial federal issues, the Court notes Defendant has pointed to\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   authority where a state-law analogue to the FCRA alone supported federal question jurisdiction. To the contrary, courts have rather\n   <em>\n    uniformly\n   </em>\n   deferred to plaintiffs who have exclusively alleged state-law claims in the employment discrimination context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hooten v.

Defendant's claim that\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   federal questions are\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   subsumed within a state-law claim for retaliatory conduct against a former employer is thus objectively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant's sole argument against the imposition of attorney's fees is that removal is only improper if \"diversity is the sole basis for removal.\" (Resp. 5). As noted, however, that the forum defendant rule applies where an action is removed \"solely\" based on diversity jurisdiction is of no\n   moment considering federal question jurisdiction is also absent here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, every basis Defendant has offered for the existence of subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Complaint is without merit. Removal was objectively unreasonable from the beginning. The Court thus grants Plaintiff's request for an award of attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens v.
