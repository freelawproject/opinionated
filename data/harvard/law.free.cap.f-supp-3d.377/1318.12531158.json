Frank, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This cause is before the court on the defendant's \"Motion for Reconsideration/Objection to Sentence.\" (Doc. 28). For the reasons set forth below, this court denies the motion and overrules the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 12, 2018, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida charged defendant Charles F. Leekley (\"Leekley\"), in a two-count information. Count one charged Leekley with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or controlled substance, in violation of Section 316.193 of the Florida Statutes, and Title 18, United States Code, Sections 7 and 13. Count two charged him with driving a motor vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit, in violation of Section 316.183, Florida Statutes, and Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 634.25. (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 12, 2018, Leekley and his attorney appeared for a change of plea hearing. The government orally moved to amend count one of the information to charge Leekley with careless driving, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20316.1925\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court granted the motion to amend. Count two was not amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the plea hearing, Leekley was advised of the maximum penalties of the\n   charged offenses. Specifically, this court advised Leekley that count one carried the following maximum penalties: (1) thirty days of imprisonment; (2) a fine of $ 5,000; (3) five years of probation; and (4) a $ 5 special assessment. When asked if he understood that these were the maximum penalties, Leekley replied in the affirmative. Leekley's attorney likewise confirmed that she had advised Leekley that he faced these penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the plea hearing, Leekley's attorney did not object or claim that this court erroneously stated the maximum penalties. Rather, Leekley's attorney simply requested that the court not incarcerate Leekley and instead impose only a fine. The government concurred in this request. This court reminded Leekley that, regardless of his attorney and the government's request, this court could impose any sentence that did not exceed the maximum penalties set by statute and regulation. Leekley indicated that he understood this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the plea hearing, the government orally stated the facts that it was prepared to prove in the event the case proceeded to trial. Among other things, the government noted that it could establish that, on or about November 23, 2017, police officers observed Leekley failing to maintain his lane while traveling \"at a high rate of speed.\" When the officers paced Leekley's car, Leekley was driving approximately 58 miles per hour in a zone which had a posted speed limit of 45 miles per hour. Under oath, Leekley agreed that the material facts stated by the government were accurate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leekley pleaded guilty to the offenses as orally amended by the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Leekley pleaded guilty, this court inquired whether the parties desired a presentence investigation report or whether Leekley desired to be sentenced that day. The parties indicated that they did not believe that the preparation of a presentence investigation report was useful, and Leekley's attorney indicated that Leekley desired to be sentenced that day. This court provided Leekley and his attorney an opportunity to address this court. Leekley's attorney requested that this court not incarcerate Leekley because that would jeopardize his career as a merchant mariner. She suggested that a fine would be sufficient punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A pretrial services report was provided to the parties and this court. That report indicated that Leekley had the following history:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-18\"><strong>Date of Arrest</strong> <strong>Agency</strong> <strong>Charge</strong> <strong>Disposition</strong> 05/15/2005 Hennepin County Cts. 1&amp;2: Driving 03/02/2009: (Age 41) S.O.

After this court noted that it would be imposing a sentence consistent with the factors set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), this court imposed the following sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Count One: one year of probation with various special conditions (including attendance of DUI school and a victim impact panel); a fine of $ 200; and a mandatory $ 5 special assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Count Two: a fine of $ 100; and a mandatory $ 5 special assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After this sentence was imposed, this court inquired whether Leekley objected to either the entry of the plea or the sentence imposed. Leekley's attorney responded that Leekley had no objection. More specifically, neither Leekley nor his attorney objected to the term of probation imposed by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 18, 2018, the judgment was entered. (Doc. 27). On December 20, 2018, Leekley filed a \"Motion for Reconsideration/Objection to Sentence.\" (Doc. 28). As discussed below, Leekley argues that the sentence imposed by this court was unlawful insofar as it entailed a term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

App'x 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (11th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Leekley implicitly argues that, although section 3561(a) is generally applicable to federal convictions, it does not apply to his case because the assimilating regulation does not explicitly mention that a term of probation was authorized. (Doc. 28 at \u00b6 4). But that argument fails for a number of reasons. First, this court was unable to find any federal statute or regulation defining a criminal offense that also explicitly states that courts are authorized to impose a term of probation. Rather, in criminal statutes, Congress sets forth a maximum term of imprisonment and a maximum fine. Federal criminal statutes that define crimes are silent as to whether a term of probation is authorized, although a few specifically state that probation is not authorized. This makes perfect sense in light of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203561\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and its precursor. Because \u00a7 3561 is a statute of general applicability, noting in every criminal statute that a term of probation is authorized simply would be redundant. It is already understood that the generally-applicable statutes authorizing terms of probation, terms of supervised release, and special assessments apply to all crimes unless Congress specifically states otherwise. Because generally-applicable statutes address these subjects, there is no reason to repeat this in every statute and regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, when Congress wants to preclude courts from imposing a term of probation, it does not do so\n   <em>\n    sub silentio.\n   </em>\n   Rather, it explicitly informs federal courts that they are not authorized to impose a term of probation. For example, in section 841(b)(1)(A) of Title 21 of the United States Code, Congress specifically stated: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence of any person sentenced under this subparagraph.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), \u00a7 960(b)(1), \u00a7 960(b)(2), and \u00a7 960(b)(3) of Title 21, Congress used this same language to preclude courts from imposing sentences that would entail a term of probation.
