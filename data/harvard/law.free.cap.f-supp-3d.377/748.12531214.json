Detective Ferguson was being investigated, but was not fired for his perjury and misconduct until after petitioner's trial. After the detective had been discharged, the Oakland County Prosecutor dismissed sixteen cases involving Detective Ferguson. The record reflects that Mark Ferguson also withheld information pertaining to the background of his confidential informant. It is petitioner's contention that this evidence of corruption on the part of Detective Mark Ferguson in the performance of his duties would have affected the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and undermine confidence in the verdict. The Court grants relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Petitioner's trial began on February 6, 2012, and continued on February 7, 2012, when testimony was provided by the three (3) prosecution witnesses, ending with closing arguments and the verdict presented by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Michael Zion, the informant, testified that he contacted Detective Mark Ferguson in early January 2011, to try to obtain leniency involving a pending retail fraud charge, in exchange for providing information regarding drug trafficking in the City of Pontiac, Michigan. (T. 2/7/2012, pp. 28-29). Zion, however, informed Ferguson that he only knew one individual named \"Marc,\" from whom he could buy drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49). Zion further testified that he did not use drugs when he contacted Ferguson and did not use drugs prior to picking up the retail fraud charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The record reflects that Zion had a phone number for \"Marc,\" without explanation as to how it was obtained. Zion testified that he contacted \"Marc\" a few times after he spoke with Ferguson, but before the first controlled buy. The remainder of Zion's testimony pertains to the details of each of the controlled drug transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Detective Mark Ferguson testified that he was contacted by Michael Zion at his office in Pontiac, in the early part of January 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . pp. 82-83, 102). He did not make a determination if Zion was a user or if he could sell drugs on the street. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 102). However, Ferguson did conduct a background check. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102-103). The remainder of Ferguson's testimony, as follows, is consistent with Zion's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ferguson testified that the first controlled buy occurred on January 26, 2011, at a BP gas station, where Zion was wired, searched, and given money to purchase $ 300.00 worth of cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   pp. 83-87). Ferguson also testified that \"I told other officers, undercover officers where the deal was going to take place, they -- they\n   usually go in front of me, before me, set up in the area to get a good eye on us going in.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   p. 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   All subsequent buys occurred at the 456 Montana address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second controlled buy took place the following day on January 27, 2011. Zion was wired, searched, and provided with $ 600.00 to purchase cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 89-91). Ferguson testified, \"I met up with Mr. Zion prior to, the deal was already set up, through him and Mr. Kelley to purchase cocaine, I then instructed other officers to go in the area of Montana Street, I searched Mr. Zion, searched his vehicle, gave him the recording device, a live recording device.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the third controlled buy, which took place on January 28, 2011, Zion was again wired, searched, and provided this time with $ 2400.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84-91). Ferguson also testified that he sent other undercover officers to the 456 Montana address prior to the third controlled buy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92). Ferguson testified that at some point \"[Zion] exited, got back in his vehicle, he then called me on the phone, stated Mr. Kelley told him to go around the corner to the store to get some razor blades.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The fourth controlled buy occurred on February 3, 2011. Ferguson testified that he doubled the $ 2400.00 amount, but then decreased his request when Marc started acting \"weird.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 95). Ferguson also testified that he had debriefed his officers because he had intended to arrest petitioner following this drug buy. It was during this drug buy that Zion was thrown against a wall and searched. It was also during the fourth drug buy that Zion exited the front of the house to go to the store to buy cigarettes (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96-97, 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In summary, Ferguson testified that he obtained 120 grams of cocaine from the four (4) controlled buys, by providing approximately $ 5000,00 in funds during the controlled buys. Ferguson further testified that this, in his experience, was a large amount of cocaine and was not for personal use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   99). Based on the amount of cocaine, Ferguson classified petitioner as \"a mid-level drug dealer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The prosecution called Rachel Topacio as their third and final witness. Ms. Topacio testified that she is \"a forensic chemist, with the Oakland County Sheriff's Office, in the forensic lab.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119). Topacio testified that she tested each of the four substances and the results of each tested substance contained the presence of cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124-128). No other witnesses were called at petitioner's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Following the trial, and before sentencing, petitioner filed a motion for a new trial. Among his claims, he alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for not contacting and calling the ex-girlfriend of the informant Michael Zion. The record references a letter sent by Zion's former girlfriend to petitioner a few days before trial, asking for petitioner's help in a matter pending in another court. She is also the mother of Zion's child. The girlfriend indicated in her letter that although she does not know petitioner, she wanted to express her sympathy as to his situation. She wrote that Zion \"turned into a snitch 3 years ago to get off a felony, and possession charge,\" and indicated that Zion was a crack user. ECF 5-5 PgID.430, 5-8 PgID.751-752,. Defense counsel informed the court that petitioner provided the letter to his trial counsel, but counsel failed to file any witness list before trial. ECF 5-5 PgID.431.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court judge denied the motion for a new trial finding that the evidence against petitioner was substantial and there was not a reasonable probability that absent trial counsel's errors, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 434-435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Petitioner filed a motion for relief from judgment on February 17, 2015, with several attachments, alleging that appellate counsel was ineffective by refusing to raise the issue that Detective Mark Ferguson provided false testimony at his trial. ECF 5-9, PgId.916.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court judge rejected his claim finding that \"appellate counsel opined that Officer Ferguson's [firing by the Oakland County Sheriff's Department] would not benefit defendant because defendant's case was based largely on a confidential informant's testimony that he purchased drugs from defendant and was not based exclusively on Officer Ferguson's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Ferguson,\n   </em>\n   11-236105-FH, Slip. Op. at *2-3 (Oakland County Circuit Court Jan. 5, 2016). The trial court then found that \"there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant even without Officer Ferguson's testimony and defendant has not shown any false testimony by Officer Ferguson, defendant has not shown that he was prejudiced by appellate counsel's failure to raise the credibility issue on appeal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The trial judge did not expressly adjudicate petitioner's underlying claim involving the newly discovered impeachment evidence involving Detective Ferguson's discharge from employment and the subsequent dismissal of sixteen of his cases by the Oakland County Prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In his habeas petition, petitioner provided a detailed account in support of his claim that the prosecution used perjured testimony from Ferguson to convict him of the underlying charges. (ECF 1, PgID.39-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Respondent concedes that \"In January 2013, Det. Ferguson was fired from the Oakland County Sheriff's Department for lying at a preliminary examination (not Kelley's preliminary examination) about opening a package of marijuana before obtaining a search warrant. After he was fired, the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office reviewed 100 cases Ferguson had been involved with, including Kelley's case. In 16 of those cases (not including Kelley's case) the prosecutor found that there was not evidence independent of Ferguson's testimony to support the charges, and the prosecutor voluntarily dismissed those cases. In the rest of the cases, the charges were not dismissed-Kelley's case in particular was not dismissed because Michael Zion's testimony supported the charges.\" (Respondent's Answer, ECF 4, PgID.82-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Petitioner contends that his newly discovered evidence only came to light at the time petitioner sent his court-appointed lawyer a letter on January 31, 2013, which indicated that Detective Ferguson had been investigated and fired for falsifying evidence. His court-appointed appellate counsel informed petitioner that he did not intend to take any action regarding the development with Ferguson and told petitioner that he was free to act on his own behalf to seek a remedy. Petitioner, was only able to fully develop this claim in his post-conviction motion for relief from judgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Respondent contends that petitioner's fourth claim is procedurally defaulted, because the trial judge ruled that petitioner failed to show good cause and prejudice for not raising this claim on his direct appeal, as required by M.C.R. 6.508(D)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Petitioner filed a Standard 4 Brief on his appeal of right claiming that Ferguson provided false testimony, but was unaware of the specific misconduct that would support his claim. The supporting evidence of Detective Ferguson's testimony was not available until after petitioner filed his appeal of right. Petitioner's appellate counsel filed an appeal brief containing one (1) claim pertaining to the sufficiency of the evidence. Petitioner filed a Standard 4\n   Brief containing the following four (4) issues: trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor referencing the audio recordings, trial counsel's failure to investigate and call a potential witness [Zion's former girlfriend], trial counsel's lack of communication, and the misconduct of the chief investigating officer compounded by the prosecutor's misconduct. In his brief, petitioner argued that \"[A] review of the entire record in the instant case supports facts that the prosecution witnesses were not truthful about Michael Zion's informant status; that the record clearly shows a significant amount of missing evidence which suggests that Michael Zion was indeed a paid informant contrary to what is stated on the record.\" (Standard 4 Brief, p. 16, ECF 5-7, PgID.570).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   When the state courts clearly and expressly rely on a valid state procedural bar, federal habeas review is also barred unless petitioner can demonstrate \"cause\" for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged constitutional violation, or can demonstrate that failure to consider the claim will result in a \"fundamental miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

However, without the identification testimony of Detective Ferguson, the prosecution could not prove the identity of petitioner to support the first drug charge.

[prosecutor]: Okay. At some point did Mr. Zion exit that home?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. He did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. Okay. What happened then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. He exited, got back in his vehicle, he then called me on the phone, stated Mr. Kelley told him to go around the corner to the store to get some razor blades.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The affidavit in support of the search warrant provided to the circuit court is inconsistent with Ferguson's trial testimony. It is also inconsistent with the section that pertains to his confidential informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Section 4 (D) of the sworn affidavit reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (D) During a period of time covering over 1 year, informant has purchased narcotics and dangerous drugs over 20 times. As a result of the purchases made by the informant, five search warrants have been issued by judges of the 50th District Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The informant, Michael Zion, testified that he contacted Ferguson to offer information pertaining to buying drugs. He said that he could provide information on one individual who sold drugs. Zion also testified that he did not do drugs before his contact with Ferguson or thereafter. He testified that his motive for contacting Ferguson was simply to obtain leniency on a retail fraud charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In closing argument, the prosecution portrayed this informant as an individual looking for assistance on a shoplifting charge, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Now, yes, an informant is someone who engaged and helped police not because he wanted to be a good citizen but because he wanted some help on his own shoplifting case, that's true, that does not take away from his credibility when he testified today, however.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   You don't have to like an informant, you don't have to like Michael Zion to find the defendant guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (T. 2/7/12, p. 139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The prosecutor later made the following remarks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Now, Mr. Taylor talked a lot about credibility and that's an instruction and I want you to pay particular attention to that jury instruction and I want you also to recall the demeanor Mr. Zion exhibited when he testified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Yes, he was shaky, yes, he was nervous, he was working off a shoplifting charge and he got himself wrapped in prosecuting a mid-level drug dealer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Ask him if he'd do it again, he'd probably say no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Can't blame him, he probably didn't want to be here, you could tell but he was very straight forward with his answers, he didn't try to hide anything about this background.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   He told us the truth to every single question that was asked of him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The testimony provided by Detective Mark Ferguson at trial, and his affidavit in support of the search warrant are inconsistent as to Zion's motive in testifying at petitioner's trial and his relationship with Detective Ferguson. Ferguson's trial testimony is further exacerbated by the comments made by the prosecutor who portrayed Zion as an individual attempting to gain leniency on a retail fraud charge. The prosecutor went so far as to say to the jury, \"Ask him if he'd do it again, he'd probably say no.\" The signed affidavit in support of Ferguson's search warrant describes his informant as having \"purchased narcotics and dangerous drugs over 20 times. As a result of the purchases made by the informant, five search warrants have been issued by judges of the 50th District Court.\" ECF 5-8, PgID.837. The prosecutor's comment and characterization of Zion's nervousness stemming from \"he was working off a shoplifting charge and he got himself wrapped in prosecuting a mid-level drug dealer,\" would not be consistent with the sworn affidavit in support of the search warrant which described the informant as having experience in 20 drug buys which resulted in 5 search warrants. When added to the newly discovered evidence of Ferguson's misconduct, this Court finds that presentation of the additional evidence would be sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Respondent contends that the testimony of the informant, Michael Zion was sufficient, without the testimony of Ferguson, to sustain the convictions. This Court had already found that the identification evidence needed to sustain the first drug buy was provided by Detective Ferguson and without his testimony, the conviction cannot stand. In regards to the subsequent drug buys, the credibility of the informant, Michael Zion, is questionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Petitioner attached to his Standard 4 Brief on his direct appeal a letter sent from Zion's ex-girlfriend. This is the same letter referenced in petitioner's motion for a new trial. ECF 5-8, PgID.752. This letter suggests that Zion was a drug user with a long standing informant relationship with the police. This calls into question Zion's testimony that he had no prior dealings with narcotics and was simply trying to get out from under a retail fraud charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   A review of the entire record brings into question the credibility of the informant, Michael Zion, who testified that he did not use drugs and that he simply contacted Detective Ferguson to gain leniency on a retail fraud charge. This testimony was also emphasized by the prosecution in closing argument. Due to the newly discovered evidence of Detective Mark Ferguson's perjury and firing from the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, and credibility issues in connection with the informant Michael Zion, this Court finds that had the jury been presented with evidence that Detective Ferguson had been fired from the Sheriff's Department for committing perjury and that the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office had subsequently dismissed sixteen cases in which Detective Ferguson was the officer in charge of the case, there is a great probability of a different outcome to petitioner's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The fact that the Oakland County Prosecutor may have been unaware of Detective Mark Ferguson's perjury is not dispositive of whether a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation occurred nor would it relieve other agents\n   of the State from disclosing the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Brady's\n   </em>\n   obligation to disclose also applies to exculpatory evidence that is known only to the police, but withheld from the prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kyles v.

In that prosecution for being a felon in possession of a firearm, a Detroit Police officer testified that he saw the defendant toss a gun during a pursuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 882. The day after this officer testified, the Detroit Police Department suspended the officer during the course of an investigation into claims that the officer falsified police reports in weapons cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officer was subsequently criminally charged, but acquitted. This officer was not the only law-enforcement witness who testified to seeing the defendant with a gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 883. Despite the fact that the government was unaware of the investigation,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 884, Judge Lawson found a\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   violation because the officer knew of his own suspension and the pending investigation into his misconduct and that information\n   undermining his credibility would damage the case.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 885.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Finally, Judge Arthur J. Tarnow of this district recently granted habeas relief on a similar claim, finding that evidence that the officer in charge's corrupt activities, could be imputed to the prosecutor's office, for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , because the officer was a key part of the prosecution team who was in charge of the investigation and actually sat at the table with the prosecution at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGowan v.

Evidence that Detective Ferguson had committed perjury in another case, and that the prosecutor had dismissed a number of cases involving Detective Ferguson, could have been used to significantly impeach the detective's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The only other witness called to testify as to the drug transactions was Michael Zion. His credibility is also questionable. Having reviewed the entire record, the Court finds that the verdict can be brought into question in light of the testimony provided by both of the prosecution witnesses that testified as to the drug transactions. Although other officers were referenced by Ferguson, their existence and roles are questionable, as they were not called to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Therefore, the Court will order the State of Michigan to either (1) set a new trial date that is within ninety days of entry of this order, which is to be conducted in accordance with the conditions stated in this opinion, or (2) release petitioner unconditionally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.
