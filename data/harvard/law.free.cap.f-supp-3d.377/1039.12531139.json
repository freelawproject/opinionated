FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 16, 2013, Plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff brings six causes of action alleging Defendants violated NEPA, the NFMA, the APA, and the ESA when they approved the Bagley Hazard Tree Abatement Project (hereinafter \"the Project\"). (ECF No. 1.) The Project was put in place in response to the August 2012, Bagley Fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (hereinafter \"Forest\"). (ECF No. 79-3 at 3, 5.) Roughly 46,000 acres burned, with some areas lightly burned and other areas more severely burned. (ECF No. 79-3 at 3.) Approximately 30% of the burned land was privately owned and 70% was publicly owned. (ECF No. 79-3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Shasta-Trinity National Forest administers land within the Bagley Fire footprint. (EA at 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) Ninety-five miles of road within this area experienced variable degrees of fire severity and associated tree mortality. (EA at 1.) Fire-killed snags and defective trees damaged by the fire pose a danger to those traversing the roads within the area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (EA at 1.) These weakened trees remain standing for a relatively short time period before falling. (EA at 1.) Defendant Forest Service closed almost all the roads in the fire area immediately after the Bagley Fire. (Forest Service Closure Order 14-12-02, Shasta-Trinity National Forest Bagley Fire Emergency Closure (U.S.D.A. 2012), https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/stnf/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5443633\n   &amp;width=full (hereinafter \"Bagley Closure Order\").) However, service personnel and fire fighters continue to access the roads to perform their jobs. (Bagley Closure Order.) Private landowners with easements continue to access their inholdings within the fire area. (Bagley Closure Order.) These individuals are exempt from the closure and continue to use the roads despite the hazards. (Bagley Closure Order.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant Forest Service devised the Project to increase the safe use of the National Forest Transportation System within the area burned by the Bagley Fire. (EA at 1;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Project has three objectives: (1) retain open roads on the forest transportation system that will be needed for future activities such as forest health projects, timber management, fire protection, recreational use and management, and wildlife management; (2) meet contractual and legal obligations including cost-share agreements under the Forest Road and Trail Act Easements\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (3) quickly recover the monetary value of wood through salvage and sale, where feasible and appropriate, to offset the cost to the public while reducing excessive fuel loading. (EA at 2.) To meet those objectives, Defendant Forest Service proposed three tasks: (1) identify and fell hazard trees along 95 miles of open National Forest Service roads that have lost their structural integrity and are likely to fall uncontrolled, jeopardizing public safety and the transportation system (5,430 acres); (2) salvage higher concentrations of felled trees along nineteen segmented miles of National Forest Service roads (776 acres)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (3) treat\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   activity-created fuels in excess of ten tons per acre (woody material less than or equal to nine inches in diameter). (EA at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In March 2013, Defendant Forest Service began the regulatory process under NEPA and the ESA in an effort to authorize the Project. (ECF No. 79-3 \u00b6 2.) In June 2013, Defendant Forest Service requested public comment, and in July 2013 Defendant Forest Service issued a Draft EA. (ECF No. 79-3 \u00b6 2.) On July 18, 2013, the Forest Service Chief granted an Emergency Situation Determination (hereinafter \"ESD\"), allowing implementation of the sale of timber to begin immediately following public notice of the decision. (ESD, AR at 8784.) Defendant Forest Service advertised the available timber, but did not receive any interested parties between 2013 and 2016. (ECF No. 79-1 at 9.) Defendant Forest Service issued a BA on July 22, 2013, and in response Defendant Fish and Wildlife Service issued a Concurrence Letter\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   on August 23, 2013. (ECF No. 79-3 \u00b6 2.) On August 2, 2013, Plaintiff submitted comments on the Draft EA. (ECF No. 79-3 \u00b6 2.) On August 29, 2013, Defendant Forest Service issued a Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact (hereinafter \"DN/FONSI\"). (ECF No. 79-3 \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 16, 2013, Plaintiff filed a complaint, alleging the Project posed a\n   threat to the Northern Spotted Owl (hereinafter \"NSO\") and its habitat. (ECF No. 1.) The NSO is listed as threatened under the ESA. (EA at 43.) Surveys from the 1990s, 2011, and 2012 revealed at least one NSO activity center within the Project area. (EA at 44-45.) Results of post-fire surveys were not available at the time the EA was finalized. (EA at 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants brought a motion to dismiss, alleging Plaintiff's claims were barred because Plaintiff failed to exhaust available and statutorily-mandated administrative remedies (ECF No. 15-1 at 1 ), which the Court denied (ECF No. 25 ). The Court determined Plaintiff's claims were not barred because the ESD allowed the logging project to be implemented immediately, depriving Plaintiff of the opportunity to appeal. (ECF No. 25 at 8 ; ESD, AR at 8784.) Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (ECF No. 50 ), which the Court also denied (ECF No. 66 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 21, 2016, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. (EFC No. 70.) On January 6, 2017, Defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment. (EFC No. 79.) The Court has carefully considered the arguments raised by both parties' briefing. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is DENIED. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff makes two primary arguments in its motion for summary judgment: (1) Defendant Forest Service violated NEPA; and (2) Defendants violated the ESA. (ECF No. 77.) The motion for summary judgment includes four claims: (1) Defendant Forest Service failed to disclose or analyze the cumulative effects of the Project in combination with private lands logging, as required by NEPA (ECF No. 77 at 10 ); (2) under NEPA, Defendant Forest Service was required to prepare an EIS because the environmental effects of the Project may be significant (ECF No. 77 at 20 ); (3) Defendant Forest Service failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives, as required by NEPA (ECF No. 77 at 28 ); and (4) Defendant Fish and Wildlife Service issued an arbitrary and capricious concurrence letter in violation of the ESA (ECF No. 77 at 29 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response, Defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 79.) Defendants raised five arguments in the cross motion for summary judgment: (1) Defendants considered the effects of private salvage operations, satisfying NEPA's requirement to consider cumulative impacts (ECF No. 79-1 at 12 ); (2) the environmental effects of the Project are minimal so an EIS was not required under NEPA (ECF No. 79-1 at 23 ); (3) Defendant Forest Service considered a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project, as required by NEPA (ECF No. 79-1 at 29 ); (4) Defendant Fish and Wildlife Service's concurrence letter considered the best available science, as required by the ESA (ECF No. 79-1 at 31 ); and (5) no injunction can be issued because Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate an injunction is required (ECF No. 79-1 at 37 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will first address\n   the NEPA claims, then address the ESA claim. The Court will then address Defendants' argument regarding Plaintiff's NFMA claim that was raised in the original complaint but not addressed by Plaintiff at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether Defendant Forest Service adhered to the procedural requirements of NEPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff argues Defendant Forest Service violated NEPA for three reasons: (1) Defendant Forest Service was required to prepare an EIS because the Project may have a significant impact on the environment due to the alleged cumulative impacts of private logging projects (ECF No. 77 at 20 ); (2) Defendant Forest Service was required to prepare an EIS due to the alleged effects of the Project on special land designations (ECF No. 77 at 23 ); and (3) Defendant Forest Service failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives (ECF No. 77 at 28 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant Forest Service responds that the Project will not have a significant impact on the environment. Specifically, Defendant Forest Service brings three arguments in its cross motion for summary judgment: (1) agencies incorporated the cumulative effects of private logging operations into the environmental analysis (ECF No. 79-1 at 12 ); (2) an EIS was not required because the environmental effects of the Project are minimal (including an assertion that treatment on special land designations does not mandate an EIS) (ECF 79-1 at 23); and (3) Defendant Forest Service considered a reasonable range of alternatives (ECF No. 79-1 at 29 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court will address the parties' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    i. Whether the Project may have a significant impact on the environment due to the alleged cumulative effects of private logging activities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff alleges an EIS was required because the Project may have a significant impact on the environment due to the alleged cumulative impacts of private logging and salvage. (ECF No. 77 at 9-11.) Plaintiff argues Defendant Forest Service inadequately considered the cumulative effects of private logging and salvage operations. (ECF No. 77 at 11.) In opposition, Defendant Forest Service argues that the BA and EA considered cumulative impacts of private logging activities within the analysis area. (ECF No. 79-1 at 12.) Defendant Forest Service argues that only after appropriate consideration, the agency concluded the Project would not have a significant impact on the environment. (ECF No. 79-1 at 12.) In Defendant Forest Service's cross-motion for summary judgment, the agency argues this Court should deny relief for Plaintiff on the basis that Defendant Forest Service considered the effects of private salvage operations. (ECF No. 79-1 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that an EIS must be prepared when \"substantial questions are raised whether a project may have a significant effect upon the human environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Found.

Plaintiff alleges Defendant Forest Service failed to acknowledge\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   effects of private lands logging on NSO critical habitat. (ECF No. 77 at 11-13.) However, Defendant Forest Service clearly determined private land would be logged.

Further, the BA states, \"[T]his is likely a conservative approach and probably underestimates the amount of NSO habitat available.\" (BA at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, Defendant Forest Service may prove that there are not significant impacts on the environment, satisfying NEPA, by aggregating the cumulative effects of past projects into an environmental baseline, against which the incremental impact of a proposed project is measured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ecology Ctr. v.

Plaintiff argues Defendant Forest Service could have evaluated an action alternative that enters a smaller percentage of the fire-affected area while still satisfying the purpose of and need for the Project. (ECF No. 77 at 29.) However, both action alternatives are estimated to affect 17% of the burned area affected by\n   <em>\n    high-severity\n   </em>\n   fire, which is substantially less than 17% of the entire burned area at any fire severity level. (BA at 26.) Defendant Forest Service considered reducing the distance from the road used to classify hazard trees, effectively reducing the number of acres treated. (EA at 29.) Ultimately, Defendant Forest Service elected to use the Hazard Tree Guidelines, Forest Service Health and Safety Code Handbook, and OSHA guidelines for logging operations to determine which trees pose hazards.

Plaintiff does not argue this claim in its motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 77 ), nor does Plaintiff respond to Defendants' arguments in Defendants' cross motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81 ).

In its complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the Forest Service is required by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Plan to manage threatened and endangered species under existing recovery plans. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 102.) Plaintiff has failed to establish ways in which Defendants failed to abide by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Plan, and thus the NFMA. Because Plaintiff fails to establish facts demonstrating a failure to comply with the Forest Plan Standards &amp; Guidelines in Plaintiff's filings, Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 77 ; ECF No. 81.)
