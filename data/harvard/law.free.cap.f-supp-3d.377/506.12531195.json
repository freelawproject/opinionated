UPMC Concise Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"UPMC CSUMF\") \u00b6\u00b6 1 &amp; 2. Premier provides cost containment services to workers' compensation insurers and third party administrative (\"TPA\") service providers in twenty-one (21) states including Pennsylvania. Am.

The services provided by Premier include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) Medical Bill Review and Repricing - Preferred Provider Organization (\"PPO\") discount network access, electronic data interface (\"EDI\") transfer services, and the issuance of savings reports to clients on a monthly, quarterly, and/or annual basis;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) Physical Therapy (\"PT\") and Diagnostic (\"MRI\") discount network access - Scheduling of all PT/MRI appointments, verification and tracking of attendance for all appointments, PT utilization review services, obtaining all PT treatment notes and MRI imaging reports, tracking PT appointments and treatment compliance, issuance of detailed PT utilization reports for all active and discharged patients as well as PT outcomes by body part on a monthly, quarterly, and/or annual basis and the issuance of network savings reports to clients on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) Panel Development - Investigation and vetting of potential panel providers for qualifications, licensing, and quality of care, providing ongoing panel maintenance, panel implementation, and verification of the accuracy of the panel provider information of all panels every six months and/or when demographic (address, phone number, etc.) changes occur, providing customer service and receiving feedback regarding client satisfaction with all PCS services through the use of written customer surveys;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (4) Injury Management - Scheduling of all physician, PT and MRI appointments for managed panel clients, obtaining work status information after every appointment and forwarding it to adjuster and/or employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 10; Premier Resp. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   UPMC BMS (d/b/a WorkPartners) is a licensed TPA in Pennsylvania that originally began providing workers' compensation TPA services to UPMC entities in 1997, and later began providing workers' compensation TPA (and other) services to other public and private employers. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 40. UPMC HB (d/b/a WorkPartners) is licensed to provide workers' compensation insurance in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and began selling workers' compensation insurance in Pennsylvania in 2010. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 42 &amp; 43. WorkPartners uses vendors to provide\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   medical bill repricing and panel generation services to its clients. MCMC Concise Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"MCMC CSUMF\") \u00b6 5. Both UPMC BMS and UPMC HB are wholly\n   owned subsidiaries of UPMC. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Medical bill review and repricing is the process by which a company reviews medical bills to ensure there are no errors in the billing and to reduce provider charges. Bills from healthcare providers for services rendered to workers' compensation claimants are reviewed to assure the providers' documentation supports their billed charges, and billed charges in excess of the amounts allowed under the appropriate state's workers' compensation fee schedule are disallowed and reduced accordingly. The repricing company then reprices the bill and generates Explanation of Reimbursement (\"EOR\") forms which reflect the providers' billed charges, workers' compensation fee schedule reductions, medical bill review reductions, PPO discounts, and amounts payable to the provider. The repricing company transmits the EORs to their clients and the clients remit payment to the providers with copies of the EORs. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 15; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6 2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Premier performs repricing services for clients in Pennsylvania and twenty-one (21) states outside of Pennsylvania, according to the workers' compensation laws and fee schedules of those states, including the states with the largest volume, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Ohio, and Utah. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 19. Premier has a PPO network access contract with the Coventry Health Care (\"Coventry\") workers' compensation PPO network, which is the largest such network in the nation. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 16. Premier also accesses the Prime Health Services Network (\"Prime\") PPO, located in Brentwood, Tennessee, which includes more than 700,000 medical service providers throughout the United States. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 17. In 2014, approximately 6.84% of Premier's overall revenue was derived from its medical bill review and repricing services. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MCMC provides medical bill review and repricing services to, among other types of customers, workers' compensation insurers, workers' compensation TPA services providers and self-insured employers. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 53. Medical bill review and repricing services for UPMC WorkPartners have always been provided by MCMC, except that Premier provided bill review and repricing for four (4) of WorkPartners' TPA clients relevant here: (1) the City of Pittsburgh; (2) Port Authority of Allegheny County; (3) Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and (4) Allegheny County. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 55; Premier Resp. \u00b6 55; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9 &amp; 10. MCMC is not a panel provider and has provided no panel generation services to WorkPartners. MCMC CSUMF \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Though WorkPartners contends that it does not engage in or sell medical bill review and repricing services of workers' compensation medical bills, UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 48, Premier contends that WorkPartners bundles services in their TPA bids to include repricing services. Premier Resp. \u00b6 48. In that regard, WorkPartners does not give the employer the option to carve out the repricing services to an independent repricing vendor such as Premier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With regard to Premier's physical therapy and diagnostic network, Premier entered into direct discount contracts with a large number of outpatient healthcare providers who render services in the fields of physical therapy and diagnostic imaging (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   MRI and CT). UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 23. These direct contract relationships form what Premier called its \"PT Network\" and \"MRI Network\" which is also referred to as its \"PT/MRI Network.\" UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 24. Premier has the largest and most extensive PT/MRI network in Pennsylvania,\n   containing over 995 PT providers and 265 diagnostic imaging providers across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Panel development and maintenance, as practiced by Premier, is the process by which Premier develops functional and customized panel listings of healthcare providers to be utilized by employees who incur work-related injuries and illnesses. Premier assists the employer to implement a panel in compliance with Pennsylvania's Workers' Compensation Act and to understand the proper use of the panel. The panels are posted at the employer's workplace and are comprised of healthcare providers who are geographically located near the place of employment and who provide the medical services most likely to be needed by the employees of the particular employer. Premier updates and reissues the employer panels when provider demographics change and at the request of the employer. Premier verifies the accuracy of panel provider information for all its clients' panels every six months and communicates any changes to their employer and insurance carrier clients. Premier also investigates and vets potential panel providers for qualifications, current licensing and quality of care. Premier Resp. \u00b6 29. Premier generally does not earn money for this service separate from its connection with use of its PT/MRI Network. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 32. When providing its panel management product to WorkPartners, Premier earned revenue only when injured employees were scheduled with and received treatment from providers in Premier's PT/MRI Network. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   WorkPartners generated provider panels for certain of its fully-insured and TPA clients located in close proximity to UPMC's hospitals and physician practices across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 45; Premier Resp. \u00b6 45. WorkPartners does not generate or maintain provider panels for any employers other than its workers' compensation insurance and TPA services clients. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 47. WorkPartners contends that it does not market or sell provider panel generation or maintenance services. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 46. Employers have the right under the Workers' Compensation Act to select their own providers, which allows Premier to market its services to those employers, even if such employers are fully insured by or receive TPA services from WorkPartners. Premier Resp. \u00b6 46. To prevent such competition, Premier contends that once an employer makes the decision to purchase workers' compensation insurance from WorkPartners, WorkPartners mandates that such employer use only WorkPartners approved providers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Premier further contends that WorkPartners informed their employer-insureds that their workers' compensation premiums were based on the insureds use of WorkPartners' approved panels, which were often panels consisting of UPMC owned and affiliated providers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Premier's injury management services involve providing injured workers with assistance in scheduling appointments for medical treatment with panel providers, assuring the employer and claimed adjuster receive prompt diagnosis, treatment, and work status information, tracking physical therapy (\"PT\") treatment and reporting utilization information to the client, and scheduling all PT and diagnostic testing (\"MRI/CT\") with Premier discount network providers whenever possible to maximize the cost savings for employers and insurance carriers. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 35; Premier Resp. \u00b6 35. Premier schedules patients for treatment inside and outside of Pennsylvania with network medical service providers in Pennsylvania and neighboring states who provide medical services to employees of Pennsylvania employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 36; Premier Resp. \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In April of 2006, Premier entered into a Medical Review and Repricing Agreement (the \"Repricing Agreement\") with WorkPartners. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 59; Am. Comp. \u00b6 52. Premier became a subcontractor to WorkPartners to provide medical bill review and repricing services for three of UPMC WorkPartners' TPA clients: (1) the City of Pittsburgh; (2) Port Authority of Allegheny County; and (3) Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In August 2010, Premier began generating provider panels for certain of WorkPartners' new commercial insured clients. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 61. In addition to Premier's panel development, its services included appointment scheduling, injury management, and PT/MRI network services. Premier Resp. \u00b6 61. During the panel generation relationship with WorkPartners, every panel developed by Premier, and the included providers, required the approval of WorkPartners' Jason Gallagher (\"Gallagher\"). UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 62; UPMC Exs. AD, AE &amp; AF. WorkPartners required that Premier list UPMC owned and affiliated physicians and other providers whenever geographically feasible. Premier Resp. \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 31, 2013, Linda Schmac (\"Ms. Schmac\"), President and co-owner of Premier, wrote an email to Deborah Mehalik, WorkPartner's Manager of Network Services (\"Mehalik\"), which, on its face, described inefficiencies she believed were caused by WorkPartner's use of multiple vendors for their medical review and repricing, while using Premier's generated provider panels, but not using Premier for medical review and repricing. Schmac's email also appears to recommend that WorkPartners use MCMC for all its \"panel development, implementation and maintenance, and PT/MRI network usage\" to remedy the issues caused by multiple vendors. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 64; UPMC Ex. AH. Specifically, Ms. Schmac wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Don\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and I have discussed this issue at length and we believe the manual processes that [WorkPartners] has had to put into place to accommodate using our panel PT/MRI network program are too prone to human error and are no longer [ ] in [WorkPartners'] best interest ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Because [WorkPartners] does not utilize our repricing service, we do not have the ability to determine if your insureds are complying with the panels we have developed, implemented manage, and continue to maintain for [WorkPartners.] Further, we do not have the ability to capture our PT/MRI network bills through repricing. Nor do we have the ability to detect if any of our network providers inadvertently bill [WorkPartners] directly for services which could potentially result in [WorkPartners] paying both [Premier] and our network provider directly for the same services. While our network providers are contractually obligated to bill [Premier] for all services we schedule, this does happen from time to time, but can be easily detected through repricing so that our clients do not ever pay double for the services ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Due to the growth of [WorkPartners] and since [WorkPartners] will not consider using our repricing service which would automate these manual processes and completely eliminate these problems, we feel it would be in [WorkPartners'] best interest to transition all of [WorkPartners'] panel development, implementation, and maintenance, and PT/MRI network usage to MCMC. [WorkPartners] has grown to the point that\n   they need an integrated cost containment solution. Having [Premier] perform the services we do and having MCMC perform the repricing is cost prohibitive, labor intensive, and inefficient for both our organizations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Please understand that we absolutely loathe making this recommendation to [WorkPartners] as we sincerely enjoy working with all of you and greatly appreciate the business, and we obviously do not like having to recommend to our clients that they use our competitors' services. However, this recommendation is in the best interest of [WorkPartners] as you need a more integrated cost containment program. As always, you can count on us to make the transition to MCMC as smooth as possible for [WorkPartners].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   UPMC Ex. AH. Upon reviewing Ms. Schmac's email, WorkPartners was concerned that Premier would discontinue its panel generation services and began exploring alternatives to Premier's panel generation services. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 67 &amp; 68; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Premier, however, contends that Ms. Schmac wrote the email at Mehalik's request because Mehalik wanted to show WorkPartners' executives the inefficiency of not having one vendor providing the repricing, PT/MRI network provider services and panel generation services. Premier Response \u00b6 64. Because MCMC was allegedly double and triple paying bills and paying the full provider bill amount, Mehalik asked Ms. Schmac to send her the email so Mehalik had some leverage to convince WorkPartners to reconsider the repricing vendor. Premier Ex. 11. pp. 78-86. Though Ms. Schmac was asking WorkPartners to transition the panels to MCMC, both Ms. Schmac and Mehalik knew that was not possible because MCMC did not provide panel generation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ploy appeared to work as in January 2014, WorkPartners had Mehalik conduct a test audit and prepare an audit report that compared the relative capabilities of Premier, MCMC and another vendor, Align Networks. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 69; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6 36. Mehalik, a registered nurse, had never done an audit report before. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 70 &amp; 71; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6 43. Mehalik, however, had the necessary background, experience and competency to prepare the comparative audit report. Premier Response \u00b6 72. In her report, Mehalik recommended that WorkPartners switch from MCMC to Premier and consolidate repricing and panel generation services with Premier. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 73. WorkPartners' CEO, David Weir (\"Weir\"), not Mehalik, had the authority to make the final decision regarding whether to change the repricing vendor. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the completed audit, WorkPartners continued to review and develop a revised business model for their internal repricing, network, PPO and panel development structure. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 76; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 45 &amp; 46. Ms. Schmac was aware that WorkPartners, despite the audit report, continued to review and investigate all of its options. In fact, in an email to James Cottone and Steven Wagner of WorkPartners dated July 10, 2014, Ms. Schmac stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I'm very pleased to learn that [Premier] performed well with regard to the repricing test audit and most importantly, that [WorkPartners] is very satisfied with the services we currently provide to some of your TPA clients ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If there is anything we can do to help [WorkPartners] with the onerous task of reviewing your entire repricing, network, PPO, and panel development structure, please do not hesitate to let me know ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   We will remain patient while [WorkPartners] works through this grueling process and explores its various options ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   UPMC Ex. AO. Premier was aware, then, that WorkPartners did not simply rely on Mehalik's audit report and recommendation that Premier be given all the repricing business in its revised business model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 20, 2014, Jason Gallagher (\"Gallagher\"), the Medical Delivery Coordinator at WorkPartners, requested that Premier provide WorkPartners a spreadsheet containing a list of the provider panels of WorkPartners' insured employer clients. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 78. Prior to requesting the provider panel information in spreadsheet form, WorkPartners already possessed a copy of all the panels generated by Premier for WorkPartners' insured either in paper or PDF. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Gallagher explained the purpose for his request was to assist with creating a \"provider scorecard system\" for providers serving WorkPartners' insureds to \"better track our providers and which panels they reside on. All part of my project to track outcomes for our providers.\" UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 79. Premier contends, however, that the real reason for WorkPartners' requests for panel provider data was to steal Premier's confidential compilation of such data so that WorkPartners could create its own panel tool capable of allowing it to develop panels itself and terminate the services of Premier. Premier Response \u00b6\u00b6 80 &amp; 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In August 2014, WorkPartners began referring new workers' compensation insured employers to Align Networks (\"Align\") for panel generation. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 82. On November 13, 2014, Mehalik and another WorkPartners' employees met with representatives of Premier during which Premier was informed that: (1) WorkPartners would not switch its repricing vendor for its commercial-insured business from MCMC to Premier; (2) Premier would retain its repricing business for WorkPartners' self-insured TPA clients, Allegheny County, Port Authority of Allegheny County, City of Pittsburgh, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission: (3) there was an opportunity for Premier to work with UPMC WorkPartners' self-insured TPA business in the future; and (4) WorkPartners was trying another vendor for panel formation on new insured clients. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84, 85, 86 &amp; 87; MCMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 51 &amp; 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   During the meeting, Ms. Schmac accused WorkPartners of being dishonest and unethical. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 90. Soon thereafter, Mr. Schmac cut off online access to the provider panels that Premier continued to manage on behalf of WorkPartners. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 91. Because WorkPartners indicated at the meeting that it was not sure if it was going to transition the 1,100 WorkPartners insureds' panels from Premier to Align, Ms. Schmac instructed Premier employees to cease updating the WorkPartners insureds' panels until WorkPartners confirmed whether or not Premier would maintain this business. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 92; Premier Response \u00b6 92. On November 26, 2014, WorkPartners informed Premier that WorkPartners had no present intention to change the current arrangement with Premier regarding the panels Premier managed on behalf of WorkPartners' insured. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 6, 2015, WorkPartners sent an email to Premier requesting additional \"panel, provider and provider location data\" from Premier for the reasons set forth in the email. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 95; UPMC Ex. AZ. In a response email on that same day, Ms. Schmac, obviously upset at the request for addition panel data, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   With all due respect, ... it was our understanding that [WorkPartners] made the decision to use Align to create their panels, and since we have not received a panel request from [WorkPartners] since August, I would have to assume [WorkPartners] continues to use Align. That being said, I can't imagine that [WorkPartners] would expect us [to] invest tens of thousands of dollars to create special IT programs and processes for just the existing panels we manage for UPMC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   UPMC Ex. AZ. In an internal email dated January 7, 2015, Andrew Yohe (\"Yohe\"), a WorkPartners Vice President, advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [I]f [Premier] refuses to provide the information it leaves me well beyond suspect of the actual performance of their network. As it stands, our relationship with [Premier] is one in which we are\n   <strong>\n    absolutely living in the dark\n   </strong>\n   . We don't know what providers our clients are using, we can't judge the performance of those providers and we don't have an effective methodology of evaluating that we're paying competitive rates within their network.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Their rates and provider performance could be top notch, but I have no way of telling that.

In an email dated January 9, 2015, Linda Schmac indicated that Premier would not provide WorkPartners the data it requested, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   ... given that [WorkPartners] has made the decision to discontinue using [Premier] for new panel development in lieu of Align, I have made the decision not to comply with [WorkPartners'] request for us to provide the extensive list of IT services you have outlined in the agenda below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   UPMC Ex. BA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Premier admits, however, that it provided panel information and data to Wal-Mart, through its wholly owned TPA, Claimed Management Inc. (\"CMI\"), that allowed CMI to measure provider outcomes and utilization. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 226; Premier Response \u00b6 226. Premier also admits that it provided PT/MRI billing data to an insurer client, Brickstreet, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   the purpose of the transmission was to integrate [Premier] PT/MRI invoices electronically with Brickstreet's claim system.

Fuhr, Jr. (\"Dr. Fuhr\"), an economist with experience in analyzing antitrust issues in healthcare markets and identified by Premier as its expert, also agreed that it is appropriate and reasonable for workers' compensation insurers, like WorkPartners, to request such panel information and utilization data in order to: understand provider performance; determine what drives increasing physical therapy costs; and to analyze provider outcomes. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 233, 235. Moreover, Dr. Fuhr agreed that if a repricer, particularly one like Premier that derives revenue from utilization, refused to provide such information, it would be reasonable\n   for an insurer to look for a different repricer. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 234.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On February 17, 2015, despite Premier's refusal to provide the data requested, WorkPartners sent Premier a draft of a non-exclusive Master Services Agreement (\"MSA\") to replace the Agreement that had been in place since 2006,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which would allow Premier to service the approximately 1100 panels it generated for WorkPartners' new commercial insured clients. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 100; UPMC Ex. BC. On February 18, 2015, Ms. Schmac replied to WorkPartners, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Given the very short amount of time you have given us to review this one-sided, unreasonable agreement (8 business days), ... there is no way I could possibly execute this agreement by March 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Further, no repricing vendor including your current vendor, MCMC, who accesses the Coventry PPO network and is therefore mandated to use them as a primary network could sign this without significant revisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   I will forward this agreement to our attorney, the Dept. of Justice, our mutual clients, and Coventry, and I will respond back to you when I and they all have had adequate time to review it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Premier Response \u00b6 101. On February 27, 2015, without any attempted negotiation with WorkPartners, Ms. Schmac informed WorkPartners that Premier was not willing to enter into the proposed MSA and requested that the panel provider database requested and sent to WorkPartners \"under false pretenses\" be returned \"along with a statement representing that the data has not been used for any purpose and there are no other [copies].\" UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 103; Premier Response \u00b6 103. On March 26, 2015, WorkPartners provided written notice to Premier that it would terminate the 2006 Repricing Agreement, effective April 30, 2015. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The crux of Premier's complaint, therefore, arises from WorkPartners' unilateral decision not to consolidate its medical bill repricing and panel generation business with one vendor, but instead, after an evaluation of its repricing and panel generation vendors, chose to consolidate all repricing work with its incumbent provider, MCMC, and to direct its panel generation work to non-party Align Networks. Premier contends that such decision was made after WorkPartners requested certain confidential panel information from Premier and despite a WorkPartners' generated report indicating that Premier was superior to MCMC as a repricing vendor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As an initial matter, this Court must note the Supreme Court's thoughts on vendor selection set forth in\n   <em>\n    Nynex Corp. v.

Cluster markets are used as a matter of analytical convenience when all or most relevant market participants sell all or most all of the relevant products, and have similar shares in each of the segments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emigra Grp., LLC v.

WorkPartners does not offer itself as a competitor in the market with respect to any cost containment services, and MCMC offers only medical bill repricing in the alleged market. This Court, therefore, finds Premier's attempts to define a relevant product market necessary to show antitrust standing, and violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act are legally insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Nor does the Court find that Premier has established a relevant geographic market.

Premier offers no support for its proposed geographic market, but concludes that \"testimony from UPMC's own witnesses create a genuine issue of material fact\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ,\" stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Steve Wagner, the Senior Claims Manager for WP, agreed that panel development by and for [WorkPartners] would generally have been confined to Western PA. (Ex. 73, pp. 157-58.) Also, Defendants' own expert witness, Dr. David Reitman, testified that \"[he] would expect someone living in Western PA to be treated by a medical service provider most of the time in Western PA.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Premier Brief, p. 34. Though such statements may be true, such evidence is too simplistic and fails to account for the business realities of either the workers' compensation insurance business or the cost containment services related thereto. An\n   insured of WorkPartner's for example who has business locations in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia would look for panel development in all three states\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   , as an injured worker would seek to be treated by a medical provider near his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The geographic market for workers' compensation insurers is at least the entire state of Pennsylvania. WorkPartners is not limited to sales only to employers located in western Pennsylvania, nor are employers in western Pennsylvania limited to insurers in Premier's proposed geographic market. Employers in western Pennsylvania can and do regularly purchase insurance or TPA services from entities outside of Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 174-176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Similarly, the relevant geographic market for TPA services for workers' compensation self-insured employers is more likely nationwide, but in the very least the full state of Pennsylvania. In fact, Premier admits that many of WorkPartners' TPA competitors, including HealthSmart Solutions, Sedgwick, Gallagher Bassett, Broadspire, PMA, York and others, are large, national companies that provide TPA services across the nation. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court also agrees that the relevant geographic market for the services provided by Premier is broader than western Pennsylvania. Premier provides cost containment services to workers' compensation insurers and TPA services to providers in twenty-one (21) states including Pennsylvania. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21 &amp; 25; UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 10; Premier Resp. \u00b6 10. Moreover, Premier's competitors for cost containment services located outside western Pennsylvania compete for customers in this area, across the entire state, and nationally. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 180-181. Premier's expert, Dr. Fuhr, testified that the markets for repricing, physical therapy networks, and MRI networks are national in scope. UPMC CSUMF \u00b6 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Premier has offered no evidence to support its proposed geographic market. Moreover, its proposed geographic market is woefully narrow, and does not represent the business realities of either the workers' compensation insurance business or the cost containment service business. Premier's proposed relevant geographic market is legally insufficient to show antitrust standing, or violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, citing\n   <em>\n    Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706351\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/297/#p307\">\n    501 F.3d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (3d Cir. 2007), Premier argues that a definition of the relevant markets in this instance is unnecessary because \"there is direct evidence of monopoly power.\" Premier Brief at 33. Premier contends that there is sufficient evidence regarding UPMC's possession of monopoly or market power in the second product market, workers' compensation medical services. In support, Premier directs this Court to the testimony of UPMC President and CEO Jeffrey A. Romoff before the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Insurance Committee in 2011 during which Mr. Romoff stated \"Let me agree that UPMC and Highmark are both monopolies.\" (Premier Ex. 74, pp., 65, 72-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Mr. Romoff's testimony, however, appears to relate to general acute care services\n   on both the provider side (hospitals) and the insurance side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 73. There is no evidence that Mr. Romoff's statement has any relation to the markets alleged in this case. The workers' compensation medical services market proposed by Premier consists mainly of outpatient services, including PT and diagnostic services, not in-patient acute care services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UPMC CSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 163 &amp; 164. As set forth in Section D below, Premier is unable to direct this Court to either direct or circumstantial evidence of the UPMC Defendants' monopoly power in the relevant markets proposed by Premier.

For example, if two disgruntled customers conspire to burn a department store which would, if accomplished, have the effect of destroying its business, it seems improbable that a court would hold that the intent which suffices to support a claim under state tort law is itself also enough to support a claim for violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The anticompetitive intent which acts as a \"surrogate for effects\" must be targeted directly to the victim in its competitive aspects - injury to the victim\n   <em>\n    qua\n   </em>\n   competitor. It follows that plaintiff in this case cannot resurrect its antitrust claim because of its success before the jury on the intentional state tort claims, even though the necessary predicate of that success was the finding of an intent to injure plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    SI Handling Systems, Inc. v.
