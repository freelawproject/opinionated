INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Last July, Plaintiff Christian Fellowship Centers of New York, Inc. (the \"Church\") bought a former restaurant at 25 Court Street in downtown Canton, New York (the \"Property\") intending to use it as a church. However, Section 325-11 (the \"Ordinance\") of the Canton Village Code prohibits houses of worship from operating in the downtown zone even though it permits not-for-profit organizations to use nearby properties to meet for secular purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 22-5 (\"Zoning Code\"), 22-6 (\"Zoning Board of Appeals Record\") at 25, 42-43.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Church claims that the Zoning Code and the Ordinance violate the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(3)(D). Dkt. No. 1 (\"Complaint\") \u00b6\u00b6 72-113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Church now moves for a preliminary (or permanent) injunction requesting\n   that the Court (1) enjoin the Village of Canton (the \"Village\") from enforcing the Ordinance and the Zoning Code; (2) declare them unlawful; and (3) order the parties to confer concerning damages. Dkt. No. 13 (the \"Motion\"). For the following reasons, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part. The Village is enjoined from enforcing the Ordinance to prevent the Church from using the Property as a church pending further proceedings to determine whether the injunction should be made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To obtain a preliminary injunction against \"government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,\" a plaintiff must show that it is likely (first) to succeed on the merits and (second) to suffer irreparable injury without an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Church and the Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Church is a New York not-for-profit corporation founded in the 1970s. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13. It began its ministry in 1974 near Ogdensburg, New York, operating out of a building once used as a chicken coop, and now has five locations in New York State where members meet to worship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13-9. In May 2016, the Church launched a congregation in the Village and appointed Pastor Jamie Sinclair to lead it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. It rented space from another local church until August 2018, when its lease expired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20-21. Since then, the Canton congregation has met three times at a local university and now rents space every Sunday at the Best Western Hotel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. It has thirty-four members and averages eighty-two attendees each Sunday.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the two years since he launched the Canton congregation, Sinclair searched for a permanent property in the Village to hold worship services and conduct other religious activities, such as prayer meetings, musical performances, community service projects, and evangelism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 59. Finally, in the summer of 2018, the Church learned that a suitable building located at 25 Court Street, Canton, formerly home to a local restaurant called \"the Club,\" was for sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. The Church moved quickly to purchase it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28. The seller accepted the Church's offer on July 10, 2018, and the sale closed a few months later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; ZBA R. at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Zoning Code\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Village Zoning Code, 25 Court Street is in the downtown C-1 Retail Commercial District, one of 14 zoning districts in the Village.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Village of Canton 2016 Zoning Map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ordinance states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [t]he purpose of the C-1 Retail Commercial District is to: (1) [d]elineate a central area where shopping, recreational, and cultural facilities are provided for the community as a whole;\" and (2) [e]ncourage new development in the central business district by providing for public and commercial parking areas for business and patrons of the district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Village Code, \u00a7 325-11(A). The Ordinance limits the use of buildings in the C-1 zone to specified uses, which include retail store, launderette, restaurant or tavern, bowling alley, pool hall, and theater, as well as \"museum,\" \"municipal or government building,\" and \"[f]raternal/social clubs/education/charitable or philanthropic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 325-11(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the Ordinance did not specify \"religious assemblies\" as a permitted use, on July 20, 2018, the Church approached the Village Code Enforcement Officer and the Village Planning Chairman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. At the direction of those officers, the Church submitted a request to the Planning Board to change the use of the Property from a restaurant to a church and to obtain a certificate of occupancy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On September 11, 2018, the Planning Board held a meeting on the matter, at which Sinclair and members of the public weighed in.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. A month after the hearing, the Code Enforcement Officer denied the Church's request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff appealed to the Village Zoning Board of Appeals (the \"ZBA\"), asking that it deem the church to be a \"[f]raternal/social club/education/charitable or philanthropic\" use permitted in the C-1 zone. ZBA R. at 3, 8-10, 24. However, the ZBA affirmed the Code Enforcement Officer's decision, concluding that \"based on the village code a church is not an allowed use in a C-1 commercial district.\" ZBA R. at 42. Conrad Stuntz, the Chairperson of the ZBA, later elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [a]s described by the Village's Zoning Code, 'church religious institution' use is expressly permitted as a matter of right in the Business District (or 'B-1') zone ( [Zoning Code] \u00a7 325-10(B)(1)(j) ) and permitted by Special Exception (or 'special permit') in both 'R-1' and 'R-2' residential District (Ex. A \u00a7 325(B)(2)(d) ),\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   but \"church religious institution\" is not named as a permitted use in the C-1 zone. Dkt.

These Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Church filed this case on February 11 and the Motion on March 7, 2019. The Motion relies on only two of the Church's claims against the Village. Mot. \u00b6 2. It requests that the Court, under Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Declare that the Village's zoning code, on its face and as applied [to the Church] violates the Equal Terms provision of [RLUIPA] and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; B ... [E]njoin the Village ... from enforcing its zoning code, both facially and as applied to the Church, and from preventing or attempting to prevent the Church from using its property as a church; C. Direct the parties to confer regarding the Church's damages for the violations of its constitutional and\n   statutory rights, as well as its costs and expenses of this action, including reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and other applicable law; [and] D. Grant such other relief as this Court deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mot. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court set an expedited briefing schedule, but it allowed the Village to request any necessary extension before its response was due. Dkt. Nos. 16, 18 (\"March 8 Text Orders\"). The Village later reported it would not request an extension. Dkt. No. 20 (\"March 15 Report\"). The Motion is now fully briefed. Dkt. Nos. 14 (\"Church's Memorandum\"), 22 (\"Opposition\"), 23 (\"Reply\"). Also, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in support of the Church. Dkt. No. 27 (\"Statement of Interest\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Village submitted a second brief in response. Dkt.

Ripeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the threshold, the Village argues that this case is unripe for judicial review because the Church did not request a variance from the Zoning Code.
