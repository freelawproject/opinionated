Cynthia Bashant, United States District Judge\n  Plaintiff Harley Seegert commenced this class action against Defendant Lamps Plus, Inc. seeking relief for violations of California's Unfair Competition Law, California's False Advertising Law, and California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act. Plaintiff alleges Defendant engages in fraudulent pricing practices by labeling its merchandise with \"Compare At\" price tags without ever offering the product at the listed original price. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-8, ECF No. 1-3.) Plaintiff claims this deceptive pricing scheme leads Lamps Plus customers to believe they are receiving a discount, when in fact, they are paying the original retail price.

Class Members can also opt to use the Voucher for either (i) 20% off a purchase of up to $ 150, or (ii) $ 30 in credit against the purchase of any item valued over $ 150. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With at least 930,835 estimated Class Members, Plaintiff attempts to value the Settlement at $ 16,755,030 by multiplying the number of Class Members by the price of the vouchers being distributed. (Mot. 8:3-8.) However, providing Class Members $ 18 in store credit is not as valuable as providing them $ 18 in cash.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Redman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264994\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/622/#p636\">\n    768 F.3d at 636-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing \"the ways in which store credit for $ 10 is not as valuable to the recipient as $ 10 in cash\"). And while the Settlement Agreement refers to the class reward as a \"voucher\" and not a \"coupon,\" the Senate Report on CAFA's coupon provisions treats the term coupon as interchangeable with voucher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

On its website, Lamps Plus proclaims itself to be \"the nation's largest lighting retailer.\" Lamps Plus, https://www.lampsplus.com/ (last visited Nov. 14, 2018).

Most of the products actively promoted at Lamps Plus are more expensive than $ 18.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lamps Plus, https://www.lampsplus.com/.

Plaintiff alleges to have gone to Lamps Plus to purchase a chest. (Compl. \u00b6 13.) He encountered a 55 Downing Street branded Josephine 3-Drawer Mirrored Accent Chest with Silver Trim discounted from $ 899.99 to $ 599.99 and ultimately purchased it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's purchase of the $ 599.99 chest indicates he was enticed to shop at Lamps Plus for its furniture and home d\u00e9cor-products that are priced well above $ 18.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lamps Plus, https://www.lampsplus.com/. And, in light of Plaintiff's experience and the products actively promoted by Lamps Plus, it is likely that other customers were similarly interested in products more expensive than $ 18. This likelihood, too, supports that the proposed Vouchers qualify as coupons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Easysaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518948\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/747/#p755\">\n    906 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   755 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264994\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/622/#p636\">\n    768 F.3d at 636-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, the proposed relief here can be distinguished from cash-equivalent certificates awarded in other cases. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/#p950\">\n    779 F.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded a $ 12 gift-card to Walmart.com was not considered a coupon because it offered class members a choice from thousands of products for which ordinary consumers have need. The products available at Lamps Plus are not everyday products required for purchase. Lamps, couches, tables, and other home d\u00e9cor are generally not essential items. Further, the class members in\n   <em>\n    In re Online DVD\n   </em>\n   also \"had the option of obtaining cash instead of a gift card, undercutting the argument that the settlement forces them to buy from the defendant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011310\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/934/#p950\">\n    779 F.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no similar option here. Therefore, the Vouchers are not equivalent to cash.
