Factual Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Columbus State is a large community college with three divisions: Arts &amp; Sciences. Business &amp; Engineering Technology, and Health &amp; Human Services. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 12 (ECF No. 39-1 ). Each division has a dean, who reports to Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Jack Cooley (\"Vice President Cooley\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Columbus State's Arts &amp; Sciences division offers associate degrees designed to transfer to\n   four-year institutions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Business &amp; Engineering and Health &amp; Human Services offer career-based training designed to prepare graduates for immediate employment; therefore, most courses offered in these divisions do not transfer to other institutions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 1, 2012, Columbus State hired Dr. Amy Ng (\"Dr. Ng\") as an instructor in the Health &amp; Human Services' Criminal Justice Department. Ng Dep. Tr. at 10, 24 (ECF No. 44 ). Of the four professors in the Criminal Justice Department, Dr. Ng was the only female.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Dr. Ng alleges that, during her first semester, two of the three other Criminal Justice Department professors began harassing and discriminating against her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By February of 2014, Dr. Ng was unhappy with her work environment and so she emailed Vice President Cooley to express interest in transferring from the Health &amp; Human Services' Criminal Justice Department to the Arts &amp; Sciences' Social Sciences Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38. Throughout the 2014 Spring semester, the Chair of the Social Sciences Department at that time, Rebecca Mobley (\"Chairwoman Mobley\"), communicated with Dr. Ng about transferring to the Social Sciences Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. On May 8, 2014, Chairwoman Mobley advised Vice President Cooley and Lisa Schneider, Interim Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences (\"Dean Schneider\"), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I just had a conversation with [Dr. Ng], and she expressed that the situation in her department has deteriorated significantly. Given that Don Ricker's contract will end at the end of this term, we would like to seriously push to have [Dr. Ng] moved to our department ASAP. As you know Don taught the bulk of our criminology courses, and given Amy's area of expertise she would be able to assume these courses while a plan is developed to create 2+2 plans of study for students wishing to go into Criminal Justice/Criminology. Our department is fully supportive of her move. Is it possible that this could be seriously investigated over the summer with a hope that she could be relocated by Autumn, if appropriate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cooley Dep., Ex. 3 at 1-2. Dean Schneider responded that some of those professors in the Criminal Justice Department who allegedly harassed Dr. Ng wanted to keep those courses in the Criminal Justice Department. Schneider Dep., Ex. 3 (ECF No. 40 ). Referring to those professors, Vice President Cooley replied that he had \"zero interest in protecting the convenience of faculty who put the college at risk due to their behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ng Dep., Ex. 10 at 4. Vice President Cooley then emailed Dean Schneider individually, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I want to move forward on this .... I am not overly concerned about the police faculty having courses for their convenience. They made their bed. This is not to say that we shouldn't be concerned that the college makes all necessary courses available to that program.... I'm just not concerned that [the Criminology courses] be located in [the Criminal Justice Department]. It's a cause and effect world.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Schneider Dep., Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May of 2014, after obtaining the consent of the Social Sciences Department faculty, Vice President Cooley approved Dr. Ng's transfer from the Criminal Justice Department to the Social Sciences Department. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 53-55, Ex. 3-5; Schneider Dep. Tr. at 62-63. By the time the Social Sciences Department approved Dr. Ng's transfer, she had developed three other courses in the Criminal Justice Department. Ng Dep. Tr. at 63-64. Vice President Cooley testified that, according\n   to the terms of the transfer, Dr. Ng would have a \"teach out\" period in the Criminal Justice Department and then begin teaching the Criminology courses exclusively through the Social Sciences Department. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 65, Ex. 3-5. Dr. Ng testified that Dean Schneider ensured Dr. Ng that she would have enough courses to teach during Dr. Ng's interim \"teach out\" period, after which Dr. Ng's courses in the Criminal Justice Department would transfer to the Social Sciences Department. Ng Dep. Tr. at 63-64. The terms of Dr. Ng's transfer were never memorialized in writing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68. Dr. Ng testifies that the terms were \"all discussion-based.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June of 2014, Columbus State hired Dr. Allysen Todd (\"Dean Todd\") as the Dean of its Arts &amp; Sciences division. Todd Dep. Tr. at 15 (ECF No. 44 ). On October 1, 2014, Dr. Raadschelders replaced Chairwoman Mobley as the Chair of the Social Sciences Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44; Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 11-13, Ex. B (ECF No. 42 ). As Chair of the Social Sciences Department, Dr. Raadschelders reported directly to Dean Todd. Schneider Dep. Tr. at 15; Todd Dep. Tr. at 15. Dean Todd reported directly to Vice President Cooley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Dr. Raadschelders was responsible for: leading the Social Sciences Department in curriculum planning and assessment; facilitating hiring; conducting performance evaluations; overseeing professional development of staff and faculty; managing department resources, including the budget, scheduling, and staffing of classes; and resolving student complaints and personnel issues. Pl.'s Dep. Tr., Ex. D at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 6, 2014, Dr. Ng filed an internal sex discrimination and retaliation complaint against Scott Wagner, a former police officer and instructor in the Criminal Justice Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ng Dep. Tr. at V.2, Ex. 2. On August 8, 2014, Dr. Ng transferred to the Social Sciences Department. Ng Dep., Ex. 3. Upon transferring to the Social Sciences Department, Dr. Ng was the most junior faculty member. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 87-88; Schneider Dep. Tr. at 149; Ng Dep. Tr. at 22-26, Ex. E. The Social Sciences Department's faculty used a seniority-driven course selection system. Ng Dep., Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Ng was required to teach up to five sections of courses in the Criminal Justice Department during the 2014-15 school year. Ng Dep. Tr. at 83. Within a month of Dr. Ng's transfer from the Criminal Justice Department to the Social Sciences Department, the Criminal Justice Department removed Criminology and Introduction to Sociology courses from its degree program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86; Cooley Dep. Tr. at 90. Dr. Ng believed that faculty in the Criminal Justice Department removed these courses to retaliate against her for transferring out of the Criminal Justice Department and filing the Title IX complaint against its faculty. Ng Dep. Tr. at 88. Dr. Ng told Dr. Raadschelders that she felt the Criminal Justice Department was retaliating against her. Pl. Dep. Tr. at 86. Around the same time, Dr. Karen Muir (\"Dr. Muir\"), a former Social Sciences Department faculty member who had seniority over Dr. Ng, returned to the Social Sciences Department. Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 26. The reduced demand for Criminology and Sociology courses, in addition to Dr. Muir's return, further frustrated scheduling issues for Dr. Ng and others in the Social Sciences Department. Schneider\n   Dep. Tr. at 73. To generate more teaching opportunities, Dr. Ng and another Social Sciences Department faculty member applied to teach courses in the Criminal Justice Department. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 99-100, Ex. 13; Ng Dep. Tr. at 28-30. Dean Todd supported Dr. Ng's request. Ng Dep. Tr. at 28-30\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 24, 2015, Dean Todd directed Dr. Raadschelders to inform Dr. Ng that the Arts &amp; Sciences division needed a transfer pathway in Criminology and that Dr. Ng could develop one course each semester for that purpose. Todd Dep. Tr. at 64, 71, Ex. 11, 16; Pl.'s Dep., Ex. L. Vice President Cooley authorized her to create the Criminology transfer pathway. Todd Dep. Tr. at 65; Cooley Dep. Tr. at 92-93. From March of 2015 to March of 2016, Dr. Ng created two new course proposals for the Social Sciences Department. Ng Dep. Tr. at 99-100. In March of 2016, Social Science Department faculty members expressed concern that Dr. Ng needed to distinguish her proposed courses from the policing and corrections courses offered in the Criminal Justice Department. Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 21-22, Ex. I. Dr. Ng submitted her course proposals to the Division Curriculum Committee in March of 2016. Ng Dep. Tr. at 106. Thereafter, the Division Curriculum Committee advised Dr. Raadschelders that it would not consider Dr. Ng's course proposals because the paperwork lacked Vice President Cooley's signature, which was required. Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 17, 2016, Dr. Raadschelders notified Dean Todd of the Division Curriculum Committee's decision regarding Dr. Ng's course proposals. Todd Dep. Tr. at 45; Ex.21. Thereafter, Vice President Cooley received Dr. Ng's course proposals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125. Vice President Cooley averred that he was surprised because he did not know Dr. Ng had been authorized to develop courses. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 135-36. Upon reviewing the course proposals, Vice President Cooley was concerned about their numbering, which indicated higher-level coursework, and perceived lack of transferability to other institutions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. Dean Todd did not share the same concerns and instead advocated for their approval. Cooley Dep., Ex. 15. Vice President Cooley told Dean Todd he would contact his colleagues at other schools for feedback on the course proposals and pause consideration of their approval in the meantime. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 115-16, Ex. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 4, 2016, a Social Sciences Department faculty member, Dr. Tracy Little (\"Dr. Little\"), requested a meeting with Vice President Cooley and Dr. Raadschelders to discuss Vice President Cooley's rationale for pausing consideration of the course proposals. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 132, Ex. 21. In response, Vice President Cooley expressed his willingness to discuss the matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also made clear his reluctance to add new courses due to the increasing legislative focus on streamlining higher education for affordability and the uncertain demand for the proposed courses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 11, 2016, Dr. Raadschelders, Dr. Little, and Vice President Cooley met to discuss the development of Criminology courses for the Social Sciences Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137-38. Vice President Cooley reiterated his concerns that Columbus State's Division Curriculum Committee would deny the course proposals because their course numbers indicated upper-level courses and other four-year institutions might not accept them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138. During the meeting, Dr. Raadschelders grew angry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139. Vice President Cooley testified that he did not believe Dr. Raadschelders was disrespectful but, based on her tone and raised voice, Vice President Cooley believed she was angered by his skepticism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140. Dr. Raadschelders'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   notes from the April 11, 2016 meeting reiterate Vice President Cooley's testimony. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. K. Dr. Raadschelders' notes also mention discussions about Dr. Ng's move and scheduling issues in the Social Sciences Department, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   We asked what we were to do about [Dr. Ng], and [Vice President Cooley] repeated his assurance of guaranteeing her hours for the summer. I asked about the fall and spring and the following summer. [Vice President Cooley] said we would have to wait and see. I said that was unacceptable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   As we were leaving, [Dr. Little] mentioned that [Dr. Ng] had been to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, and I mentioned that [Dr. Ng] would likely be seeking legal counsel. [Vice President Cooley] said that was her prerogative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the April 11, 2016 meeting, Vice President Cooley and Dr. Raadschelders never interacted again. Cooley Dep. Tr. at 146. Vice President Cooley testifies that because Dr. Raadschelders had grown angry at the April 11, 2016 meeting, he asked Dean Todd to speak with Dr. Raadschelders about constructively solving the Social Sciences Department's curriculum problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140-41. Dean Todd avers that once she learned about Dr. Raadschelders' behavior during the April 11th meeting, she decided that she needed to file a written reprimand for Dr. Raadschelders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Todd Dep. Tr. at 31. Dean Todd then met with Columbus State's Human Resources Department to discuss Dr. Raadschelders' behavior. Todd Dep. Tr. at 30. Dean Schneider and Human Resources Representative Julie Klinger (\"HR Rep. Klinger\") also met to discuss Dr. Raadschelders' \"insubordinate and discourteous\" conduct. Schneider Dep. Tr. at 110-11, Ex. 17. After meeting, HR Rep. Klinger sent a written reprimand template to Dean Schneider and Dean Todd to prepare for Dr. Raadschelders. Klinger Dep. Tr. at 87, Ex. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 25, 2016, at approximately 9:00 a.m., Dean Todd returned a completed written reprimand to HR Rep. Klinger. Todd Dep. Tr. at 31, 55, Ex. 30. Dean Todd, Dean Schneider, and HR Rep. Klinger planned to issue Dr. Raadschelders the written reprimand at a meeting scheduled for 10:00 a.m. that day. Klinger Dep. Tr. at 87, Ex. 8. No one told Dr. Raadschelders the reason for the meeting. Todd Dep. Tr. at 31, 55; Schneider Dep. Tr. at 119. HR Rep. Klinger did not have enough time to review Dean Todd's draft and told Dean Todd not to issue Dr. Raadschelders the written reprimand at the April 25th meeting. Klinger Dep. Tr. 68, 76; Todd Dep. Tr. 54-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At 10:00 a.m., HR Rep. Klinger, Dean Todd, and Dean Schneider met with Dr. Raadschelders. Klinger Dep. Tr. at 87, Ex. 8. Dr. Raadschelders informed Dean Todd, Dean Schneider, and HR Rep. Klinger that she had met with Dr. Ng and explained there was nothing more she could do for Dr. Ng, Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 50;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Schneider Dep., Ex. 25 at 3. Dr. Raadschelders notified Dean Todd, Dean Schneider, and HR Rep. Todd that she had encouraged Dr. Ng to seek help \"extra-institutionally,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , through the Ohio Civil Rights Commission or by suing Columbus State.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Raadschelders also acknowledged her job was at risk and that she did not have faculty protections, such as tenure or union support. Schneider Dep., Ex. 25 at 4. Dr. Raadschelders then suggested to Dean Schneider and Dean Todd that she might disclose damaging information about Columbus State to the Columbus Dispatch. Pl.'s Resp. (citing Schneider Dep. Tr. at 135).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Raadschelders testified that, after the April 25th meeting, she was in fear of losing her job. Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 59-60. For that reason, Dr. Raadschelders contacted HR Rep. Klinger. Klinger Dep. Tr. at 62-63. HR Rep. Klinger urged Dr. Raadschelders to let the curriculum matters lapse and told her, \"this is not your flag to fly. Let the union handle [Dr. Ng's situation].\" Klinger Dep. Tr. at 65-66. Dr. Raadschelders testified that she did not believe the union could help Dr. Ng. Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 50, 62. Further, Dr. Raadschelders told HR Rep. Klinger that she was justified in her actions, would not accept any discipline, and would hire an attorney. Klinger Dep., Ex. 4 at 3. HR Rep. Klinger assured Dr. Raadschelders that Columbus State had not terminated her and that she could return to work. Klinger Dep. Tr. at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Thereafter, HR Rep. Klinger spoke with Dean Todd. Klinger Dep. Tr. at 51; Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 60. About that conversation, Dean Todd testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   So I said to [HR Rep. Klinger], if [Dr. Raadschelders] were to say, \"look, I don't agree with this, the way in which we have to pause over these courses, but now I recognize that I've been given a directive and even though I personally disagree with it, I'm going to move forward as I should, as a chair, as a professional.\" I was hoping [Dr. Raadschelders] would say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Todd Dep. Tr. at 204. HR Rep. Klinger informed Dean Todd that Dr. Raadschelders was disinclined to accept any kind of reprimand because she felt justified in continuing to advocate for Dr. Ng's course proposals. Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 61-62. Dean Todd then recommended firing Dr. Raadschelders. Todd Dep. Tr. at 206. On May 3, 2016, at Dean Todd's recommendation, Columbus State terminated Dr. Raadschelders. Cooley Dep., Ex.

The question is whether a reasonable jury could find otherwise.

An employee who complains that the employer is retaliating against another employee engages in Title VII protected activity when the context objectively reveals that the employee is complaining about repeated abusive treatment.\n   <em>\n    Yazdian v.

Here, a reasonable jury could find that Dr. Raadschelders specifically referenced previous harassment and alleged ongoing discrimination by Columbus State faculty against Dr. Ng. She also mentioned Dr. Ng's interests in potentially suing the college. Construing all facts and making all reasonable inferences in Dr. Raadschelders' favor, a jury could conclude that when Dr. Raadschelders criticized Columbus State's actions toward Dr. Ng, she was protesting Columbus State's allegedly discriminatory treatment. Therefore, to the extent Dr. Raadschelders criticized how Columbus State treated Dr. Ng, she arguably engaged in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

A jury could find that Dean Todd's belief that Dr. Raadschelders opposition to her plan was her concern that Dr. Ng's complaints of gender-based discrimination had not been addressed. Because Dean Todd justified firing Dr. Raadschelders for insubordination, which was arguably in part at least protected activity, Dr. Raadschelders has offered direct evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Dean Todd believed Dr. Raadschelders' protected activity constituted insubordination, and therefore that Columbus State retaliatorily terminated her for engaging in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Sixth Circuit's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Yazdian\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   support this conclusion.

Columbus State concedes that Dr. Raadschelders has established the first three elements by introducing evidence that she was a woman who was qualified for her job and was fired from that position.

Columbus State contends that one is generally not replaced for purposes of a discrimination claim when other people already employed by the organization assume the terminated employee's responsibilities.
