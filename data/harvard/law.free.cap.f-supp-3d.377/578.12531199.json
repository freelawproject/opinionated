STANDARDS FOR DISABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Social Security Act (\"Act\") defines disability as the \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    Pass v.

If the ALJ finds that the claimant has been working (step one) or that the claimant's medical impairments do not meet the severity and duration requirements of the [R]egulations (step two), the process ends with a finding of \"not disabled.\" At step three, the ALJ either finds that the claimant is disabled because her impairments match a listed impairment [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a listing in 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 (\"the Listings\") ] or continues the analysis. The ALJ cannot deny benefits at this step. If the first three steps do not lead to a conclusive determination, the ALJ then assesses the claimant's residual functional capacity [\"RFC\"], which is \"the most\" the claimant \"can still do despite\" physical and mental limitations that affect her ability to work.

Tr. 14 \u00b6 2. At step two, the ALJ found that plaintiff had the following medically determinable impairments that were severe within the meaning of the Regulations: degenerative disc disease, migraines, and dysfunction of a major joint. Tr. 14 \u00b6 3. At step three, the ALJ found that plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals any of the Listings. Tr. 14 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ALJ next determined that plaintiff had the RFC to perform a limited range of sedentary work as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the claimant has the [RFC] to perform sedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a),\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   except she may use an assisted devices for prolonged ambulation and walking on uneven terrain. The claimant can climb ramps and stairs occasionally, never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, balance occasionally, stoop occasionally, kneel occasionally, crouch occasionally, and crawl occasionally. The claimant can never work at unprotected heights or with moving mechanical parts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Tr. 15 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on his determination of plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ found at step four that plaintiff was unable to perform her past relevant work. Tr. 17 \u00b6 6. At step five, the ALJ found that there were jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy that plaintiff could perform, including jobs in the occupations of order clerk, charge account clerk, and document preparer. Tr. 18-19 \u00b6 10. The ALJ therefore\n   concluded that plaintiff was not disabled from the alleged disability onset date, 17 February 2014, through the date of his decision, 1 May 2017.

The challenge here to the ALJ's appointment is neither frivolous nor disingenuous and goes to the validity of the proceeding itself. Therefore, even if issue exhaustion were deemed to apply, the court would have the discretion to consider the Appointments Clause issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cirko o/b/o Cirko v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-CV-680,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201014195\">\n    2019 WL 1014195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (M.D. Pa.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20A.K.%20Marsh.%202019\">\n    4 Mar. 2019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (relying on its reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bizarre\n   </em>\n   to hold that \"there exists no clear statutory, regulatory, or judicial authority requiring claimants to exhaust an Appointments Clause challenge before the Social Security Administration or warning that failure to do so will forfeit judicial review of that claim\" and that even if such did exist, \"the circumstances warrant an exercise of the court's discretion under\n   <em>\n    Freytag\n   </em>\n   \" because the challenge was \"neither frivolous nor disingenuous\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court finds that this is one of the \"rare cases\" contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Freytag\n   </em>\n   in which it should exercise its discretion to find that no waiver occurred, again, assuming the exhaustion requirement applied. The ALJ's statement to plaintiff about the nature and significance of the hearing he was about to conduct helps establish this case as among the \"rare ones\" and bolsters the appropriateness of finding that she did not waive her Appointments Clause claim. While it is not unusual for an ALJ to make an opening statement at a hearing, particularly to help put the claimant at ease, the statement by the ALJ here was extreme and starkly atypical in its characterization of the hearing as a benign proceeding devoid of legal consequence-that is, akin to a casual conversation in plaintiff's home about her life. The statement effectively encouraged plaintiff not to be vigilant in protecting her rights and interests during the hearing. The court declines to indulge in the presumption-which would be to the ALJ's and Commissioner's benefit-that plaintiff's counsel's handling of the hearing and the Appointments Clause claim in particular were not affected by the ALJ's statement. Under the specific circumstances presented, it would be manifestly unfair to find waiver by plaintiff of her Appointments Clause claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that the exhaustion requirement did not apply to plaintiff's Appointments Clause claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   based on the non-adversarial nature of the Social Security disability process. Alternatively, if the exhaustion requirement is deemed to apply, the court exercises its discretion under\n   <em>\n    Freytag\n   </em>\n   to find that no waiver occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Turning then to the merits of plaintiff's Appointments Clause claim, the court, in accordance with the uncontested contention of plaintiff, concludes that the ALJ who decided plaintiff's case was appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause. Particularly in light of the Social Security Administration having since corrected the appointment process, remand for a new hearing before a different ALJ is the appropriate remedy for this violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2055 ; Soc.
