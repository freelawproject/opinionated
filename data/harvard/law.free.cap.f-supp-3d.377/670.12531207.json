The plaintiffs own and operate billboards. They contend that the City's different rules for on- and off-premises signs is an unconstitutional restriction of speech under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the parties' request, the Court held a bench trial on this question on June 26, 2018. The parties submitted pretrial briefing, (Pls.' Br., Dkt. 25; City Br., Dkt. 30; Pls.' Resp., Dkt. 34), joint stipulated facts, (Dkt. 26), and proposed findings and fact and conclusions of law, (Dkts. 27, 29). Both parties then submitted post-trial briefing. (Dkts. 37, 38, 40, 42). Having considered parties' submissions, the evidence and argument at trial, and the applicable law, the Court now enters the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Reagan National Advertising of Austin, Inc. (\"Reagan\") filed 50 permit applications to install digital sign-faces on billboards throughout the Austin area. (Am. Stip. Facts, Dkt. 26, at 3). Defendant City of Austin (\"the City\") denied the applications, citing city code (\"the Sign Code\") that prohibits the installation of digital faces on \"off-premise\" signs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Shortly after, Lamar Advantage Holding Company (\"Lamar\") filed 23 permit applications, which the City denied on same grounds. (Lamar Am. Compl., Dkt. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reagan filed suit in Travis County and the City removed to federal court. (Not. Removal, Dkt. 1). Lamar joined the case as an intervenor plaintiff. (Order on Mot. Intervene, Dkt. 9). Reagan and Lamar then filed amended complaints, which assert identical causes of action and requests for relief. (Reagan Am. Compl., Dkt. 19; Lamar Am. Compl., Dkt. 13). Reagan and Lamar assert their claims based on the Sign Code in effect at the time that the City denied their permit applications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reagan Am. Compl., Dkt. 19, at 2; Lamar Am. Compl., Dkt. 13, at 2).The City revised Chapter 25-10 on August 17, 2017, after all of Plaintiffs' applications were denied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. No. 20170817-072, Dkt. 37-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reagan and Lamar assert that the distinction between on- and off-premises signs in the Austin Sign Code is an unconstitutional content-based restriction of speech, both facially and as applied to Reagan and Lamar. (Reagan Am. Compl., Dkt. 19, at 7; Lamar Am. Compl., Dkt. 13, at 5). They seek a declaratory judgment\n   that Chapter 25-10, or any relevant part of that chapter, is an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech; that it is invalid and unenforceable on its face; that it is invalid as applied to Regan and Lamar; and that Reagan and Lamar are \"allowed to convert [their] outdoor advertising signs to digital copy without having permits issued.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 37.003, 37.004 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Stipulated Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties stipulated to the following facts, which are not contradicted anywhere in the record. (Am. Stip. Facts, Dkt. 26). Although the parties submitted separate proposed findings of fact that feature slightly different wording, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 27, 29), they are identical in substance. The Court therefore adopts the Joint Proposed Amended Stipulated Facts as its own findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs Reagan and Lamar are companies in the business of outdoor advertising, which includes ownership and operation of billboards throughout the City of Austin and surrounding area. (Am. Stip. Facts, Dkt. 26, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Chapter 25-10 of the Austin Sign Code distinguishes between \"on-premise\" signs and \"off-premise\" signs. Under the Sign Code in effect at the time of Plaintiffs' applications, a sign is an \"off-premise\" sign if it advertises something not located where the sign is installed or directs people to any location other than the site of the sign itself. Section 25-10-3(11) (current version at Section 25-10-4(9) ). Billboards are off-premises signs. (Am. Stip. Facts, Dkt. 26, \u00b6 9). The Sign Code allows construction of new on-premises signs but prohibits new off-premises signs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Existing off-premises signs are deemed \"nonconforming signs,\" which were lawful when installed but no longer comply with the current Sign Code. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 25-10-3(10). The Sign Code prohibits changes to \"non-conforming signs,\" including existing off-premises signs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Sign Code allows digital sign-faces for on-premises signs but prohibits digital sign-faces for off-premises signs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 25-10-102(6) (allowing electronically controlled changeable copy signs for on-premises signs); Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b) (prohibiting any \"change in the method of technology used to convey a message\" on a non-conforming sign).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City's stated general purpose in adopting the Sign Code, including the sign regulations at issue in this lawsuit, is to protect the aesthetic value of the city and to protect public safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 17, 2017, Reagan submitted 50 permit applications to install digital sign-faces on existing sign structures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). The next month, the City of Austin denied all 50 of Reagan's applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). Reagan then submitted another 11 permit applications to install digital sign-faces on existing sign structures in June. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). In July, the City of Austin once again denied all 11 of Reagan's applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). In the denial letters, the City stated that \"[t]hese applications cannot be approved under Section 25-10-152 (\n   <em>\n    Nonconforming Signs)\n   </em>\n   because they would change the existing technology used to convey off-premise commercial messages and increase the degree of nonconformity with current regulations relating to off-premise signs.\" (First Regan Denial Letter, Dkt. 36-2, at 1 (\"Ex. J-4\"); Second Reagan Denial Letter, Dkt. 36-3, at 68 (\"Ex. J-7\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Lamar submitted 23 permit applications to install digital sign-faces on existing sign structures. (Am. Stip. Facts, Dkt. 26, \u00b6 21). In August, the City of Austin denied all of Lamar's applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). In its denial letter to Lamar, the City stated that \"[t]hese applications cannot be approved under Section 25-10-152 ... [and] the longstanding prohibition codified in Section 25-10-102 (\n   <em>\n    Signs Prohibited in All Sign Districts\n   </em>\n   ),\" which prohibits off-premises signs that are not authorized under any other provision of the Sign Code. (Lamar Denial Letter, Dkt. 36-4, at 68 (\"Ex. J-9\") ). Reagan and Lamar have submitted into evidence a complete list of the subject properties for which the City denied permits to install digital sign-faces. (Ex. A, Dkt. 26-1; Ex. B, Dkt. 26-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties also stipulate that the City amended Chapter 25-10 on August 17, 2017, after the City denied all of Reagan and Lamar's permit applications. (Am. Stip. Facts, Dkt. 26, \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ordinance No. 20170817-072, Dkt. 36-11, at 4-20; Section 25-10 (as amended 2017), Dkt. 36-12, at 1-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Additional Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court also finds the following additional facts, which were undisputed and submitted during and after the bench trial. First, the amendments to the City Code did not alter Section 25-10-152, which prohibits new digital sign-faces for billboards. Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b) (current version at Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b)(2017) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the amendments did change the definition of an \"off-premise\" sign. The old Sign Code in effect at the time of Reagan and Lamar's applications provides that an off-premises sign is \"a sign advertising a business, person, activity, goods, products, or services not located on the site where the sign is installed, or that directs persons to any location not on that site.\" Section 25-10-3(11) (current version at Section 25-10-4(9)(2017) ). The new Sign Code provides that an off-premises sign is \"a sign that displays any message directing attention to a business ... activity, events, person, institution, or other commercial message which is generally conducted ... or occurs elsewhere than on the premises where the sign is located ...\" Section 25-10-4(9) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Reagan and Lamar argue that the distinction between on-premises and off-premises signs in the Austin Sign Code is an unconstitutional content-based restriction of speech because it \"treats on-premise and off-premise signs differently and defines them in such a way that requires one to read the sign to determine which kind of sign it is and what ordinances apply.\" (Pls.' Br., Dkt. 25, at 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   They contend that \"[i]f the Sign Code must be read to determine what ordinances apply,\" it is not content-neutral and therefore subject to strict scrutiny. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before reaching the merits of Reagan and Lamar's claim, the Court must consider two preliminary questions. Now that the\n   City has amended parts of the Sign Code, is this lawsuit moot? And if their claim is otherwise moot, do Plaintiffs have a vested right to have their applications considered under the Sign Code in effect at the time that they applied?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the Court recognized and raised the possibility of mootness during the bench trial. The parties submitted argument at trial and post-trial briefing on this question. (Dkts. 37, 38, 40, 41, 42).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   If a court determines at any time that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the court lacks \"the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Miss., Inc. v.

For example, the old Sign Code in effect at the time of Reagan and Lamar's applications defines an off-premises sign as \"a sign\n   <em>\n    advertising\n   </em>\n   a business, person, activity, goods, products, or service ...,\" while the new definition is \"a sign\n   <em>\n    that displays any message\n   </em>\n   directing attention to a business ... activity, events, person, institution,\n   <em>\n    or other commercial message.\n   </em>\n   \" Section 25-10-3(11) (current version at Section 25-10-4(9)(2017) ). However, the amendments do\n   not alter the prohibition against new digital sign-faces for billboards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b) (current version at Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b)(2017) ). Moreover, the amendments do not change Reagan and Lamar's claim in this suit: that if a person must read a sign to determine which regulation applies-the on-premises provision or the off-premises provision-then that the regulation is content-based and subject to strict scrutiny. (Reagan Am. Compl., Dkt. 19, at 4-5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lamar Am. Compl., Dkt. 13, at 3 (\"The only way to determine whether a sign is an on-premise or off-premise sign is to consider the content of the sign and determine whether that content is sufficiently related to the business or service offered on the sign site.\") ). This is the sole basis of their challenge to the Sign Code. Because the amendments do not change the question before the Court, the Sign Code has not been \"sufficiently altered so as to present a substantially different controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130180\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/970/593/#p602\">\n    970 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   602 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ne.

Reagan and Lamar's claims are not moot.

The Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court now turns to the central question in this case. Reagan and Lamar ask the Court to find that the on/off premises distinction in the Sign Code in effect at the time that the City denied their permits is an unconstitutional content-based restriction of speech, facially and as applied to them. Specifically, they contend that\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

(Pls.' Br., Dkt. 25, at 3). Reagan and Lamar argue that under\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , the Sign Code's different rules for on- and off-premises signs are content-based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The City counters that the on/off-premises distinction only regulates the location of signs, not their content, and that\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   did not address the standard for on/off-premises distinctions at all.

As detailed above, an off-premises sign is \"a sign advertising a business, person, activity, goods, products, or services not located on the site where the sign is installed, or that directs persons to any location not on that site.\" Section 25-10-3(11) (current version at Section 25-10-4(9) (2017) ). The Sign Code allows digital sign-faces for on-premises signs but prohibits digital sign-faces for off-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 25-10-102(6) (allowing electronically controlled changeable copy signs for on-premises signs); Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b) (current version at Section 25-10-152(B)(2)(b)(2017) (prohibiting any \"change in the method of technology used to convey a message\" on a non-conforming sign).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   directs courts to evaluate whether a regulation is facially content based\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   whether the \"purpose and justification for the law are content based\" before a court may \"conclude that the law is content neutral and thus subject to a lower level of scrutiny.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, a court must consider whether the law is content-neutral on its face.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Court agrees with the City that the Sign Code's on/off premises distinction is facially neutral because it \"do[es] not ban or otherwise curtail discussion of any specific topics, ideas or viewpoints.\" (City Br., Dkt. 30, at 5). For example, the on/off premises distinction in the Sign Code does not impose greater restrictions for political messages, religious messages, or any other subject matter, as the impermissible regulation did in\n   <em>\n    Reed. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sign Code does not require a viewer to evaluate the topic, idea, or viewpoint on the sign in order to determine which provision applies. It only requires a viewer to determine whether the subject matter is located on the same property as the sign, or on a different property. This is a regulation based on location, not \"based on the message a speaker conveys.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2227 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sorrell\n   </em>\n   , 564 U.S. at 565,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450498,5923853\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/552/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, the City's stated \"purpose and justification\" is to \"protect the aesthetic value of the City and to protect public safety.\" (City Br., Dkt. 30, at 6). Applied without bias to different messages or speakers, community aesthetics and public safety are indeed content neutral grounds. There is no evidence in the record that the City of Austin has applied these grounds differently for different messages or\n   speakers, or that these grounds are pretext for any other purpose. The Court concludes that the Sign Code's on/off premises distinction is content neutral both facially and in its purpose and justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because the Sign Code's on/off-premises distinction is content-neutral, the Court applies the intermediate scrutiny standard for commercial speech restrictions from\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson.\n   </em>\n   Neither party disputes the first requirement: the regulated speech \"concerns lawful activity and is not misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    453 U.S. at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   , 447 U.S. at 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). For the second requirement, the City of Austin submits that the distinction for on/off-premises signs is intended to \"protect the aesthetic value of the City and to protect public safety.\" (City Br., Dkt. 30, at 6). Reagan and Lamar argue that \"no compelling interest is being served, nor can the regulation be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" (Pls.' Br., Dkt. 25, at 12). But\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   directly contradicts Reagan and Lamar: \"Nor can there be substantial doubt that the twin goals that the ordinance seeks to further-traffic safety and the appearance of the city-are substantial governmental goals.\"\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    453 U.S. at 507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the third requirement, that a regulation must \"directly advance\" a government's substantial interest, the Supreme Court further stated that courts should \"hesitate to disagree with the accumulated, common-sense judgments of local lawmakers ... that billboards are real and substantial hazards to traffic safety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Such [a]esthetic judgments are necessarily subjective, defying objective evaluation, and for that reason must be carefully scrutinized to determine if they are only a public rationalization of an impermissible purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723119\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/490/#p507\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
