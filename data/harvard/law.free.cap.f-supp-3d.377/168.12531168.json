Ominously, Desir warns that \"a great fraud and conspiracy has been perpetrated on the people of America. The American Bar ... was established by people with treasonous goals in mind.\" <em>Id.</em> at 24. In short, Desir makes as plain as day what her grievance is and what she wants a federal court to do to remedy it. Without comment on the merits of her grievance against the \"system\", and surely the grievance she articulates is in dispute among the body politic generally, it is crystal clear that the only way for the Court to remedy that grievance is to set aside the state court judgment of foreclosure. The road to that destination, however, runs through state court, not this Court.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-28\">For example, Desir alleges that \"[t]he mortgage is a security agreement which [she] signed fraudulently.\" Compl. at 4.

Apr. 17, 2013) (plaintiff's RESPA and TILA claims were \"merely an impermissible collateral attack of a state court judgment of foreclosure\").</p><p id=\"p-22\">This suit, which attacks a final judgment of foreclosure and sale previously rendered in state court, falls squarely within the bounds of <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> . At the outset, Desir describes it as an \"interpleader action\"</p><p id=\"p-23\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"173\" href=\"#p173\" id=\"p173\">*173</a>seeking \"relief from a judgment or order\" under Rule 60(b). Compl. at 4-5. Her core grievance concerns BNY's pursuit of foreclosure without \"any lawful proof of claim and standing\"; as part of the relief sought, she asks BNY to dismiss the state court proceeding. <em>Id.</em> at 7, 12. She connects the defendants to the foreclosure judgment in myriad ways, under the common thread that they all claim \"entitlements\" to the property. For instance, she summarily alleges that BoA, Bayview and Frenkel Lambert acted as \"third party debt collectors\" in relation to the foreclosure action. <em>Id.</em> at 8-9. She also contends that BNY and MERS \"recorded a fraudulent assignment of mortgage\" on the property, thus calling into question any entity's standing to foreclose. <em>Id.</em> at 6, 12.</p><p id=\"p-25\">Broadening focus, Desir purports to bring claims for fraud, which might survive <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> if the fraudulent conduct alleged did not lie at the core of the very loan agreement that was not only found valid in state court but was enforced by its judgment. For example, she claims that JPMCB committed \"fraud and unjust enrichment\" in relation to a loan it extended to her, because \"Carlyne Desir funded the loan, which the bank still has not repaid me for! ... I'm the creditor because I put up the security for the loan.\" Compl. at 11. Certainly, had Desir's complaint given any indication that the fraudulent conduct at the center of the claim related to something other than the making of the foreclosed loan agreement, that is, something independent of a challenged state court judgment, such claims would not implicate <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> <em>.</em> <em>See</em> <em>Graham v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306139\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/156/491/#p507\">156 F.Supp.3d 491</extracted-citation>, 507-08 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (claims alleging invalid assignment of note upon which foreclosure was based barred by <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> while claims alleging breach of separate loan modification agreement not barred). But, attacking the very contract enforced by the state court as fraudulent is a claim that cannot be stated independently <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"174\" href=\"#p174\" id=\"p174\">*174</a>of the prior state court judgment; thus, <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> bars it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-26\">II. <em>Failure to State a Claim</em></p><p id=\"p-27\">Even if there were subject matter jurisdiction, the complaint would nevertheless fail on 12(b)(6) grounds, as it consists entirely of conclusory and speculative allegations that fail to state a claim under any cause of action. Desir purports to assert federal claims for violations of FDCPA, TILA, FCRA, RESPA, and RICO, and state law claims for fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and defamation. As BNY and Bayview correctly observe, the \"disorganized and incomprehensible\" complaint does not meet the pleading standards set forth under <em>Twombly</em> <em>/</em> <em>Iqbal</em> and Rule 8(a)(2), \"consisting instead of a series of legal conclusions and bald references to causes of action, without any factual support.\" BNY/Bayview Mem. at 8.</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">a unilateral contract with no Duty or Performance signature by Defendant to provide any consideration whatsoever to Plaintiff. Until such a time that Defendant comes forth with proof of damages by providing original wet ink contract, and agrees to provide such lawful proof under oath, Plaintiff believes Defendant demand(s) [<em>sic</em> ] is entirely based on Hearsay, and that there is no lawful proof to the contrary, and therefore no controversy whatsoever before the Court to for foreclosure [<em>sic</em> ] on my property.</p><p id=\"p-30\">Compl. at 7. In addition to these nonsensical attacks on the loan agreement, she repeatedly intones the names of various causes of action with no factual development whatsoever, such as: \"CPA Audit is Fraud and GAAP Violation. FRAUD, violations of UCC 3-501, and Unjust enrichment .... BOA breach of contract and fiduciary duties.\" Compl. at 8. In a rambling manner, she asserts that \"Frenkel Lambert Weiss, LLP Attorneys' statements are hearsay, counsels [<em>sic</em> ] do not have personal knowledge of the note, mortgage, deed, or my property\", (<em>id.</em> at 10); \"[defendants] began writing defamatory things about the plaintiff and prepared documents containing per se false, unfair and defamatory statements about plaintiff\", (<em>id.</em> ); and \"defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress on plaintiff. Defendants [have] intentionally cause[d] me emotional distress, caused plaintiff suffering, mental and emotional distress .... this damages my reputation intentionally, recklessly, and with malice, spite and ill will\", (<em>id.</em> ; <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em> at 12-14). No context is given for these extreme and conclusory allegations.</p><p id=\"p-31\">Plaintiff has failed to state a claim with regard to any of the causes of action recited, in rote and seemingly endless fashion, throughout the complaint. Accordingly, even if the Court were to have subject matter jurisdiction over such claims, dismissal would still be warranted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Gonzalez v. Option One Mortg. Corp.</em> , No. 3:12-CV-1470 (CSH), <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202475893\">2014 WL 2475893</extracted-citation>, at *13 (D.

Nor to the extent that a statute on plaintiff's laundry list of statutory violations might afford her a right of action on the grievances she asserts does the complaint give indication that any attempted amendment would be anything but futile.</p><p id=\"p-32\"><em>Conclusion</em></p><p id=\"p-33\">In line with the foregoing, the motions to dismiss are granted and the action is dismissed without prejudice except as to its refiling in federal court. Furthermore, plaintiff is hereby placed on notice that the re-assertion of the same claims against defendants in any future action filed in federal court may present grounds for sanctions. The Clerk of Court is directed to mail a copy of this Order to <em>pro se</em> plaintiff, to enter judgment, and to close this case for administrative purposes.</p><p id=\"p-34\">So Ordered.</p><p id=\"p-37\">Complaint page references are to ECF pagination.</p><p id=\"p-38\">Off on the other foot, Stewart Title has elected to move for summary judgment, pursuant to Rule 56. Plaintiff has filed an opposition to that motion, styled as a cross-motion for summary judgment. <em>See</em> Stewart Title Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. 78; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. 80. Stewart Title notes that the complaint \"contains only two paragraphs concerning [it] ... which consist of a string of nonsensical phrases lacking any specific factual allegations\" and purporting to assert claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. Stewart Title Mem. at 3, Dkt. 78-15. In light of the Court's findings, <em>infra</em> pages 173-74 and 174-75, that plaintiff's challenge to the foreclosure judgment is barred by <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> and plaintiff has failed to state any viable claims falling outside the scope of <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> , the claims against Stewart Title are dismissed on that basis and plaintiff's purported cross-motion is denied.</p><p id=\"p-39\">The background facts are taken from the complaint. <em>See</em> <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473125\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/147/#p153\">282 F.3d 147</extracted-citation>, 153 (2d Cir. 2002). All facts alleged in plaintiff's pleadings are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are drawn in her favor. <em>Vietnam Ass'n for Victims of Agent Orange v. Dow Chem. Co.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869707\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/104/#p115\">517 F.3d 104</extracted-citation>, 115 (2d Cir. 2008).</p><p id=\"p-40\">The complaint also references a 2012 state court foreclosure action initiated by BNY against the property, which did not reach a final judgment; the last filing on the docket is BNY's Notice of Intent to Prosecute. <em>See</em> Apr. 25, 2017 Notice, Dkt. 28, <em>Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (CWALT 2006-31</em> <em>B) v. Carlyne Desir et al.</em> , No. 502162/2012. Desir appears to construe the two suits as one foreclosure action, though the complaint here primarily focuses on the 2015 action. The Court takes judicial notice of the state court filings. <em>See</em> <em>AQ Consulting WLL v. Branca</em> , No. 10-CV-7496 (AKH), <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20240812\">2011 WL 240812</extracted-citation>, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 2011) (taking judicial notice of state court filings on motion to dismiss).</p><p id=\"p-41\">In her other opposition filings, plaintiff makes similar arguments and reiterates the allegations from the complaint. <em>See, e.g.</em> , Pl.'s Opp'n to MERS Mot., Dkt. 58; Pl.'s Opp'n to BoA Mot. at 4, Dkt. 61 (referring to state court as \"a Kangaroo court, sham legal proceedings\"); Pl.'s Opp'n to Frenkel Lambert Mot., Dkt. 76; Pl.'s Opp'n to JPMCB Mot., Dkt. 72-13; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J.</p><p id=\"p-42\">To the extent that plaintiff seeks to assert state law claims unconnected to her challenge to the foreclosure judgment, such as for defamation, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Webster v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</em> , No. 08-CV-10145, <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205178654\">2009 WL 5178654</extracted-citation>, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2009) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where \"nearly all of Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the <em>Rooker</em> <em>-</em> <em>Feldman</em> doctrine\" and the pendent claims \"are implausible under <em>Iqbal</em> \").</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
