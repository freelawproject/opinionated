After the Court dismissed several of the claims in an earlier complaint (Dkt. No. 28), Haley filed the operative First Amended Class Action Complaint (Dkt. No. 35).

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with this case, on the basis of the Court's Opinion addressing TIAA's prior motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haley v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass'n of Am.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 855,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201585673\">\n    2018 WL 1585673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2018). The following facts are taken from the First Amended Class Action Complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") and are assumed true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Melissa Haley is an employee of Washington University (\"WashU\") and a participant in the Washington University Retirement Savings Plan (\"the Plan\"), an employee pension benefit plan regulated by ERISA. (Dkt. No. 35 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13.) The Plan offers participants the opportunity to take out a loan against a portion of their retirement accounts. (Compl. \u00b6 31; Dkt. No. 35-1 at 2.) The Plan contracted with two outside vendors, Vanguard and Defendant TIAA, to administer these loans. (Compl. \u00b6 45; Dkt. No. 35-1 at 3.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For loans administered by TIAA, participants are required \"to borrow from Defendant's general account rather than from the participant's own account.\" (Compl. \u00b6 24.) Thus, participants must first \"transfer 110% of the amount of the loan from the participant's plan account ... to one of Defendant's general account products,\" which \"pay a fixed rate of interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The amount transferred to a general account product serves as the collateral securing the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The participant then repays the loan to Defendant's general account, which also earns the interest paid on the loan. (Compl. \u00b6 26.) TIAA retains for itself the difference, or \"spread,\" between (a) the interest rate paid to participants with respect to the loan collateral and (b) the amounts earned by TIAA on investments from its general account and from interest paid by participants on the loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 26-28.) In other words, participants do not receive the full amount of the interest they earn on their collateral, because some of it (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"spread\") is taken by TIAA as compensation for administering the loan. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between 2011 and 2015, Plaintiff took out four separate participant loans, which TIAA has administered. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14.) Plaintiff has fully repaid the first two loans, and she is in the process of repaying the two outstanding loans. (Compl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed this putative class action in February 2017, claiming that Defendant's administration of retirement loans to Plan participants (the \"loan program\") violates ERISA. (Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiff alleged both that TIAA itself violated its duties as an ERISA fiduciary, and that TIAA is liable as a nonfiduciary for breaches by the Plan Administrator, WashU. (Dkt. No. 5 \u00b6\u00b6 48-80.) TIAA moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. No. 20.) On March 28, 2018, the Court granted the motion to dismiss in part, holding that Plaintiff had standing to bring this action, but that she had not plausibly alleged that TIAA qualified as an ERISA fiduciary. (Dkt. No. 28 at 6, 14.) With respect to Plaintiff's claims for equitable relief against TIAA as a nonfiduciary, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, and granted Plaintiff leave to amend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed the First Amended Class Action Complaint on May 3, 2018. (Dkt. No. 35.) Counts I through III of the Amended Complaint again allege that TIAA itself violated its duties as an ERISA fiduciary. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-77.) And Counts V through VII allege that TIAA is liable as a nonfiduciary for breaches by the Plan Administrator. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-80.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   TIAA now moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), or for an order striking the class allegations in the Amended Complaint under Rule 12(f).

Threshold Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before addressing whether Haley has plausibly alleged each of her claims, the Court must resolve a threshold disagreement between the parties about the elements of these claims and the framework for assessing them at the motion to dismiss stage. This disagreement has two facets: (1) which party bears the burden with regard to demonstrating that any \u00a7 408 exemptions are satisfied; and (2) what level of knowledge plaintiffs must allege as to a nonfiduciary participating in a prohibited transaction under \u00a7 406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Section 408 Exemption as an Affirmative Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Haley takes the position that she need not \"plead facts that refute Defendant['s] affirmative defenses that TIAA's loan program falls within a Section 408(b) exemption,\" because \"such exemptions are affirmative defenses\" that the Defendant \"bears the burden of proving by a preponderance.\" (Dkt. No. 40 at 13-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9 n.9.) TIAA counters that \"an ERISA plaintiff has the burden of pleading\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   elements of a non-fiduciary claim,\" including that the \u00a7 408 exemptions are\n   inapplicable in a particular case.

No. 41 at 2 n.3.) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   TIAA identifies no cases that have squarely considered the issue and held that, inconsistent with the treatment of\n   <em>\n    fiduciary\n   </em>\n   defendants, the applicability of a \u00a7 408 exemption is not an affirmative defense for\n   <em>\n    non-fiduciary\n   </em>\n   defendants, and\n   <em>\n    non-fiduciary\n   </em>\n   defendants do not bear the ultimate burden of satisfying the exemption. Nor does the Court see any good justification for creating this distinction. Non-fiduciary defendants charged with knowing participation in prohibited transactions are equally well-suited to invoke a \u00a7 408 exemption to avoid liability. As to TIAA's argument that non-fiduciaries have no duty to avoid prohibited transactions,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   established that non-fiduciaries have a duty \"imposed by \u00a7 502(a)(3) itself\" not to knowingly participate in violations of ERISA.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    530 U.S. at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Non-fiduciaries can thus invoke \u00a7 408 exemptions to demonstrate that this duty was not breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, it makes little sense to require a plaintiff to identify and refute each potentially applicable exemption in the complaint.

It would be unnecessarily complicated and duplicative to require plaintiffs to bear the burden of alleging and proving the non-applicability of a \u00a7 408 exemption as to some defendants but not others; or to require plaintiffs to adequately plead the non-applicability prophylactically, in the event that they lose on the argument that defendant is a fiduciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The conclusion that fiduciary and non-fiduciary defendants should bear the same burden of demonstrating the applicability of a \u00a7 408 exemption is consistent with cases that have treated the exemptions as an affirmative defense.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicability of a \u00a7 408 exemption is an affirmative defense on which such non-fiduciary defendants bear the ultimate burden. As such, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) based on the application of a \u00a7 408 exemption is warranted only if it is \"clear from the face of the Complaint or judicially noticed court filings that the Plan's use of proprietary funds falls within an available exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Moreno v.

But in order to determine whether that is indeed the case, the Court must first establish the contours of the applicable knowledge requirement. TIAA contends that the complaint must include \"non-conclusory allegations that WashU and TIAA knew not only that the transactions occurred, but also that the transactions were not exempt under 408(b).\" (Dkt. No. 39 at 8.) Haley takes the contrasting position that a plaintiff need not allege awareness of the non-applicability of a \u00a7 408 exemption on the part of the fiduciary or non-fiduciary defendant. (Compl. at 27 n.6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 41 at 2-3 (characterizing Haley's position on this point).)

Those circumstances, in turn, involve a showing that the\n   <em>\n    plan fiduciary\n   </em>\n   , with actual or constructive knowledge of the facts satisfying the elements of a \u00a7 406(a) transaction, caused the plan to engage in the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    530 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under its most natural reading, this language suggests that the non-fiduciary needs to know: (1) that the transferor is an ERISA plan fiduciary; (2) that the fiduciary caused the plan to engage in the transaction; (3) that the fiduciary had knowledge of the facts underlying the transaction that subjected it to \u00a7 406(a); and (4) any facts relevant to the transaction that bring it under \u00a7 406(a).

In other words, to survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs need not plausibly allege that the fiduciary and non-fiduciaries involved knew that the transaction at issue was a \"prohibited transaction\" under \u00a7 406(a) that did not fall within an exemption under \u00a7 408(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, as explained\n   above,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   generally requires plaintiffs to plausibly allege that non-fiduciary transferee defendants knew they were transacting with an ERISA fiduciary, and knew the factual circumstances underlying the transaction that are relevant to the application of \u00a7 406(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This result is supported by the Court's conclusion above regarding the status of \u00a7 408 exemptions as an affirmative defense. Fiduciary and non-fiduciary defendants bear the ultimate burden of proving that their conduct was exempt from \u00a7 406 liability under \u00a7 408, and at the motion to dismiss stage a plaintiff need only allege sufficient facts in the complaint such that it is not clear that an exemption applies. It would be incongruous to require plaintiffs to allege sufficient facts only to put the application of a \u00a7 408 exemption in question at the motion to dismiss stage, but to simultaneously require plaintiffs to plausibly allege that defendants knew their conduct was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   covered by an exemption. Declining to impose such a scienter requirement is thus consistent with the allocation of the ultimate burden of proving that an otherwise prohibited transaction is exempt, which lies with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court's holding regarding the applicable knowledge requirement is also consistent with the nature of prohibited transactions under ERISA. \"Congress enacted ERISA \u00a7 406(a)(1), which supplements the fiduciary's general duty of loyalty to the plan's beneficiaries, \u00a7 404(a), by categorically barring certain transactions deemed 'likely to injure the pension plan.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    530 U.S. at 241-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Comm'r v.

Conversely, declining to impose a scienter requirement on fiduciaries and non-fiduciary defendants is consistent with the treatment of \u00a7 406 prohibited transactions as\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violations of ERISA which pose unique risks to the\n   health of the plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"243128\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/991/278/\">\n    991 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   306 n.30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   TIAA raises two arguments against this result, which the Court finds unpersuasive. First, TIAA contends that these knowledge standards, coupled with the broad text of \u00a7 406(a), would impermissibly \"force[ non-fiduciary transferees] into discovery in every single case.\" (Dkt. No. 41 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

But this will not necessarily be true. Although plaintiffs have \"no duty to negate the availability of [a] section 408(b)[ ] affirmative defense,\" and need not demonstrate that defendants knew the transaction violated \u00a7 406 or did not satisfy an exemption under \u00a7 408, courts \"must still consider whether the facts alleged in the Complaint plainly establish [an] exemption's applicability.\"\n   <em>\n    Bekker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204636841\">\n    2018 WL 4636841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (emphasis omitted).

No. 41 at 3.) But the Court's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   imposes a greater knowledge requirement on non-fiduciaries. Whereas plaintiffs must plausibly allege that a fiduciary transferor knew only the facts underlying the \u00a7 406 violation, plaintiffs must allege that the non-fiduciary transferee also knew those factual circumstances, in addition to the facts that the transferor was an ERISA fiduciary and caused the transaction with the knowledge of the underlying facts. And concerns that \u00a7 406 would impose too high a burden on the non-fiduciary defendants can be accommodated by \"inform[ing] courts' determinations of what a transferee should (or should not) be expected to know when engaging in a transaction with a fiduciary.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    530 U.S. at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Section 406(a)(1)(B) Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, Haley contends that in causing the plan to lend money to plan participants through TIAA's loan program, WashU has violated ERISA \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) and TIAA has knowingly participated in that violation. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 78-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Section 406(a)(1)(B) prohibits fiduciaries from causing a plan to engage in a transaction that \"constitutes a direct or indirect ... lending of money or other extension of credit between the plan and a party in interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The corresponding exemption for this conduct can be found in \u00a7 408(b)(1), which provides that the prohibitions in \u00a7 406 do not apply to \"[a]ny loans made by the plan to parties in interest who are participants or beneficiaries of the plan if such loans ... bear a reasonable rate of interest,\" and satisfy other enumerated conditions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Regulations regarding the application of the \u00a7 408(b)(1) exemption provide in part that \"a loan program containing a precondition designed to benefit a party in interest (other than the participant) is not afforded relief by section 408(b)(1) or this regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .408b-1(a)(3)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Haley contends that TIAA's loan program is prohibited by \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B), and does not satisfy the \u00a7 408(b)(1) exemption because it does not bear a reasonable rate of interest, and the requirement that funds be transferred to TIAA to serve as collateral constitutes a precondition designed to benefit TIAA. (Dkt. No. 40 at 3.) In seeking dismissal of this claim, TIAA argues that Haley has not sufficiently alleged: (i) the elements of a \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) violation; (ii) knowledge; and (iii) the inapplicability of the \u00a7 408(b)(1) exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (i) TIAA argues that its loan program does not fall within \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) because it involves the lending of money \"between two different parties in interest,\" instead of \"between the Plan and a party in interest.\" (Dkt. No. 39 at 17; Dkt. No. 41 at 4.) The Court rejects this argument as foreclosed by the statute on its face: Section 406(a)(1)(B) proscribes both direct and\n   <em>\n    indirect\n   </em>\n   loans from the plan to participants. Enlisting a service provider to administer loans, with funds from the plan, constitutes such an \"indirect\" loan subject to this prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (ii) The bulk of TIAA's argument on the \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) claim is directed at knowledge. TIAA contends that Haley did not sufficiently allege that WashU or TIAA knew that the loan program was not exempt under \u00a7 408(b)(1). (Dkt. No. 39 at\n   15-19.) As the Court explained above, however, the Amended Complaint must allege knowledge of certain underlying facts, but not knowledge that the transaction at issue violated ERISA. The applicable knowledge requirement is satisfied here: Haley plausibly alleged that TIAA knew it was transacting with an ERISA fiduciary, and that WashU and TIAA knew that the loan program involved the indirect lending of money between the Plan and plan participants. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, 15, 45, 83-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (iii) Finally, TIAA argues that its loan program is exempt under \u00a7 408(b)(1). In support of this contention, TIAA notes that its loan program is structured similarly to other permissible participant loan programs. (Dkt. No. 39 at 16;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n    at 10-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (surveying history of collateralized loan programs and differences between 403 and 401(k) plans).) As TIAA observes, Plaintiff does not respond to this specific argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 41 at 6.) And the point is well taken: that TIAA uses assets in an annuity contract as collateral for its participant loans, and funds the loans from its general account, alone does not render the administration of its loan program a nonexempt prohibited transaction. But the fact that similarly structured programs\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   comply with ERISA's provisions and regulations does not mean that\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   program is necessarily compliant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Additionally, TIAA argues that Haley does not plausibly allege that the interest rate TIAA receives for the loan was unreasonable. (Dkt. No. 39 at 17.) This is tantamount to an argument that the \u00a7 408(b)(1) exemption clearly applies on the face of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As discussed above, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of a \u00a7 406(a) claim is appropriate where a defendant raises a \u00a7 408 exemption \"as an affirmative defense and it is clear from the face of the complaint, and matters of which the court may take judicial notice, that the plaintiff's claims are barred as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Sewell v.

Dismissal of the \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) claim is thus inappropriate unless it is clear on the face of the Complaint that the loans administered by TIAA \"bear a reasonable rate of interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Haley contends that the Plan \"does not receive a reasonable rate of interest\" from the participant loans because TIAA charged a \"loan interest rate of 4.44%\" to participants but only paid a rate of 3% to the Plan. (Dkt. No. 40 at 3.) As the relevant regulations explain, a loan \"bear[s] a reasonable rate of interest if such loan provides the plan with a return commensurate with the interest rates charged by persons in the business of lending money for loans which would be made under similar circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .408b-1(e). It is not clear from the face of the Amended Complaint that the rate of return ultimately paid to the Plan-3%-is commensurate with rates charged for similar\n   loans. The fact that the only other loan interest rates alleged in the Amended Complaint-the 4.44% and 4.17% interest paid to TIAA by plan participants-is noticeably larger supports the inference that the plan loans may not bear a reasonable rate of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For this reason, the Court cannot conclude that \u00a7 408(b)(1) clearly exempts TIAA's loan program from liability. Accordingly, because Haley has adequately alleged the application of \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) and the requisite knowledge of the fiduciary and defendant non-fiduciary, TIAA's motion to dismiss the \u00a7 406(a)(1)(B) claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 94-99.) Section 406(a)(1)(C) prohibits transactions that constitute the direct or indirect \"furnishing of goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party in interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C). Section 408(b)(2) exempts certain transactions from the prohibitions of \u00a7 406(a)(1)(C), where they comprise contracts \"for office space, or legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan,\" and where \"no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .408b-2.

(Dkt. No. 39 at 19-20.) Applying the proper knowledge standard discussed above, however, the Court concludes that the Amended Complaint plausibly alleges that TIAA knew that WashU was an ERISA fiduciary causing this transaction, and that both entities knew or should have known the underlying facts that bring their service agreement within the prohibition of \u00a7 406(a)(1)(C). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10; 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (ii) TIAA also argues that dismissal is required because the Amended Complaint alleges insufficient facts to demonstrate that the fees paid to TIAA for administering the loan program are unreasonably excessive. (Dkt. No. 39 at 20.) Haley responds, in part, that the structure of the TIAA loan program compared to Vanguard's loan program, and the nature of asset-based fees, supports the conclusion that TIAA received unreasonable compensation for administering its loan program. (Dkt. No. 40 at 16.) As TIAA observes, however, the Court already rejected these allegations in its March 28, 2018 Opinion as \"insufficient to state a claim for knowingly excessive compensation.\" (Dkt. No. 28 at 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 41 at 8.) The Court thus considers the two new allegations offered by Haley in the Amended Complaint to determine whether they move her excessive compensation claim over the line from possible to plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, the Amended Complaint characterizes TIAA's compensation in a new way; instead of the gap between the interest earned by TIAA on the loan and the interest rate TIAA pays on the collateral (Dkt. No. 5 \u00b6 18), Haley now alleges that TIAA earns the larger difference between \"the amount Defendant earns on investments in its general account and the amount that Defendant credits to participants on the posted collateral\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27). Haley contends that the magnitude of this investment income earned-which is \"materially more than the interest that Defendant pays the participant on the collateral securing\n   repayment of the loan\" (Compl. \u00b6 26)-makes the compensation unreasonably excessive (Dkt. No. 40 at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   TIAA counters that the only allegations that it \"earned greater interest than it paid to plan participants\" are made \"on information and belief,\" which are \"inadequate to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Twombly/Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   \" (Dkt. No. 41 at 7-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 97.) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Second Circuit has held that allegations made \"on information and belief\" satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   pleading threshold under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228260\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/110/#p120\">\n    604 F.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (2d Cir. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Negrete v.

Such circumstances include when the facts pleaded are \"peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant or where the belief is based on factual information that makes the inference of culpability plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Arista\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228260\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/110/#p120\">\n    604 F.3d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). Here, the first exception applies: The investment income that TIAA earns on its general account is information uniquely within TIAA's possession. The Court will thus consider these allegations as supporting Haley's excessive compensation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, Haley contends that TIAA's failure to disclose to WashU the total compensation TIAA received in administering the loan program-contrary to the applicable regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202550\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .408b-2(c)(1) -supports the inference that those fees were excessive. (Dkt. No. 40 at 15-16.) And the Amended Complaint, after reviewing the relevant regulations, states that \"[n]one of the Annual Returns for the Washington University Plan filed with the US Department of Labor on Form 5500 contain any information or disclosure that Defendant is receiving indirect compensation with respect to the loan program by keeping a portion of the interest on paid [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] by plan participants on amounts borrowed from their own accounts.\" (Compl. \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   TIAA argues that this allegation does not support Haley's claim, because the Amended Complaint does not allege \"that TIAA failed to comply with its regulatory disclosure requirements,\" and \"TIAA has no responsibility for the Plan's Annual Returns.\" (Dkt. No. 41 at 8.) Again, the Court is unpersuaded. Haley alleges that WashU is not reporting on its annual return to the Department of Labor any indirect compensation that TIAA received through administering the loan program. (Compl. \u00b6 50.) The reasonable inference from this allegation is that TIAA is either failing to disclose its indirect compensation to WashU,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   or WashU is failing to report this compensation to the government. Either circumstance raises a red flag about the propriety of the level of compensation received by TIAA in connection with the loan program. This allegation thus serves as the kind of \"evidence of self-dealing or other disloyal conduct\" that enables plaintiffs to state a claim for excessive compensation.\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204358769\">\n    2017 WL 4358769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Overall, the collective allegations in the Amended Complaint plausibly establish that the \u00a7 408(b)(2) safe harbor does not clearly exempt the conduct at issue. Accordingly, TIAA's motion to dismiss the excessive compensation claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Section 406(a)(1)(D) Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, Haley claims that TIAA's loan program violates ERISA \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8, 86-93.) Section 406(a)(1)(D) prohibits transactions that constitute a \"transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of a party in interest, of any assets of the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D). Under the corresponding safe harbor, transfers of plan assets to service providers are exempt where, in connection with the transfer, \"the plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1108(b)(17)(A). \"[I]n the case of an asset other than a security for which there is a generally recognized market,\" adequate consideration means \"the fair market value of the asset as determined in good faith by a fiduciary or fiduciaries.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1108(b)(17)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In the March 28, 2018 Opinion, the Court held that Haley \"adequately alleged that the transfer of [plan] assets to a party in interest was a prohibited transaction under ERISA \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D),\" and this claim thus survived TIAA's motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 28 at 21.) Nonetheless, TIAA argues that this claim is deficiently alleged in the Amended Complaint on three bases: (i) existence of a prohibited transaction under \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D); (ii) knowledge; (iii) inapplicability of \u00a7 408(b)(17). (Dkt. No. 39 at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (i) According to TIAA, its loan program does not constitute the \"use\" for its benefit of \"plan assets\" as a matter of law, because the loan collateral it is \"using\" does not constitute a \"plan asset\" under ERISA's guaranteed benefit policy exception, \u00a7 401(b)(2). (Dkt. No. 39 at 21.) But in making this argument TIAA is trying to cast Haley as asserting a \"use\" claim, rather than a \"transfer\" claim. (Dkt. No. 39 at 21 n.28; Dkt. No. 41 at 4-5.) This characterization is contrary to the Amended Complaint, which alleges both prohibited \"transfer\" and \"use.\" (Compl. \u00b6 90 (\"Defendant's loan program on its face requires a transfer of plan assets, or use of plan assets by or for the benefit of Defendant, resulting from the mandatory transfer of plan assets from a borrowing participant's selected investment choices into Defendant's general account, which Defendant invests along with the other assets of its general account for its own benefit[.]\").) And in her opposition brief, Haley disclaims any attempt to allege prohibited \"use\" under \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D), arguing that TIAA's argument regarding the status of the collateral was \"irrelevant\" to her allegations about the unlawful \"transfer.\" (Dkt. No. 40 at 21-22.) Accordingly, the Court construes the Amended Complaint as alleging only a transfer in violation of \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D) and rejects TIAA's guaranteed benefit policy argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (ii) Again, TIAA argues that Haley was required to-and failed to-allege knowledge that the transfer was not exempt on the part of WashU and TIAA. (Dkt. No. 39 at 21.) But TIAA does not challenge whether WashU and TIAA knew of the facts underlying the transaction that brought it within the scope of \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D). Under the Court's formulation of this requirement, Haley has plausibly alleged the requisite knowledge to survive a motion to dismiss. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, 91-92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (iii) Finally, TIAA claims that the application of the exemption in ERISA \u00a7 408(b)(17) is clear from the face of the Amended Complaint, because \"the Complaint lacks non-conclusory allegations that the Plan received less or paid more than adequate consideration in connection with\n   TIAA's loan product.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 41 at 5; Dkt. No. 39 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court concludes that is it not clear from the face of the Amended Complaint that the Plan received no less and paid no more than adequate consideration for TIAA's administration of participant loans. The complaint contains no allegations regarding the \"the fair market value\" of the service \"as determined in good faith by\" WashU.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(17)(B)(ii). Instead, the complaint indicates that TIAA receives different levels of compensation for the same service due to the asset-based nature of its loan program (Compl. \u00b6 97), which raises doubts regarding whether that compensation is always no more than \"adequate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Because the Court cannot determine at this stage that \u00a7 408(b)(17) exempts the loan program from liability-and Haley has adequately alleged the other elements of a \u00a7 40(a)(1)(D) claim-TIAA's motion to dismiss this claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Equitable Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, TIAA moves to dismiss Counts V through VII on the ground that the Amended Complaint seeks relief that is unavailable under ERISA. TIAA contends that this is a suit for legal relief-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , monetary damages-but ERISA permits only equitable relief from non-fiduciaries. (Dkt. No. 39 at 22-24.) Notably, however, TIAA's argument ignores the fact that the Court already rejected this argument in its previous Opinion. (Dkt. No. 28 at 14-17.) Reviewing the Amended Complaint, the Court sees no reason to revisit its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Admittedly, a change was made in the Amended Complaint that pertains to the issue of relief. Whereas the previous complaint specifically requested \"disgorgement of the proceeds of the illegal arrangement\" (Dkt. No. 5 \u00b6 83), the Amended Complaint does not expressly request disgorgement by name. But this omission seems related to a mistake whereby Plaintiff claimed that \"Defendant is liable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) for losses ... resulting from the breaches of fiduciary duty alleged in this Count\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 85, 93, 99), even though \u00a7 1109(a) applies only to fiduciary defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 40 at 22 (admitting to the \"erroneous[ ]\" citation).) Regardless, the content of \u00a7 1109(a) makes clear that what Plaintiff truly seeks is disgorgement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (providing that fiduciaries \"shall be personally liable to ... restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan\"). And Plaintiff's reply brief confirms the point. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 40 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Furthermore, the other aspects of the complaint that were relevant to the Court's prior decision on this question remain the same: Haley seeks to \"[e]njoin Defendant from ... further engaging in transactions prohibited by ERISA,\" and requests \"other equitable ... relief as appropriate.\" (Compl. at 29 &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 85, 93, 99.) And the substance of her claims are unchanged: \"she alleges that TIAA unjustly generated profits from her property after obtaining that property as loan collateral via a transaction that allegedly violated \u00a7 406(a) of ERISA.\" (Dkt. No. 28 at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the Opinion of March 28, 2018, the Court rejects Defendant's contention that Counts V through VII must be dismissed for seeking legal relief unauthorized under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Specifically, TIAA claims that striking these allegations is appropriate because the Amended Complaint fails to adequately allege the requisite knowledge on behalf of any other plan fiduciary or for TIAA with respect to\n   any other plan. (Dkt. No. 39 at 25.) Haley responds that TIAA's arguments in support of its motion to strike will be the focus of class certification, and that the Amended Complaint adequately alleges that the practices at issue apply to all TIAA's participant loan programs.

(Dkt. No. 5 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) In the Amended Complaint, Haley frames the spread slightly differently as encompassing not only \"the spread between the rate provided by the general account product in which the collateral is held and the interest rate of the loan, but also the even greater spread between the rate of return on the assets contained in Defendant's general account and the interest rate of the loan.\" (Compl. \u00b6 40.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Court notes that the Amended Complaint alleges only six counts.

(Dkt. No. 39 at 8; Dkt. No. 41 at 3.) In that Opinion, the Court held that Plaintiff had not adequately alleged that both WashU and TIAA knew that TIAA was receiving unreasonably excessive compensation, so as to fall outside the \u00a7 408(b)(2) exemption. (Dkt. No. 28 at 18-19.) The Court notes, however, that the requisite knowledge requirement for non-fiduciary claims was not addressed by the parties' briefing on the first motion to dismiss. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 21 at 20-22; Dkt. No. 26.) Here, with the question squarely presented and raised by the parties for the first time, the Court concludes that plaintiffs asserting a prohibited transaction claim under \u00a7 406(a) need not allege that the fiduciary or non-fiduciary defendant knew that the conduct was not exempted by \u00a7 408(b) in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Court's reading of\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    is supported by an additional aspect of that opinion as well.\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    reasoned that the fact that both \"the harmed beneficiaries\" and \"the\n    <em>\n     culpable\n    </em>\n    fiduciary\" could \"seek restitution from the arguably\n    <em>\n     less culpable\n    </em>\n    [non-fiduciary]-transferee\" as a result of the opinion would not be an incongruous outcome.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 252,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413601\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/238/#p241\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). But if the non-fiduciary defendant were required to participate in the transaction knowing that it violated ERISA-whereas the fiduciary could be liable for knowing only the underlying facts-the non-fiduciary could hardly be said to be\n    <em>\n     less\n    </em>\n    culpable than the fiduciary. The relative levels of culpability in this hypothetical supports the conclusion that the transferee is not required to have a higher degree of knowledge of the unlawfulness of the transaction than the transferor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Court notes that this conclusion differs slightly from the knowledge standard Haley proposes, whereby plaintiffs would be required to allege that the non-fiduciary and fiduciary knew (or should have known) that their conduct fell within \u00a7 406(a), but plaintiffs would not be required to allege knowledge that conduct was not exempt under \u00a7 408(b). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 40 at 20 (\"[A]\n    <em>\n     Harris Trust\n    </em>\n    claim against a non-fiduciary requires allegations that the non-fiduciary defendant as well as the plan fiduciary knew (or should have known) about the conduct at issue and the fact that it violated ERISA's prohibited transaction rules.\").) The Court does not read the case law to support such a compromise.

But to require plaintiffs to demonstrate that fiduciary transferors and non-fiduciary transferees knew the transaction violated ERISA would come close to creating just such a good faith defense; and such a defense would be inconsistent with ERISA's treatment of prohibited transactions as\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    violations of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    It is undisputed that Haley, as a plan participant, qualifies as the \"party in interest\" for this claim.

However, the Court may not consider this evidence in ruling on its motion to dismiss, because it is not clear that Haley previously possessed the documents, and she did not rely \"on the terms and effect of [the] document[s] in drafting the complaint.\"\n    <em>\n     Chambers v.

(Dkt. No. 41 at 5.) However, TIAA's opening brief argued only that this particular exemption applied to the \u00a7 406(a)(1)(D) claim. (Dkt. No. 39 at 20-21.)

And because TIAA bears the ultimate burden of proving that \u00a7 408(b)(17) exempts its loan program from liability, the Court can look to the Amended Complaint and the arguments Haley offers regarding similar exemptions to assess whether \u00a7 408(b)(17) clearly applies here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
