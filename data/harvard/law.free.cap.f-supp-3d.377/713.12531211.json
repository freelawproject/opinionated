Hood, Senior U.S. District Judge\n   On December 14, 2017, the Plaintiffs, Janet Crowe, Phillip Crowe, and Faye Crowe (the \"Crowes\" or the \"Plaintiffs\") were involved in an automobile collision with Defendant, Ian A. Johnson (\"Johnson\" or the \"Defendant\"), a Michigan resident, in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Johnson rear-ended the Crowes vehicle when, while accelerating forward in moderate to heavy traffic, a water bottle fell onto the floor of his vehicle, prompting him to reach down, take his eyes off the road, and attempt to secure the bottle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The parties have each moved for partial summary judgment. [DE 27, 28]. The Crowes move for summary judgment on the issue of liability. [DE 27]. Johnson moves for summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages. [DE 28]. The parties have responded in opposition to the applicable motions. [DE 29-30]. Additionally, the parties have replied in support of their motions or the time to reply has expired. [DE 32]. As a result, this matter is ripe for review and consideration and all pending motions for summary judgment will be consolidated in this memorandum opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Crowes motion for partial summary judgment [DE 27] as to liability is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Johnson's motion for partial summary judgment [DE 28] as to punitive damages is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the evening of December 14, 2017, the Plaintiffs, Janet Crowe, Phillip Crowe, and Faye Crowe set out from their home in Perryville, Kentucky, intent on visiting the home of Janet's daughter, Elizabeth Waters, in Alabama to celebrate the Christmas holiday. [DE 29-5 at 9, 35-37, PageID # 718, 744-46]. The Crowes loaded up their 2015 Buick Regal with their dog, Christmas presents for the children, and even packed a twenty-five-pound turkey for the occassion. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-37, PageID # 35-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After an hour and a half of driving, the Crowes decided to stop for supper at a Steak 'n Shake restaurant in Bowling Green, Kentucky. [Id. at 37-8, PageID # 746-47]. Upon finishing their meal, the Crowes piled back into the car to complete the remaining three and a half hours of their journey. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Janet Crowe was driving, with her husband, Phillip, seated in the front passenger seat, and her mother, Faye sitting directly behind Phillip in the right-rear passenger seat. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, PageID # 744]. All dutifully fastened their seatbelts and the Crowes pulled out of the Steak 'n Shake, headed eastbound on Scottsville Road toward the I-65 intersection. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40, PageID # 748-49]. At the time, the weather was fair and the road conditions were good. [DE 27-1 at 16, PageID # 364; DE 29-5 at 35-36, PageID # 744-45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unfortunately, on their way to I-65 southbound interchange, the Crowes encountered moderate to heavy traffic. [DE 29-5 at 38-39, PagedID # 747-48]. After making it a little way down Scottsville Road toward I-65 South, the Crowes encountered a stoplight at an intersection. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50, PageID # 758-59]. Ms. Crowe's vehicle was in the right hand-lane, as she was preparing to take the ramp\n   onto I-65 south. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50, PageID # 759]. The Crowes' vehicle was stopped at the light approximately one car length behind a 2015 white Nissan, occupied by Jackson and Rachel Daugherty. [DE 27-3 at 5, 22, PageID # 472, 489; DE 29-5 at 51, PageID # 760].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Defendant, Ian Johnson, who was staying at a nearby Microtel, was returning from his own supper that night in his 2018 Chevrolet Camaro. [DE 27-1 at 15, PageID # 363]. Johnson proceeded towards intersection on Scottsville Road and came up behind the Crowes' Buick. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15, PageID # 362-363].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The stop-light at the intersection turned green and the Daughertys, who were in the lead vehicle of the three, accelerated forward through the intersection. [DE 27-3 at 5, PageID # 472; DE 32-1 at 2, PageID # 823]. Janet Crowe also began accelerating forward into the intersection and proceeded beyond the stoplight. [DE 29-5 at 49-450, PageID # 758, 759].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Johnson began to accelerate as well. [DE 27-1 at 21, PageID # 372]. As the cars proceeded to move, Johnson's water bottle, which had been sitting near his shifter, fell on the floor of his car. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, PageID # 362]. He went to reach for the water bottle while continuing to accelerate forward. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In doing so, Johnson admits that he made a mistake by taking his eyes off the road, reducing his ability to slow down. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 22-29, 44, 57-58, PageID # 362, 370-77, 392, 405-06].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Due to the off-ramp, traffic was backed-up and moving slowly. [DE 29-5 at 40, PageID # 759]. As a result, Ms. Crowe slowed her car to a stop just after she passed through the intersection. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, PageID # 749]. Ms. Crowe then glanced at her rear-view mirror. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 50, PageID # 749, 759]. As she did, she saw a flash of light and the rear of the Crowes' car was impacted by Johnson's vehicle. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, PageID # 749]. Other than the lights she saw behind her, Ms. Crowe never saw the Defendant, Ian Johnson, in his vehicle prior to the collision nor was she aware of what he was doing in his vehicle. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, PageID # 761]. Ms. Crowe estimates that Johnson was \"going pretty fast.\" [DE 29-5 at 40, 52, PageID # 749, 761].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around this same time, Jackson Daugherty, who was planning on merging into the left lane, checked his rearview mirror. [DE 27-3 at 6, 18 PageID # 473, 485]. At that time, his vehicle had already moved through the intersection at approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour. [DE 27-3 at 27, PageID # 494]. Daugherty looked at his rear-view mirror and believes he saw either lights from Johnson's vehicle or glare off the Crowes' vehicle. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 23, and 31, PageID # 477, 490, and 498]. Then, his car was, in turn, impacted from the rear by the Crowes' vehicle. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, PageID # 498].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Daugherty had not previously noticed Johnson's vehicle. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23, PageID # 488-89]. Nor had he heard a horn prior to the impact. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22, PageID # 488-89]. In his testimony Daugherty estimated that Johnson's vehicle was moving at the speed limit, which he estimated to be \"[m]aybe 40, 45[,]\" miles per hour. [DE 29-3 at 10, PageID # 676]. However, though he claims to have seen Johnson's vehicle, Daugherty admits he could only guess as to its speed at prior to the collision. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   25-26, PageID # 691-92].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In March 2018, the Crowes filed this lawsuit. [DE 1]. The Crowes' Complaint generally alleges that Johnson's negligent operation of his motor vehicle was a breach of duty owed to the Crowes and a direct and proximate cause of the collision and any resulting injuries and economic losses suffered by the Crowes. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, PageID # 1-2, \u00b6\u00b6 5,7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Crowes seek compensatory damages for their personal injuries, emotional distress, medical expenses, rehabilitation, physical therapy expenses and medical devices, living and transportation accommodations, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, the cost of implementing a reasonably adequate life care plan, and any other compensatory damages. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, PageID # 2]. The Crowes further seek punitive damages against Johnson, stemming from their claim that his alleged behavior was willful and wanton. [Id. at 1 and 3, PageID # 1 and 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Crowes' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Crowes ask the Court to grant summary judgment for them on the issue of Johnson's alleged negligence. [DE 27 and 30]. The Crowes argue that summary judgment is appropriate because Johnson has \"repeatedly and consistently admitted that he was the sole cause of the collision\" with the Crowes. [DE 27 at 5, PageID # 346]. In particular, the Crowes cite to Johnson's testimony that he was not watching the road and was reaching for a water bottle when he rear-ended the Crowes. [DE 27 at 5-6, PageID # 347]. This, the Crowes argue, establishes Johnson's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Johnson states that the Crowes incorrectly argue that \"because a rear-end collision occurred, the Defendant must have been going too fast, must have been following too close, and ultimately, must have been negligent.\" [DE 30 at 2, PageID # 803]. In reconstructing the Crowes argument, Johnson then heavily\n   relies on\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lucas\n   </em>\n   , stating that Kentucky law is clear that rear-ending a vehicle is not dispositive of negligence.

[DE 29-3 at 10, 25-26, PageID # 676, 691-92].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even assuming their high estimate is accurate, as the\n   <em>\n    Kinney\n   </em>\n   court did, it does not reach the level of culpability even of the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Kinney\n   </em>\n   , who exceeded the speed limit by ten miles per hour and drove into oncoming traffic, attempting to pass the car ahead of him.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275890\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/131/357/#p358\">\n    131 S.W.3d at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, Johnson's conduct is most like that of the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , where this Court determined punitive damages were not available when the when the defendant's alleged conduct included driving while sleepy, within the speed limit, proper lane, and without any suggestion of intoxication.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693644\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/442/384/#p385\">\n    442 F.Supp.2d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court finds that under the gross negligence standard in Kentucky, even reading the facts in the light most favorable to the Crowes, Johnson is entitled to partial summary judgment on the unavailability of punitive damages. The Crowes have failed to establish by clear and convincing that Johnson's conduct was anything more than ordinary negligence. There is no dispute that Johnson looked down and reached for a fallen water bottle while accelerating in moderate to heavy traffic. But these facts simply fail to rise to the level of outrageous or egregious misconduct required to allow punitive damages. Johnson may have been negligent, but the Crowes, who have the burden to establish by \"clear and convincing\" evidence that Johnson's conduct was outrageous, have failed to do so. Accordingly, Johnson's actions constitute only ordinary negligence under Kentucky law and do not warrant a punitive damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The facts, even when read in the light most favorable to the Defendant, establish that the Defendant negligently caused a rear-end collision with the Plaintiffs' vehicle. Still, the circumstances of the underlying incident fail to satisfy the stringent test for punitive damages under Kentucky law. Accordingly, punitive damages are unavailable as a matter of law. An appropriate order will issue concurrently with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (1) That the Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment [DE 27] be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (2) That the Defendant's motion for partial summary judgment [DE 28] be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (3) That the Plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages be, and the same are,\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Defendant Johnson attached several exhibits to his motion for partial summary judgment [DE 28], including two (2) letters of correspondence, dated December 3, 2018, [DE 28-4] and December 4, 2018, [DE 28-5]. Having reviewed these exhibits the Court finds that these letters contain settlement discussions between the named parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The Federal Rules of Evidence apply in diversity cases.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Lee v.

Ky. 2012). The Sixth Circuit notes that Fed. R. Evid. 408\"prohibits the admission, for certain purposes, of offers to compromise along with any statement made during the course of such compromise negotiations.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gjokaj v.

App'x. 494\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 501 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 408(a)(1)-(2) ). Specifically, Fed. R. Evid. 408(a)(2) provides that evidence of conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations is inadmissible in civil cases to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Seye v.

Ky. 2013). The Sixth Circuit has held that \"this Rule applies only to preclude evidence related to the claim 'that was the subject of the compromise.' \"\n    <em>\n     Gjokaj\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12404382\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/700/494/#p501\">\n     700 F.

Thus, the Court views the correspondence as offers of compromise and evidence of negotiation, which is inadmissible to support summary judgment on this issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
