(\"Alorica,\" and together with Credit One and NCO, \"Defendants\"), for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff now moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, for summary judgment. (Docket entry no. 49.) Credit One also moves for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff's TCPA claim or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings pending a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") on the treatment of reassigned phone numbers. (Docket entry nos. 68, 74.) NCO and Alorica join Credit One's opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, as well as Credit One's motions for summary judgment and for a stay. (Docket entry nos. 53, 57, 66, 83, 85.) The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has carefully considered the parties' submissions in connection with the instant motion practice and, for the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and Credit One's motions for summary judgment and a stay are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Credit One Bank is a national banking association. (Docket entry no. 30, Credit One Answer \u00b6 6.) On or around September 15, 2016, an individual applied for and obtained a credit card account with Credit\n   One. (Docket entry no. 73, Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 1.) As part of the application process for the account, the individual provided her personal information to Credit One, including a telephone number ending in 7929 (the \"Subject Number\"). (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 2.) Credit One approved the individual for the account and subsequently mailed her a credit card along with Credit One's standard cardholder agreement. (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 3.) The individual accepted the terms of Credit One's standard cardholder agreement, including a provision authorizing Credit One to contact her at the telephone number she provided, when she used the card. (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 4, 5.) Some time thereafter, the individual defaulted on her credit card account and Credit One attempted to call her to collect an unpaid balance. (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Credit One authorized Expert Global Solutions Financial Care (\"EGS\") to collect the unpaid balance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 8.) Between January 2017 and March 27, 2017, EGS placed 380 calls to the Subject Number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 10.) The parties agree that EGS did not transmit any prerecorded messages to the Subject Number. (Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 15.) During the time when the calls regarding the delinquent Credit One account were made, Plaintiff was the holder of a cell phone account connected to the Subject Number. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 2; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 13.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff has never had any relationship with Credit One. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The calls placed by EGS to the Subject Number were all made through the LiveVox 3.2 dialing system using its Quick Connect feature. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 12; Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 19.) To use the LiveVox system, an EGS manager uploads a list of telephone numbers provided by Credit One into the system each morning. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 16; Def. 56.1 St. \u00b6 18.) Those phone numbers are stored in the LiveVox system throughout the workday. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 17.) When using Quick Connect, the dialing system uses a proprietary algorithm created by LiveVox to determine how many calls to place automatically in order to keep customer service representatives fully occupied at all times. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 18.) As more customer service representatives log into the dialing system and indicate their readiness to take calls, the dialing system will increase the number of calls it automatically makes. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 19.) When Quick Connect places calls, it will place more outbound calls than the number of customer service representatives actually logged in and ready to receive calls, based on the assumption that not all of the people being called will actually answer their phones. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 20.) There are no customer service representatives on the phone when a call is launched by Quick Connect. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 22.) Instead, Quick Connect will transfer only those calls that are answered by a customer to an available customer service representative. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 23.) If there are more answered\n   calls than available customer service representatives, answered calls are transferred to a holding queue until a representative becomes available. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 24.) A customer service representative using Quick Connect does not have the ability to manually dial a phone number or to select a specific account to call, nor does the representative have any input into what number Quick Connect will call next. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties dispute whether the LiveVox system used to call Plaintiff is properly classified as a \"predictive dialing system\" within the meaning of certain FCC rulings, whether the system requires human intervention to launch each call, and whether the system has the capacity to store or produce randomly or sequentially generated telephone numbers. Relying on testimony from EGS's Corporate Designee, Andrew Balthaser, and the expert report of Ray Horak, Credit One argues that LiveVox is not a predictive dialing system. Balthaser testified that Quick Connect does not operate as a predictive dialer because \"to my knowledge, the algorithm is not changing. It's not adapting or predicting different things. It's operating within guardrails that are established at the creation of a campaign.\" (Docket entry no. 70-1, Balthaser Dep. 51:9-19.) When asked if he knew whether the LiveVox Quick Connect \"algorithm or system has any predictive capabilities,\" Balthaser stated that \"only LiveVox has access to their algorithms to see how it paces or controls the number of calls launched.\" (Docket entry no. 81-1, Balthaser Dep. 100:16-101:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relying on an interview with Balthaser, Horak proffers that \"Mr. Balthaser advised me that Quick Connect, as configured by EGS, does not fit the definition of a [p]redictive [d]ialer.\" (Docket entry no. 72, Horak Rep. \u00b6 53.) Horak also learned from Balthaser that, at the end of each call, a customer service representative \"record[s] the result of the call,\" and then \"click[s] a hot button labelled\n   <em>\n    Ready\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Next\n   </em>\n   , thereby instructing the system to dial the next set of numbers from the campaign database.\" (Horak Rep. \u00b6 53.) Horak asserts that \"[t]his high level of human intervention is necessary to launch each and every call attempt for each and every [representative] logged in and available.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Horak also asserts that the Subject Number \"was not randomly or sequentially created, but rather, was obtained from\" Credit One. (Horak Rep. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For his part, Plaintiff submits the declaration Kevin Stark, former director of Product Management for LiveVox from mid-2012 through November 2017, who states that the LiveVox automated outbound dialing system \"has predictive dialing capabilities and the ability to launch phone calls without direct human intervention on each phone call.\" (Docket entry no. 81-2, Stark Decl. \u00b6 3.) Plaintiff also proffers the expert report of Randall Snyder, who opines that the LiveVox dialing system software \"provides pacing algorithms for predictive dialing,\" and that the Quick Connect service, which is described in the LiveVox Manager User Guide as an \"[a]utomated outbound service that immediately connects live answers with an available agent,\" is \"precisely the definition of predictive dialing.\" (Docket entry no. 81-3, Snyder Rep. \u00b6 26.) Snyder also opines that the LiveVox dialing system has the capacity to store and dial randomly or sequentially generated numbers because the algorithms to do so are \"among the most basic in computer science\" and EGS, if it \"so chose, can easily upload random or sequentially generated telephone numbers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Snyder Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 31-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In the absence of FCC guidance, Credit One contends, the Court must look to the TCPA's statutory definition of an ATDS, which Credit One argues requires that a device have the capacity to \"store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Although the D.C.

Circuit's expressed concern regarding the FCC's failure to engage in reasoned decisionmaking in the 2015 Order \"applies with equal force\" to its prior orders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pinkus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526140\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/927/#p935\">\n    319 F.Supp.3d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As other courts have noted, \"the logic behind invalidating the 2015 Order does not apply to the prior FCC [o]rders,\" and the D.C.

Instead, the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the FCC's \"most recent effort\"-the 2015 Order-\"falls short of reasoned decisionmaking.\"\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nor is it of any consequence that the D.C. Circuit found that it had jurisdiction to review the petitioners' challenge to the 2015 Order. While some courts have interpreted the D.C. Circuit's discussion of its jurisdiction to entertain the petitioners' challenge concerning the functions a device \"must be able to perform\" as expanding the scope of the court's ruling, these courts ignore the actual language of the D.C. Circuit's subsequent analysis of the issue, which does not ultimately implicate the validity of the FCC's prior orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maes v.

Wis. Oct. 30 2018) (\"[The court of appeals'] analysis and holding were limited to the 2015 order: it looked at the ways in which the 2015 order expanded upon prior rulings, and then struck down those expansions as unreasonable. Although it discussed the content of the 2003 order, it did so only to highlight its contradictions with the new rules.\"). Even if the D.C. Circuit had jurisdiction to revisit the FCC's prior orders, it does not necessarily follow that the court actually exercised such jurisdiction to invalidate the orders. Because the Court finds that the FCC's prior rulings are undisturbed by\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , the Court defers to the FCC's prior determination that \"a predictive dialer constitutes an automatic telephone dialing system and is subject to the TCPA's restrictions on the use of autodialers,\" even if it dials numbers from a list. (2008 Order \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court next turns to the question of whether the LiveVox system at issue in this case is a predictive dialer within the meaning of the FCC's earlier rulings. Citing primarily to the declaration of Kevin Stark, former director of Product Management for LiveVox, who states that LiveVox \"has predictive dialing capabilities and the ability to launch phone calls without direct human intervention,\" Plaintiff argues that LiveVox is a predictive dialer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stark Decl. \u00b6 3.) The evidence proffered by Credit One to the contrary is insufficient to create a genuine issue of\n   material fact as to whether the LiveVox system is a predictive dialer. Credit One cites principally to the testimony of EGS's Corporate Designee, Andrew Balthaser, who stated that Quick Connect does not \"operate as a predictive dialer\" because \"to my knowledge, the algorithm is not changing. It's not adapting or predicting different things. It's operating within guardrails that are established at the creation of a campaign.\" (Balthaser Dep. 51:9-19.) However, when asked whether he knew if the LiveVox's \"algorithm or system has any predictive capabilities,\" Balthaser responded that \"only LiveVox has access to their algorithms to see how it paces or controls the number of calls launched,\" thus admitting that he did not have personal knowledge of LiveVox's predictive capabilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Balthaser Dep. 100:16-101:8.) It is undisputed here that the Quick Connect feature of the LiveVox dialing system uses a proprietary algorithm to determine how many calls to automatically place in order to keep customer service representatives fully occupied at all times and that Quick Connect adjusts the number of calls that are automatically placed based on the number of available customer service representatives at any given time. (Pl. 56.1 St. \u00b6 18-20, 22-24, 26-27.) These facts are consistent with the FCC's definition of a predictive dialer as \"an automated dialing system that uses a complex set of algorithms to automatically dial consumers' telephone numbers in a manner that 'predicts' the time when a consumer will answer the phone and a telemarketer will be available to take the call.\" (2003 Order at n.31.) Accordingly, the competent undisputed evidence establishes that LiveVox is an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA, and Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his claim for TCPA liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Reliance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants contend that, even if LiveVox is an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA, Plaintiff's TCPA claim must still be dismissed because Credit One and EGS reasonably relied on the prior express consent of the individual who previously owned the Subject Number in placing the collection calls. Citing the FCC's unchallenged interpretation in the 2015 Order of the term \"called party\" to include \"individuals who might not be the subscriber, but who, due to their relationship to the subscriber, are the number's customary user and can provide prior express consent for the call\" (2015 Order at \u00b6 75), Credit One argues that the Court should apply a similar \"reasonable reliance approach\" in creating a \"common-sense exception to liability\" for calls directed to new holders of reassigned cell phone numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Credit One's argument finds no basis in the text of the TCPA, which only makes a caller's intent relevant in connection with the trebling of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Echevvaria v. Diversified Consultants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13 Civ. 4980(LAK)(AJP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20929275\">\n    2014 WL 929275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2014) (\"The TCPA is essentially a strict liability statute that does not require any intent for liability except when awarding treble damages.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is\n   the FCC's \"reasonable reliance approach\" in the customary user context sufficiently analogous to the reassigned number context to support the kind of expansive exception to liability Credit One advocates for here. The customary user whose consent provides a basis for reliance under the FCC's 2015 Order interpretation is by definition someone who is a current, ongoing user of the relevant cell phone number. The reassignment of a number creates no relationship between the prior, consenting holder and the new holder. Thus, there is no reasonable basis for reliance on the original holder's consent as indicative of consent by the new user. Indeed, in a portion of the 2015 Order that the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   court later rejected, the FCC observed that there was \"no basis in the statute or the record before us to conclude that callers can reasonably rely on prior express consent beyond one call to reassigned numbers\" (2015 Order \u00b6 90 n.312), and framed a very limited \"reasonable reliance approach\" by providing only a one-call safe harbor for reassigned numbers. Accordingly, the Court declines Defendants' invitation to recognize a reasonable reliance exception or defense that is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Credit One also argues that a stay pending the FCC's forthcoming rulemaking on reassigned number liability is warranted pursuant to either the primary jurisdiction doctrine or the Court's inherent authority. On March 23, 2018, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on \"ways to address the problem of unwanted calls to reassigned numbers,\" including \"the specific information that callers need from a reassigned numbers database\" and \"the best way to make that information available to callers that want it.\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201452721\">\n    2018 WL 1452721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   **1-2 (Mar. 23, 2018). On May 14, 2018, the FCC issued a public notice seeking comment on \"how to treat calls to reassigned wireless numbers under the TCPA\" in light of the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , including how to interpret the term \"called party\" for calls to reassigned numbers, whether the FCC should maintain a reasonable reliance approach to prior express consent, and whether a reassigned numbers safe harbor is necessary. (Docket entry no. 76-6, Frampton Decl. Ex. F at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The doctrine of primary jurisdiction ensures that \"courts and agencies with concurrent jurisdiction over a matter do not work at cross-purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Fulton Cogeneration Assocs. v.

A court may stay a case in deference to an agency if it determines that a stay is necessary to \"maintain[ ] uniformity in the regulation of an area entrusted to a federal agency\" or to \"utiliz[e] administrative expertise\" on technical questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

Jan. 25, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Credit One argues that a stay is warranted because reassigned number liability involves balancing the privacy rights of the individual and the commercial speech rights of the telemarketer, matters that are within the FCC's field of expertise, and that proceeding with this action would create the risk of inconsistent rulings because district courts are required to adhere to the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA. Credit One further argues that Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by a stay since discovery has concluded, and that any stay will be relatively brief, as evidenced by the fact that the FCC sought comment on the topic of reassigned number liability only six days after the mandate was issued in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   . For his part, Plaintiff argues that the FCC's proposed rulemaking regarding a reassigned numbers database will have no bearing on this case, particularly where multiple courts have already provided guidance on the meaning of the term \"called party.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Soppet\n   </em>\n   , 679 F.3d at 641 (7th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Osorio v.

Plaintiff also argues that, even if the FCC were to make rulings favorable to Credit One, such rulings would not apply retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that a stay is not warranted in this matter under either the primary jurisdiction doctrine or the Court's inherent authority. The FCC's March 23, 2018, notice of proposed rulemaking appears to pertain only to the creation of a reassigned numbers database and does not speak directly to issues of reasonable reliance or reassigned number liability under the TCPA. Although the FCC, in the wake of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , sought further comment on a safe harbor for reassigned numbers and the interpretation of the term \"called party\" for calls to reassigned numbers, the May 14, 2018, public notice cited by Credit One does not indicate any intent by the FCC to proceed with rulemaking on those topics in the near future. Moreover, as Plaintiff points out, courts can interpret the TCPA in the absence of agency guidance and have already done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pieterson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203241069\">\n    2018 WL 3241069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D.

Furthermore, staying this action would unnecessarily delay resolution of Plaintiff's claims, and the mere possibility of a more favorable determination by the FCC at some uncertain point in the future is insufficient to demonstrate that Credit One will be prejudiced if this action proceed.\n   <em>\n    Pieterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203241069\">\n    2018 WL 3241069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (noting that the FCC's process \"can\n   take years,\" and often results in a \"cycle of staying a case while an FCC order is pending only to have the FCC order challenged in court ... demonstrating the real possibility of indefinite delay.\") Accordingly, the Court denies Credit One's motion to stay this action pending further rulemaking by the FCC on the issue of reassigned number liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted as to the issue of TCPA liability, and Credit One's motions for summary judgment and a stay are denied.
