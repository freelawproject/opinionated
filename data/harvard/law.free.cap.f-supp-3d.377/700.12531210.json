HANEN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This insurance dispute stems from a pollution event on the Hawaiian island of Oahu and the ensuing criminal proceedings. In particular, the parties dispute whether the insurer had a duty to defend Plaintiffs in those criminal proceedings. The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment [Doc. Nos. 42 &amp; 48]. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the motion filed by the insurer, AIG Specialty Insurance Company (\"AIG\") [Doc. No. 48], and denies the motion filed by the insureds, Waste Management, Inc. (\"WMI\") and Waste Management Hawaii, Inc. (\"WMH\") (collectively \"Waste Management\") [Doc. No. 42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rainstorms hit Oahu in December 2010 and January 2011, leading to flooding in the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill (\"Landfill\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Waste from the Landfill, including syringes, blood vials, catheters, and other medical waste, flowed into the\n   Pacific Ocean and washed up on nearby beaches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Landfill is operated by WMH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Chronology of Ensuing Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2011, within a few weeks of the last storm, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") issued an Administrative Order on Consent for Removal Action (\"AOC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AOC, which WMH agreed to, ordered WMH to take certain actions and produce information to the EPA in order to respond to the pollution event.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The costs to defend and to implement the AOC are not at issue in the pending motions. AIG had no role in the AOC, and Waste Management does not contend that it should have. Nevertheless, as will be seen below, the AOC is part of Waste Management's overall position regarding the duty to defend the criminal case described below. In April 2011, the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") began a grand jury investigation into the pollution from the Landfill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August 2011, the EPA notified WMH \"that the response work set forth in the AOC is completed to the satisfaction of EPA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2011, Waste Management gave its first notice of a potential claim to AIG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice stated that \"THIS IS NOTICE ONLY AS WE ARE NOT YET SURE THIS WILL EXCEED OUR $ 5 M[I]LL[I]ON SELF-INSURED RETENT[I]ON.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In February 2013, WMH and the DOJ entered a tolling agreement for civil claims under the Clean Water Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2013, the DOJ notified Waste Management that \"[i]t is our position that this case is appropriately resolved with a criminal resolution, including felony offenses\" and offered a plea agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2014, WMH and two WMH employees were indicted pursuant to a 13-count indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other charges, the indictment alleged in Count 9 the offense of \"knowing discharge of pollutants into a water of the United States, in violation of an [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System] Permit, and aiding and abetting the same\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1319(c)(2)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person\" is unlawful except when done in compliance with certain enumerated sections.

For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that Waste Management has not identified a Claim giving rise to a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The AOC and Ensuing Federal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The EPA issued the AOC in January 2011 and certified \"that the response work set forth in the AOC is completed to the satisfaction of EPA\" in August 2011. Waste Management first gave notice of a potential claim to AIG in December 2011 and evidently informed AIG of the AOC sometime thereafter. Waste Management explains its argument that the overall federal proceedings that began with the AOC are a single Claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Because the core factual allegations about the discharge of contaminants during the January 2011 storm are the same in each proceeding, and the proceedings were strategically coordinated by a single claimant, all of the federal enforcement activity arising out of that contamination should be viewed as a single\n   <strong>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n   commenced by the AOC. For purposes of the Eight-Corners Rule, then, it is the AOC that must be measured against the coverage of the [Insurance Policy] ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Comparing the AOC to the Insurance Policy, the Court finds that the AOC is not a Claim that triggers coverage for the criminal proceedings. WMH completed the response work under the AOC to the satisfaction of the EPA before Waste Management ever provided notice to AIG of any potential claim. As AIG avers, at the time Waste Management notified AIG of the pollution event, \"\n   <em>\n    nobody\n   </em>\n   was demanding that [Waste Management] clean up\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   , as all clean up required by the AOC had been completed months earlier.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, AIG \"could not have had a duty to defend against the AOC because by the time [AIG] received notice there was literally nothing to defend, as the AOC had already been negotiated and issued, and all required work had been completed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with AIG's position. The AOC cannot be considered a Claim-\"a written demand received by the\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   alleging liability or responsibility and seeking a remedy on the part of the\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   for Loss ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   -giving rise to a duty to defend when it had already been handled to the satisfaction of the EPA by the time AIG received notice of it. Waste Management conceded at oral argument that it is not making a claim for the expenses it incurred before notifying AIG, acknowledging that any expenses incurred\n   in 2011 complying with the AOC \"would fall within our deductible.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Waste Management is not making a claim based upon the AOC; Waste Management wants reimbursement for the amounts it expended in defending the criminal case. Applying the eight-corners rule to the AOC and Insurance Policy, then, shows nothing in the AOC that could potentially trigger a duty to defend subsequent criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Waste Management additionally argues that the \"Claim\" is in reality the parallel administrative, criminal, and (potential) civil proceedings and that this Claim was commenced by the AOC. Citing the rule that \"the court must focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages rather than on the legal theories alleged,\"\n   <em>\n    Merchs.

For the reasons stated above, comparing the four corners of the AOC to the four corners of the Insurance Policy does not trigger a duty to defend the criminal proceedings. It is true that factual allegations rather than the pleaded legal theories or causes of action control the duty to defend,\n   <em>\n    Merchs. Fast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015789\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/939/139/#p142\">\n    939 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   141 ;\n   <em>\n    Adamo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009522\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/853/673/#p676\">\n    853 S.W.2d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but Waste Management has cited no precedent for its position that subsequent criminal or civil proceedings can be lumped into the previously-extinguished AOC for purposes of the eight-corners rule. Likewise, AIG's admission that \"[c]ertain aspects of the AOC constitute a 'Claim' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   and AIG's agreement to defend Waste Management against any civil proceedings that the DOJ may bring (subject to a reservation of rights and the self-insured retention) do not give rise to a duty to defend against the federal government's abundant arsenal in all of its various facets. It is one thing for a court to look at the factual allegations rather than the legal theories or causes of action pleaded in a complaint; it is a different matter for a court to weld together multiple different administrative, criminal, and potential civil proceedings into a single purported \"claim\" for purposes of the eight-corners rule. Such a practice would turn the eight-corners rule into a twelve-or sixteen-corners rule, a rule that has not been adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas. The AOC, then, is not a Claim that would trigger AIG's duty to defend subsequent criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Waste Management alternatively asserts that the April 2014 indictment standing alone constitutes a Claim because the indictment could result in an order requiring WMH to clean up its environmental violation or a restitution order. Waste Management's argument appears to proceed as follows: Coverage D provides coverage for \"\n   <strong>\n    Loss\n   </strong>\n   that the\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   becomes legally obligated to pay as a result of a\n   <strong>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n   for\n   <strong>\n    Clean-Up Costs\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Loss is defined to include Clean-Up Costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clean-Up Costs are defined as expenses incurred for environmental remediation \"[t]o the extent required by\n   <strong>\n    Environmental Laws\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Environmental Laws are defined as \"any federal ... laws (including, but not limited to, statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, guidance documents, and governmental, judicial or administrative orders and directives) that are applicable to the\n   <strong>\n    Pollution Condition.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, an order pursuant to federal criminal laws (Environmental Laws) requiring a party to incur expenses to remediate environmental contamination (Clean-Up Costs) would constitute Loss that the insured became legally obligated to pay as a result of a Claim for Clean-Up Costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to this argument, the indictment is a Claim (\"a written demand ... seeking a remedy ... for\n   <strong>\n    Loss\n   </strong>\n   \") that is covered by Coverage D. It is important to note that the Insurance Policy excludes coverage for \"\n   <strong>\n    Claims\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    Loss\n   </strong>\n   ... [d]ue to any criminal fines, criminal penalties or criminal assessments.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   AIG responds that \"the Indictment does not seek any\n   <strong>\n    Clean-Up Costs\n   </strong>\n   \";\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   in fact, it does not expressly demand any remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it seeks criminal convictions. According to AIG, the eight-corners rule \"prohibits judicial creation of a demand for\n   <strong>\n    Clean-Up Costs\n   </strong>\n   that does not exist within the Indictment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Once again, the Court is compelled to agree with AIG because the \"eight-corners doctrine 'strictly circumscribe[s]' a court's analysis of the duty to defend.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilbane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860833\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/589/#p596\">\n    664 F.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    D.R.

The four corners of the Insurance Policy require a Claim: \"a written demand ... seeking a remedy ... for\n   <strong>\n    Loss\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The indictment does not seek a remedy for Loss. The indictment does not include a demand for any remedy. It only charges WMH and two individuals with crimes. Even assuming that a remediation order or restitution order would not be excluded under the Criminal Fines, Penalties, or Assessments exclusion (and, in the case of a remediation order, assuming that there was still environmental\n   clean-up left to be completed in 2014), there is no statement or express indication within the indictment that it seeks or will seek a remediation or restitution order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the eight-corners rule, the Court may not consider the extrinsic evidence that Waste Management offers: the Policy Statement regarding Remedial Orders and associated Commentary in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, 1997 and 2007 EPA policy memoranda, and a 2009 DOJ memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Quoting\n   <em>\n    Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Nokia, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Waste Management contends that the indictment is a Claim because \"[w]here the complaint does not state facts sufficient to clearly bring the case within or without the coverage, the general rule is that the insurer is obligated to defend if there is,\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   , a case under the complaint within the coverage of the policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, held that the \"potentiality\" standard is not an exception to the eight-corners rule.\n   <em>\n    Gilbane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860833\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/589/#p596\">\n    664 F.3d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Although the Texas Supreme Court has held that an insurer has a duty to defend 'if a plaintiff's factual allegations potentially support a covered claim,' \" the Fifth Circuit stated, quoting\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   , \"it has never applied the 'potentiality' standard to deviate from the eight-corners rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860833\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/589/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8197533\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/487/#p491\">\n    268 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   490 ). \"Rather, it has used the standard to characterize the description of claims in the petition, determining whether they potentially were covered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8197533\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/487/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, looking only within the four corners of the indictment, the Court finds that the indictment alleges that WMH and two individuals committed crimes.

Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 45 at 8. In its Motion for Summary Judgment and Reply brief, however, Waste Management has not argued that the Demand Letters independently constitute a Claim. Waste Management instead asserts that the Claim is the parallel proceedings as a whole (commenced by the AOC) or the indictment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Waste Management, Inc. and Waste Management Hawaii, Inc.'s Reply In Support of Their Partial Summary Judgment Motion and Opposition to Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc.

AIG, by contrast, addresses the letters (or at least two of them) in its Motion for Summary Judgment and contends that \"[t]he DOJ letters on which [Waste Management] relies ... fall far short of constituting a\n    <strong>\n     Claim\n    </strong>\n    for\n    <strong>\n     Loss\n    </strong>\n    .\" AIG MSJ at 19. Waste Management has not responded to AIG's argument or otherwise addressed the Demand Letters at the summary judgment stage. The Demand Letters, then, provide no grounds on which to grant summary judgment in favor of Waste Management or deny summary judgment to AIG.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Waste Management MSJ at 21.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Defendant AIG Specialty Insurance Company's Reply in Support of Its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc.

No. 34; Amended Scheduling Order, Doc. No. 38. Although there is some suggestion in the parties' briefing that the Court could address claims besides Waste Management's first and second claims for relief in today's order, the Court will respect what it understands to be the parties' agreement. The Court's ruling today accordingly only grants summary judgment to AIG on Waste Management's first and second claims for relief. The Court expresses no opinion on AIG's contention that granting summary judgment against Waste Management on its first and second claims for relief entitles AIG to have Waste Management's remaining claims dismissed as well. Thus, this order remains interlocutory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Waste Management has argued in part that due to the government's policies of pursuing criminal convictions in order to or as a means to extract civil remedies/damages, this Court should expand the holding of the Supreme Court of Texas in\n    <em>\n     McGinnes\n    </em>\n    to encompass related criminal proceedings that may have an impact on the civil litigation (which is waiting in the wings and which, at least in this case, AIG has admitted it will probably have to defend, albeit under a reservation of rights and subject to the self-insured retention). This is problematic because it is contrary to the existing law established by both the Supreme Court of Texas and the Fifth Circuit, and this Court is not authorized to rule contrary to established Fifth Circuit law, nor is the Supreme Court of Texas authorized to accept a certified question from this Court, as the Texas Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to questions posed by \"a federal appellate court.\" Tex. Const, art. V, \u00a7 3-c (a). Nevertheless, given the parties' intent, as expressed at oral argument, to resolve the duty-to-defend question first and/or the ability of the Fifth Circuit to send questions to the Supreme Court of Texas, the Court will certify this case for an interlocutory appeal if either party requests within 14 days of this order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
