(Doc. 24 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiff opposed (Doc. 30), and Defendant replied (Doc. 32). On review, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff James Baskerville is an African-American male formerly employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in its Orlando, Florida healthcare facility. (Doc. 22, \u00b6 1.) Over the years, Plaintiff applied for several positions \"that his knowledge, skills and experience made him eligible to perform.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Yet Plaintiff was \"repeatedly overlooked and not offered the positions\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9), which led him to file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"\n   <strong>\n    EEOC\n   </strong>\n   \") complaints with the Office of Resolution Management alleging racial discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 21.) Plaintiff claims that his supervisor was aware of his participation in this \"prior protected activity\" and created a \"hostile work environment\" because of it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 27, 2017, Plaintiff attempted to discuss the \"target[ing] and bull[ying]\" with his supervisor but the supervisor dismissed his concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) On leaving his supervisor's office, Plaintiff went to the elevator and made a profane reference to his supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) The supervisor's wife heard the comment and reported it to management, who accused Plaintiff of insubordination and \"initiated a proposal for removal from federal service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.) Ultimately, he was terminated on December 12, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) According to Plaintiff, the use of profanity does not typically result in such disciplinary action-he chalks the proposal for removal and termination up to retaliation for filing charges of discrimination and reprisal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.) So, he sues Defendant under Title VII for unlawful retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following an initial round of pleading (Docs. 1, 14, 16, 20, 21), Defendant seeks dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as to Plaintiff's termination and failure to state a claim. (Doc. 24.) With the Motion, Defendant attaches several exhibits related to Plaintiff's EEOC complaints: (1) a September 26, 2017 notice of acceptance of a July 26, 2017 complaint of discrimination based on reprisal; (2) a November 8, 2017 notice of amendment to the July 26, 2017 complaint after Plaintiff sought to file a new complaint based on several events, including the September 27, 2017 incident with his supervisor and the issuance of a proposed removal letter; and (3) a December 6, 2017 notice of amendment to include that Plaintiff \"was issued a Last Chance Agreement and threatened that if he did not sign, he would be terminated December 12, 2017.\" (Doc. 24 1, pp. 5-16.) With this, Defendant claims that Plaintiff never filed a new complaint or amendment after his December 12, 2017 termination, barring this action. (Doc. 24, pp. 4-8; Doc. 32.) Without the\n   termination, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff fails to state a retaliation claim because a proposal for removal is not an adverse employment action. (Doc. 24, pp. 7-9.) In response, Plaintiff maintains he adequately alleged exhaustion in his complaint and sued after the EEOC failed to investigate his claims in the required 180 days. (Doc. 29.)
