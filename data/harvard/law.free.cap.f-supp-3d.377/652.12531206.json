P. 12(b)(6) (Dkt. #18), and Defendants Abbott and White's (\"AG Defendants\") Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. #20). Having considered the motion and the relevant pleadings, the Court finds that the CCDAO's motion should be denied, the County's motion should be granted in part and denied in part, and the AG's motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As alleged by Plaintiff Suzanne H. Wooten, on March 4, 2008, Plaintiff defeated incumbent Judge Charles Sandoval in the Republican primary election for the 380th District Court Judge in Collin County, Texas by a landslide. The next day, Judge Sandoval approached the Collin County District Attorney's Office (the \"CCDAO\") to complain about Plaintiff, asserting that she cheated during the election and he wanted the CCDAO to find a crime against her. After this meeting, the CCDAO\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   took it upon themselves to investigate Plaintiff's campaign without the assistance of law enforcement. Eventually, the Office of the Attorney General\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"OAG\"), joined in the case against Plaintiff. The investigation lasted over two years before Plaintiff was initially indicted on October 14, 2010, with the final indictment filed on July 14, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The theory of the criminal investigation and prosecution against Plaintiff was that a married couple, David Frederick Cary and Stacy Stine Cary (\"the Carys\") gave itemized monetary contributions to Plaintiff, through the Carys consultant who also happened to be Plaintiff's media consultant, James Stephen Spencer. The Carys and Spencer were co-defendants in the criminal prosecution. Plaintiff and the Carys were all tried separately, and convicted by three different juries. Specifically, Plaintiff's jury found her guilty of six counts of bribery, one count of engaging in organized criminal activity, one count of money laundering, and one count of tampering with a governmental record. After these three trials, Spencer took a plea deal. The Carys appealed their convictions. The Dallas Court of Appeals affirmed Stacy Cary's conviction but several months later a different panel determined David Cary should be acquitted on all counts. Both cases were then appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. On December 14, 2016, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals determined that the Carys should be acquitted on all counts, as the allegations against the Carys were not actually a crime pursuant to the relevant statutes.\n   <em>\n    Stacy Cary v.

On May 24, 2017, the 366th Judicial District in Collin County granted the requested relief \"finding the evidence presented legally insufficient because the allegations, even if true, were not crimes under Texas law.\" (Dkt. #3 at p. 1). The 366th Judicial District in Collin County further determined that because the evidence was legally insufficient to convict\n   her of the nine felony charges, there had been a \"violation of the Applicant's due process rights.\" (Dkt. #3 at p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on this set of facts, Plaintiff filed suit on May 23, 2018 (Dkt. #1). On May 29, 2018, Plaintiff amended her complaint (Dkt. #10) suing the CCDAO Defendants, the AG Defendants, and the County for violation of her due process rights, violation of the fourth amendment, conspiracy to deprive constitutional rights, and malicious prosecution, among other causes of action and theories of liability. On July 30, 2018, the CCDAO Defendants (Dkt. #17), the County (Dkt. #18), and the AG Defendants (Dkt. #20) filed their motions to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint asserting, among other things, immunity. On September 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a response to the CCDAO Defendants' motion (Dkt. #29), the AG Defendants' motion (Dkt. #30), and the County's motion (Dkt. #31). On September 24, 2018, the CCDAO Defendants (Dkt. #32), the AG Defendants (Dkt. #35), and the County (Dkt. #33) filed a reply. Finally, on October 1, 2018, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply to the AG Defendants' reply (Dkt. #36) and the County's reply (Dkt. #37). Plaintiff did not file a sur-reply to the CCDAO Defendants' reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that each claim in a complaint include a \"short and plain statement ... showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED.

The CCDAO Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The CCDAO Defendants claim that their limited and early involvement in the process of Plaintiff's ultimate prosecution and conviction, is protected by prosecutorial immunity. The CCDAO Defendants allege that their involvement is limited to appearing in front of the grand jury and actions in preparation to be in front of the grand jury. According to the CCDAO Defendants, these functions are intimately associated with the judicial phase, such that these actions are guaranteed prosecutorial immunity. Plaintiff counters that while presenting information before the grand jury and preparation of such can be protected by immunity, the CCDAO Defendants' actions here are not. According to Plaintiff, the CCDAO Defendants' conduct surrounding the grand jury were purely investigative, as opposed to prosecutorial in nature, and were done without probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that after she defeated the incumbent, the incumbent approached the CCDAO alleging Plaintiff cheated in the election and urging the CCDAO to find a crime. Subsequently, the CCDAO launched its investigation into Plaintiff and her campaign. The CCDAO conducted this investigation on its own without the help of law enforcement. To further its investigation, the CCDAO, through Defendant Milner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   began issuing grand jury subpoenas. In the Fall of 2008 alone, nine grand jury subpoenas were issued for documents. The following fall, Defendant Milner began issuing grand jury subpoenas for Plaintiff's employees, people who contributed to Plaintiff's campaign, and other people related to the campaign. A total of six different grand juries were used to investigate Plaintiff: the grand juries of the Fall of 2008, Spring of 2009, Fall of 2009, Spring of 2010, Fall of 2010, and Fall of 2011. Four of the six were used to subpoena bank records, phone records, credit card documents, personal records, emails, and various campaign-related vendor information. Three of the six were used to subpoena witnesses. According to Plaintiff, all of this occurred without probable cause. Not only that, but it is alleged that Defendant Milner admitted to Collin County District Judge Chris Oldner, the judge presiding over the Fall 2009 Grand Jury, that, although they did not have enough information to indict Plaintiff, they would continue to gather information through their investigation. Moreover, even though the CCDAO Defendants maintain that they only had limited and early involvement, because the OAG took over the case as the Attorney\n   <em>\n    Pro Team\n   </em>\n   , the CCDAO was permitted to \"render such non-prosecutorial support, investigative aid and other assistance as the Attorney Pro Team deems proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on these allegations, the CCDAO Defendants conduct is along the lines of the conduct described in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   . The\n   CCDAO Defendants were acting as investigators searching for probable cause, as opposed to acting as prosecutors with probable cause preparing for prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p274\">\n    509 U.S. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p274\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). As such, at this time, prosecutorial immunity does not protect the actions of the CCDAO Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The AG Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The AG Defendants argue that they are entitled to prosecutorial immunity. First, Defendant Abbott contends that, as a supervisor, he is entitled to the same immunity of those that he is supervising. Defendant White contends that because the OAG did not intervene in the case until after the investigatory phase, he is entitled to prosecutorial immunity. Accordingly, the AG Defendants maintain that they only functioned in a capacity that was intimately associated with the judicial phase of the case against Plaintiff. Plaintiff counters that Defendant Abbott affirmatively argued that he falls outside the scope of prosecutorial immunity and that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded, for purposes of a motion to dismiss, that Defendant White was part of the investigation against Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendant Abbott is correct that, as a supervisor of the assistant attorney generals, he is immune to the extent that, in this case, Defendant White, is immune.\n   <em>\n    Van de Kamp v. Goldstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679192\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/335/#p347\">\n    555 U.S. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679192\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/335/#p347\">\n    129 S.Ct. 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679192\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/335/#p347\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (emphasis in original) (explaining that not protecting the supervisor would \"create practical anomalies. A trial prosecutor would remain immune ... but her supervisor might be liable for\n   <em>\n    negligent\n   </em>\n   training or supervision .... [Thereby creating a situation where] a plaintiff could restyle a complaint charging a trial failure so that it becomes a complaint charging failure of training or supervision [essentially] eviscerate[ing]\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   .\"). As such, to determine the immunity of Defendant Abbott, the Court must look to the immunity of Defendant White.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds, based on the allegations against White, that, at this stage, some of his actions are protected by prosecutorial immunity and some of his actions are not. The Court addresses the allegations against Defendant White in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Involvement Starting in December 2008\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The AG Defendants maintain that when Defendant White became involved in Plaintiff's case it was \"well after the investigation was commenced by the CCDAO\" and that at that point Plaintiff was already a clearly identified suspect and the CCDAO already had probable cause, comparing the case to\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   . However, Defendant White was involved in the case much earlier than the point when he was appointed to the Attorney\n   <em>\n    Pro Team\n   </em>\n   . After Plaintiff defeated the incumbent on March 4, 2008, the CCDAO almost immediately began an investigation into her campaign. The first known grand jury subpoena was issued in September 2008. Three months later, Defendant Milner, on behalf of the CCDAO, requested the assistance of the OAG specifically requesting Defendant White for his \"expertise\" in election violations. Defendant White confirmed to the FBI that he started assisting on Plaintiff's case in December 2008, prior to Plaintiff taking the bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, the facts of this case are distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   . The Northern District of Texas in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   held that a prosecutor's actions in attending and allegedly directing a line-up were \"continuing to develop the State's case against\n   <em>\n    identified\n   </em>\n   suspects, not attempting to identify new suspects. Plaintiffs had already been indicted for the murder of Cruz, and by this time [the prosecutors] had the majority of their witnesses and evidence in place for trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v. Abreo\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:09-cv-190-C,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011565430\">\n    2010 WL 11565430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 20, 2010). Here, according to the allegations, this was not a case where the police investigated a crime to find a suspect, but rather where the prosecutors investigated a suspect to find a crime. Thus, the fact that Plaintiff was already identified as \"the suspect\" at the time Defendant White joined the investigation is irrelevant in this case. Further, there is no allegation that the CCDAO had probable cause by December of 2008, and in fact, the allegations suggest that the Plaintiff was investigated for at least another year and a half before ever even seeking an indictment against Plaintiff. Finally, Plaintiff had not yet been indicted, nor were the prosecutors in this case anywhere close to having even enough evidence to get an indictment, much less to be prepared to try the case. As such, the AG Defendants' reliance on this case, and this reasoning, is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this case, and at this stage, there are no allegations, that between December 2008 and, at the earliest, July 22, 2010, anything occurred that was tangentially related to the judicial phase of Plaintiff's prosecution. Thus, Defendant White's involvement beginning in December 2008 plausibly suggests that he was involved in the investigation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. June 2010 Meeting and Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the district judge presiding over the Spring 2010 Grand Jury declined to extend the grand jury's six-month term on June 24, 2010. Despite this ruling, Plaintiff claims that on June 28, 2010, Defendant White reached out to Plaintiff's counsel requesting she appear at an added grand jury session, which Plaintiff was not aware had not been approved. At that time, Plaintiff's counsel and Plaintiff offered to meet with Defendant White, and others, on June 29, 2010. The June 29, 2010 meeting was very short and Defendant White had no questions for Plaintiff at that time. Plaintiff alleges that she perceived the meeting was an attempt to intimidate her. Subsequently, Plaintiff learned of the ruling that the extension had been denied; accordingly, on June 29, 2010, Plaintiff's counsel filed a Motion to Quash the Illegally Re-Assembled Grand Jury. On June 30, 2010, the district court held a hearing on the motion, with Plaintiff's counsel and Defendant White appearing at the hearing. The motion to quash was granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AG Defendants argue that any meeting prior to a grand jury and any pretrial hearing are protected by prosecutorial immunity. Plaintiff disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court acknowledges that \"interviewing witnesses who will appear before the grand jury\" generally falls \"within the\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   shelter.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524077\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/748/#p769\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as identified earlier, not every grand jury proceeding is protected by the\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   shelter. Accordingly, it naturally follows that interviewing a witness before a grand jury will not always fall within the\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   shelter, particularly when the grand jury proceeding itself does not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   shelter. Here, at the motion to dismiss stage, it is at least plausible that this \"grand jury\n   proceeding\" would not be intimately connected with the judicial phase of the process, as it was expressly against a direct order of the district court and, ultimately, never held upon threat of contempt. Additionally, prior to the end of the grand jury's term in Spring of 2010, the Spring 2010 Grand Jury requested to hear the criminal case against Plaintiff but Defendant Milner refused. It is unlikely that less than a week later the prosecution had probable cause to present their case against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cousin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347058\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/627/#p633\">\n    325 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   633 (citing\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p274\">\n    509 U.S. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p274\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (holding \"[T]he existence of probable cause with respect to a particular suspect is a significant factor to be used in evaluating the advocatory nature [as opposed to the investigatory nature] of prosecutorial conduct.\").

The Fifth Circuit has described that a district attorney has qualities of both a state official and a county official; explaining, that the district attorney's \"office is a local entity, created by the State of Texas and deriving its powers from those of the State, but limited in exercise of those powers to the county, filled by its voters, and paid for with its funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Crane v.

Additionally, the CCDAO in this case was not attempting to uphold the laws of the State, as the allegations against Plaintiff were not a crime under the laws of the State. As such, because the policy is not about enforcing the laws of the State and instead runs afoul of the laws of the State and serves as a violation of the Constitution, based on the precedent before it, the Court finds that Defendant Roach, as the Collin County District Attorney, was acting as a policy maker on behalf of the County for purposes of the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The CCDAO Defendants state Plaintiff's punitive damage claim fails, without any argument or factual support.

Defendant Cristopher Milner was an assistant district attorney in Collin County at this time, and participated in the case against Plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Defendant Gregory Abbott was the Attorney General for the State of Texas at this time. Defendant Harry Eugene White was an assistant attorney general at this time and participated in the case against Plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    It is interesting to note that generally another assistant district attorney presented cases to the grand jury; however, when it came to Plaintiff's case, Defendant Milner presented the case to the grand jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The AG Defendants point out the complaint alleges that the CCDAO had control of the investigation; however, Defendant White was deputized as an assistant district attorney for Collin County in September 2009 operating under Defendant Roach's authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The district court held that \"The Attorneys representing the State in this matter had absolute[ly] NO authority to re-assemble this Court's Grand Jury after it was discharged on June 24, 2010 without permission of the Court .... Therefore, there is no authority for this Court's Grand Jury to re-assemble to conduct any additional business. Any such business will be VOID and have NO AUTHORITY. Any person who violates this order will immediately be held in CONTEMPT.\" (Dkt. #10 at \u00b6 47) (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    As properly laid out in the AG's motion to dismiss, the claims of supervisory liability and failure to intervene are incorporated into whether Plaintiff has pleaded a constitutional violation. As such, the Court reserves ruling on these issues contained in the CCDAO Defendants' and the AG Defendants' motions to dismiss. Moreover, the AG Defendants' argument that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead a claim against them will also be addressed within the analysis of qualified immunity. Finally, Collin County's argument that it is not liable because of the immunity of the CCDAO Defendants will only be able to be decided after the qualified immunity issue is decided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    For example, in her complaint: (1) Plaintiff does not mention her probation, which is a basis for a deprivation of liberty in her procedural due process claim; (2) lacks factual details surrounding her arrest, which is the basis for her false arrest claim; (3) could contain more specifics surrounding her supervisory liability and failure to intervene claims; and (4) could be more specific as to her due process claim-whether she seeks only procedural or also substantive due process and what property and liberty interests are alleged, although some of this information is contained in the briefing, it could be more clearly identified in the complaint. The Court does not hold that any of the areas are insufficient or that there are no other areas that could be clarified, but merely provides some examples of where some additional clarity could be helpful to the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Plaintiff also asserts that the AG Defendants were not acting within the scope of their authority as she has asserted an ultra vires exception to immunity. Plaintiff argues that there is a statute that defines the role that the AG Defendants are allowed to act within when assisting a district attorney's office, and that the AG Defendants acted outside such authority. The Court finds this argument intriguing, but unnecessary to fully develop at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The AG Defendants also argued that they were entitled to official immunity in the same way they were entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity, which the Court previously determined they are not entitled to at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The County also maintains that this argument is further supported by the fact that the CCDAO Defendants would gain immunity in their official capacity under the 11th Amendment, which is derived from the State. Because Plaintiff did not sue the CCDAO Defendants in their official capacity, the Court does not venture out to decide the hypothetical situation of, if they had been sued in their official capacity, if the CCDAO Defendants would be immune pursuant to the 11th Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court also notes that in\n    <em>\n     Brown\n    </em>\n    the Fifth Circuit pointed out that \"Brown does not contend that, apart from the role of Lyford, Upshur county has a policy of charging and arresting innocent people.\"\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

While the Court does not speculate on the Fifth Circuit's ruling had that been the argument, the Court does find it noteworthy that it was mentioned before the Court determined that the attorney appointed as attorney\n    <em>\n     pro team\n    </em>\n    for the district attorney's office was acting on behalf of the state.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Northern District of Texas did identify the difference between the two allegations; however, the defendants in that case did not argue against the official policy; accordingly, that claim proceeded past the motion to dismiss without an argument against it.\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021356818\">\n     2003 WL 21356818\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Even so, just looking to the complaint, Plaintiff has plausibly pleaded that the CCDAO Defendants acted willfully and intentionally.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
