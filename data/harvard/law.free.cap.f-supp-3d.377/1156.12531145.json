DEQ set forth Montana's original WQS in what DEQ defined as \"Circular 12-A\" (hereafter \"Montana's Base WQS\"). Montana's Base WQS apply to the discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus in applicable Montana waters. DEQ developed standards for each of Montana's \"wadeable streams\" and grouped these standards by ecoregions. AR-1221. Montana's Base WQS serve to protect all designated uses, including health, fishing, and recreation in most Montana waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Montana's Base WQS sets pollutant concentration limits, geographical parameters, and seasonal timeframes to which the standards apply. AR-1222-23.

DEQ developed the Original Variance Standard in recognition of the challenges in meeting the stringent requirements of Montana's Base WQS. DEQ relaxed the criteria for dischargers. The Original Variance Standard provided a relaxed limit of 1,000 \u00b5g/l of total phosphorus and 10,000 \u00b5g/l of total nitrogen for larger plants discharging more than one million gallons of effluent per day (\"gpd\"). AR-12232. The Original Variance Standard additionally placed a limit of 2,000 \u00b5g/l of total phosphorus and 15,000 \u00b5g/l of total nitrogen for smaller plants discharging less than one million gpd.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DEQ developed the Original Variance Standard based on DEQ's determination that many dischargers could not feasibly meet the high costs associated with implementation of Montana's Base WQS. DEQ allowed the Original Variance Standard to last up to twenty years from the date of adoption pursuant to Montana law. DEQ claims that the Original Variance Standard allowed time for improvements from current conditions to work toward the stringent numeric nutrient criteria contained in Montana's Base WQS. EPA approved Montana's Base WQS and the Original Variance Standard in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Waterkeeper challenged the Original Variance Standard in this Court in May 2016. Montana law requires DEQ and EPA to review the variance every three years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-5-313\">\n    Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 75-5-313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). DEQ began the process of amending the Original Variance Standard during the pendency of the May 2016 lawsuit. EPA approved what is known as \"Amended Circular 12-B\" (hereafter the \"Current Variance Standard\") in October of 2017, pursuant to its first triennial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   EPA similarly approved the seventeen-year period remaining on the variance's twenty-year timeline. The first triennial review did not alter the criteria in Montana's Base WQS. AR-20649. The Current Variance Standard improves upon the Original Variance Standard by providing a tighter limit of 300 \u00b5g/l of total phosphorus and 6,000 \u00b5g/l of total nitrogen for larger plants discharging more than one million gpd. AR-12232. The Current Variance Standard additionally placed a limit of 1,000 \u00b5g/l of total phosphorus and 10,000 \u00b5g/l of total nitrogen for smaller plants discharging less than one million gpd.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-5-313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Current Variance Standard places stronger limits on dischargers than the limits of the Original Variance Standard. The Current Variance Standard continues to fall short, however, of the criteria contained in Montana's Base WQS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held a hearing to discuss the impact of the Current Variance Standard on Waterkeeper's original Complaint on June 28, 2017. (Doc. 99.) The parties determined that the Current Variance Standard rendered the Original Variance Standard inapplicable to the proceeding. The Court granted Waterkeeper leave to amend its Complaint to address the Current Variance Standard and the updated posture that it presented to the litigation. (Doc. 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Current Variance Standard applies to thirty-six municipal dischargers. DEQ premised the Current Variance Standard upon \"widespread economic and social impact\" to Montana communities associated with the need to comply with the WQS. DEQ and EPA determined that the cost of implementing the technology required to meet Montana's Base WQS would cause these widespread economic and social impacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Waterkeeper's Amended Complaint raises the same essential challenges to EPA's approval of the Current Variance Standard. Waterkeeper alleges (1) that the language of the CWA does not allow for the consideration of economic and social impacts (i.e. \"costs\") in setting WQS; and (2) that the Current Variance Standard effectively replaces Montana's Base WQS. Waterkeeper argues that the seventeen-year timeline requires Defendants to meet only the more relaxed Current Variance Standard, rather than to meet the more stringent criteria in Montana's Base WQS. Defendants assert that DEQ based the Current Variance Standard upon a permissible interpretation of the CWA and that the Current Variance Standard does not replace Montana's Base WQS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The City of Whitefish does not yet meet the Current Variance Standard of 6,000 \u00b5g/l. AR-20498. DEQ may determine, however, that current conditions at the City of Whitefish do not require it to meet even the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-20498. DEQ will analyze how far the City of Whitefish stands from meeting the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   DEQ could authorize anywhere between zero steps and the full nine steps for the City of Whitefish to reach the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-20498. The number of years that\n   DEQ allows the City of Whitefish to reach the Current Variance Standard may run anywhere between zero and the full remaining seventeen years of the variance. The City of Whitefish still would fall below attainment of the stricter criteria in Montana's Base WQS at the end of the seventeen years. This scenario conflicts with the notion that a variance should allow a discharger sufficient time to reach the stricter criteria contained in Montana's Base WQS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C020\">\n    80 Fed.

EPA's regulation allowing time to \"achieve\" a variance stretches the definition of \"highest attainable condition\" to allow a twenty-year period merely to reach the \"highest attainable condition.\" This contradiction does not comport with the purposes of the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The variance should serve to allow a discharger to make progress toward attaining the highest condition - Montana's Base WQS. Nothing in EPA's regulations, or the terms of the variance that it approved, allows a discharger time to meet merely the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard. Further, nothing in Montana's variance statute - the source of the twenty-year timeline - contemplates a timeline for the State of Montana to work toward compliance with the relaxed Current Variance Standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when they adopted the Current Variance Standard. Congress contemplated that attainment of a state's base WQS would not always be attainable immediately. The regulations effectuate\n   this purpose by allowing dischargers time-limited variances to reach base criteria. Montana's Base WQS constitute the base criteria. Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously when they set forth a seventeen-year timeline after their first triennial review merely to meet the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard. The CWA does not contemplate the ability of a state to adopt a variance from the variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The regulations do not prove arbitrary and capricious in their use of the phrase \"highest attainable condition\" as a representation of the treatment requirements throughout the term of the variance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20131.14\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(ii). The regulations prove arbitrary and capricious, however, when they contradict the term \"attainable\" in setting forth the term of the variance as \"only as long as necessary to\n   <em>\n    achieve\n   </em>\n   the highest attainable condition[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20131.14\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(iv) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The seventeen-year timeline permissibly could be used to meet the criteria in Montana's Base WQS. Defendants must begin with a program that complies with the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard.

Defendants must adopt a timeline for which attainment of Montana's Base WQS would be feasible. To hold otherwise would render meaningless Montana's Base WQS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    III. WHETHER THE VARIANCE REPRESENTS A REPLACEMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Waterkeeper argues that the Current Variance Standard constitutes a replacement WQS that does not protect the designated uses adopted by DEQ and EPA under Montana's Base WQS. Waterkeeper asserts that the Current Variance Standard now constitutes the State of Montana's Base WQS for the term of the variance. Waterkeeper contends that EPA's approval of the Current Variance Standard proves arbitrary and capricious as it fails to protect designated uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Waterkeeper relies on\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202967654\">\n    2008 WL 2967654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. July 29, 2008), to argue that EPA used the Current Variance Standard to circumvent the requirements of Montana's Base WQS. The district court in\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe\n   </em>\n   analyzed the State of Florida's adoption of numeric nutrient criteria for phosphorus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *27. The State of Florida approved a blanket variance in light of its determination that dischargers were not yet ready to meet the criteria required to protect the designated use. The district court determined that EPA's approval of the blanket variance proved arbitrary and capricious. The blanket variance \"effectively suspends the enforcement of the [numeric] phosphorus criterion and, in lieu, creates new or revised water quality criterion[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Waterkeeper argues that the district court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe\n   </em>\n   compels a similar result for the Current Variance Standard. EPA's approval of the Current Variance Standard proves distinguishable at this time. The Current Variance Standard does not involve a blanket variance that covers all dischargers without requiring the discharger to request the variance. The Current Variance Standard also subjects dischargers to a use attainability analysis to demonstrate that a variance would be necessary to avoid substantial and widespread economic and social impact. The Current Variance Standard does not involve dischargers who merely stand unwilling to meet the criteria for the designated use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe\n   </em>\n   , at *27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court has determined that Defendants must begin with compliance with the\n   Current Variance Standard and then work toward attainment of Montana's Base WQS. The Current Variance Standard must involve a process by which DEQ evaluates attainability against the impact on median household income and socioeconomic conditions within communities. The district court in\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe\n   </em>\n   reasoned that the variance at issue did not contemplate progress toward attainment. The Court too recognizes that a variance's effect, even if not its intended purpose, may be to avoid attainment indefinitely rather than to make progress toward attainment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   EPA argues that the time-limited variance requires dischargers to take specific action to reduce pollutant discharges and make progress to achieving compliance with the underlying numeric nutrient criteria. Waterkeeper argues that the variance requires no such progress and merely acts as an \"escape clause.\" To treat the Current Variance Standard as the baseline for the attainment of the criteria contained in Montana's Base WQS avoids allowing the variance to serve as an \"escape clause.\" This treatment also distinguishes it, for now, from\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Montana set itself as a national leader in the development of numeric nutrient criteria to protect its precious water resources. The record fails to demonstrate that the Current Variance Standard represents an attempt to make progress toward attainment. Defendants must demonstrate progress toward attainment of Montana's Base WQS. Defendants must set forth a timeline that ends with the ultimate attainment of Montana's Base WQS rather than simply improving water quality to the level of the relaxed criteria of the Current Variance Standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court declines to allow the relaxed Current Variance Standard, similar to the variance at issue in\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe\n   </em>\n   , to replace the criteria of Montana's Base WQS. EPA's approval of the relaxed Current Variance Standard itself does not violate the CWA. EPA's approval of the current seventeen-year timeline to allow dischargers to meet the relaxed Current Variance Standards runs counter to the CWA's requirements and cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants have demonstrated that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A) contains ambiguity that EPA may interpret.
