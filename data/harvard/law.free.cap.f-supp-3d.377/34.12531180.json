The complaint alleges that the directive was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 706.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Fed.

P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is perhaps worth noting at the outset what this case does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   involve. It is not about the best way to develop and implement our national environmental policies, or who are the proper people to assist in that process. And of course it is not about the wisdom or effectiveness of those policies. Rather, this case involves a fairly narrow set of issues: in substance, whether a specific EPA conflict-of-interest directive violates federal law, and whether plaintiffs are the proper parties to assert such claims. Based on established federal law, and for the reasons set forth below, the challenged directive is not subject to judicial\n   reversal, and accordingly the complaint will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the complaint, documents referred to in the complaint, and accompanying exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Environmental Protection Agency is the principal agency of the federal government tasked with protecting the environment. (Compl. \u00b6 19). In furtherance of its mission, the EPA administers grants, some of which fund scientific research. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36). Thousands of these grants are awarded to individuals or groups affiliated with public institutions of higher learning, private universities, and not-for-profit organizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To help guide its decision-making, the EPA receives counsel on scientific and policy matters from almost two dozen federal advisory committees (\"FAC\"), including the Science Advisory Board (\"SAB\"), the Board of Scientific Counselors (\"BSC\"), and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (\"CASAC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 25-26). FACs are typically composed of scientists and other experts affiliated with universities, not-for-profit research institutions, private industry, and local governments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   EPA FAC members are appointed by the Administrator of the EPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). They typically serve a term of a defined length, usually two or three years, but are eligible to be reappointed to a second term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). FAC participation offers scientists an opportunity to help shape public policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32). Some FAC members are also paid for their work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Like other agency heads, the EPA Administrator has broad discretion over the appointment of FAC members. By regulation, \"[u]nless otherwise provided by statute, Presidential directive, or other establishment authority, advisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the appointing or inviting authority. Membership terms are at the sole discretion of the appointing or inviting authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.130\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Some constraints on FAC composition are imposed by statute. For present purposes, the most significant limitations are imposed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (\"FACA\"), which requires, among other things, that committee membership be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7 5(b)(2). FACA further requires committees to be free from \"inappropriate[ ] influence[ ] by the appointing authority or by any special interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7 5(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because some FAC members are scientists associated with universities and not-for-profit research institutions, some FAC members are also recipients of EPA grants that have been awarded to their universities and institutions. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31, 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Union of Concerned Scientists (\"UCS\") is a not-for-profit organization with a self-described mission of conducting scientific analysis and research in the public interest and representing the interests of the scientific community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Its \"core mission\" is to advance and support the interests of the scientific community in\n   government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). It also seeks to advance the interests of its individual members and members of its Science Network, a membership organization of individuals within USC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). Many of those members either currently hold a grant from the EPA or serve on a FAC, or plan to apply for a grant or seek to serve on a FAC in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 31, 2017, then-EPA Administrator E. Scott Pruitt issued a directive titled \"Strengthening and Improving Membership on EPA Federal Advisory Committees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 33; Ex. A). The directive stated that \"[i]n order to strengthen and improve the independence, diversity and breadth of participation on EPA federal advisory committees,\" the EPA \"shall, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, apply ... [four] principles and procedures when establishing the membership of such committees.\" (Ex. A). The first principle-and the only one at issue in this case-is entitled \"Strengthen Member Independence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It provides that FAC \"[m]embers shall be independent from EPA, which shall include a requirement that no member of an EPA federal advisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA grants, either as principal investigator or co-investigator, or in a position that otherwise would reap substantial direct benefit from an EPA grant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second, third, and fourth principles direct the agency to increase participation in FACs from state, tribal, and local government officials; increase membership from historically unrepresented or underrepresented states and region (\"Enhance Geographic Diversity\"); and regularly rotate membership (\"Promote Fresh Perspectives\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Elizabeth Anne Sheppard is Professor and Assistant Chair of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. (Compl. \u00b6 15). She is one of the seven members of CASAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She is currently serving a three-year term on CASAC and is eligible for reappointment to an additional term when her current term concludes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Before the directive was issued, she simultaneously served on CASAC and was the recipient of a $ 3 million EPA grant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). As a result of the directive, she was forced to give up her role as co-investigator on the grant and has not sought EPA grant funding for any future research. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 66-69). The complaint alleges that if the directive were rescinded, it is likely she would reassume her role as co-investigator, or otherwise seek EPA grant funding, while continuing to serve on CASAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). She wishes to be considered for EPA research grant funding in the future\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   continue serving on CASAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). She is paid for her work on CASAC, and also views her participation as an important form of public service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Fed.
