Read together, these sections require the EEOC to investigate a charge and dispose of it in one of the four ways listed in \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) : conciliation, filing suit on behalf of the aggrieved person, dismissing the charge, or, if none of these actions are taken within the 180 day period, notifying the aggrieved person of his or her right to sue. When \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) is read in conjunction with \u00a7 2000e-5(b), it is clear that Congress intended for the EEOC to have control over charges of discrimination for 180 days and that a cause of action based on those charges may not be brought before the expiration of that time.

Section 2000e-5(b) and (f)(1) can be read together to an unambiguous result: Congress intended the EEOC to investigate every charge, but acknowledged the potential for charges to become lost or dormant in the agency's backlog, leaving aggrieved persons without a swift remedy. As a result, it later amended the statute to create\n   a 180-day \"safety-valve\" through which aggrieved persons can prosecute their claims should the EEOC be unable to do so. Read this way, there is no ambiguity and the EEOC's reasonableness in promulgating the regulation should not be considered. As explained above, when read together, \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5 and (b) and (f)(1) leave the EEOC with only four ways to dispose of a charge while fulfilling its statutory duty to investigate it: conciliation, suit, dismissal, or inaction for 180 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Further, though it may be argued that there is no practical difference between dismissing a charge before 180 days-an action explicitly allowed in the statute-and issuing an early right to sue notice under the regulation, the two are not the same, especially not in this case. While the EEOC may dismiss a charge early, it still must investigate that charge. On the other hand,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.28\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) says nothing about ending an investigation early because the charge appears to be unfounded.

Contreras' EEOC charge stated that he was discriminated against because of his race, and, specifically, that he was \"harassed in the form of disciplinary actions for infractions that are not true or not a violation of any policy,\" \"was removed from a special assignment.\" Contreras stated in his charge, \"I believe I was denied an assignment, harassed and disciplined because of my race (Latino) and National Origin (Hispanic) in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.\" Dkt.
