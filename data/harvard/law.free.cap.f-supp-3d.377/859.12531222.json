(\"Defendant\" or \"National Union\")'s motion for summary judgment (Doc. 12) and the parties' responsive memoranda (Docs. 17, 21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also before the Court is National Union's motion to strike (Doc. 22) and the parties' responsive memoranda (Docs. 25, 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties agree that there is no outstanding dispute of material fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case arises out of a May 26, 2015 fire at an apartment building located at 6020 Dahlgren Street in Cincinnati, Ohio (the \"Building\"). (Doc. 13-2 at \u00b6 1). Firefighters were dispatched to the Building, and Daryl E. Gordon, a firefighter, was killed responding to the fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2; Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the relevant timeframe, The Community Builders, Inc. (\"TCB\") owned the building. (Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6 2). Wallick Properties Midwest LLC (\"Wallick\"), managed\n   the building for TCB, pursuant to a Management Agreement. (Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 3-1). The Management Agreement between TCB and Wallick contained the following provision regarding insurance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Insurance\n   </em>\n   . The Owner [TCB] will inform the Agent [Wallick] of insurance to be carried with respect to the Project and its operations and the Owner will cause such insurance to be placed and kept in effect at all times. The Agent will pay premiums out of the Rental Agency Account and premiums will be treated as operating expenses. All insurance will be placed with such companies, or such conditions, in such amounts and with such beneficial interests appearing thereon as shall be acceptable to the Owner and Consenting Parties and shall be otherwise in conformity with the mortgage; provided that the same will include public liability coverage, with the Agent designated as one of the insured, in amounts acceptable to [Wallick] as well as [TCB] and the Consenting Parties. [Wallick] will investigate and furnish [TCB] with full reports as to all accidents, claims and potential claims for damages relating to the Project and will cooperate with [TCB's] insurers in connection therewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Doc. 3-1 at PAGEID # 409). Therefore, under the Management Agreement, TCB was required to secure insurance that designated Wallick as an insured. Wallick was also required to cooperate with TCB's insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Liberty Mutual Insurance/American Economy Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\") issued a Commercial Package Policy (the \"Liberty Mutual Policy\"). Wallick qualified as an \"insured\" under the Liberty Mutual Policy. (Doc. 13-2 at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gordon's estate brought claims against TCB and Wallick, among others. The claims were settled with contributions from multiple insurers, including CIC and National Union. (Doc. 18-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Liberty Mutual contributed to the settlement of Gordon's claims on behalf of Wallick until its primary policy was exhausted. (Doc. 13-2 at \u00b6 11). CIC paid $ 1,000,000, its policy limit, on behalf of Wallick as part of the settlement. (Doc. 3 at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CIC claims that the insurance policies issued by itself and National Union are both excess policies and therefore National Union should contribute to the settlement on a pro rata basis. National Union argues that the policy it issued is in excess to CIC's policy and therefore is not required to contribute to CIC's settlement payment. Therefore, the Court will next examine the relevant portions of the insurance policies at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. CIC Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CIC issued a policy to Wallick with a \"Commercial General Liability Coverage Part\" for the period June 24, 2014 to June 24, 2015 (the \"CIC Policy\"). (Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6 6; Doc. 12-3). CIC originally issued an insurance policy to Wallick on June 24, 2009. (Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6 17). The CIC policy has a per occurrence limit of $ 1,000,000. (Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6 7). The \"Insuring Agreement\" section of the CIC Policy provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any\n   \"occurrence\" and settle any claim or \"suit\" that may result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. 12-3 at PAGEID # 657).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The \"Commercial General Liability Conditions\" section of the CIC Policy includes an \"Other Insurance\" provision providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Other Insurance\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under COVERAGE A.

If this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by method described in c. below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b.\n   <strong>\n    Excess Insurance\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This insurance is excess over:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) Any other primary insurance available to the insured covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations, or the products and completed operations, for which the insured have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 670-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The CIC Policy also contains the following endorsement (the \"Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement,\" or the \"Endorsement\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. REAL ESTATE PROPERTY MANAGED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   This insurance does not apply to \"property damage\" to property you operate or manage or as to which you act as agent for the collection of rents or in any other supervisory capacity\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to your liability out of your management of property for which you are acting as real estate manager this insurance is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 701). The Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement was added to the CIC Policy in 2012. (Doc. 18-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The CIC Policy reflects a \"Commercial General Liability Coverage Part\" premium of $ 145,558. (Doc. 12-3 at 494). The premium charged under the CIC policy for coverage provided by the \"Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement\" was $ 1,957.00. (Doc. 12-3 at 723).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Schedule of Locations (the \"Schedule of Locations\", Doc. 13-3, at PAGEID # 869-76) lists all the properties covered by the Commercial General Liability Coverage Part. The Building is not listed on the Schedule of Locations. It is undisputed that Wallick was acting as a real estate manager for the Building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the CIC Policy contains the following \"Method of Sharing\" provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limits of insurance\n   to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Doc. 12-3 at PAGEID # 671).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. National Union Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   National Union issued an Umbrella Policy to TCB for the period May 1, 2014 to May 1, 2015 (the \"National Union Policy\"). (Doc. 12-4). Wallick also qualified as an insured under the National Union Policy. (Doc. 13-2 at \u00b6 12). The National Union Policy has a limit of $ 25,000,000. (Doc. 12-4 at PAGEID # 740). The National Union Policy Reflects a premium of $ 314,112.00 or $ 12,564.48 per $ 1,000,000 of coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

The Court will address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Blandford Affidavit \u00b6 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   11. Liberty Mutual agreed Wallick was an insured under the policy issued to TCB; agreed its policy was primary; provided Wallick defense and indemnity; and contributed to the settlement of the firefighter's claim on behalf of Wallick, providing primary coverage until its policy was exhausted. (Blandford Affidavit at \u00b6 11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court finds that this is inadmissible hearsay to the extent that it is offers to prove the position of Liberty Mutual regarding how it interpreted the Liberty Mutual Policy. Nevertheless, Blandford filed a second affidavit (Doc. 24) that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   4. Wallick was an insured under the Liberty Mutual policy issued to TCB, and Liberty Mutual provided Wallick defense and indemnity and contributed to the settlement of the firefighter's claim on behalf of Wallick, without contribution from CIC or National Union, until its policy was exhausted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court finds that this revised statement does not include inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Mueller Affidavit \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14 (Doc. 13-3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   8. Beginning in 2012, Wallick requested limited coverage from CIC for locations such as the Dahlgren property - properties which Wallick managed but which were owned by someone else who provided primary general liability insurance for those properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   14. ISO has indicated that the coverage provided by the Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement \"is excess over any other available insurance, regardless if the other insurance is primary or excess.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits C and D, www.claimsjournal.com and https://paas.iso.com).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   National Union also seeks to strike Exhibits C and D attached to the Mueller Affidavit as hearsay and for lack of proper authentication. Exhibits C and D contain statements from the website of ISO, a source of information about property/casualty insurance, regarding coverage provided by the Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court finds that, to the extent these statements are offered to explain CIC's intents and purposes in drafting the CIC Policy, they are not hearsay. However, these statements would then be offered as extrinsic evidence to interpret the CIC Policy. As discussed above, the Court will not consider extrinsic evidence to interpret the unambiguous terms of the CIC Policy. Therefore, the Court will not consider statements in Paragraphs 8 and 14 of the Mueller Affidavit, nor Exhibits C and D attached thereto, in analyzing the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Authentication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, National Union argues that the Schedule of Locations, attached as Exhibit A to the Mueller Affidavit, should be stricken for lack of authentication. (Doc. 13-3 at PAGEID # 869-76). National Union contends that Mueller fails to explain the origin of the Schedule of Locations or where she obtained it. National Union relies on\n   <em>\n    Papalios v.

Importantly, however, the court only addressed whether the document was self-authenticating because the plaintiff had not filed an authenticating affidavit with the offered document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Here, the Plaintiff does not contend that the Schedule of Locations is self-authenticating, but attached it to an authenticating affidavit. The Mueller Affidavit is based on her personal knowledge as she participated in the creation of the Schedule of Locations. Therefore, the Schedule of Locations is clearly authenticated and is admissible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons outlined above, National Union's motion to strike (Doc. 22) is granted in part and denied in part.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At issue before the Court is whether the National Union Policy is in excess to the CIC Policy. National Union argues that the National Union Policy is a true umbrella policy, and thus is in excess to all other policies. National Union also contends the CIC Policy does not provide disparate coverage relative to the Schedule of Locations. CIC argues that, while the CIC Policy provided primary coverage related to properties included on a Schedule of Locations, the Building was covered by the Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement, which provides excess coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   It is not in dispute that the Building is not included on the Schedule of Locations and that Wallick was acting as a real estate manager for the Building. As the facts are not disputed, the Court is \"presented solely with a question of law concerning the correct construction\" of the National Union and CIC Insurance Policies.\n   <em>\n    Advance Watch Co. Ltd. v. Kemper Nat. Ins.

Therefore, the Court must consider whether the Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement modifies the CIC Policy to provide excess coverage for liabilities arising out of Wallick's management of property as a real estate manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It is undisputed that the CIC Policy is generally a primary policy and is titled a \"general liability\" policy. CIC contends, however, that the CIC Policy was modified in 2012 by the Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement to provide excess coverage for certain properties managed by Wallick. Above the Endorsement, the CIC Policy states, in bold capital letters: \"\n   <strong>\n    THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   </strong>\n   \" (Doc. 12-3 at PAGEID # 701). The Endorsement then provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   With respect to your liability out of your management of property for which you are acting as real estate manager this insurance is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In its analysis of an insurance policy, a court \"may not render any term meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Mar. 26, 2004) (holding that real estate property\n   management endorsement clearly and unambiguously modified an insurance agreement to make the policy excess).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This Court finds that the CIC Policy plainly states the agreement between Wallick and CIC. Here, the language of the Endorsement clearly and unambiguously provides that, for any liability arising out of Wallick's management of property for which it was acting as a real estate manager, the CIC Policy provides excess coverage over any other insurance. The Court agrees with the majority of courts that find that the terms of the Real Estate Property Managed Endorsement make the CIC Policy a true excess policy for properties where Wallick is acting as a real estate manager. Therefore, CIC's coverage of the Building is excess to any other valid and collectible insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court notes that in its summary judgment brief, National Union argues that the premiums of the CIC Policy and National Union Policy support the conclusion that the National Union Policy is in excess to the CIC Policy. Because excess policies provide special coverage not normally applicable except for in cases of catastrophic loss, premiums charged under such policies are substantially lower than premiums charged for a primary policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Treder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188306\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/771/#p783\">\n    271 Wis.2d at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188306\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/771/#p783\">\n    679 N.W.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . National Union highlights that the $ 1,000,000 CIC Policy reflects a \"Commercial General Liability Coverage Part\" premium of $ 145,558 (Doc. 12-3 at PAGEID # 494), whereas the $ 25,000,000 National Union Policy reflects a premium of $ 313,112.00, or $ 12,564.48 per $ 1,000,000 of coverage. (Doc. 12-4 at PAGEID # 740). National Union emphasizes that this is \"one-tenth the Cincinnati premium per dollar of coverage.\" (Doc. 12 at 17). However, in CIC's summary judgment brief, CIC makes clear that National Union failed to note that the premium charged by CIC under the Endorsement was only $ 1,957. (Doc. 12-3 at 723). National Union abandons this line of argument in its subsequent briefing. Therefore, the premium charged under the CIC Endorsement was significantly less per $ 1,000,000 than the National Union Policy. This further evinces the Court's finding that, as modified by the Endorsement, the CIC Policy provides true excess coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1800059\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/49/213/#p218\">\n    49 Ohio St. 2d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20N.E.2d%201052\">\n    361 N.E.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (1977). Because the Policies are mutually repugnant and both National Union and CIC are proportionally liable, each party is liable for the $ 1,000,000 settlement on a pro rata basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Additionally, the CIC Policy's \"Method of Sharing\" provision requires that the National Union and CIC provide coverage on a pro rata basis. That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limits of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   (Doc. 12-3 at PAGEID # 671). The National Union Policy does not contain a provision addressing the method of sharing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Here, in light of the fact that the National Union Policy and CIC Policy are mutually repugnant, and CIC's \"Method of Sharing\" provision that permits contribution by equal shares, the Court find that National Union and CIC must provide coverage on a pro rata basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
