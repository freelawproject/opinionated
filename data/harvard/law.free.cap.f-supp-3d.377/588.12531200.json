For the following reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted. Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Parties, Mark, Applications, and Registrations at Issue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At issue in this trademark case is the use of the IPAD mark in commerce. Plaintiff is RXD Media. RXD launched its website, ipad.mobi, in 2007. According to RXD, ipad.mobi was meant to be an online platform primarily for notetaking. In 2016 RXD relaunched its website as ipadtoday.com. Ipadtoday.com offers a wider array of services than ipad.mobi. Instead of simply being a notetaking platform it is a mobile notes and cloud storage site. Defendants are IP App and Apple. Apple is the technological titan founded by Steve Jobs. IP App is a subsidiary Apple used to apply for trademarks. Both Plaintiff and Defendants claim to have priority in the rights to use the IPAD mark in commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There are two trademark applications and several registered trademarks at issue. The two applications are the '446 Application and the '563 Application. These were both filed by IP App and seek to register the IPAD mark in relation to various services. In addition, Apple owns eight IPAD registrations, including one incontestable registration (the '575 Registration), which claim computer and digital goods as well as business and marketing services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    B. The TTAB Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After IP App filed its '446 Application and '563 Application, claiming use of the IPAD mark in connection with cloud storage and computing, RXD filed oppositions to each, arguing RXD had priority as a senior user for the use of the IPAD mark in cloud storage and computing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The TTAB rejected RXD's opposition, holding that RXD's mark was ipad.mobi, not IPAD, and even if RXD's mark was IPAD, RXD's use of the mark was descriptive, and therefore in order to be entitled\n   to priority RXD would have needed to demonstrate it had achieved secondary meaning in its IPAD mark before IP App's constructive priority dates of July 16, 2009 (the '563 Application) and January 25, 2010 (the '446 Application). The TTAB found RXD made no such showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Current Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After losing in the TTAB proceedings, RXD filed suit in this Court, (1) seeking this Court's review of the TTAB decision, (2) claiming Apple lacked bona fide intent to use the IPAD service mark in commerce for anything other than tablet computers, (3) seeking a declaration that RXD has priority over Apple's rights in the mark IPAD, (4) alleging likelihood of confusion, and (5) alleging unfair competition and false designation of origin. Apple counterclaimed, arguing RXD's use of IPAD should be enjoined because it infringes upon Apple's trademark registrations for IPAD. Apple counterclaimed for (1) trademark infringement under \u00a7 32(1) of the Lanham Act, (2) false designation of origin under \u00a7 43 (A)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act, and (3) common law trademark infringement and palming off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a period of discovery both parties moved for summary judgment. RXD moved for partial summary judgment on Apple's counterclaims. Apple moved for summary judgment on all claims and counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Oct. 21, 1994). An applicant possessing a brand concept that can embrace the use of the new mark, and the claimed goods or services being within the applicant's immediate capability to implement also constitute persuasive evidence of an applicant's bona fide intent to use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rolex Watch U.S.A., Inc. v.

Apr. 27, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, Apple has produced its license agreement for the IPAD mark, which covers the applied-for services. Apple has also produced evidence, through the form of contemporaneous registration certificates, that it had the capacity to produce the applied-for services. Viewing this in the context of the strength of Apple's brand, and its breadth of products and services, this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate Apple's bona fide intent to use the IPAD mark rather than simply reserve rights in the IPAD mark. Summary judgment on Count II of Plaintiff's Complaint is granted in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    C. Likelihood of Confusion with Apple's Registered Marks\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In its Counterclaim, Apple alleges RXD's use of the IPAD mark infringes on its registered IPAD marks and brings three Counts: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, false designation of origin, and common law trademark infringement. For the following reasons, summary judgment in favor of Apple on all three Counts is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To establish trademark infringement, the plaintiff must demonstrate it owns a valid, protectable mark and that there is likelihood of confusion between plaintiff's and defendant's marks. The Fourth Circuit considers nine factors in a likelihood of confusion analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (1) the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark as actually used in the marketplace; (2) the similarity of the two marks to consumers; (3) the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify; (4) the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders; (5) the similarity of advertising used by the markholders; (6) the defendant's intent; (7) actual confusion; (8) the quality of the defendant's product; and (9) the sophistication of the consuming public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Variety Stores, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516724\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/651/#p660\">\n    888 F.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660 (4th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The first six factors all cut in favor of Apple. First, Apple's mark is undeniably strong. Its products and i-formative trademarks\n   make up one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Second, both Apple and RXD use the IPAD mark, so not only are the marks similar to consumers, they are identical. Third, both Apple and RXD use the IPAD mark for electronic or computer goods and services. Fourth, both Apple and RXD offer their products through websites. Fifth, both Apple and RXD advertise over the internet. Finally, the evidence demonstrates RXD was aware of Apple's i-formative marks when it thought of the name ipad and that RXD's owner was put on notice by fellow users of online forums when he bought the ipad.mobi site that the use of IPAD could be potential trademark infringement, suggesting bad intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Apple has also demonstrated actual confusion. The Fourth Circuit inferred that survey evidence of actual confusion will weigh in favor of the alleged infringer if the survey showed a rate of actual confusion \"much below ten percent.\"\n   <em>\n    Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650629\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/455/\">\n    81 F.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 n.15 (4th Cir. 1996). A ten to twelve percent rate of actual confusion, on the other hand, is \"sufficient to demonstrate actual confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650629\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/455/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Apple has provided a consumer survey that found a twenty-seven percent confusion rate. This is well above the Fourth Circuit's benchmark and so this factor also cuts in favor of Apple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The eighth and ninth factors are neutral. The quality of the defendant's product is relevant when the defendant's product is \"markedly inferior,\" such that it is using \"the similarity of the two marks to generate undeserved sales.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650629\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/455/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650629\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/455/\">\n    at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Apple argues that RXD's low subscriber base for its IPAD service demonstrates its markedly inferior quality. However, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to RXD, a low subscriber base is not necessarily an indictment of the quality of RXD's product. Thus, this factor does not cut in either party's favor. Finally, the consumer sophistication factor is not relevant because both Apple and RXD market their goods to the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As discussed above, all but two of the relevant factors in the likelihood of confusion analysis cut toward Apple. Although trademark infringement is a fact-based inquiry, and is rarely resolved on summary judgment, here the evidence of infringement is overwhelming, and Apple is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Summary judgment on Apple's counterclaims for trademark infringement under \u00a7 32(1) of the Lanham Act, false designation of origin under \u00a7 43 (A)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act. and common law trademark infringement and palming off are granted in favor of Apple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As explained above, this Court affirms the TTAB decision and as a result grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff's Counts I, III, IV, and V. This Court also finds that Defendants demonstrated a bona fide intent to use the IPAD mark and so grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff's Count II. Finally, this Court finds the evidence establishes likelihood of confusion between RXD's use of IPAD and Apple's registered trademarks and so grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Defendants' counterclaims. Therefore. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted and summary judgment on all claims and counterclaims is granted in favor of Defendants. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is denied. A corresponding Order has issued. This Memorandum Opinion constitutes final judgment of this Court for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
