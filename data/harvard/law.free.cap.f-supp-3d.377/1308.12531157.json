(Doc. 27). In this motion, Defendant raised three grounds for judgment on the pleadings: (1) jurisdiction lies with a three-judge court, (2) the complaint fails to demonstrate that a remedy exists, and (3) the claims are barred by the doctrine of laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 7, 2018, the court ordered the parties to brief all three issues raised in the motion. (Doc. 30). Plaintiffs filed \"Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\" on November 30, 2018. (Doc. 31). On December 21, 2018, Defendant filed \"Secretary of State John Merrill's Reply in Support of His Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. 27).\" (Doc. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 16, 2019, the court held a hearing solely on the issue of whether jurisdiction of this case lay with this court or with a three-judge panel. On January 28, 2019, the court entered an Order denying Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the jurisdictional issue. (Doc. 41). Because the court has jurisdiction, the case remains before this court. So, the remaining two grounds raised by Defendant in his motion for judgment on the pleadings are now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are eight African-American citizens of Alabama. One Plaintiff resides in Congressional District (\"CD\") 1, one resides in CD 2, one resides in CD 3, and five reside in CD 7. The redistricting plan currently used in Alabama, Senate Bill 484, allegedly \"packs\" African-American voters into CD 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 484, 2011 Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2011). The Alabama legislature established CD 7 as a majority-minority district following the 1982 Amendments of the Voting Rights Act. Nearly one-third of Alabama's African-American population falls into CD 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the passage of S.B. 484, the black voting age population (BVAP) of CD 7 under the 2002 redistricting plan was 58.33%. Now, the CD 7 BVAP is 60.91%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that S.B. 484 redrew district lines to \"move\" African-American voters from predominantly white districts into CD 7 to \"pack\" the district designated as a majority-minority district with African-American voters. But the plan also allegedly \"cracks\" African-American voters in CDs 1, 2, and 3 by splitting among three districts those African-American voters who could be grouped together in a second majority-minority district. Plaintiffs contend that the African-American population in these districts should be united to form a second majority-minority CD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs raise a Section 2 violation of the Voting Rights Act, alleging vote dilution. The Supreme Court identified three preconditions necessary to establish a vote dilution claim: (1) the minority group \"is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in the single-member district,\" (2) the minority group is \"politically cohesive,\" and (3) \"the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it-in the absence of special circumstances, such as the minority candidate running unopposed-usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    Thornburg v.

The first principle is that, in evaluating motions to dismiss, the court must assume the veracity of well-pleaded factual allegations; however, the court does not have to accept as true legal conclusions even when \"couched as ... factual allegation[s]\" or \"threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Courts hesitate to require a plaintiff to prove the elements of a claim at the motion to dismiss stage. \"Asking for plausible grounds to infer [an element of a claim] does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the claim].\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    550 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs also explain how the area known as the \"Black Belt\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was specifically divided between the four CDs at issue in the complaint, packing minorities into CD 7 and cracking CDs 1, 2, and 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). From this division of the Black Belt, the court can infer that a second majority-minority district could plausibly be formed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   So, while Plaintiffs have not yet\n   <em>\n    proven\n   </em>\n   by presenting an alternative district map that an alternative redistricting plan that resolves the alleged Section 2 violations definitely exists, they have met the burden to\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   Section 2 violations by showing that such a plan plausibly could exist. Because such a plan plausibly exists, the court must deny Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Doctrine of laches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs' claim is barred by the doctrine of laches. Specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' claims first became available in June 2011 when the redistricting plan was passed; that Plaintiffs had no excuse for delay because the 2010 Census data upon which their claim is based was available since February 2011; and that the state of Alabama would be prejudiced because a final decision (after appeal) would not be reached until 2019 or 2020, requiring a new redistricting plan to be drawn based on outdated census information from 2010-and shortly before statewide redistricting using the 2020 Census-if Plaintiffs succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Preliminarily, Plaintiffs contend that the doctrine of laches only applies in cases seeking retrospective damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peter Letterese &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038761\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/1287/#p1321\">\n    533 F.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1321 (11th Cir. 2008) (\"[L]aches serves as a bar only to the recovery of retrospective damages, not to prospective relief.\"). Here Plaintiffs seek no retrospective damages, solely prospective relief. But, as Defendant points out, redistricting challenges are subject to the doctrine of laches because of the ten-year expiration date of electoral districts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders v. Dooly Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119749\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/1289/#p1290\">\n    245 F.3d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290-91 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (applying the doctrine of laches to a voting rights case). Electoral districts expire every ten years because the federal government conducts a new census every ten years, which the state then uses to create an updated redistricting plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2020 Census: What is the Census?\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html (last visited Mar. 11, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   So, because the doctrine of laches can apply to redistricting cases, the court will address the elements of the doctrine. The doctrine of laches requires three elements: \"(1) a delay in asserting a right or a claim; (2) that the delay was not excusable; and (3) that there was undue prejudice to the party against whom the claim is asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Venus Lines Agency Inc. v.

Each element will be discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Delay in asserting a right or claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs delayed in challenging the redistricting plan because the claim became available in June 2011, when Alabama's redistricting plan went into effect, and because the 2010 Census, which Plaintiffs use to support their arguments for redistricting, was already available to Plaintiffs in June 2011. Further, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs did not challenge the past four elections in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2016, but instead waited until just before the government conducts the 2020 Census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant suggests that, because Plaintiffs could have filed suit seven years prior, the claim is inexcusably delayed. One court has found inexcusable delay when the challenged redistricting plan was no longer the plan used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

A different court found inexcusable delay when only one election under the challenged plan remained, and four elections based on that plan had passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fouts v.

And Ms. Chestnut, the one Plaintiff not residing in Alabama in June 2011, has been a registered voter in Alabama since 2016. (Doc. 31 at 23). Even though she did not live in Alabama when the redistricting plan first came into effect, she has had two years to bring such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But Plaintiffs also argue that the claim did not necessarily arise in 2011, which leads to the second element of the doctrine of laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Delay was not excusable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Delay is \"measured from the time at which the plaintiff knows or should know she has a provable claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Kason Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"224233,224135\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/120/1199/\">\n    120 F.3d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs argue that, at the time the 2011 redistricting plan was passed, they were not immediately aware that their votes would be diluted. Additionally, Ms. Chestnut, did not reside is Alabama until 2016, so she could not have sued earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that \"a plaintiff's reasonable need to fully investigate its claims\" may excuse delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Black Warrior Riverkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076350\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1271/#p1285\">\n    781 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285 (11th Cir. 2015). But even if the nine Plaintiffs who were citizens in 2011 did not realize their claim arose in June 2011, they were registered voters in Alabama for the next three election cycles before bringing a claim. Plaintiffs suggest that Ms. Chestnut could have reasonably taken until 2018 to investigate her claims, although they do not explain why the other plaintiffs would be justified in a seven-year delay from the 2011 redistricting. And Plaintiffs provide no demonstration of the steps taken to investigate the claim that would justify the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As to Ms. Chestnut, one plaintiff's delay does not necessarily prejudice others. For example, a political party's sophisticated knowledge of a state's election laws and awareness of a claim is not imputed to ordinary citizens\n   <em>\n    Nader 2000 Primary Comm., Inc. v. Hechler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11233854\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/112/575/\">\n    112 F.Supp.2d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 n.2 (S.D. W. Va. 2000). But our case does not involve one sophisticated plaintiff's greater knowledge being imputed to ordinary citizens. Instead, our case involves nine citizens-who supposedly had been investigating their claims since they arose in June 2011-joined by a new citizen, who then needed an additional two years after moving into the state to join the other nine in bringing this claim. The court finds these excuses for the delay unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Defendant was prejudiced\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that the state of Alabama would be prejudiced because, if Plaintiffs win, a new redistricting plan must be drawn using 2010 Census data merely a year or two before the new 2020 Census; Defendant points to demographic shifts in Alabama since the 2010 Census, implying that the redistricting plan will have to change in 2021. (Doc. 27 at 18). Defendant also contends that redistricting now would spend valuable state resources that could otherwise be allocated to the 2021 redistricting plan, while noting that Alabama may lose a congressional seat following the 2020 Census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In support, Defendant cites the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which held that forcing the state to redistrict when one election remained under the challenged plan \"would come at great cost and yield results that are at best uncertain, and at worst, perverse.\"\n   <em>\n    Mac Govern v. Connolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874645\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/637/111/#p116\">\n    637 F.Supp. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 (D. Mass. 1986). But at the time of that case, the 1985 Census was not yet complete, and the state was already in the process of redistricting. The court noted, \"Since the 1985 census may not be complete, an injunction at this point could have the ironic effect of forcing a hasty reapportionment based on the already-superseded 1975 state census....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874645\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/637/111/#p116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In our case, redistricting will certainly be costly. But the 2010 Census still remains the most current data available as of today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant also cites\n   <em>\n    Fouts\n   </em>\n   , in which the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida found that forcing the state to redistrict two years before the mandatory redistricting would \"result[ ] in voter confusion, instability, dislocation, and [a] financial and logistical burden on the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Fouts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470643\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/88/1351/#p1354\">\n    88 F.Supp.2d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as noted by Plaintiffs, \"redistricting to remedy a \u00a7 2 violation will always require the allocation of some voters to different districts.\" (Doc. 31 at 30). Plaintiffs also point out that a court has previously ordered redistricting within two years of another redistricting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larios v.

But the court notes that the plaintiffs in this case seek a new reapportionment plan two years\n   <em>\n    be\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fore\n   </em>\n   the next scheduled reapportionment plan, while the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Larios\n   </em>\n   sought a new reapportionment plan two years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the last reapportionment plan.

In\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   , voters in Dooly County, Georgia sued county officials, alleging that the county commission and board of education districting plan contained racially gerrymandered districts in violation of equal protection.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119749\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/1289/#p1290\">\n    245 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the Eleventh Circuit did not independently evaluate whether the delay actually prejudiced the defendants. The district court concluded that the delay prejudiced the defendants because (1) the back-to-back redistrictings would cause confusion and expense, and (2) the census data available was \"over 10 years old and thus unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119749\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/1289/#p1290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119749\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/1289/#p1290\">\n    at 1290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   But this case differs from\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   . As Plaintiffs point out, the congressional redistricting here would likely be less confusing than the localized county redistricting in\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   . Congressional races are better funded and highly publicized, so voters would be more aware of which district they belong. (Doc. 31 at 30). And the 2010 Census data available here, while nine years old, is more reliable than the 10 year old data in\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   because the government has not yet taken a new census.\n   <em>\n    See 2020 Census: What is the Census?\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html (last visited Mar. 11, 2019) (explaining that the federal government took the first census in 1790 \"and our country has every 10 years since\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While the data available in this case is nine years old, it remains the most up-to-date information available-until the government completes the 2020 Census. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida held that ordering a state to redistrict in 1999 forced the state to use the 1990 Census data, and \"[s]uch old census figures have been recognized as unduly prejudicial because they fail to provide a basis for 'fair and accurate representation to the citizens.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fouts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470643\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/88/1351/#p1354\">\n    88 F.Supp.2d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532705\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/99/#p102\">\n    909 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   104 ). And while congressional races are better funded and more highly publicized, the court remains unconvinced that a more publicized election will necessarily educate voters on where the newly drawn district lines lay. As noted by the Fourth Circuit, \"two reapportionments within a short period of two years would greatly prejudice the [state] and its citizens by creating instability and dislocation in the electoral system and by imposing great financial and logistical burdens.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532705\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/99/#p102\">\n    909 F.2d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court finds that to force the state of Alabama to redistrict twice in two years-once based on nine-year-old census data-would result in prejudice.

Redistricting committees sometimes base new redistricting plans on existing plans.
