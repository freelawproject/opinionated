WOODS, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Press America, Inc. (\"Press America\") contracted to print and mail letters for Plaintiffs CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and Caremark Rx, LLC. The letters were related to Plaintiffs' pharmaceutical benefits program, so the parties were aware that the contract involved some risk that letters containing individuals' private health care information would be misdirected. Press America indemnified Plaintiffs for any claims or liabilities arising from its negligence. What Press America did not know was that Plaintiffs had entered into a contract with International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"), requiring that Plaintiffs pay IBM $ 45,000 for each piece of misdirected mail-a payment obligation that IBM and CVS transparently referred to as a \"penalty.\" Press America learned that information the hard way. After Press America errantly mailed 41 letters to the wrong people, IBM sought $ 1.845 million ($ 45,000*41) from CVS. CVS paid without much fuss, then demanded that Press America reimburse it for that amount pursuant to its indemnity. Press America refused, leading to this lawsuit. Because Press America has established that CVS's payment was an unenforceable penalty, and therefore was not founded upon any legal liability to CVS, Press America need not reimburse CVS pursuant to its contractual indemnity. For that and the other reasons described below, the parties' cross motions for summary judgment are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties: Press America and CVS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CVS Pharmacy Inc. (\"CVS Pharmacy\") and Caremark Rx, L.L.C. (\"Caremark\", and collectively with CVS Pharmacy,\n   \"CVS\"), are in the pharmacy business. Among other things, CVS administers prescription drug plans for clients as part of what are referred to as \"pharmacy benefits management programs\" (\"PBMs\"). Joint Statement \u00b6 1. As part of its administrative obligations to its clients, CVS contacts its clients' employees, retirees, and dependents about their prescription medications, in particular, when it is time for them to renew their prescriptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2-3. CVS mails notices to PBM members about such matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Aptly named, Press America, Inc. (\"Press America\") prints and distributes mass mailings for its customers. Press America had served as a vendor for CVS since approximately 1990.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. In 2010, CVS began talks with Press America for Press America to provide printing and mailing services to CVS in connection with CVS's PBM business. Those discussions ultimately yielded fruit in February 2012, when CVS and Press America entered into the series of agreements that are the subject of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. CVS's Relationship with IBM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One of CVS's PBM clients was International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"). In early 2011, IBM issued a request for proposals, seeking bids from companies to administer a PBM plan for IBM's PBM members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96. One of the requirements of the request for proposals was that any potential bidder agree to provide a \"performance guarantee\" to protect members' personally identifiable information (\"PII\") and protected health information (\"PHI\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98. In particular, IBM made clear that bidders would have to compensate IBM for each security incident, including inadvertent disclosures of members' PII or PHI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99. CVS submitted a bid in response to the request for proposals, and won.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97, 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   IBM and CVS set about negotiating a contract to govern their relationship. For purposes of this litigation, the most significant feature of their negotiations involved the \"performance guarantee\" that IBM had required as part of its request for proposals. IBM viewed their requested provision \"as different, it was new....\" Declaration of Adam Pence (\"Pence Decl.\"), Dkt. No. 89, Ex. 29, Transcript of Deposition of IBM 30(b)(6) witness, Tobe Mizels (\"Mizel Tr.\") 129:3-4. CVS also believed that the performance guarantee request was \"unique\" in the industry. Joint Statement \u00b6 34. (When Press America learned of the provision following the claim that led to this litigation, they too believed it to be a novel requirement for a contract of this sort; it was, in their view \"way out of left field.\")\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Not only did IBM want CVS to pay a penalty if it failed to meet its performance guarantee, it wanted the amount of its vendor's potential liability to be uncapped. Mizel Tr. at 129:3-4. The provision was a focus of the negotiations between CVS and IBM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   IBM and CVS entered into a Letter of Understanding (the \"LOU\") on December 29, 2011, to be effective January 1, 2012. Pence Decl. Ex. 30. The LOU was a binding contract, but it was understood by the parties as an interim step, bridging the way to a final agreement. In the LOU itself, the parties agreed to \"further negotiate in good faith to execute the Pharmacy Benefits Management Services Agreement and [to] use best efforts to complete this work as soon as possible.\" LOU at 2. The LOU was structured so that it would automatically terminate when the final agreement was consummated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the LOU, CVS agreed to \"comply with the performance standards described in Exhibit C of this Letter of Understanding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exhibit C to the LOU, in turn, required CVS to meet an \"Ongoing Performance Standard.\" The relevant performance standard at issue here is Number\n   26:, Security Incidents, described as the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Security incidents, including inadvertent disclosures, involving Confidential Participant Information or Protected Health Information: a) must be reported to IBM as quickly as possible and no later than 24 hours after knowledge of security incident (including magnitude of data exposure); b) root cause analysis must be performed and communicated to IBM no later than 72 hours after knowledge of security incident; c) a full corrective plan of action must be provided to IBM no later than five business days after knowledge of security incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LOU at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Failure by CVS to meet this performance standard had real consequences under the LOU-it triggered a \"penalty.\" For each breach, the LOU provided that CVS would be on the hook for the \"Fees at Risk per Period\" (with, again, each \"Period\" defined as a single breach).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The amount at risk was defined as follows: \"\n   <em>\n    Penalty\n   </em>\n   of 3% of total annual administrative fees at risk shall apply for each security incident, inadvertent disclosure or breach, as well as $ 25,000 for each failure to meet any of the standards for follow-up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). While the penalties associated with breaches of other \"performance guarantees\" under the LOU were capped at $ 1,500,000 per year, breaches of the \"Security Incidents\" standards could result in an unlimited amount of penalty obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LOU at 18 (\"the maximum penalty that CVS Caremark shall have at risk for any Agreement Year is $ 1,500,000 for the performance guarantees listed in Table B, excluding PG # 26 Security Incidents.\"). Of course, it was this uncapped, \"different,\" and \"new\" performance guarantee that led to this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In general, CVS treated all of its client contracts as confidential. Joint Statement \u00b6 110. But the LOU did not contain a contractual provision requiring that it be maintained in confidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After CVS and IBM entered into the LOU, they continued to negotiate a final contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112. Among the provisions that they negotiated was the nature of what would constitute a \"Security Incident\" under the performance guarantee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113. Eventually, IBM and CVS executed a final contract on March 28, 2013 (the \"Final IBM Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118; Pence Decl. Ex. 31. That final contract states that it is \"effective January 1, 2012,\" however, IBM and CVS agree that the LOU governed the parties' relationship prior to the date of its execution. Joint Statement \u00b6\u00b6 118-119. And, in particular, IBM's representative agreed that the \"performance guarantee penalties\" established in the LOU were the ones that applied until the final contract was signed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Given that the LOU governed at the time of the incident that provoked this litigation, the terms of the Final IBM Agreement are not significant for purposes of the Court's resolution of this motion-it was not the governing agreement at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But CVS argues that the Final IBM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Agreement \"best represents the understanding of the parties, even during the time between the execution of the LOU and the final agreement.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support (\"P's Aff. Mem.\"), Dkt. No. 86, at 8. Perhaps not coincidentally, in the Final IBM Agreement, concluded following the incident that instigated this suit, references to the consequences of a violation of a performance guarantee as \"penalties\" were scrubbed. Instead, they are described as \"fee adjustments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In particular, in Section 3.13 of the Final IBM Agreement, CVS agrees that if it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   fails to satisfy the performance standards in Exhibit D, CVS Caremark's fees shall be adjusted as described in Exhibit D. Measurements related to the performance standards described in Exhibit D shall be reported to CVS Caremark quarterly within 60 calendar days after the end of each quarter. Performance for the purpose of\n   <em>\n    fee adjustment\n   </em>\n   shall be measured on a quarterly basis and CVS Caremark shall credit the Plan for any payments due within thirty (30) days after the issuance of the quarterly performance standard report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Final IBM Agreement \u00a7 3.13 (emphasis added). The performance guarantee is triggered by a \"Protection of Information Failure\" as defined in Exhibit D to the Final IBM Agreement. Joint Statement \u00b6 129. The consequences of a failure to meet that performance guarantee standard under the Final IBM Agreement are substantially the same as under the LOU-3% of the annual fees at risk apply for each Protection of Information Failure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. As with the penalty provided for under the LOU, the amount of \"fee adjustments\" resulting from a violation of this performance guarantee was uncapped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The LOU did not contain an express choice of law provision. However, the Final IBM Agreement states that it \"and the legal relations between the parties hereto shall be determined in accordance with ERISA, and to the extent not preempted by ERISA, in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York....\" Final IBM Agreement \u00a7 8.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Press America's Contracts with CVS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    The Contract Negotiations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As described above, Press America had served as a vendor for CVS for over twenty years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. In mid-June 2010, CVS issued an RfQ (request for quotation) for printing services in connection with its Adherence to Drug Therapy (\"ADT\") program. Pence Decl. Ex. 6. When Press America responded to the RfQ, as part of its pitch for the business, Press America's representative touted his company's ability to handle the project-and highlighted the risks associated with performance of the contract, lest CVS select a less capable vendor. In a June 17, 2010 e-mail responding to the RfQ, Press America principal Martin D'Amico wrote \"[p]lease recognize the highly specialized nature of these mailings [for closed-faced envelopes] and that not all vendors can manage the data mapping properly. Errors in data mapping can result in huge compliance issues for CVS Caremark.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Joint Statement \u00b6 17. Mr. D'Amico was referring to the possibility of disclosures of protected information, such as PHI and PII: Press America was aware of that risk even before it won the contract in connection with which the risk ultimately manifested itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Press America won CVS's business. CVS and Press America began to work on the contract in earnest in the Fall of 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. \"The contract was assembled by Philip Morin of CVS, using preapproved language provided by CVS's legal department. Mr. Morin had never seen the IBM Agreement nor was he aware of its existence when he was negotiating Press\n   America's agreement with CVS. Mr. Morin did not advise Press America of the existence of any performance guarantees contained in the IBM-CVS agreement and could not have as he did not know whether any such provisions existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-29 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As part of the contract negotiation process, CVS proposed that Press America obtain a $ 15 million insurance policy to cover privacy liability in the event of the disclosure of members' private health information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. That level of insurance coverage was expensive. So Press America pushed back, asking if $ 5 million in coverage would be sufficient on two separate occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 65. CVS was concerned about the volume of letters that Press America would be handling that would contain PHI and PII-approximately 500,000 to 800,000 letters a month-so CVS held firm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-59, 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CVS's representatives expected that the insurance would cover instances of credit monitoring for affected individuals, \"identity theft, access to people's medical information, and then any sort of claim that would be generated from that type of disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. CVS did not, however, calculate the insurance coverage with reference to the penalty payments then due under the LOU's performance guarantee provisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 58. After all, its negotiator did not know about the IBM Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Nor did Press America have an inkling of the potential impact of the IBM Agreement when it negotiated insurance with CVS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-87. But Press America did not find the high insurance amount to be particularly odd because CVS \" 'tend[ed] to do things big' and because HIPAA fines or credit counseling costs could justify such a requirement, given the volume of material Press America would be mailing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66 (quoting D'Amico Tr. 82:19-83:7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As a result of their negotiations, CVS and Press America entered into the principal agreements that are the subject of this dispute-the Business Associate Agreement and the Master Services Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    The Business Associate Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first agreement that CVS and Press America entered into was the Business Associate Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2011 (the \"Business Associate Agreement\"). Pence Decl. Ex. 3. The parties entered into the Business Associate Agreement while still negotiating the final terms of the service agreement that would govern their relationship. However, with the expectation that the companies would enter into a future agreement involving the distribution of personal privacy information, they entered into the Business Associate Agreement in order to \"comply with the HIPAA Rules and other applicable Privacy Laws.\" Business Associate Agreement at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To achieve that end, Press America (defined as the \"Vendor\" in the agreement) agreed to do a number of things. They agreed not to use or disclose PHI other than as permitted under Press America's service agreements with CVS, and also not to use or disclose \"Private Information\" other than as permitted or required by the agreement, or as required by law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.0.a. \"Private Information\" was defined in the Business Associate Agreement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) Protected Health Information (\"PHI\"), as defined by the HIPAA Rules, created or received on behalf of, or received from Company, (2) Nonpublic Personal Financial Information and, as applicable, Nonpublic Personal Health Information, as defined by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, and (3) any data or information that (i) relates to an individual and (ii) identifies or there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be\n   used to identify the individual (such as, but not limited to, an individual's name, postal address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, financial account number, or any other unique identifier).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Business Associate Agreement \u00a7 1.c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Most significantly for this case, the Business Associate Agreement required that Press America indemnify CVS in the event of violations of the agreement or improper disclosures of \"Private Information.\" Section 6.0 of the Business Associate Agreement contained the relevant indemnification provision and read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Vendor will indemnify and hold harmless CVS and any of its officers, directors, employees, or agents from and against any claim, cause of action, liability, damage, cost, or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court or proceeding costs, arising out of or in connection with any breach of the terms of this Agreement, any Breach\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Private Information under the control of Vendor or its agents or subcontractors that requires notification under the HIPAA Rules or state law, or any failure to perform its obligations with respect to Private Information by Vendor, it [sic] officers, employees, agents, or any person or entity under Vendor's direction or control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Business Associate Agreement \u00a7 6.0.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Business Associate Agreement did not contain an express choice of law provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    The Master Services Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On or around February 6, 2012, CVS Pharmacy, \"on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates including without limitation Caremark Rx, L.L.C.\" (which were also collectively defined as \"CVS\"), and Press America entered into the Master Service Agreement (the \"MSA\"). Pence Decl. Ex. 2. The MSA was stated to be effective retroactive to October 1, 2011. Joint Statement \u00b6 74. Pursuant to the MSA, Press America agreed to service CVS's ADT Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on or around February 14, 2012, CVS Pharmacy, \"on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, including Caremark Rx, L.L.C.\" and Press America entered into a Statement of Work, effective October 1, 2011 (the \"2011 SOW\"), which outlined the core tasks, responsibilities and costs of Press America's ADT printing and mailing services. Pence Decl. Ex. 2, 2011 SOW2; Pence Decl. Ex. 7. And then, just a few months later, the same entities entered into another Statement of Work, effective May 1, 2012 (the \"2012 SOW\"), which again outlined the core tasks, responsibilities, and costs of Press America's ADT printing and mailing services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The 2011 SOW and 2012 SOW were incorporated by reference into the MSA and became an \"integral part\" of the MSA. MSA \u00a7 1 (Overview of Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In some ways, the MSA was a flexible agreement-it put in place broad architecture for the relationship between CVS and Press America. Pursuant to the terms of the MSA, the specific tasks to be performed by Press America would be set forth in separately agreed statements of work. In the MSA, Press America (referred to as \"Vendor\" in the contract) agrees \"to perform such Services (the 'Services') as set forth in a Statement of Work (each an 'SOW') that CVS elects to purchase and which meet or exceed CVS specifications described in the applicable SOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth [in the MSA].\" MSA \u00a7 1 (Overview of Agreement). \"Inability of Vendor to provide Services or the receipt of non-conforming Services may be considered a breach of contract on the part of Vendor by CVS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2 (Services Provided).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The MSA required Press America to indemnify CVS for any breach of the agreement, as well as for negligence and other misconduct. Section 8.1 of the MSA, titled \"Indemnification,\" read in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Vendor agrees (i) to indemnify and hold harmless CVS from and against any claims, liabilities, and damages to the extent same are due to Vendor's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement or Vendor's failure to comply with or abide by any applicable law (other than by reason of an act or omission of CVS), and (ii) to defend promptly and diligently, at Vendor's sole expense, with attorneys reasonably acceptable to CVS, any claim, action, or proceeding brought against CVS or CVS and Vendor jointly or severally, arising out of or connected with any of the foregoing, and to indemnify and hold CVS harmless from any judgment, loss, or settlement on account thereof. Vendor's duty to defend CVS under this Section shall apply to any complaint or claim that makes allegations that, if proved, place the alleged breach of duty, whether in tort or contract, potentially within the purviews of the duties, responsibilities, and obligations undertaken by Vendor pursuant to this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   MSA \u00a7 8.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The parties' discussion of insurance requirements ripened into a contractual obligation in the MSA. Pursuant to Section 8.2 of the MSA, CVS agreed to procure at its own expense privacy liability coverage with a limit not less than $ 15,000,000 per claim. MSA \u00a7 8.2. The requirements for that coverage were broad and were to include \"breach of privacy and the failure to protect and disclosure of personally identifiable information, ... and health information; violation of any federal, state or local law or regulation in connection with the protection of information including fines and penalties to the extent allowed by applicable law; notification and crisis management costs, identity theft monitoring and regulatory defense; disclosure of any third party's proprietary information including, without limitation, trade secrets, and; liability for interruption of CVS's or any third party's business including, without limitation, claims for loss of use and loss of profits....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The MSA contained an express choice of law provision, pursuant to which the agreement \"shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York....\" MSA \u00a7 13.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   None of the contracts required CVS to provide Press America with the specific terms of any agreements with CVS's PBM clients. Joint Statement \u00b6 95. And there is no evidence before the Court that Press America ever inquired about the terms of those contracts as part of their negotiation process or deal diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   So, threatened by a blanket indemnity provision, yet armored with a $ 15 million insurance policy, Press America went about the business of printing mailings in support of CVS's PBM business on behalf of CVS's many clients, including IBM. The risks associated with improper disclosures of privacy information and the associated liability were things that Press America knew about from the time that it first bid for the contract. But Press America did not know about CVS's \"unique,\" \"new,\" and \"different\" negotiated penalty provision with IBM. They would shortly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    D. 41 Mislabeled Envelopes: That Will Be $ 1.845 Million Dollars, Please\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Something went wrong when Press America mailed a series of letters on behalf of CVS's PBM customers on August 2, 2012. Press America placed letters for 2,668 individuals in envelopes with the wrong addresses. Joint Statement \u00b6 195. The letters were mailed.

Press America, in turn, seeks a ruling by the Court that the $ 1.845 million penalty is unenforceable, and that, as a result, CVS must tender payment for the $ 560,354.97 in open invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   CVS commenced this litigation on January 10, 2017. Dkt. No. 1. The initial complaint brought claims for breach of contract, based on Press America's alleged failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the MSA and the Business Associate Agreement. The complaint also included claims for common law indemnification and negligence. Press America filed counterclaims against CVS on March 22,\n   2017. Dkt. No. 20. In the counterclaims, Press America asserted that CVS had breached its contractual obligations to pay invoices that it had submitted under the MSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On April 7, 2017, with the consent of the Court, CVS filed an amended complaint (\"Am. Compl.\"). Dkt. No. 28. The amended complaint asserted a more general breach of contract claim-that Press America had failed to comply with the standard of service, and therefore harmed CVS-as well as a direct claim for a breach of the indemnification provisions of the parties' agreements. Like the original complaint, the amended complaint also asserted claims for common law indemnity and negligence. In its April 12, 2017 answer to Press America's counterclaims, CVS asserted, among other things, that because of Press America's breach of the MSA, it was not entitled to payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Press America moved to dismiss CVS's amended complaint. Dkt. No. 45. After briefing, the Court denied the motion in full on January 4, 2018. This set of cross motions followed several months thereafter. Each party filed a separate motion for summary judgment: CVS moving for summary judgment with respect to its breach of contract and indemnity claims, Dkt. No. 85, and Press America for summary judgment on substantially the same issues, in addition to claiming recovery of the amount of the invoices due to it. Dkt. No. 81. While a number of issues are disputed in the motions, both sides understandably focus on the question of whether Press America must reimburse CVS for the $ 1.845 million payment that it made to IBM. It is to that question that the Court now turns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

It is so clearly a penalty that the parties to the contract expressly called it one. While the Court must look to the substance of the provision, not its form, the Court need not ignore the fact that the parties referred to the payment obligation\n   in the LOU as a \"penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LOU at 18 (\"The maximum penalty that CVS shall have at risk for any Agreement year is....\"). The Final IBM Agreement, perhaps subject to more careful legal review than the LOU, omitted references to the word \"penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   LOU at 25 (\"Fees at Risk:\n   <em>\n    Penalty of\n   </em>\n   3% of total annual administrative fees....\") (emphasis added)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Final IBM Agreement at D8 (\"Fees at Risk per Period ...: 3% of annual fees at risk....\"). But that does not matter. The LOU governed the payment obligation at the time of the Incident. And that CVS and IBM ultimately clothed the payment obligation with a title other than their initial word choice-\"penalty\"-does not change the nature of the obligation. If anything, it suggests a desire to obscure its nature. A representative of IBM involved in the negotiation of the contract testified that he viewed the $ 45,000 and other express penalties provided for in the LOU, as just that, a penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mizel. Tr. at 117:1-5 (\"I obviously thought that we should assess a penalty for not providing, whatever, the reporting or the root cause analysis within the appropriate time frame.\"); 117:1-5. The express language of the LOU reveals the parties' intention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court's conclusion that this payment obligation is a penalty is reinforced by the context in which the penalty applied. Under the LOU (and the Final IBM Agreement), the penalty was to be paid in the event that CVS failed to achieve a \"performance guarantee.\" The trigger for the payment under a performance guarantee was not merely a breach of the contract, but failure by CVS to meet identified contractual goals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The penalty was intended to spark compliance with those goals. That reveals the punitive nature of the payment obligation, which, because it served as a mere \"added spur to performance,\" should not be enforced.\n   <em>\n    Priebe &amp; Sons v.

No evidence has been presented that suggests that the amount correlates with IBM's anticipated actual damages. The penalty for each misdirected letter was $ 45,000-a very high amount. As Press America points out in its briefing, had all of the mislabeled pieces of mail that Press America sent on that ill-fated day been subject to a penalty provision similar to the one developed by IBM, it would have been on the hook for $ 120,060,000 ($ 45,000*2,668). Privacy of individuals' health information is valuable, but there is nothing in the record that suggests that this extraordinary, \"new,\" \"unique\" payment obligation was tethered to IBM's anticipated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   To the contrary, the evidence supports the contrary conclusion. The language of the LOU itself is the most important data point. In addition to the provisions that the Court has already noted, the penalty payment under the LOU is automatically escalated\n   in the event of repeated non-compliance. LOU at 18 (\"In the event a quarterly performance standard is not met in any subsequent quarter, the\n   <em>\n    penalty\n   </em>\n   shall be doubled up to an annual maximum of 50% of the annual\n   <em>\n    penalty\n   </em>\n   limit....\")(emphasis added). These increases in the penalty amount are the kind of\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   spurs to performance that are emblematic of a penalty; they bear no relation to IBM's damages. Moreover, a representative of IBM involved in the negotiation of the deal testified that the purpose of the penalty was partly symbolic. Mizels Tr. 127:17-25. (\"I think that we expect that CVS Caremark would protect the data to the utmost. Regardless of whether or not the penalty was there or not, the penalty was there to demonstrate IBM's commitment to protecting employees, IBM's employees' data.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant provisions of the LOU (and the Final IBM Agreement) require the payment of a sum of money that is grossly disproportionate to the amount of IBM's anticipated actual damages. It is, therefore, a penalty and is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As the Court held in the motion to dismiss, Press America has no standing to impeach the contractual obligation between IBM and CVS. CVS agreed to an unenforceable penalty provision. CVS chose to honor that payment obligation to its important customer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's ruling will not directly result in CVS getting its money back from IBM. CVS's payment to IBM is not at issue here: The question is whether CVS can now claim reimbursement of that amount through Press America's indemnification without having first given Press America-its surety-the opportunity to weigh in. For the reasons that follow, the answer to that question is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Language of the MSA's Indemnification Provision Captures This Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The language of the MSA's indemnification provision is very broad and captures the payment at issue here. The Court's determination that Press America need not reimburse CVS does not rely on a construction of the indemnification provision at issue, or Press America's argument that the $ 1.845 million liability did not fall within the \"reasonable intendment\" of the parties at the time that they entered into the contract. Press America's argument that extrinsic evidence regarding its ignorance of the existence of the payment obligation under the LOU alone excuses its performance is not viable under New York law and is not supported by the cases that it cites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   New York law requires that contractual indemnification provisions be strictly construed. As the New York Court of Appeals held in\n   <em>\n    Hooper Assocs., Ltd. v. AGS Computers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Words in a contract are to be construed to achieve the apparent purpose of the parties. Although the words might \"seem to admit of a larger sense, yet they should be restrained to the particular occasion and to the particular object which the parties had in view\" is particularly true with indemnity contracts. When a party is under no legal duty to\n   indemnify, a contract assuming that obligation must be strictly construed to avoid reading into it a duty which the parties did not intend to be assumed. The promise should not be found unless it can be clearly implied from the language and purpose of the entire agreement and the surrounding facts and circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4413164\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/74/487/#p491\">\n    74 N.Y.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491-92,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20N.Y.S.2d%20365\">\n    549 N.Y.S.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20N.E.2d%20903\">\n    548 N.E.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (internal citations omitted) (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

As highlighted above, the quoted language from\n   <em>\n    Niagara\n   </em>\n   uses a \"neither/nor\" formulation, suggesting that if damages are expressly within the terms of a contract, but are not of such character that it is reasonable to infer that they were intended to be covered, the contractual indemnity should not be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   From this statement of the law, Press America derives an argument that-regardless of the language of its contractual indemnity-it is excused from its indemnification obligations because it did not know of the specific penalty provision contained in CVS's agreements with IBM, and because it did not have a reason to expect the existence of such a provision. Press America relies heavily on the First Department's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker Co. v.

But Press America misreads the case. The Court has identified no New York cases that excuse a party's obligation to pay under a clear contractual indemnification agreement because, as a matter of fact, the party was unaware of the specific potential obligation at the time that it entered into the indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker Co.\n   </em>\n   is factually similar to this case in several ways. Tokyo Tanker entered into an agreement to act as an agent to sell two vessels. As part of its contract with the owner of the vessels, Tokyo Tanker agreed to indemnify the owner of the vessel for \"any and all ... claims ... that any [owner] shall sustain or become liable or answerable for, or shall pay, in any way\n   <em>\n    resulting from, caused by or as a consequence of a Sale or contemplated Sale of a Vessel.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560012\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/142/377/\">\n    142 A.D.2d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2075\">\n    536 N.Y.S.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Unbeknownst to Tokyo Tanker, before entering into the agency agreement with Tokyo Tanker, the owner of the vessels had entered into a separate agreement with its banker (the \"Morgan Agreement\"), in which the owner agreed to pay its banker a commission upon the sale of the vessels.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2075\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   After one of the vessels was sold for $ 7,052,049, the owner turned to Tokyo Tanker and claimed that Tokyo Tanker's contractual indemnity made it liable for \"$ 1,312,000 paid by the [owner] to the bank as a fee under the Morgan Agreement, $ 69,287 for the legal fees incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of the Morgan Agreement, and $ 7,568 for expenses, including travel to Tokyo, incurred in said legal work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 379,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2075\">\n    536 N.Y.S.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tokyo Tanker did\n   not believe that it was obligated to pay those amounts pursuant to its contractual indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The First Department agreed with Tokyo Tanker but, importantly, not merely because Tokyo Tanker was not aware of the existence of the Morgan Agreement at the time that it entered into its indemnity, as Press America argues. Instead, the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker\n   </em>\n   relied upon a strict construction of the language of the contract. The court focused in particular on the language of the contract that required that indemnified claims and expenses \"result from\" or \"arise out of\" any \"Sale\" of a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The court concluded that the contractual indemnification provision could not be construed to encompass the payment of the fee to the vessel owner's banker under the Morgan Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 380,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2075\">\n    536 N.Y.S.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"That [owner] agreed to pay the bank a fee upon the sale of vessels in return for the release of its $ 3 million collateral account\n   <em>\n    does not bring these obligations within sections 3.1 (c) and (d) of the Tanker Agreement\n   </em>\n   [providing for the contractual indemnity], for [i]n determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract or bond of indemnity,\n   <em>\n    the instrument must be read\n   </em>\n   in the light of the circumstances surrounding its execution and the purpose which it was designed to accomplish.\" (emphasis added) ) (internal citations and quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 380-81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2075\">\n    536 N.Y.S.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In light of all of these circumstances, the\n   <em>\n    words comprising sections 3.1 (c) and (d) of the Tanker Agreement\n   </em>\n   '\n   <em>\n    may not reasonably be read\n   </em>\n   to place upon [Tokyo Tanker] a burden which [it] did not expressly assume\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   which it is inconceivable [it] would have accepted'.\" (emphasis added) ). The\n   <em>\n    Toyko Tanker\n   </em>\n   court was informed by the surrounding circumstances when it construed the contract, but, ultimately, its decision relied on a close reading the language of the contract itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Press America makes too much of\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker\n   </em>\n   when it argues that it need not make payment under the indemnity agreement because it was not aware of the relevant payment obligation. The case does not stand for that proposition, as a careful reading reveals. The quote from\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker\n   </em>\n   that provides the most superficial support for Press America's argument is the first sentence of the opinion: \"An indemnification agreement will not be read to impose obligations upon the indemnitor which are\n   <em>\n    neither\n   </em>\n   disclosed at the time of its execution\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   reasonably within the scope of its terms and the over-all intendment of the parties at the time of its making.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 378,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2075\">\n    536 N.Y.S.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This sentence cannot be read to support the conclusion that an obligation that is not disclosed at the time of the indemnity agreement's execution will not be enforced. Such a holding would be written differently to say that such obligations will not be imposed if they are\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   not disclosed\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   within the scope of its terms. The nature of the undisclosed payment obligation informed the\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker\n   </em>\n   court's scrutiny of the contract's terms; it did not provide an independent basis for the court to find that Tokyo Tanker need not comply with the contract, as Press America incorrectly argues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In contrast to the contractual language at issue in\n   <em>\n    Tokyo Tanker\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds nothing in the language of Press America's indemnification obligation that can reasonably be construed to exclude the payment to CVS. The language of the indemnification provision in the MSA is very broad: Press America agrees \"to indemnify and hold harmless CVS from and against any claims, liabilities, and damages to the extent same are due to Vendor's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement\n   or Vendor's failure to comply with or abide by any applicable law (other than by reason of an act or omission of CVS)....\" MSA \u00a7 8.01. The IBM payment is a liability due to Press America's negligence or breach of contract. The language is unambiguous. No express carve out applies. Evaluated in the context of the surrounding circumstances, there is no basis for the Court to find one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The court's decision is worthy of quotation at length:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Unless there is specific provision in the contract of indemnity, an indemnitee is not required to give notice of claims against him to the indemnitor. If he elects to defend, then he will be bound by the outcome on principles of res judicata. If, however, the indemnitor declines to defend the proceeding, and the indemnitee is therefore required to carry that burden, then the indemnitor is conclusively bound by any reasonable good faith settlement the indemnitee may make or any litigated judgment that may be rendered against him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   On the other hand, if the indemnitee fails to notify the indemnitor, or having notified him, refuses to accept proffered assistance, he proceeds at his own risk with regard to any judgment or settlement which may ultimately ensue. Then, in order to recover reimbursement, he must establish that he would have been liable and that there was no good defense to the liability. Moreover, he must establish that with respect to the amount paid it was a reasonable amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   In this context it should be noted that the test of reasonableness applies not to the fact of liability but only to the amount that may be paid by way of settlement of such liability. Nor is good faith alone a sufficient test, as it might be in the earlier instance noted. Thus, in the Dunn case it was observed that the indemnitee \"assumes the risk of being able to prove the actionable facts upon which his liability depends as well as the reasonableness of the amount which he pays\" (emphasis supplied). This means, in effect, that the indemnitee must establish his case against the indemnitor in the same way that the claimant against him would have been obligated to establish its case, namely, by a preponderance of the evidence or other appropriate level of proof required to sustain recovery in favor of the claimant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   The explanation for the higher requirement that an indemnitee, who has\n   not given notice, or who has rejected defense by the indemnitor, establish that he had been liable to the claimant stems from the fact that his action with regard to the claim is completely free of control by the indemnitor. Since, under such circumstances, the indemnitee knows or believes that any financial responsibility he undertakes is likely to fall ultimately on the indemnitor, he is not inhibited, except by the barest self-restraint. This is an insufficient protection for an indemnitor; and, as a consequence, the indemnitee acts at his own risk that later he will be able to establish that the payment he made was one he had to make. Needless to say, even this is not an absolute test. He meets his burden if he shows, by satisfying the finder of the facts by the preponderance of the evidence or other appropriate level of proof, that he would have been liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Feuer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3007194\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/8/294/\">\n    8 A.D.2d at 298-300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20N.Y.S.2d%20116\">\n    187 N.Y.S.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

The second clause of the indemnification provision refers to the payment of attorneys' fees, but only in the context of a requirement that Press America defend claims brought against CVS.

As such,\n    <em>\n     Sutro\n    </em>\n    appears to be the genesis of the neither/nor formulation of the test which led to some confusion in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Sutro\n    </em>\n    , the district court held as follows: \"A contract of indemnity should be construed so as to cover all losses, damages or liabilities to which it reasonably appears to have been the intention of the parties that it should apply, but not to extend to losses, damages, or liabilities which are neither expressly within its terms nor of such character that it can reasonably be inferred that they were intended to be within the contract.\"\n    <em>\n     Sutro\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569208\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/264/273/#p290\">\n     264 F.Supp. at 290\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As support for this statement of law, the\n    <em>\n     Sutro\n    </em>\n    court cited to three sources-C.J.S. on Indemnity, and two cases. The first was the New York Court of Appeals decision in\n    <em>\n     Nau v. Vulcan Rail &amp; Constr. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2047813\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/286/188/\">\n     286 N.Y. 188\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20N.E.2d%20106\">\n     36 N.E.2d 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1941). There, the Court of Appeals emphasized a basic principle of New York law in construing the indemnification provision at issue in that case: \"The words used in the contract have a precise, definite and well-understood meaning when used in connection with the subject-matter of the contract and\n    <em>\n     the courts are not permitted to explore the actuality of the intent of the parties.\n    </em>\n    Its plain terms indicate that there was no intent or purpose of the parties to give to the indemnity clauses a meaning and purpose other than the plain, unambiguous and well-understood words and expressions used import.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20N.E.2d%20106\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20N.E.2d%20106\">\n     at 198-199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20N.E.2d%20106\">\n     36 N.E.2d 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The second case cited by the\n    <em>\n     Sutro\n    </em>\n    court for its statement of the law was a short 1928 decision by a federal court in the Eastern District of New York,\n    <em>\n     Standard Oil Co., N.J. v. Robbins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1727100\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/25/339/\">\n     25 F.2d 339\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (E.D.N.Y. 1928),\n    <em>\n     aff'd sub nom.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Standard Oil Co. v. Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1756355\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/32/182/\">\n     32 F.2d 182\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2d Cir. 1929). In that case, the court examined a contractual provision requiring a dry dock company to insure the owner of a vessel to protect against claims arising from its operations under the contract at issue. Examining the language at issue, Judge Bryant from the Eastern District held that \"The contract cannot be construed to impose upon the contractor obligation to protect plaintiff against the negligence and carelessness of persons in its own employ and over whom the defendant had no authority or control. A reasonable construction seems to limit it to provide against loss or liability of plaintiff through the operations of defendant, or to loss or injury caused by physical conditions that were under the control of defendant and over which plaintiff had no control.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 340. Significantly, however, the court did not need to look beyond the four corners of the contractual language in its analysis to reach that conclusion. The cases cited by the\n    <em>\n     Sutro\n    </em>\n    court in formulating the language later adopted by the Fourth Department in\n    <em>\n     Niagara\n    </em>\n    do not support the conclusion that extrinsic evidence of the parties' intentions can be applied to trump express contractual language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The Business Associate Agreement also contains a broad indemnification agreement, triggered by a breach of that agreement or a \"Breach,\" which, as noted above, is a defined term that means \"any acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of Private Information in a manner not permitted by the HIPAA Rules [45 C.F.R. Parts 160-164]\". It is not clear that the LOU payment obligation arises as a result of a breach of the Business Associate Agreement or a \"Breach\"-the parties have not briefed that issue fully. Regardless of whether or not the Business Associate Agreement's indemnification obligation applies here, Press America would be excused from reimbursing CVS for its penalty payment under the indemnification provision for the reasons described below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , the Second Circuit held that very similar language was insufficiently unequivocal to establish a claim to attorneys' fees other than for third party claims.\n    <em>\n     Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649425\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/13/#p21\">\n     98 F.3d at 21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding the following language insufficient to give rise to a claim for fees in connection with litigation between contract's parties: \"[t]he Agency shall indemnify and save [BFI] harmless from any and all claims, demands or causes of action, any and all costs or expenses, including attorney fees, that may be asserted due or arising out of the Agency's collection activity or employee dishonesty deemed contrary to prevailing guidelines on accounts referred by [BFI]\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    In its counterstatement in response to Press America's assertion that it correctly performed the work on the contract following the Incident, CVS writes that it \"admits only that John Cappelletti provided the above testimony but further responds that the asserted fact is not material to either summary judgment motion and reserves the right to dispute the claim.\" Pls. Counterstatement \u00b6 398. CVS claims on multiple occasions \"the right to dispute\" in the future an asserted fact in its adversary's 56.1 statement. But CVS may not reserve the right to present disputes of fact at some subsequent stage of the case. CVS had the right and opportunity to do so in connection with this Rule 56 motion. That it chose not to do so does not mean that it gets a do-over later, as CVS seems to assume; instead, it means that CVS has conceded the point. Local Rule 56.1 requires a party moving for summary judgment to submit \"a separate, short and concise statement\" setting forth material facts as to which there is no genuine issue to be tried. Local Rule 56.1(a). A party opposing summary judgment must respond with a statement of facts as to which a triable issue remains.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Local Rule 56.1(b). The facts set forth in a moving party's statement \"will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted\" by the opposing party's statement. Local Rule 56.1(c). Local Rule 56.1(d) further provides that \"[e]ach statement of material fact by a movant or opponent must be followed by citation to evidence which would be admissible\" as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). \"[D]istrict courts in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York\" with the approval of the Second Circuit, \"have interpreted current Local Rule 56.1 to provide that where there are no citations or where the cited materials do not support the factual assertions in the Statements, the Court is free to disregard the assertion.\"\n    <em>\n     Holtz v. Rockefeller &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11080370\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/62/#p73\">\n     258 F.3d 62\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 73-74 (2d Cir. 2001). \"A district court has broad discretion to determine whether to overlook a party's failure to comply with local court rules.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11080370\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/62/#p73\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11080370\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/62/#p73\">\n     at 73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . CVS chose not to present evidence controverting the fact asserted by Press America. The Court is not required to deem that fact to be admitted, but it is appropriate here. Honoring CVS's self-arrogated claim of a right to dispute a fact at a later stage of the case would undermine the benefits of summary judgment motions generally. By choosing not to present evidence controverting its adversary's statement of fact, CVS has admitted it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
