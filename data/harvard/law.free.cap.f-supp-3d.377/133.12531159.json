Mr. Sampedro alleges that Trooper Kores violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as the Connecticut Constitution during his arrest. Mr. Sampedro also brings a claim against Trooper Kores, Commissioner Dora B. Schriro, Colonel Jeffrey Dubuc, and Sergeant Alaric Fox (collectively, the \"Defendants\") seeking a declaratory judgment that Trooper Kores' conduct violated his constitutional rights as averred as well as permanent injunctive relief \"as to all future conduct, training and policy administration, as relates to the detention of Connecticut residents without legal immigration status.\" Trooper Kores is sued in both his individual and official capacities, while Schriro, Fox, and Dubuc are sued in their official capacities. Trooper Kores has moved to dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. He argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity or, alternatively, that Mr. Sampedro has failed to plead a plausible constitutional violation for each of the claims against him. All of the Defendants have moved to dismiss Mr. Sampedro's request for declaratory and injunctive relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Allegations and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts the allegations in the Complaint as true and they are set forth as follows. On June 9, 2017, Mr. Sampedro was driving on Interstate 91 in Connecticut when he briefly fell asleep at the wheel and struck the trailer of another motorist. (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 9-14.) Shortly thereafter, Trooper Kores responded to the accident scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) He asked Mr. Sampedro for his license, registration, and insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) When Mr. Sampedro admitted that he did not have a driver's license, Trooper Kores asked for another form of identification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) Mr. Sampedro offered his Mexican consular identification card.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) Trooper Kores then returned to his vehicle where he appeared to be speaking to someone on his radio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After approximately forty minutes, Trooper Kores went to speak to the other driver and permitted him to leave the accident scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) Trooper Kores next approached Mr. Sampedro, placed him under arrest, and seated him in the back of his cruiser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Approximately thirty minutes later, a tow truck and two unmarked vans arrived at the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) Two officers from ICE identified themselves, approached the cruiser, and took custody of Mr. Sampedro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) Thereafter, removal proceedings were initiated against Mr. Sampedro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Construing the allegations in a light most favorable to Mr. Sampedro, the Court infers that Trooper Kores investigated Mr. Sampedro's identification and in doing so learned that he was not lawfully residing in the United States. The Court further infers that Trooper Kores directly or indirectly contacted United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") and then waited for ICE officials\n   to arrive on scene to take custody of Mr. Sampedro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 15, 2018, Mr. Sampedro filed a four-count civil rights action. In the first three counts, he alleges that Trooper Kores violated his Fourth Amendment right against unlawful seizure (Count I), his Fourteenth Amendment equal protections rights (Count II), and his rights against unlawful seizure and excessive force under the Connecticut Constitution (Count III). In Count IV, which is brought against all four defendants, Mr. Sampedro seeks a declaration that Trooper Kores' conduct violated his constitutional rights and permanent injunctive relief precluding DESPP from acting in a similar fashion in the future with respect to all Connecticut citizens without legal status in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 13, 2018, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety. Trooper Kores argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity as to each claim against him. Trooper Kores further argues that Mr. Sampedro has failed to allege a plausible violation of the Fourth Amendment or the Connecticut Constitution because probable cause existed to arrest Mr. Sampedro. All of the Defendants have moved to dismiss Count IV pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. They further move to dismiss Mr. Sampedro's request for injunctive relief for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to only Rule 12(b)(6), but their motion also challenges this Court's subject matter jurisdiction with respect to Count IV. Subject matter jurisdiction is properly challenged pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Makarova v.

Because the Defendants raise only a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction, and Mr. Sampedro has had a full and fair opportunity to respond to that challenge, it is appropriate to convert the Defendants' motion, to the extent it challenges subject matter jurisdiction, to a motion under Rule 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Trooper Kores alternatively argues that Mr. Sampedro cannot establish that he violated a clearly established right and, therefore, he is entitled to qualified immunity in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is well established that the existence of probable cause is a complete defense to a claim of unlawful seizure under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    Weyant v.

When Trooper Kores arrived at the accident scene, he asked Mr. Sampedro for his driver's license. (Compl. at \u00b6 21.) Mr. Sampedro admitted that he did not have one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Driving without a license is a motor vehicle infraction under Connecticut law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-36\">\n    Conn.

In support of this argument, he cites a series of cases which stand for the proposition that a traffic stop \"exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution's shield against unreasonable seizures.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

These cases are inapposite however. Mr. Sampedro's seizure was not a traffic stop or\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, but rather it was an arrest founded upon probable cause.
