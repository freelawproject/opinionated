C (\"2014 App.\") at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To serve its wireless-carrier customers, Plaintiff installs in \"the public right of way\" \"small cells\" or \"distributed antenna systems\" (\"DAS\"), which typically consist of a \"node\" comprising \"an antenna and equipment cabinet (typically a few cubic feet in volume) mounted to a utility pole, traffic stanchion or street light.\" (Doc. 30 (\"Lambert Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Nodes can accommodate \"one or more FCC-licensed carriers to provide network wireless services to a\n   discrete area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Several nodes together create a network, which can extend wireless coverage \"where a traditional tower is not practical and/or cannot achieve targeted coverage.\" (2014 App. at 2.) Plaintiff obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the New York State Department of Public Service to \"operate in New York State as a facilities-based provider and reseller of telephone service.\" (Lambert Decl.

Plaintiff seeks to modify three of its existing DAS installations located on Village-owned rights of way. (Doc. 33 (\"D's 56.1 Resp.\") \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. 2014 Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 25, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a letter to the Village Administrator with the subject line \"Application for Special Permit for Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.\" (2014 App. at 1.) Plaintiff stated that it sought to \"expand its existing Westchester County distributed antenna system (DAS) into the Village of Pelham Manor on behalf of its current and potential new wireless carrier clients\" and therefore requested a \"Special Permit\" from the Village under Chapter 87 of the Pelham Village Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff proposed installing one twenty-nine pound antenna and one control cabinet on each of three existing utility poles, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2), \"for the use of T-Mobile cellular service,\" (Pitcoff Decl. Ex. D (\"Res.\") \u00b6 30). These installations would \"provide area residents with improved wireless services and eliminate 'dead' spots that previously existed.\" (2014 App. at 2.) Plaintiff declared that the project met the requirements of \u00a7 87-6 of the Pelham Village Code and attached an environmental impact assessment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-38), an engineer's declaration and a structural report, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-16, 101-107), and other information intended to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 87-8 through 87-12, including a demonstration of the need for the proposed services in Pelham, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 97-98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Village's Board of Trustees approved Plaintiff's initial application on December 16, 2014, (Res. at 3), after holding \"seven meetings and three public hearings,\" (D's 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 13 (emphasis omitted) ), and it issued a Resolution granting the Special Permit, (Res. at 10). The parties entered into an agreement governing Plaintiff's use of the right of way on February 17, 2015. (Pitcoff Decl. Ex. A (\"ROW Agreement\") at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    3. 2018 Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 6, 2018, Plaintiff submitted what it called a \"Building Permit Application\" to the Village's Department of Buildings. (2018 App. at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff sought a building permit so it could \"replac[e] antennas and add[ ] equipment at the three existing node locations,\" thereby making\n   its equipment available for use by Verizon Wireless. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In its application, Plaintiff explained the basis for its belief that its request constituted an \"eligible facilities request under FCC regulations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) On the same day, ExteNet's counsel submitted a letter to the Village Administrator contending that the proposed modifications \"qualify as a federal eligible facility request\" under Section 6409 of the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, Pub.

On May 7, 2018, Plaintiff consented to a two-week extension to May 21, 2018, for the Village to \"issue the Building Permit for ExteNet's approved modifications.\" (Cuddy Feder 5/7/18 Letter at 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By letter received by Plaintiff on May 21, 2018, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D's 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 25), the Village denied ExteNet's building permit application on the basis that \"ExteNet has failed to provide in-kind survey data required by Village Code section 87-8(A) and has failed to establish that the wireless telecommunications facility continues to fill a significant gap in current wireless telecommunications services in the Village of Pelham,\" (Senerchia 5/21/18 Letter at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on June 12, 2018, and asserted two causes of action. The first claim alleges that Defendant Village of Pelham violated of Section 6409 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.6100\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.6100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   by denying and failing to approve an eligible facilities request\n   (\"EFR\") for modification of an existing wireless tower that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the tower. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-55.) The second claim alleges that Section 6409 creates a federal right because it requires state and local governments to approve a valid EFR application, and that by failing to approve the Application, the Village has deprived Plaintiff of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rec. E237-04 (daily ed. Feb. 24, 2012) (statement of Rep. Fred Upton). Together, the TCA and Section 6409 occupy a clearly contoured area of telecommunications regulation. Within these contours are certain modification requests. Defendant points to no authority to support the notion that the federal government must \"displace\" all state regulation in a case of express preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Air Evac EMS, Inc. v.

(Doc. 34 (\"P's Reply\") at 5-6.) Defendant does not dispute that if Section 6409 applies, Plaintiff's application constitutes an EFR and would constitute only an insubstantial modification under the applicable regulation. Rather it contends that, regardless of Section 6409, \"ExteNet has a contractual obligation to comply\" with Pelham Village Code \u00a7\u00a7 87-7(A) and (B) because those provisions are incorporated into the ROW Agreement. (D's Mem. at 8.)

As discussed above, Pelham Village Code \u00a7\u00a7 87-7(A) and (B) are not \"applicable\" because they are preempted by federal law.

(ROW Agreement \u00a7 5.4.) Condition No. 5 of that Resolution provides that Plaintiff \"may make subsequent immaterial modifications to the wireless communications facility upon notice to the Village but without further application to the Board of Trustees,\" although it had to obtain required permits from other Village departments. (Res. at 11.) It is not clear what these provisions intended to accomplish, or why condition No. 5 used the term \"immaterial\" when Section 6409 refers to changes that are not \"substantial[ ],\" and neither party has shed light on the subject. But it would appear at least that the parties were acknowledging the applicability of Section 6409, which in turn would connote the inapplicability of Pelham Village Code \u00a7\u00a7 87-7(A) and (B).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The only other court to have addressed whether Section 6409 can be enforced via \u00a7 1983 held that it cannot, albeit on different reasoning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bd. of Cty.
