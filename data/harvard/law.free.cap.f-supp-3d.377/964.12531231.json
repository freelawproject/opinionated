Doc. 27 at \u00b6 11; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 11, Doc. 31 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Stanley was on state probation and, as part of conditions of probation, he was required to submit to urinalysis tests. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 11; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 11; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 4; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 4. Stanley failed to show up to a meeting with his probation officer Mina Bonhorst (Bonhorst) to provide a urine sample, so on February 22, 2017, Bonhorst went to Stanley's home. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 4; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 4. Stanley answered the door and admitted to having smoked methamphetamine and marijuana with Hunter the prior morning. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 5; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 5. Stanley stated that Hunter was not feeling well after using. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 6; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 6. When law enforcement arrived at Stanley's home, Hunter appeared disheveled and would not make eye contact. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 7. As a result of law enforcement's observations and Stanley's admissions, law enforcement suspected Hunter of being under the influence of methamphetamine \"or something else during that time.\" Doc. 31 at \u00b6 8; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 8. Later that day, Stanley provided a urinalysis that tested positive for marijuana and was arrested. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 11; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 11. Hunter learned that Stanley was going to be placed in jail for a probation violation. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 9; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 9; Doc. 28-2 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   That same day, based on comments by Stanley, Bonhorst made a report to Child Protective Services (CPS), a division of the South Dakota Department of Social Services (DSS), of possible neglect concerning Hunter's two children. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 12; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 12; Doc. 28-1 at 1. Family service specialist Mat Opbroek (Opbroek) was assigned to investigate Bonhorst's report. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 13; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 13; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 3. At approximately 4:30 p.m., Opbroek and a CPS supervisor Iyvonne Jewett met with Pierre police officers to perform a welfare check at Hunter's residence. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 14; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 14; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 10; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 10. During the welfare check, Hunter admitted\n   that she had used drugs while her children were present in the home but said she did not use drugs while in the same room as the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 27 at \u00b6 15; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 15. Hunter admitted to using methamphetamine four days before the welfare check and showed law enforcement where she injected methamphetamine into her arm. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 16; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 16. Hunter voluntarily provided a urine sample which field tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 27 at \u00b6 17; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 17; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 11; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While at Hunter's residence, Opbroek observed drug paraphernalia where the children could get to it, and law enforcement informed Opbroek that there were drugs in the house. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 18; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 18; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 19; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 19. Opbroek determined that Hunter was still under the influence of drugs and thus unable to care for her children by herself, which constituted a present danger to the children. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 19; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 19; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 13; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 13. Opbroek also noted the presence of a knife impaled in the door frame when he first walked into Hunter's residence, which gave him further concerns for the children's safety. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 20; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 20. Opbroek did not believe that the potential danger from exposure to methamphetamine was sufficient to have the children screened the night of February 22, 2017. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 21; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 21. Hunter and Opbroek agreed to a present danger plan involving a neighbor named Margaret Rogers (Rogers). Doc. 27 at \u00b6 20; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 20. Rogers agreed to help monitor Hunter thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 27 at \u00b6 20; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 23, 2017, Opbroek ordered Hunter to get her children drug tested, and if she refused, Hunter \"couldn't keep them.\" Doc. 39 at \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opbroek's expressed rationale for the drug screen was his concern that Hunter's children might have been exposed to drugs at some level, including possible ingestion. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 23; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 23. Opbroek believed that the children could have been exposed to the drugs due to their ability to access to areas where drugs were kept. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 17; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 17. Depending on the situation, DSS wants to know if children are in danger of actual exposure to drugs\n   and whether their parents' drug use is directly affecting the children. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 16; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hunter and Opbroek discussed having the drug screening performed at the Avera Clinic where Hunter had previously obtained healthcare. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 26; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 26. Hunter testified that she did not know of any other option besides having the children drug tested at the Avera Clinic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 42 at \u00b6 25; Doc. 43-3 at 2; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 24; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 24. Opbroek told Hunter that he assumed the drug screens would involve urinalysis, but Opbroek did not discuss with Hunter how the medical provider would collect the samples used for the drug screens. Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 32; Doc. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Hunter contacted Opbroek to inform him that she wanted to go to Huron for Stanley's court hearing. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 28; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 28; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 30; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 30. Opbroek told Hunter to have the drug screens for the children completed before she left Pierre. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 28; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 28. Opbroek wanted the drug screening completed before Hunter traveled to Huron to help him determine if there were any medical or health threats to Hunter's children, including exposure to drugs. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 31; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 31. Hunter only agreed to have the drug screenings done because Opbroek said she would not be able to keep her children unless she had her children submit to urinalysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 42 at \u00b6 28; Doc. 32-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hunter called the Avera Clinic and tried to make the appointments for urinalysis for her two children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 33-1 at 6. Hunter told the lady who answered the phone at the clinic that she was requesting a urinalysis because CPS wanted one done. Doc. 33-1 at 6. The lady at the Avera Clinic \"didn't have any knowledge of it.\" Doc. 33-1 at 6. Hunter called Opbroek and recounted her call to the Avera Clinic. Doc. 33-1 at 6. Opbroek called the Avera Clinic,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then called Hunter back and told her that he made the appointment and dropped off some papers at the clinic. Doc. 33-1 at 6. The papers Opbroek dropped off were some blank versions of DSS's methamphetamine medical charting form. Doc. 27\n   at \u00b6 31; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 31; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 32; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 32. Opbroek did not give any other documents to Avera and did not fill out any part of the form. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 31; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 31. Opbroek verbally told someone\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the Avera Clinic that CPS was requesting \"a toxicology or a drug screening\" of Hunter's children because they might have been exposed to drugs. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 32; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 32. Opbroek requested that the results be sent to DSS via fax. Doc. 39 at \u00b6 75; Doc. 33-5 at 3. Opbroek had no further contact with anyone from Avera Clinic or with Hunter before the drug screening was performed. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 33; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Around 11:00 a.m. on February 24, Katie Rochelle (Rochelle), a registered nurse in Avera Clinic's pediatric department, called Teresa Cass (Cass), a pediatric nurse practitioner, about drug screening Hunter's children. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 32-5 at 5, 8. Rochelle informed Cass that Opbroek had told Hunter to get her children drug screened. Doc. 39 at \u00b6 37; Doc. 33-6 at 2. Cass then ordered the drug screen of Hunter's children. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 36. Cass did not speak to Opbroek or anyone at DSS about Hunter's situation. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 37; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 37. Cass was not present at the clinic at the time, Doc. 39 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 33-6 at 2, 6, and indeed was not scheduled to work that day and was out of town. Doc. 32-6 at 2. There were two other pediatricians working that day, but they did not order the tests. Doc. 40-5 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the Avera St. Mary's campus in Pierre, South Dakota, there are different departments with different buildings. Doc. 40-5 at 3. The Child Assessment Center (CAC) is one department located in a south building on the campus. Doc. 40-5 at 3. The CAC is a private agency funded through grants, the National Children's Alliance, and other organizations. Doc. 40-5 at 5. The CAC has an interagency agreement with DSS. Doc. 40-5 at 6. Every month, the CAC has a multi-disciplinary meeting involving the Department of Criminal Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the state's attorney's office, and a patient advocate. Doc. 40-5 at 6. Cass works both for the CAC where she provides medical screening of children about 50 to 100 hours per year and for Avera Clinic where she is a full time pediatric nurse practitioner. Doc. 32-6 at 3; Doc. 40-5 at 6. Doc. 40-4 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the afternoon of February 24, 2017, Hunter went to Avera Clinic with her children in order to have both of them drug screened. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 38. According to Avera's Informed Consent Policy, \"[a] written informed consent must be obtained prior to any medical treatment being performed.\" Doc. 40-7 at 2. There is no evidence that Hunter signed an informed consent document that day. Doc. 42 at \u00b6 T. Hunter took her children to the lab area of Avera Clinic. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 34; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 34; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 38. Hunter, her children, and a lab tech went into a private bathroom. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 35. Hunter's daughter provided a urine sample by urinating into a specimen container shaped like a hat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 27 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 38. Hunter's son, A.Q., was not potty-trained. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 36. A laboratory technician tried to have A.Q. urinate into a specimen container shaped like a hat, but A.Q. would not urinate. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After A.Q. could not voluntarily produce a urine sample, the laboratory technician called Rochelle, and Rochelle took Hunter and her children to the pediatrics department to perform a catheterization on A.Q.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 27 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 53; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 53; Doc. 28-4 at 3-4. Hunter felt like they were \"rushed over across the room to the other.\" Doc. 29 at \u00b6 46; Doc. 40-2 at 3. Hunter helped hold down A.Q. while Rochelle performed the catheterization procedure. Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; Doc. 42 at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 55; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 55. The procedure took a few minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 31 at \u00b6 57; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 57. Upon completion of both children's drug screenings, Hunter stopped by the DSS office to inform Opbroek that the children's drug screens had been completed and to complete paperwork related to setting up a present danger plan involving Hunter's mother. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 58; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DSS has no official policy requiring catheterization to obtain a urine sample from a child. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 52; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 52. Opbroek did not know a catheter had been used to obtain a urine sample from A.Q. until Hunter told him after the catheterization had already occurred. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 49; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 49; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 60; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 60. Opbroek testified that the situation involving Hunter and her children was the only case Opbroek had ever been involved with where Avera Clinic conducted and processed the drug screening of children. Doc. 31 at \u00b6 62; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 62. DSS considers how urine samples are obtained to be a decision best determined by the medical provider. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 52; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 52. CPS is not aware of any other child being catheterized as a result of a drug screening or health assessment requested by CPS. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 51; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rochelle testified that the catheterization was a medical procedure. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 40; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 40. Rochelle had catheterized many children before the procedure on A.Q. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 39; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 39; Doc. 31 at \u00b6 49; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 49. A.Q.'s urine was subject to a drug screen for an array of intoxicating substances. Doc. 27 at \u00b6 45; Doc. 42 at \u00b6 45.

Although this methamphetamine medical charting form was never used by Rochelle, Rochelle discussed the purpose of the appointment with Opbroek and carried through with Opbroek's request to obtain urine samples, albeit using a catheter on A.Q. without Opbroek's knowledge or direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rochelle argues that the catheterization was for a medical purpose and testified that the catheterization was a medical procedure. However, Rochelle evidently did not perform the test because A.Q. exhibited medical signs of drug ingestion. Rochelle did not check vitals or conduct any other evaluation of A.Q.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40-4 at 9. Rochelle followed the directive from Opbroek and tested A.Q.'s urine. Simply because catheterization is a medical procedure does not mean it was done for medical reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tenenbaum v. Williams\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563549\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/581/#p599\">\n    193 F.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"During the examination of [the child] 'to rule out [the possibility of] sexual abuse,' injuries might have been found, and if so we would surely expect them to have been treated. But that possibility did not turn an investigative examination into one that is 'medically indicated' and designed for treatment.\"). When viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Rochelle is a state actor because her actions were taken to collect evidence for the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Cass is also a state actor. Rochelle communicated with Cass over the telephone that the test was being performed because Opbroek had told Hunter to have her children drug screened. Cass subsequently ordered the drug screen. On February 27, 2017, Cass became aware that the results from the screening were in and, instead of calling Hunter, she called Opbroek to inform him that the results were negative. On March 1, 2017, Cass faxed to Opbroek a copy of the medical toxicology results. Hunter did not sign a written authorization to allow DSS to have access to A.Q.'s medical records until April 2017, so Cass released the results to DSS before written authorization was obtained. Hunter was not made aware of the results until months later. Opbroek used the results as part of his investigation for DSS, a state agency. Plaintiff has put forth sufficient facts to show there was a meeting of the minds among Cass, Rochelle, and Opbroek to collect and test A.Q.'s urine sample as evidence for DSS's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
