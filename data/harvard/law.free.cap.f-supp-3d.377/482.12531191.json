This Court finds, however, that Defendants' argument is\n     misguided.

Further, while probable cause might entitle Plaintiff to access\n     <em>\n      all\n     </em>\n     of the treatment and investigative records of students covered by the Acts, Plaintiff has sought access only to the\n     <em>\n      contact information\n     </em>\n     of the students' parents or legal guardians; information to which Plaintiff is entitled under the Acts' implementing regulations, \"whether or not [Plaintiff] has probable cause to suspect abuse or neglect or has received a complaint.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201326.26\">\n      45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1326.26\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     The regulations promulgated under the Acts anticipated cases such as this one, where a P &amp; A system seeks authorization to access records but cannot obtain authorization without the legal guardians' contact information.

Although in their answer to the complaint Defendants admitted to having received multiple requests from Plaintiff, Defendants neither admitted nor denied whether and/or how they responded to those requests, leading to the conclusion that the requests were never fulfilled. Defendants' inaction has effectively denied Plaintiff the opportunity to obtain authorization to access the records. In such a case,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201326.26\">\n      45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1326.26\n     </extracted-citation>\n     requires that the entity denying access provide the contact information for the legal representatives of the individuals whose records the P &amp; A seeks. Defendant has offered no legal basis to support its refusal to comply with the regulation.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-27\">\n     Further, this case is similar to\n     <em>\n      Pennsylvania Protection &amp; Advocacy v. Royer-Greaves School for the Blind.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20179797\">\n      1999 WL 179797\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (E.D. Pa. Mar. 25, 1999). There, the defendant school for \"multi-handicapped, mentally challenged blind students,\" argued that the plaintiff, a P &amp; A system, was \"not entitled to a list of guardians because [ ]P &amp; A never established a right to review the records\" of the students at the school.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at *7. The court found, however, that \"the plain language of the regulation\" supported the conclusion that the plaintiff was entitled to receive the names and contact information of the guardians of the students with developmental disabilities at the school. The court\n     further observed that \"[the] logic of this conclusion suggests that all a P &amp; A must do to receive a list of guardians is to ask for it,\" which is precisely what Plaintiff, in this matter, has done.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at *9. In making this observation, the court determined that the regulations \"must be intended to address the situation\" where a P &amp; A wishes to investigate but, because it cannot exercise its other bases for records access, \"would need the permission of the guardian to see the records, but conceivably would not know how to contact the guardian, and the facility can simply deny access by telling the P &amp; A that they are not authorized to view the records.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at *10. In such a situation, the court concluded, \"the only remedy is to provide the P &amp; A with the names and addresses of the guardians.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-28\">\n     The\n     <em>\n      Royer-Greaves\n     </em>\n     court reached this conclusion after finding that the P &amp; A system plaintiff lacked probable cause to investigate. This Court notes, however, that the same logic applies here, where no determination is made whether probable cause is present. As such, even if a P &amp; A system has probable cause to investigate, if the student in question has a legal guardian, conservator, or representative, the Acts require that \"such representative ha[ve] been contacted by [the] system\" before the P &amp; A system can access the student's records.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015043\">\n      42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15043\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(2)(I)(iii) ;\n     <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n      42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10805\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(4)(C). In light of the Acts' clear intention that P &amp; A systems be able to contact parents or legal guardians to seek authorization, this Court is persuaded by the\n     <em>\n      Royer-Greaves\n     </em>\n     court's analysis regarding the intent behind the implementing regulations.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-29\">\n     Therefore, this Court finds that under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201326.26\">\n      45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1326.26\n     </extracted-citation>\n     and\n     <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2051.43\">\n      42 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.43\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , Defendants must provide Plaintiff with the requested contact information.\n     <footnotemark>\n      7\n     </footnotemark>\n     In light of the plain meaning and purpose of these regulations, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. Accordingly, Defendants are directed to provide Plaintiff with the contact information Plaintiff requested.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-30\">\n     <strong>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-31\">\n     For the reasons stated, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion follows.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-34\">\n     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was amended and renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, effective July 1, 2005.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Pub. L. No. 108-446,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Stat.%202647\">\n      118 Stat. 2647\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 2803 (2004). Notwithstanding this change in the name of the statute, courts and litigants, including the parties in this action, continue to refer to this statute as the IDEA.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      HE. v. Walter D. Palmer Leadership Learning Partners Charter School\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264503\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/406/#p408\">\n      873 F.3d 406\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 408 (3d Cir. 2017). For clarity, this Court will refer to this statute as the IDEA in this Memorandum Opinion.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     Indeed, in a discovery report filed jointly in the instant matter the parties indicate that they:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-36\">\n     [A]gree that the primary issue ... is a legal one - whether DRP, as the [Protection and Advocacy] system [in Pennsylvania], has the right under the DD and PAIMI Acts to receive contact information for parents of students on the wait list [for special education programming]. Notably, the relevant issue is not whether the wait list students were or were not receiving special education services they needed, but only whether DRP had a legal basis to secure the parent contact information under the DD and PAIMI Acts.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     This Court also considered Plaintiff's response to Defendants' motion, [ECF 10], and Defendants' response to Plaintiff's motion. [ECF 11].\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-39\">\n     Notably, in response to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Defendants do not contest Plaintiff's proffered evidence of the existence of such a waitlist.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-41\">\n     The PAIMI counterpart of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201326.26\">\n      45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1326.26\n     </extracted-citation>\n     is\n     <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2051.43\">\n      42 C.F.R \u00a7 51.43\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , which similarly provides that \"[if] a P &amp; A system's access to ... records covered by the Act or this part is delayed or denied, the P &amp; A system shall be provided promptly with a written statement of reasons, including, in the case of a denial for alleged lack of authorization, the name, address and telephone number of the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of an individual with mental illness.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-42\">\n     Defendants warn that a ruling in Plaintiff's favor would undermine the IDEA'S purpose, displacing parents' role in the \"cooperative process\" of providing a FAPE to qualifying students by replacing parents with a third-party organization that \"has not been involved in the IDEA process\" and \"knows nothing of the individual student and her needs.\" [ECF 7 at 15]. This argument is misplaced, since a ruling in Defendants' favor would do more to displace parents' role in the treatment of their children (by frustrating P &amp; A systems' ability to obtain guardians' authorization to access their children's records) than would a ruling in Plaintiff's favor, which invites P &amp; A systems to involve guardians in their investigations.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
