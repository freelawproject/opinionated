NAAQS are \"health-based criteria for the maximum acceptable concentrations of air pollutants at all locations to which the public has access.\" UNC0027645.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that CARMMS was not up to date and did not contain all emissions that may impact the study area and notes surrounding states and projects that it argues Defendants should have included in a cumulative air quality impact inventory.

Plaintiffs continue that Defendants did not take a hard look at the Projects' effects of pollutants for which the government has established NAAQS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. Plaintiffs specifically point to monitored concentrations of ozone close to the Unit that \"are already significantly above the level of the NAAQS, leaving virtually no room for growth in emissions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim that Defendants used data that the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") determined was stale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They conclude that without properly modeling air pollution levels, Defendants cannot justify a conclusion that incremental increases of ozone would be insignificant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants respond that CARMMS included a sufficient range of projects and development and that the agencies would \"continue to monitor oil and gas development in the region to verify that cumulative emissions rates are consistent with the annual rates modeled in CARMMS.\" ECF No. 50 at 31. They argue that the record shows they sufficiently explained their decision on which geographic areas to model and that this decision is afforded deference.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Defendants note that modeling information and analysis of impacts to air quality would be updated if appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. Defendants argue that they followed updated EPA numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.

Defendants explained that, contrary to Plaintiffs contention that the pollutant data was outdated and the geographic areas should be expanded, it included data from state and federal permitted sources, projects from neighboring states, and inventories from a local gas play area.

Further, Defendants explained that it had updated its analysis\n   using EPA's new ozone NAAQS and that they would reprocess data based on revised EPA estimates. UNC0027275, 0027844. Finally, Defendants rationally concluded that air quality impacts would not cause concentrations that exceed NAAQS and as such, it is not the court's role to mandate that it perform further NEPA analysis.

They found that the demand for water would remain relatively steady for about 10 years, estimated total cumulative water quantity needed for this time, and that \"[t]he impacts on water quantity are expected to be less than significant.\" UNC0027889-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants wrote that water depletion may impact aquatic wildlife by a loss of physical habitat, changes in water quality, sediment accumulation, habitat alteration, loss of habitat complexity, or food source reduction. UNC0027911. They added that \"[d]ue to minimal change to water quantity and quality anticipated, direct impacts on agricultural operations are likely to be limited.\" UNC0028012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In the EA, Defendants discussed surface and groundwater impacts, finding in part an increased risk of spills for additional development. UNC98112. On impacts to fish, the EA read that the proposed action would result in the depletion of approximately 224.4 acre-feet of water from within the Colorado River basin, but would not likely affect adversely designated critical habitats for specified endangered fish. UNC0098045. Defendants briefly discuss the effects of drought on western United States. UNC0098113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In their Reply, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' recounting of the EIS and EA analysis of water quantity prove they insufficiently examined \"water quantity impacts other than to aquatic species.\" ECF No. 52 at 21. Further, Plaintiffs suggest I rely upon\n   <em>\n    San Juan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526813\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/326/1227/#p1242\">\n    326 F.Supp.3d at 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the proposition that the current case is at the stage of the oil and gas leasing process where analysis should be more precise than what Defendants provided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   I find neither argument compelling to overcome the deference paid to the agencies.

Further, the conclusion of the court in\n   <em>\n    San Juan\n   </em>\n   hinged upon the fact that water usage was not quantified by BLM, which has occurred here.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526813\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/326/1227/#p1242\">\n    326 F.Supp.3d at 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 47 at 38. For support, they look to a comment letter from the Colorado Division of Wildlife which read that it was \"concerned with the proposed density and extent of development in the Bull Mountain Unit as the area provides high quality habitat for a variety of species, and contains important wintering habitat for big game.\" UNC0054004. The comment had a set of wildlife best management practices concerning oil and gas development, where it noted that development activities should be planned at the largest scale possible and that development activities should be phased and concentrated, \"so that large areas of undisturbed habitat for wildlife remain.\" UNC0054006-07. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants did not take a sufficiently hard look at the cumulative impacts to wildlife when it narrowed the scope of the analysis to the Unit's boundaries and did not include a variety of other planned oil and gas developments in adjacent areas. ECF Nos. 47 at 40; 52 at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs continue by looking to comments from Colorado Parks and Wildlife who voiced concern that oil and gas development displaced big game \"long after drilling activities have ceased,\" regardless of site-specific conditions of approval or best management practices. ECF No. 47 at 39 (quoting UNC0079421). Plaintiffs posit that the Unit includes areas that are crucial to elk and deer, especially during winter months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526813\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/326/1227/#p1242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They continue that Defendant's preferred alternative for the Unit \"would result in at least 26 of the 33 well pads located within and directly adjacent to the core areas of the crucial elk and mule deer winter habitat areas, yet the agency still failed to provide any meaningful cumulative analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526813\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/326/1227/#p1242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs dismiss Defendants' explanation in the comments that Defendants lacked sufficient information for a generalized cumulative impacts analysis because Defendants did not explain what information was needed or could not be obtained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs add that the EA was similarly deficient, in that the proposed pad locations\n   were nearby elk winter concentration areas, but did not sufficiently analyze the related impacts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41. Additionally, they argue that the EA did not analyze cumulative impacts to mule deer at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In the EIS, Defendants defined the cumulative impacts analysis area as the Unit, plus a 10-mile buffer around the Unit, except that \"each resource topic defines the area based on the specific issues and resources being addressed.\" UNC0027792. Plaintiff notes that Defendants analyzed the cumulative impacts area for mule deer and elk to the Unit itself, apparently excluding the additional 10-mile buffer. ECF No. 52 at 22, n.5 (citing UNC0027932). They analyzed direct and indirect impacts to deer and elk. UNC0027924. But Defendants recognized that it was \"not possible to quantify the impacts on the deer and elk populations\" and that \"[b]ecause of the small size of the project, prime winter range would not be impacted by pad development, but it could be impacted by habitat avoidance in areas adjacent to access roads.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From there, Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants point to details of a wildlife habitat plan, certain mitigation measures, an explanation of data Defendants were missing, and an acknowledgement that elk and deer habitat could be disturbed. ECF No. 50 at 36-37 ; 51 at 31-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   After review of the briefs and record, it is not apparent to me whether Defendants considered the 10-mile buffer zone when compiling its cumulative impacts analysis regarding mule deer and elk. As such, I find that Defendants did not sufficiently explain their analysis in the EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Compare this to the 25-well Project, where Defendants analyzed the impacts of big game species pursuant to federal regulations for the USFS. UNC0098058. Enveloping the analysis of mule deer into their analysis of elk, Defendants considered a 10-mile buffer area surrounding the proposed treatments and activities for the cumulative effects analysis. UNC0092685, 0093185. Defendants found that \"[d]ue to the scale and type of this project, with limited habitat alteration and the low mileage of new road construction, effects of the project at this scale are negligible and would not show in the model unless taken to unreasonable levels of precision (beyond that of the data used).\" UNC0093185. They continued that \"[s]imilar actions within the cumulative impacts area, specifically the proposed gas development in the Bull Mountain Unit and other future energy development, will also result in an incremental reduction in habitat suitability and availability for elk and expected changes to distribution,\" but \"at the scale of the watershed and the data analysis unit used to monitor elk populations, this project, even when considered with all other projects in the area, is not likely to result in significant changes to elk populations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants sufficiently explained and analyzed cumulative impacts to mule deer and elk in the EA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Concerning the EIS, while comments from Colorado wildlife agencies regarding the wildlife management in the EIS are by no means mandatory authority, they provide support to Plaintiffs arguments as to why a larger scope was not used.
