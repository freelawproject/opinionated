The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the motion and the remainder of the file and hereby grants Ruffino's motion in part and denies it in part and grants the City's motion in part and denies it in part for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ruffino claims that the City's implementation of \"pedestrian safety zones\" outside two entrances of the Washington State Spring and Fall Fairs violates his free speech rights under the federal and state constitutions. Dkt. 2. The pedestrian safety zones are delineated by yellow lines painted on the public sidewalk. The safety zone in front of the \"Blue gate\" entrance and exit to the fairgrounds includes a 121-foot strip in front of the Fair's entrance and exit that covers a width of the sidewalk directly adjacent to the highway, as well as a similar 97-foot strip of sidewalk along the opposite side of the street. This area is illustrated in the aerial photograph below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dkt. 10 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The safety zone in front of the \"Gold gate\" includes a 72.5-foot strip on the street corner in front of the entrance and on all of sidewalk corners surrounding the intersection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10 at 7. This safety zone is demonstrated in the following aerial photograph:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dkt. 10 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In both locations, the safety zones cover the width of the city sidewalks. The width of these safety zones is illustrated in the image below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dkt. 18 at 4. Although there is paved open space immediately adjacent to the safety zones at both the Gold or Blue gates (as depicted in the photograph of the Blue gate above), that area is owned by the Fair, a private non-profit corporation, that prohibits petitioning activity on its premises except for at specifically located ten-by-ten-foot booths that must be reserved for a designated four-day period.

No force was used to remove Ruffino. The encounter is documented by several videos. Ruffino claims that the City officers violated his rights by instructing him to leave the pedestrian safety zone. He also claims that the zones are too large and are enforced for an unnecessary amount of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 14, 2018, Ruffino filed his complaint and commenced this lawsuit. Dkt. 1. On May 16, 2018, Ruffino amended his complaint as a matter of course. Dkt. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 7, 2018, the Court issued an order denying Ruffino's motion for a preliminary injunction, Dkt. 10, and granting Ruffino's motion to continue, Dkt. 28, as to his claims against the City and denying it as to his claims against individually named defendants. Dkt. 51. In the same order, the Court also granted the City's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 16, as to \u00a7 1983 liability for individually named defendants and denied it as to claims against the City. Dkt. 51. On January 10, 2019, Ruffino moved for partial summary judgment. Dkt. 56. Also on January 10, 2019, the City renewed its motion for partial summary judgment.

Dkt. 20-2 at 2-3. The Executive Order's factual findings for the Spring fair state that the fair attracts more than 150,000 visitors over four days, most of whom enter the fair on foot, that the Blue and Gold gates are the most heavily trafficked, and that impeding the relevant crosswalks degrades safety and increases the risk of injury Dkt. 20-2 at 2. The factual findings directly support the City's asserted interest. Neither the ordinance nor the Executive Order contain any reference to the content of speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menotti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8960130\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/1113/#p1128\">\n    409 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The only element of discretion in the language is to the enforcing officer to determine when activity is likely to obstruct pedestrian traffic. The language on its face requires enforcement against any conduct persisting within the pedestrian safety zones and leaves no room for content-based enforcement.

That the food drive is traditional, as Ruffino argues, Dkt. 72 at 2, says nothing about whether banner-holders traditionally stood in the pedestrian safety zones or whether an unofficial policy existed to exempt them from enforcement.

Dkt. 51 at 10-11. The Court credited the City's evidence that crowding at the Fair's entrances is less predictable than sporting events which have a scheduled beginning and expected end and reasoned that during other events at the fairgrounds where the City did not enforce the zones, the crowd sizes were substantially smaller.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154724\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/850/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (citing Dkt. 18 at 2). The Court reasoned that the depictions of the pedestrian safety zones substantiate the City's assertion that the zones are designed to cover the least amount of space while effectively achieving their purpose, and any shorter distance might reasonably be expected to fail to ensure that a clear pedestrian corridor exists from the gates to the nearest crosswalk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154724\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/850/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court noted that while the enforcement of the pedestrian safety zones certainly restricts free speech at times of lighter traffic, assessing the restriction's reasonableness \"must involve not only [Ruffino] but also all other organizations [or individuals] that would be entitled to distribute, sell, or solicit if the ... rule may not be enforced with respect to [Ruffino].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154724\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/850/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 12-13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313770\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/640/#p647\">\n    452 U.S. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313770\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/640/#p647\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In granting Ruffino a continuance of summary judgment proceedings so that he could obtain expert testimony and conduct depositions regarding less restrictive alternatives, the Court observed that \"the City's supporting evidence is notably vague regarding peak times of pedestrian traffic or the extent to which any unpredictability of traffic flow prevents the pedestrian safety zones from being narrowed substantially regarding hours of enforcement.\" Dkt. 51 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Now, the parties again dispute whether the zones could be more narrowly applied in both timing and size. The City explains that it \"took seriously the Court's admonition to review the necessity of the zones' scope and duration. And, after careful review, it concluded that a revision in either regard would leave pedestrians less safe, and not be in the public's overall interest.\" Dkt. 59 at 15. As noted, Ruffino moves for partial summary judgment on four issues, one which was addressed by the Court's analysis on the substantial government interest, and three which effectively constitute less restrictive alternatives for enforcement of the zones. Dkt. 56. First, Ruffino seeks a judgment that the pedestrian safety zones are impermissibly restrictive on weekdays as opposed to weekends, second, that the restrictions at the Gold gate should not include the area west of the crosswalk at 9th and Meridian, and third, that the restrictions at the Blue gate should only include the area that is six feet north of the light pole on the west side of the street. Dkt. 56 at 2. Additionally, Ruffino suggests that instead of the pedestrian safety zones, the City could use alternative measures \"some of which it has taken\" such as \"police officer presence, police officer\n   control of intersections and signals, partial street closures, temporary speed reduction, and enforcement of other laws\" such as ordinances on pedestrian interference and sidewalk obstruction. Dkt. 63 at 14. The Court will address each of Ruffino's specific proposed limitations in turn as a means of evaluating the narrowness of the tailoring,\n   <em>\n    Menotti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8960130\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/1113/#p1128\">\n    409 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and incorporate analysis of other possible enforcement options or modifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Timing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Regarding limiting the application of the zones to weekends only, Ruffino argues that actual attendance is lower on weekdays, and the pedestrian safety zones are unjustified with lower attendance. Dkt. 56 at 2. Ruffino does not admit that the zones are justified on weekends but concedes that because \"there are different facts with respect to weekends, due to larger fair attendance on those days, [that issue] will require trial on the merits.\" Dkt. 56 at 2 n.2. Ruffino argues that the City varies its policing staff daily based on expected attendance, Dkt. 56 at 11 (citing Dkt. 58-8 at 28), implying that the City has some ability to predict attendance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ruffino cites fair attendance data showing that average weekday attendance between 2014 and 2018 has varied from 27,178 to 54,331, in contrast with average weekend attendance which varied from 49,667 to 106,096. Dkt. 56 at 9 (citing Dkt. 58-8 at 40). He argues \"[t]he City in no way considers the actual size of crowds or the actual safety concerns.\" Dkt. 56 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   City Manager Kevin Yamamoto declares that the City \"worked to come up with a way to maintain the zones for only part of the time,\" at the Court's request, but concluded that \"this would make pedestrians less safe.\" Dkt. 62 at 2-4. He declares that \"it is almost impossible to predict when crowds will form.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The City argues that it cannot safely limit the amount of time the zones are enforced because the uncertainty caused by the variety of events at the fair throughout the day is compounded by the fact that \"[a] warm Monday is often busier than a rainy Saturday.\" Dkt. 59 at 15-16 (citing Dkt. 62 at 2-3). Yamamoto further declares that a variable regulation would be difficult for law enforcement to keep up with, and even less clear to attendees. Dkt. 62 at 3. The crux of the City's argument on timing of the zones is directed at the concept of temporally flexible enforcement, which the City argues would create uncertainty for both law enforcement and attendees. Dkt. 59 at 15-16. This relates to the City's argument that enforcing existing obstruction ordinances did not work because \"[n]ot only were those laws reactive, by definition, becoming enforceable at the point where there was already a safety hazard, but worse, the ad hoc enforcement (including the antagonistic interactions that usually go along with it) largely occurred at the busiest and most dangerous times.\" Dkt. 59 at 7. The City concludes that absent safety zones, its safety objective \"will not just be 'achieved less effectively'\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    491 U.S. at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it will not be achieved at all.\" Dkt. 59 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court's prior Order denying a preliminary injunction considered the overall average daily attendance of between forty- and fifty-thousand people, not the substantially higher weekend averages. Dkt. 51 at 8-9. The Court now finds that even considering somewhat lower average weekday attendance, the City has provided evidence that pedestrian flows are considerable and quite variable due to weather and other factors, and that there is a potential for\n   additional pedestrian impediment because of reactive or unanticipated enforcement. The Court concludes that consistent enforcement of the zones is narrowly tailored to the volume and variability of pedestrian traffic. The Court will thus include temporal enforcement in its analysis of ample alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Blue Gate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Regarding the Blue gate, Ruffino argues that pedestrian safety zone is geographically overbroad and should include \"only the area starting 6 feet north of the light pole on the west side of the street, and then further to the line established by the City, north of the Blue Gate Crosswalk, and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the area south of the location that is six feet north of the light pole.\" Dkt. 56 at 2. Ruffino's description does not directly address the portion of the zone on the east side of the street across from the Blue gate but may intend to exclude a similar part of the east side of the zone. The City argues that after consultation with its staff, law enforcement, and its expert witness, it concluded that \"reducing [the zones] to something less than the width of the ticketing gates-where the significant backlogs and queuing occurs-would be arbitrary and hazardous.\" Dkt. 62 at 2. The City highlights that Uber and Lyft drop-offs created additional traffic concerns in 2018, and the fair has informed the city that they will be using metal detection in the future at the gates which the City anticipates will create additional bottlenecking. Dkt. 59 at 15 (citing Dkt. 62 at 2). Ruffino argues that the fair performed bag checks at entrances in 2018 without delays, citing the deposition of his expert witness who stated he did not see backups when his bag was searched, Dkt. 64-4 at 5-6, and the deposition of the fair's Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deponent, Dkt. 64-3 at 24-24, who stated he did not see lines of more than 30 people at ticket windows. Dkt. 63 at 4. Ruffino also argues that issues stemming from ride-share traffic could be addressed by placing official signs along Meridian prohibiting stopping or loading pursuant to RCW 46.61.570. Dkt. 72 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The safety zone at the Blue gate directly lines up with one of the two busiest entrances to the fair and protects access to the crosswalk leading to a busy street, following the areas of known crowding, in contrast to the event operators who failed to consider those areas in\n   <em>\n    Kuba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154724\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/850/#p856\">\n    387 F.3d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, as the Court previously reasoned, the City has presented unrebutted evidence that the zones are tailored to apply only during the two busiest annual events in the City, the Spring and Fall fairs. Dkt. 51 at 10-11. The Court finds that while the safety zone at the Blue gate may not be the least restrictive alternative, on the available evidence it is narrowly tailored to the City's safety interest. The Court will thus consider the safety zone at the Blue gate when it analyzes ample alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Gold Gate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Regarding the portion of the pedestrian safety zone west of the crosswalk at the Gold gate, Ruffino argues that there is at least a question of fact as to whether the zone is geographically overbroad because \"the City has consistently closed the entire street along 9th, west of Meridian.\" Dkt. 56 at 2. Therefore, Ruffino argues, the zone should be modified to exclude the area west of the west crosswalk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154724\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/850/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The City's briefing on the motions for summary judgment does not address this argument specifically, so it is unclear whether the City disputes Ruffino's assertion that the street is consistently closed during the fairs. This street closure was also before the Court in Ruffino's motion for preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10 at 15, Dkt. 52 at 8-9. Both parties' arguments regarding traffic and gate activity and practices discussed\n   regarding the Blue gate are also relevant to analysis of the Gold gate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court concludes that on the available evidence, this area is consistently closed to traffic. Even if emergency vehicles are parked on this street, the City has not presented evidence that modifying the pedestrian safety zones to account for the street closure would impede the operation of these vehicles. Modifying the zone at the Gold gate to account for the street closure is an obvious, less restrictive alternative that would allow substantially more access for speech. On this basis, the Court finds that the zone at the Gold gate is not narrowly tailored. The Court grants summary judgment for Ruffino on this question and denies the City's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Ample Alternatives\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A restriction that is content neutral, advances a legitimate government interest, and is narrowly tailored must also leave open ample alternative means of communication.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414210\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/703/#p725\">\n    530 U.S. at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414210\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/703/#p725\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit has set out four factors within this analysis: (1) whether the speaker may still reach the intended audience, (2) whether the location is part of the expressive message, (3) whether, particularly for political speech, opportunities for spontaneity are available, and (4) the cost and convenience of alternatives.\n   <em>\n    Long Beach Area Peace Network\n   </em>\n   , 574 F.3d at 1025. In evaluating Ruffino's motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court observed that photographs of the pedestrian safety zone show that Ruffino can stand merely six to ten feet past the ramp onto the sidewalk from the street crosswalk at the Blue gate, a few feet to the side of the flow of traffic. Dkt. 51 at 14. He is also able to and has reserved a space inside the fairgrounds for petitioning activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 11-1 at 10, 12). The Court reasoned that Ruffino was denied his preferred petitioning location within the pedestrian safety zone based on documented high-volume crowds in those zones, the very problem prompting the City's creation of the zones. Dkt. 51 at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While reserving a space in the fairgrounds includes a cost, Ruffino has both utilized the option to reserve space inside the fair and testified that he is more successful gathering signatures on the public sidewalks. Dkt. 61-3 at 3. The City argues that there is steady foot traffic around the perimeter of the fair outside the pedestrian safety zones and cites Ruffino's deposition where he confirmed that signature gathering occurred at these locations. Dkt. 59 at 12 (citing Dkt. 61-1 at 8). Ruffino counters that it is important for signature-gatherers to be near pedestrians to engage in conversation, the pedestrian volume is much lower in the areas outside the zones, and some past successful signature-gathering has taken place on fair property where the fair retains the right to bar activity in the future. Dkt. 63 at 10 (citing Dkt. 64-1 at 11, Dkt. 64-3 at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court considers the sufficiency of alternatives in conjunction with enforcement of the temporal restrictions and the Blue gate which satisfy the preceding elements of the test. Considering the factors, the Court first finds no evidence contradicting a conclusion that the audience is the same in both Ruffino's preferred areas and the available alternatives. Second, Ruffino does not assert the location is part of the expressive message. Third, speakers are not dissuaded from spontaneous speech by permitting or advance notice requirements. Fourth, signature-gatherers do not have to exert substantial additional effort to stand in one location versus another, and Ruffino's past use of the reserved space in the fair in conjunction with sidewalk petitioning suggests the cost of this option is not a barrier to his speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that the pedestrian safety zones are content neutral both facially and as applied, the City has shown its safety interest is substantial, and that the temporal restrictions and the geographic restrictions at the Blue gate are narrowly tailored in the context of the ample alternatives which remain for signature-gathering. The Court finds that the pedestrian safety zone at the Gold gate is content neutral and in response to a substantial government interest but is not narrowly tailored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
