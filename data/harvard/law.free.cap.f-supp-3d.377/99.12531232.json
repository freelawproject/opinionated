The joinder of these indispensable parties was feasible since the inception of the original\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , hence, the issue of the joinder of these indispensable parties has become a non-issue, as Mr. Delgado-Gonzalez and Ms. Delgado-Caraballo are now plaintiffs in the recently filed\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Notwithstanding, there are two more issues pending before the Court, to wit: (a) whether plaintiffs are entitled to claim personal damages under EMTALA as to APS;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (b) whether plaintiffs are entitled to claim personal damages \"under the law of the State,\" as explicitly stated under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201399\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dd)(d)(2)(A), as to APS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence, since the EMTALA provisions do not apply to APS, plaintiffs are not entitled to claim any type of damages under EMTALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C.\n   <strong>\n    The EMTALA Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the outset, the Court reviews the holding of the First Circuit, as to EMTALA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   To summarize our EMTALA-claim conclusions:\n   <strong>\n    We do not disturb the grant of summary judgment for APS, because plaintiffs do not attack that piece to the judge's decision\n   </strong>\n   .

However, since APS is not an EMTALA participant hospital, the only available alternative for plaintiffs is to claim damages under Puerto Rico applicable law, as provided by the EMTALA statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(d)(A), but limited only to \"months not years,\" after the death of Mrs. Natividad Caraballo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    The Death of Mrs. Natividad Caraballo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Mrs. Natividad Caraballo took her own life on October 4, 2012. Mrs. Caraballo was the author of her own injury resulting in the taking of her own life, apparently in her home. The record is clear that Mrs. Caraballo's death did not happen at the emergency stabilizing unit at Hospital Pavia Hato Rey, where she was examined and discharged on October 1, 2012 or at the APS facilities in Caguas where she was examined and discharged on October 3, 2012. Indeed, after Dr. Nilsa Lopez evaluated Mrs. Caraballo, Dr. Lopez gave her a follow up appointment for the next month. It is uncontested that the suicidal death of Mrs. Natividad Caraballo occurred on October 4, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In sum, from the moment that Mrs. Natividad Caraballo made her final decision to take her own life, and executed her plan, from that moment Mrs. Caraballo cut off any rights that may be transferred to her heirs, as a suicidal death is not a tortuous death that is transferable to third parties under Art. 1802.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The personal claims for pain and suffering of the deceased Mrs. Natividad Caraballo are simply not transferable to the heirs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at pages 112-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    The Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Returning to the\n   <em>\n    Opinion\n   </em>\n   of the First Circuit, the Court ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint to include the remaining indispensable parties. An\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   was eventually filed on October 3, 2018, at Docket No. 154. However, the joining of the two new indispensable parties do not change this Court's finding under EMTALA, as what really triggered the unfortunate death of Mrs. Caraballo is an external factor not related to EMTALA and/or the medical services received at APS, who is not a covered entity under EMTALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Court notes that on or about October 3, 2012, Mrs. Natividad Caraballo had notice of the passing of her mother-in-law due to long term diseases of cancer and diabetes. It further appears that Mrs. Natividad Caraballo had a close relationship with her mother in law, and at that point could not manage her emotional situation\n   any longer, leading to the potential decision of taking her own life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Under local Puerto Rico law, the surviving heirs of a suicidal relative do not inherit a cause of action for the pain of Mrs. Natividad Caraballo, as this was a personal decision taken by Mrs. Natividad Caraballo, and authored by her only, as opposed to an EMTALA violation, or negligence, or medical malpractice, or any other potential cause of action under Puerto Rico law.\n   <em>\n    See discussion infra\n   </em>\n   of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in the opinions of\n   <em>\n    Widow of Delgado, et al. v.

The unfortunate event that triggers the instant complaint was the suicidal death of Mrs. Natividad Caraballo, on October 4, 2012. The family plaintiffs\n   <strong>\n    had knowledge\n   </strong>\n   of their mother's death since, on or about October 4, 2012. The daughter Yomayra Delgado Caraballo has knowledge as to APS since Yomayra Delgado and her brother Juan Ramon Delgado Caraballo had a conversation on August 13, 2013. During the conversation, plaintiff Yomayra stated that \"He [plaintiff Juan Ramon Delgado Caraballo] told me that he thought about my mother, and the situation in which she was found dead, and that he thought that they [APS] were going to do something else, that they [APS] were going to admit her, or something, upon seeing her in that condition, and they [APS] didn't do that.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 141, p.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   It is uncontested that Mrs. Natividad Caraballo passed away on October 4, 2012. Plaintiffs Yomayra and Juan Ramon discussed on August 13, 2013, whether her mother Natividad should have been admitted at APS, on October 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Hence, the heirs of the Estate of Natividad Caraballo had one year from October\n   4, 2012, that is, October 4, 2013, to file any action to claim damages based on fault or negligence under the laws of Puerto Rico, unless the one year statute of limitations is timely tolled, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . However, the record shows that the original\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   as to the personal damages of the family members under EMTALA and Puerto Rico laws, was filed on September 30, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   It is critical to note that the statute of limitations of the supplemental tort claims under Puerto Rico law is one year \"from the time the aggrieved person had knowledge thereof.\" 31 L.P.R.A \u00a7 5298. The statute of limitations of the Puerto Rico claims run separately from the EMTALA's statute of limitations which is \"two years after the date of the violation with respect to which the action is brought.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (d)(2) Civil enforcement - (C) Limitations on actions. \"No action may be brought under this paragraph more than two years after the date of the violation with respect to which the action is brought.\" This section refers to the rights of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     patient or \"individual.\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (Emphasis ours.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In the instant case, it is clear from the record that the supplemental claims under Puerto Rico law are time barred, as all the family members listed as plaintiffs, except the minors, of the late Natividad Caraballo knew of her passing on October 4, 2012, or shortly thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence, the statute of limitations for supplemental claims of the family members under Puerto Rico law expired on or before October 4, 2013. The original\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   was filed on September 30, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    EMTALA v.

Consequently, the Puerto Rico one year statute of limitations elapsed even considering that plaintiffs received the medical records on or about September 16, 2013, or a few days thereafter, that is, but certainly before the expiration of the statute of limitations on October 3, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   But the fact is that plaintiffs did not need copies of the medical records to file a timely complaint, as they had knowledge of the cause of their mother's death since October 4, 2012. Moreover, plaintiffs sought to have the defendant to be hospitalized at APS on October 3, 2012 precisely out of concern for the health of their mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 141, p.11. Plaintiffs requested their mother's hospitalization since the dates when Yomayra took her to the emergency room at Hospital Pavia Hato Rey on October 1, 2012, and to APS on October 3, 2012, and both entities denied plaintiffs' request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Moreover, even a copy of the death certificate would have been sufficient to file a timely complaint to safeguard the one year statute of limitations but they did not act timely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales-Melecio v.

Specially, considering that Yomayra Delgado, and Juan Delgado, the widower, had requested APS the hospitalization of her mother on the day prior to the suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Court emphasizes that, based on the record, the only statement made by plaintiff Yomayra Delgado to the APS' evaluating professional when she took her mother to the October 3, 2012 appointment, regarding the request for Natividad's admission, is the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   And I told the physician, with her, that I loved her, that I really cared for her, that I loved her a lot. That I wanted her to be okay.\n   <strong>\n    That we were afraid that she would do something against herself.

Based on the record, however, the Court finds that the above statement made by Yomayra cannot be interpreted as a direct request to the professional who was evaluating Natividad, to admit her mother as a patient. Yomayra's \"thoughts ... that she would be admitted,\" and a direct request for admission as a patient are inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Finally, the statute of limitations may have been interrupted also by making an extrajudicial claim, but plaintiffs also failed to timely pursue that option.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosa v.

But even considering the date when plaintiffs received the medical records at APS, that is, on or about September 16, 2013 as the starting point for the one year statute of limitations under Puerto Rico law, the uncontested fact is that plaintiffs\n   filed the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   on September 30, 2014.
