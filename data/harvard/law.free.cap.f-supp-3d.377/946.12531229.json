Presently pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 35 and 47). The motions are fully briefed and ready for disposition. All matters are pending before the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge with the consent of the parties, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Based upon a review of the file, record and proceedings herein, and for the reasons stated, the Court grants the Committee's motion for summary judgment and denies DaPron's cross motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), DaPron alleges a wrongful denial of disability benefits claim under ERISA (Count I), arguing that the Committee wrongfully denied him disability benefits because he did not \"apply for Disability Retirement benefits in connection with [his] termination.\" (ECF No. 32, FAC at \u00b6 35) DaPron also alleges a breach of fiduciary duty claim stemming from when the Committee adjudicated his claim for benefits in 2016. (Count II). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50) In particular, DaPron alleges that his employer was aware that his mental condition impaired his judgment, insight and capacity, and prevented him from applying for benefits until 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48) DaPron further alleges that the Committee breached its fiduciary duty by refusing \"to consider the medical evidence documenting his incapacity to apply for benefits at the time of his separation from his employment; not investigating whether the plan administrator received notice of his disability and his incapacity to apply for benefits at the time of his separation from his employment; and using an unfair and biased process designed to create evidence to support a denial of benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50(a)-(c)) DaPron seeks an order of remand with instructions for the Committee to conduct a full and fair review and an award of attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fundamental to this Court's function in reviewing the decision of the plan administrator regarding a claim for benefits is the necessity that the Court has a full and complete administrative record.\n   <em>\n    Gentile v.

However, to the extent that DaPron presents evidence that was not raised prior to the conclusion of the administrative claims process and the close of the administrative record on January 19, 2017, these letters may not be considered because the Court can consider only the evidence that was before the administrator when the claim was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

(ECF No. 48 at 1-2 ) In support of his objections, DaPron asserts that \"the citation to particular parts of materials in the record do not support this contention.\" (ECF No. 48 at 2 ) \"Those matters in dispute shall be set forth with specific references to portions of the record, where available, upon which the opposing party relies. The opposing party shall also note for all disputed facts the paragraph number from movant's listing of facts. All matters set forth in the statement shall be deemed admitted for the purposes unless specifically controverted by the opposing party.\" Local Rule 4.01(E). These objections DaPron has raised that do not cite to the record and are ineffective for purposes of establishing a genuine factual dispute. Accordingly, for purposes of the Committee's motion for summary judgment, DaPron is deemed to have admitted the facts set forth in those paragraphs in the Committee's statements of uncontroverted facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roe v.

(ECF No. 25-2 )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In May 2016, DaPron first submitted an application for disability pension benefits under the Plan along with a copy of a February 20, 2010, letter confirming a finding of disability and an award of Social Security Disability Benefits. (AR 410-11) Although the Committee met on May 24, 2016, and DaPron's claim was on the agenda, his claim was not discussed at the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401-04) The Committee voted unanimously to deny DaPron's claim for disability pension benefits. (Mark Mispagel Depo. at 16, 28 (ECF No. 41-3 )) In his deposition, Mispagel testified that the Committee understood the Plan required that a disability pension application be made by an employee prior to his employment being terminated, and he is not aware of any exceptions to this requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29) Mispagel testified that the Committee interpreted the Plan to require an employee to file an application for disability pension benefits prior to his separation from employment because if not, the employee would not be considered eligible for such benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41) Mispagel opined that he was not aware of the Plan being administered any differently and that there was no attempt to determine whether DaPron was disabled at the time he separated from his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42) Mispagel further explained that the reason DaPron's claim was denied as follows: \"In looking at the claim application, ... it was done six years after the separation of the employee ... on a voluntary resignation. And the committee looked at the plan documents and, in general, the -- or, in specific, the plan document indicates that an employee or a - actually, it says a covered employee or one of their legal representative or their family members will make application prior to a - separating from employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In a letter dated June 20, 2016, Gorla explained how the Committee had reviewed DaPron's claim for disability pension benefits under the Plan and denied his application for disability pension benefits as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The [Committee] has reviewed your claim for Disability Retirement benefits under the Laclede Gas Company Employees' Retirement Plan (\"Plan\"). The Plan requires that in order for an employee to be eligible for Disability Retirement benefits, the employee must terminate due to becoming totally and permanently disabled. The Plan Administrator must determine that the employee is totally and permanently disabled. This analysis is done after an employee (or the employee's family/legal representative) submits a written application to the Plan Administrator. If the Plan Administrator finds that the employee is totally and permanently disabled, the employee will be considered retired. Accordingly, the application for Disability Retirement must be made before/in connection with the employee terminating employment. The Committee has determined that an employee who does not apply for Disability Retirement benefits in connection with the employee's termination is not eligible for Disability Retirement benefits. You employment with Laclede Gas Company terminated on or about March 2, 2010, and your application for Disability Retirement\n   benefits did not occur until on or about May 16, 2016. You did not apply for Disability Retirement benefits in connection with your termination. Therefore, your claim for Disability Retirement benefits is hereby denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In the event you wish to appeal this decision with respect to the question of whether you [are] eligible for Disability Retirement benefits, such appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Committee by you or your duly authorized representative within 180 days after receipt of this denial. In your appeal you may request to review records and other information in the possession of the Committee which are relevant to this claim. You may also submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The Committee shall review any additional information provided in any such appeal without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Committee's review shall not afford deference to the initial adverse benefit determination. Any individual conducting the decision on review shall not be one of the individuals who made the initial adverse decision, nor the subordinates of such individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The decision on review shall be furnished in writing within forty-five days after the receipt by the Committee of the request for review, unless an extension is determined to be necessary by the Committee. If the decision of the Committee is a denial of benefits and you object to the decision of such appeal, you may file an additional appeal in accordance with Section 7.8 of the Plan. Finally, you have the right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial of an appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   If there is no appeal within the 180-day period mentioned above, the Committee's decision will be final and binding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (AR 412)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In a letter dated July 25, 2016, DaPron's counsel requested \"[a] copy of any and all summary plan descriptions, policies, certificates of insurance and other plan documents relating to your policy with Laclede Gas Company\" and other documents.

(AR 418) On August 11, 2016, Courtney Vomund, associate general counsel, enclosed a copy of the Plan and explained that \"[d]ue to the fact that the denial was on procedural grounds under the terms of the Plan, there is no documentation from medical providers related to the denial of the claim.\" (AR 454-55)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On December 7, 2016, DaPron, through his counsel, appealed this determination by filing an administrative appeal by submitting an eight-page appeal letter outlining the medical evidence supporting DaPron's disability at the time of his termination in 2010. (AR 456-63) DaPron's counsel also submitted over one thousand pages of DaPron's medical treatment records and Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") records. (AR 468-155) Neither the Committee nor Gorla reviewed the medical or SSA records submitted with DaPron's appeal letter but Gorla reviewed the correspondence that had been exchanged and the appeal letter.

Applying the abuse of discretion standard, the Court finds that, based on the administrative record before the Committee, there was more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the Committee's decision to deny disability pension benefits.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13; Answer to First Amended Complaint at \u00b6 13 (ECF No. 34 )) In May 2016, DaPron submitted an application for disability pension benefits under the Plan. (AR 410)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After interpreting the Plan to require that claims for disability pension benefits must be submitted in connection with the employee separating from employment, the Committee voted unanimously to deny DaPron's claim. (Mispagel Depo. At 16, 38-29) The Committee found that because DaPron submitted his claim more than six years after separating from his employment, his claim was untimely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   By letter dated June 20, 2016, Gorla explained how the Committee had reviewed DaPron's claim for disability pension benefits under the Plan and denied his application for disability pension benefits as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The Committee has determined that an employee who does not apply for Disability Retirement benefits in connection with the employee's termination is not eligible for Disability Retirement benefits. You employment with Laclede Gas Company terminated on or about March 2, 2010, and your application for Disability Retirement benefits did not occur until on or about May 16, 2016. You did not apply for Disability Retirement benefits in connection with your termination. Therefore, your claim for Disability Retirement benefits is hereby denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (AR 412) Because the Committee found that DaPron did not submit a timely claim for disability pension, the Committee did not assess whether DaPron had been disabled in 2010 or whether he would have qualified for a disability pension had he submitted a claim for a disability pension in connection with his termination employment in March 2010. (Mispagel Depo. at 30, 40-41)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On December 7, 2016, DaPron filed an administrative appeal, arguing that because his mental illness precluded him from filing for disability pension benefits in March 2010 when he resigned, he should be permitted to file his claim for disability pension. (AR 456-63) Gorla affirmed the Committee's interpretation of the Plan and their determination that DaPron's claim was in untimely. Gorla explained why DaPron's appeal was denied as follows: \"The Plan Administrator interprets the ... Plan provisions to require that an application for disability retirement be filed with the Plan Administrator at or around the time the Participant terminates employment.... Mr. DaPron's employment with Laclede Gas Company terminated on or about March 2, 2010, and his application for disability retirement benefits did not occur until on or about May 16, 2016[,] [n]early six years after Mr. DaPron's termination date[.]\".... Therefore, Mr. DaPron's appeal of the Retirement Board's denial of disability retirement benefits is hereby denied.\" (AR 464)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In support of its Motion, the Committee argues that there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of DaPron's disability pension benefits as the Plan does not allow a claim to be filed more than six years after the participant's separation from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   First, Section 7.1 defining disability date clearly does not allow a former employee to qualify for benefits. The section specifically requires that the claimant \"is employed\" and \"is unable\" to work. The section is written in the present tense further evidencing that the Plan allows only persons still employed to file a claim for a disability pension. Likewise, the section requires that in order for a person to qualify for benefits, there must be evidence that \"there is no work that he is able to perform available to him within the Company.\" (AR 27) Finally, Section 7.1 requires that the claimant be in \"Covered Employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Committee contends that inasmuch as DaPron voluntarily resigned in March 2010, he was not a \"Covered Employee\" in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Likewise, the SPD clearly delineates a specific time frame for the filing of a claim by requiring an employee to give at least thirty days' notice of his intent to retire and by precluding giving notice more than ninety days in advance of his retirement. Moreover, the employee must also submit competent medical evidence of his total and permanent disability. (AR 118)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, the Committee cites to Section 16.3 as precluding a former employee from filing a claim but requiring that the person be an \"Employee\" when he submits his claim in writing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 16.3 (\"An Employee or Beneficiary, or the Company acting in his behalf, shall notify the Retirement Board in writing of a claim for benefits under the Plan.\"). (AR 61)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, the Court finds and concludes that the Committee acted within the written terms of the Plan in denying DaPron's disability pension benefits, and the Committee's interpretation of the Plan was reasonable. As set forth above, the Plan clearly requires that the claimant \"is employed\" in order for a person to qualify for benefits. DaPron was not employed and had not been employed for six years when he filed for his claim for disability pension benefits. Moreover, the Committee's interpretation of the Plan does not render any plan language internally inconsistent. The Plan interpretation has been consistently applied as supported by Mispagel's testimony that that the Committee interpreted the Plan to require an employee to file an application for disability pension benefits prior to his separation from employment because if not, the employee would not be considered eligible for disability pension benefits. (Mispagel Depo. at 41-42) The Court finds that the Committee appropriately and reasonably denied DaPron's claim for disability pension benefits as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Committee Did Not Breach A Fiduciary Duty\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In Count II, DaPron asserts that the Committee breached a fiduciary duty in 2016 by refusing to take into account his medical documents showing that he was disabled at the time he separated from his employment in 2010. The Committee argues that it reasonably interpreted the Plan to bar a claim for disability pension benefits filed six years after separation from employment, and such determination was not arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Committee's refusal to consider DaPron's medical records before denying him disability pension benefits does not establish a procedural irregularity sufficient to warrant a heightened level of scrutiny for a breach of fiduciary duty, because the Committee's denial was based on DaPron's failure to file his claim six years after his separation from employment. A procedural irregularity is said to\n   exist where the plan administrator, in the exercise of its power, acted dishonestly, from improper motive, or failed to use sound judgment in reaching its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menz v. Procter &amp; Gamble Health Care Plan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702362\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/865/#p871\">\n    520 F.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (8th Cir. 2008).

Accordingly, the Committee was not required to consider DaPron's extenuating circumstances set forth in his medical records when interpreting the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court concludes that the Committee's decision to deny DaPron disability pension benefits because he failed to file for such benefits at the time of his separation from employment as required by the Plan was supported by substantial evidence. The record shows that no employee has been allowed to wait for six years after separating from employment to file a claim for a disability pension. Likewise, Mispagel testified that no participant has been allowed to submit a claim for a disability pension after terminating employment. Based on the administrative record, the Court finds that substantial evidence supports the Committee's decision to deny DaPron disability pension benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On its face, the result here may seem harsh.
