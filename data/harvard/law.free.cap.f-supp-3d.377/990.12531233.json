(\"AVC\") and Defendant/Counter-Claimant Asetek Danmark A/S. ECF Nos. 180, 186. Asetek has also filed several requests to strike. ECF No. 185. The Court will grant the motions to strike in part, grant Asetek's motion for partial summary judgment, and deny AVC's motion for partial summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court briefly sets out the nature and history of this dispute, then reviews the factual record in greater detail where relevant below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case concerns two patents, held by Asetek, that describe a liquid cooling device for the central processing unit of a computer: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,240,362 (\"the '362 patent\") and 8,245,764 (\"the '764 patent\"). ECF Nos. 180-13, 180-14. Claim 1 of the '362 patent is illustrative:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. A cooling system for a computer processing unit, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   an integrated element including a heat exchanging interface, a reservoir, and a pump, wherein\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   the reservoir is configured to receive a cooling liquid from outside the reservoir through an inlet and pass the cooling liquid to the outside through an outlet, the reservoir including an upper chamber and a lower chamber, the upper chamber and the lower chamber being vertically displaced chambers that are separated by at least a horizontal wall and fluidly coupled together by a plurality\n   of substantially circular passages, at least one of the plurality of substantially circular passages being positioned on the horizontal wall, a boundary wall of the lower chamber being formed by the heat exchanging interface;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   the heat exchanging interface is adapted to provide separable thermal contact between the processing unit and the cooling liquid such that heat is dissipated from the processing unit to the cooling liquid as the cooling liquid passes through the lower chamber of the reservoir; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   the pump is adapted to direct the cooling liquid through the upper chamber and the lower chamber of the reservoir, the pump including a motor having a rotor, a stator and an impeller having a plurality of curved blades, the impeller being positioned within the reservoir;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a heat radiator spaced apart from the integrated element, the heat radiator being fluidly coupled to the outlet and the inlet of the reservoir, the heat radiator being configured to circulate the cooling liquid therethrough and exhaust heat from the cooling liquid; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a fan configured to direct air through the heat radiator, the fan being driven by a motor separate from the motor of the pump.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ECF No. 180-13 at 18 :50-19:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The patents issued on August 14, 2012, and August 21, 2012, respectively. ECF No. 180-13 at 2 ; ECF No. 180-14 at 2. Asetek then filed two separate actions in this district against different entities (who are not parties to this action), asserting that their products infringed the patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Asetek Holdings, Inc. v. Coolit Sys. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 12-cv-04498-EMC, ECF No. 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203812089\">\n    2012 WL 3812089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (August 27, 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Asetek Danmark A/S v. CMI USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 13-cv-00457-JST, ECF No. 1 (January 31, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties agree that Asetek sent a letter to AVC dated April 30, 2014, alleging that the Liqmax 120 product and related products - sold by one of AVC's customers, Enermax - also infringed the patents. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22 ; ECF No. 186 at 20 ; ECF No. 203-12 at 2. After additional correspondence in which AVC apparently responded that it had no relationship to the Liqmax products identified, Asetek sent an email to AVC on August 2, 2014, informing AVC of its belief that \"AVC is likely selling other infringing products in the United States.\" ECF No. 203-12 at 2. Asetek's CEO testified that, in a subsequent meeting, AVC attempted to obtain a license for the patents. ECF No. 202-7 at 241 :20-243-10. AVC does not dispute that the meeting took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 30, 2014, AVC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, requesting declaratory relief that its products - which it designated as the K7 and K9 products - did not infringe the '362 or '764 patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. AVC claimed that (1) the products did not infringe the patents-in-suit; and (2) the patents-in-suit were invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203812089\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After proceedings not directly relevant here, the case was transferred to this Court in December 2016. ECF No. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 14, 2017, Asetek filed counter-claims for direct, induced, contributory, and willful infringement, alleging that at least the AVC K7127N, K7 1.5, and K9, and Riotoro Bifrost 120Ti/240 products infringed the '362 and '764 patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 73. On January 17, 2018, the Court issued its claim construction order. ECF No. 105. Asetek subsequently amended its infringement contentions to cover the AVC 1.5, 2.0, K7127N, and K9 products (the\n   \"accused products\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 125, 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 30, 2018, Asetek filed a motion for partial summary judgment on AVC's invalidity and equitable defenses. ECF No. 180. Asetek also filed a motion to strike portions of AVC's expert's non-infringement report. ECF No. 185. AVC filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on December 6, 2018, on a series of issues, including its liability for induced, contributory, or willful infringement, as well questions related to extraterritorial sales and Asetek's compliance with product marking requirements. ECF No. 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Asetek has filed a separate motion to strike portions of Dr. Clarksean's rebuttal non-infringement report. ECF No. 185. In the course of briefing on the motions for summary judgment, Asetek also requested that the Court strike Dr. Clarksean's declaration attached in support of AVC's motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 203 at 20-23, and Dr. Joshi's declaration attached in support of AVC's opposition to Asetek's motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 205 at 5-8. The Court resolves these disputes before reaching the merits of the parties' summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) requires a witness who is \"retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case\" to provide a written report containing, among other things, \"(i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them,\" and \"(ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). In addition, Rule 26(e)(1) imposes an obligation on a party \"who has responded to an interrogatory\" to \"supplement or correct its disclosure or response (A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rule 37, in turn, \"gives teeth to Rule 26's disclosure requirements by forbidding the use at trial of any information that is not properly disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodman v.

Dr. Clarksean's Rebuttal Non-Infringement Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Asetek requests that the Court strike from Dr. Clarksean's report the theory that the K9 and M5 products do not infringe the '764 patent because the pump stator of those products is not \"isolated from the cooling liquid.\" ECF No. 185 at 6. Asetek argues that AVC failed to disclose this theory in its answer to Asetek's August 2, 2017 interrogatory requesting the factual and legal bases for AVC's non-infringement contentions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 185-2 at 3-4; ECF No. 185-3. Instead, Asetek contends, AVC advanced this theory for the first time in Dr. Clarksean's rebuttal report, which it served on October 26, 2018. ECF No. 185 at 8; ECF No. 185-1 \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its opposition, AVC first argues that it was not required to supplement its interrogatory response with these details, and therefore did not violate Rule 26(e)(1). ECF No. 199 at 10-11, 13. AVC reasons that, because Asetek bears the burden of proof on the question of infringement, AVC did not need to \"divulge its fully-crystallized non-infringement arguments upon which [it] would rely at trial, because the deadline for AVC's rebuttal expert report on non-infringement served that purpose.\" ECF No. 199 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties rely on cases from this district suggesting opposite conclusions. AVC cites\n   <em>\n    MediaTek Inc. v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the court rejected a request to strike validity theories that were provided in an expert rebuttal report, but not disclosed in response to an earlier interrogatory. No. 11-CV-5341-YGR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202854773\">\n    2014 WL 2854773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Cal. June 20, 2014). The\n   <em>\n    MediaTek\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that, \"by propounding [its] interrogatory right on the heels of serving its invalidity contentions, [the accused infringer] was trying to get a preview of what [the patentee's] rebuttal report would say.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Deeming this \"gamesmanship,\" the court stated that it would \"not penalize [the patentee] for providing its response - its expert rebuttal report - at the time appointed by the Court's scheduling order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Asetek, on the other hand, relies on\n   <em>\n    Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co.\n   </em>\n   , where the court granted a similar request to the one Asetek makes here, faulting Samsung for its \"failure to disclose its non-infringement theories prior to the rebuttal expert reports,\" given that Samsung \"had a duty to amend its answers to contention interrogatories in a timely manner.\" No. 11-CV-01846-LHK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203155574\">\n    2012 WL 3155574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds the rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Samsung\n   </em>\n   more persuasive. A rule that an accused infringer may wait until its expert rebuttal report to set forth theories of non-infringement for the first time would forfeit the benefits of contention interrogatories. As the Federal Circuit has explained, such interrogatories \"serve an important purpose in helping to discover facts supporting the theories of the parties. Answers to contention interrogatories also serve to narrow and sharpen the issues thereby confining discovery and simplifying trial preparation.\"\n   <em>\n    Woods v. DeAngelo Marine Exhaust, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514693\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1272/#p1280\">\n    692 F.3d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Because \"answers to contention interrogatories evolve over time as theories of liability and defense begin to take shape .... Rule 26(e) requires that as theories mature and as the relevance of\n   various items of evidence changes, responses to interrogatories, and particularly contention interrogatories, be corrected or supplemented to reflect those changes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514693\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1272/#p1280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds nothing in the text of this district's patent rules relieving parties arguing non-infringement of that obligation. Rather, the rules were \"designed to require parties to crystallize their theories of the case early in the litigation and to adhere to those theories once they have been disclosed\" - not defer the disclosure of those theories until the expert rebuttal stage.\n   <em>\n    MLC Intellectual Prop., LLC v. Micron Tech., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-03657-SI,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206046465\">\n    2018 WL 6046465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2018) (quoting\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l Ltd. v. Monolithic Power Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805486\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1355/\">\n    467 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1366 n.12 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court next turns to AVC's arguments that it did not violate Rule 26(e)(1) because the information was conveyed to Asetek through alternate means. AVC asserts that it satisfied its obligations by providing physical copies of the K9 and M5 products in a timely manner. ECF No. 199 at 11. AVC cites no support for this position and, in any event, providing an example of the accused product plainly does not substitute for answering a contention interrogatory.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514693\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1272/#p1280\">\n    692 F.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . AVC likewise cannot fulfill its obligation by now point to a single table indicating that the K9 had a submersible pump, ECF No. 200-4 at 2, which was not produced in response to the interrogatory. The post-hoc identification of a needle in a haystack does not cure AVC's failure to respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apple, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203155574\">\n    2012 WL 3155574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, AVC points to its Rule 30(b)(6) witness's deposition testimony on September 18 and 19, 2018. ECF No. 199 at 12. Assuming without deciding that this testimony could ever suffice to meet AVC's discovery obligations, the Court finds that it does not do so in this instance. Huang stated that the K9 differed from the 1.5 product because it \"uses an immersive pump.\" ECF No. 183-4 at 101 :24-102:2. When asked to explain the term \"immersive pump,\" Huang responded, \"I'm not - I don't know the detailed technology\" and gave no additional explanation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:20-22. This exchange does not disclose in any discernible manner the basis for Dr. Clarksean's theory. In addition, AVC mischaracterizes Asetek's motion as conceding that Asetek gleaned this theory from Huang's testimony. ECF No. 199 at 12. Asetek offered unrebutted evidence that it did not understand AVC's position at the time,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 185-1 \u00b6 11, and stated that once it received Dr. Clarksean's rebuttal report, it understood Huang's testimony as revealing that \"AVC intended to argue, even when it was developing its products, that the K9 and M5 do not infringe\" based on the theory at issue. ECF No. 185 at 12. The thrust of this discussion is when\n   <em>\n    AVC\n   </em>\n   knew of its own theory, not when Asetek came to understand it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court further agrees with Asetek that Huang's testimony that AVC used this \"entirely different pump\" to \"try to design around Asetek's patents\" provides unrebutted evidence that AVC was fully aware of this theory at the time it received the interrogatory. ECF No. 183-4 at 120 :2-4; 120:20-22. Accordingly, AVC cannot claim that it did not discover this theory until it received Dr. Tilton's infringement report. ECF No. 199 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that AVC violated its Rule 26(e)(1) obligations by failing to disclose its theory in response to Asetek's contention interrogatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court further finds that AVC has not carried its burden to demonstrate that its failure was not \"substantially justified or harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3953783\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1197/#p1213\">\n    548 F.3d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) ). As just noted, the record reveals that AVC has been aware of this\n   theory since the outset of this litigation. AVC offers no justification for failing to include it in its interrogatory responses, but instead attempts to show that other actions conveyed the same information, i.e., that its failure was harmless. As explained above, AVC's argument that it had no obligation to supplement its responses lacks merit. Therefore, AVC's conduct was not substantially justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nor was it harmless. By waiting until its expert rebuttal report to disclose its theory, AVC prevented Asetek from conducting fact discovery on the issue, thereby hampering its expert discovery as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apple, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203155574\">\n    2012 WL 3155574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"Although expert discovery had not yet concluded, the experts were in effect locked-in to the factual record as of the time fact discovery closed and could not test the factual basis for the newly amended contentions by conducting additional discovery.\"). It also deprived Asetek of the ability to fully question AVC's deposition witnesses on the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The factors that AVC cites do not overcome this prejudice. AVC did not give Asetek prior notice of its position through other means, as discussed above. AVC's reliance on Dr. Tilton's ability to locate the stator when asked in his deposition, ECF No. 199 at 16-17, is not responsive to the material dispute identified by Asetek as to what portions of the accused products actually constitute the \"stator.\" ECF No. 185 at 13. It is no answer, as AVC suggests, ECF No. 199 at 18, that Asetek can request leave to submit a supplemental expert report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K. P. v. Santa Clara Cty.

Cal. Mar. 19, 2015) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To the extent the Joshi declaration opines that there were general industry-level trends \"to increase the effectiveness and minimize the volume of the heat dissipation module in the field of thermal management,\" ECF No. 194-1 \u00b6 2, the Court finds that it is a reasonable synthesis of the background sections of his invalidity report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 180-2 at 9-11 ; ECF No. 180-4 at 9-11. But the Joshi declaration goes much further, stating his opinion\n   that pursuit of this \"miniaturization\" or \"integration\" goal would have motivated a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine prior art references in the specific combinations set forth in the remainder of his expert report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 194-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-8, 12-14, 17-19, 26-29. There is simply no corresponding discussion of miniaturization as applied to any prior art in Dr. Joshi's report. This absence is underscored by the fact that the Joshi declaration makes no attempt to link its contents to any specific discussion in the report, instead citing to the portions of Dr. Joshi's deposition testimony that are helpful to AVC.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that these opinions impermissibly exceed the scope of Dr. Joshi's expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Joshi declaration also opines on whether various prior art references disclose certain limitations of the patents-in-suit. As this Court has previously held, an invalidity report must be specific as to which item of the prior art discloses which element of the disputed claim.\n   <em>\n    Asetek Danmark A/S v. CMI USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-00457-JST,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206997670\">\n    2014 WL 6997670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2014) (striking post-report testimony that a new item of the prior art disclosed a thermal exchange chamber). It is difficult to see how, absent some clarifying function, Dr. Joshi's opinions regarding the connection between the prior art references and claim limitations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-16, 23-25, are not either unnecessarily redundant with his expert report or impermissibly beyond its scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court perceives only one such potential ambiguity. Dr. Joshi's expert report uses the following diagram from Schmidt\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 180-2 at 35 ; ECF No. 180-4 at 29 ; ECF No. 180-20 at Fig. 1. The diagram displays two labeled vertical supply manifolds (32), each of which has connected horizontal bars. The horizontal bars attached to the righthand manifold are labeled as atomizer plates (34), while the opposing set of horizontal bars are not. Nonetheless, a review of Schmidt suggests that both sets are intended to represent atomizer plates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   No. 180-20 at 2 :63-65 (\"The supply manifolds 32 have an atomizer plate 34 in communication with each outlet of the supply manifold ....\"). Dr. Joshi's expert report, however, at times treats the letfhand set as \"horizontal portion[s] ... of the supply manifolds 32\" rather than as a separate item. ECF No. 180-2 at 35 ; ECF No. 180-4 at 29. Arguably, then, Dr. Joshi's designation of the supply manifolds (32) as a heat exchange \"chamber\" - as depicted in his report - encompasses the atomizer plates (34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to the remaining opinions in the Joshi declaration, AVC has provided no explanation why their omission from Dr. Joshi's report were either substantially justified or harmless, and so by default it has not carried its burden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3953783\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1197/#p1213\">\n    548 F.3d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, it is doubtful that these failures were substantially justified given that AVC had access to all the relevant information regarding the patents and prior art at the time Dr. Joshi submitted his report. Nor can AVC show that it was harmless to add new theories in support of its invalidity claims at summary judgment, particularly now that discovery has closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rowe Int'l Corp. v.

Ill. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, the Court strikes the entire Joshi declaration except its opinions that (1) miniaturization is a generally applicable industry trend and (2) Schmidt's atomizer plates (34) disclose a heat exchange chamber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Dr. Clarksean's Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As discussed below, even were the Court to consider the challenged opinions in Dr. Clarksean's declaration, ECF No. 186-2, it would still deny AVC's motion for summary judgment on those points. The Court therefore denies Asetek's request as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Del. 2011) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   AVC first contends that item 34 of Schmidt, the atomizer plates, discloses a thermal exchange chamber. ECF No. 194 at 18-20. As discussed above, the Court finds that Dr. Joshi's report, as elaborated on in his deposition testimony, sufficiently sets forth this theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 180-2 at 35 ; ECF No. 180-4 at 29 ; ECF No. 180-20 at Fig. 1. Asetek does not contest on the merits whether item 34 discloses this limitation, ECF No. 205 at 9-10, and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to AVC, a reasonable jury could so find.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, AVC notes that item 12 of Schmidt, the pump, is surrounded by a housing (40) that constitutes a second thermal exchange chamber. ECF No. 194 at 20 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 180-2 at 33 ; ECF No. 180-20 at Fig. 2. AVC reasons that Schmidt discloses a configuration in which the pump and its housing are vertically separate from the atomizer plates, thereby creating an upper and lower chamber. ECF No. 194 at 20. The Court disagrees with Asetek that this theory is new. Dr. Joshi's report states that because \"[t]he pumps 12 may also be disposed outside of the reservoir 14 .... it is obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the art at time of the invention to relocate the pump\n   12 such that the housing 40 is higher than the supply manifolds 32.\" ECF No. 180-2 at 33, 53-54, 65-66. As discussed above, a jury could reasonably conclude that this reference to the supply manifolds included the connected atomizer plates. Thus, Dr. Joshi espoused that general theory, although his precise language indicates that perhaps it is better treated as a modification to Schmidt. Resolving this factual question in AVC's favor, a jury could reasonably find that Schmidt disclosed an upper and lower chamber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, AVC continues, Schmidt discloses how these vertically spaced chambers could be separated by a horizontal wall. ECF No. 194 at 20. AVC posits that the pump (12) may be positioned above the manifold/atomizer plate assembly, and seemingly, that the uppermost atomizer plate (34) provides the horizontal wall between the pump and lower atomizer plates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175739\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/337/#p347\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   AVC cannot rely on this contention because it is not found in the Joshi report.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 180-2 at 33, 54, 66. Rather, the report opines that the horizontal wall element is disclosed by Yu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36, 57, 69.

Differences Between Prior Art and Claims at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Besides the \"separated by at least a horizontal wall\" limitation, the parties do not dispute for the purposes of this motion the various other differences between Schmidt and the '362 patent identified in Dr. Joshi's report. Dr. Joshi opines, for instance, that Schmidt does not disclose \"an integrated liquid cooling device for a central processing unit\" in claim 1, but that Yu does so. ECF No. 180-2 at 35. Similarly, Dr. Joshi states that neither Schmidt nor Yu disclose \"the heat exchanging interface is removably coupled to the reservoir\" limitation in claim 6, but that \"Atsuo teaches such limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than reviewing those differences in detail, the Court turns to the crux of the parties' dispute: whether AVC has provided any evidence of a motivation to modify Schmidt with the other prior art limitations contained in Dr. Joshi's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Motivation to Combine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In order to survive summary judgment, AVC must provide evidence that, viewed through the lens of summary judgment, clearly and convincingly shows \"that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the prior art in the way claimed by the [ '362 ] patent claims at issue and had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    Pers.

Asetek contends that, even under this flexible standard, AVC's showing is defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, Asetek argues that the patents concern technology of sufficient complexity that expert testimony of motivation is required.

ECF No. 180 at 17-19. The Federal Circuit has held that a jury cannot reasonably find the motivation to support obviousness based solely on testimony that \"is generic and bears no relation to any specific combination of prior art elements,\" and that \"fails to explain why a person of ordinary skill in the art would have combined elements from specific references in the way the claimed invention does.\"\n   <em>\n    ActiveVideo Networks, Inc. v.

AVC acknowledges as much. AVC's contention that \"motivation to combine prior art references need not be expressly stated\" in Dr. Joshi's report misreads the case law. AVC cites cases holding that \"suggestion or motivation need not be expressly stated\" in the\n   <em>\n    sources of motivation\n   </em>\n   , such as prior art references,\n   <em>\n    B.F.

In support, Asetek has produced unrebutted evidence that AVC sold and shipped its products to customers within the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 203-7 at 3-5. This far exceeds the showing in\n   <em>\n    Power Integrations II\n   </em>\n   , where the accused infringer argued that it sold its products \"overseas into a worldwide distribution system with no knowledge of where its chips will ultimately end up.\" 843 F.3d at 1333. Nevertheless, the Federal Circuit held there that a jury could reasonably find an affirmative step based on evidence that the infringer designed and marketed its products for the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1333-34. Here, where it is undisputed that AVC knowingly sold and shipped products directly to the United States, a jury could even more readily find the requisite affirmative step. AVC entirely bypasses this element of Asetek's argument, focusing instead on whether the instruction manuals constitute an affirmative step inducing infringement of the '362 patent's method claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Turning to those claims, Asetek argues that there is evidence that \"AVC has specifically designed, promoted, and sold the product[s] for [the] sole and very purpose\" of practicing the methods of claims 17-19. ECF No. 203 at 17-18. Further, Asetek contends, there is a disputed issue of fact whether AVC prepared or provided input into the user manuals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court need not reach the issue of AVC's role in the manuals because Asetek's first argument is sufficient for it to survive summary judgment on this point. A jury can reasonably find \"an affirmative act\" encouraging infringement from the infringer \"incorporating components whose sole purpose is to cause the [products] to operate in a manner that infringes the [asserted] patents under normal circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Ricoh Co. v.

Cir. 2008). Here, Asetek's expert report indicates that the accused products \"necessarily infringe the relevant claims,\"\n   <em>\n    Power Integrations\n   </em>\n   , 843 F.3d at 1333, because their \"only function\" is \"to perform [Asetek's] patented methods,\"\n   <em>\n    Ricoh\n   </em>\n   , 550 F.3d at 1343 ; ECF No. 203-18 \u00b6\u00b6 449-450. As explained in greater detail when discussing contributory infringement, there are triable issues of fact whether that is the case. Accordingly, the Court holds that a jury could reasonably find that AVC took affirmative steps to induce direct infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, the Court finds sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that AVC acted with the requisite knowledge.

In its opposition, Asetek concedes that the licensing agreement at least \"arguably granted Corsair [the licensee] the right to make or have made products covered by Asetek's patents without any marking requirement.\" ECF No. 203 at 23. Accordingly, Asetek now disclaims any right to infringement damages prior to January 2, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court therefore turns to the effect of the CNTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In the CNTS, Asetek agreed not to sue Corsair for its sale of products supplied by CoolIT. ECF No. 187-6 at 19. At the time, Asetek was pursuing infringement claims against CoolIT and affiliated entities in this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Asetek Holdings, Inc. v.

The CNTS was structured so that its effective license to Corsair lasted only as long as that question remained unsettled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 187-6 at 19-20. Stated differently, the CNTS at most licensed the sale of products that Asetek could not prove it had a right to mark. Accordingly, the Court holds that unmarked products sold under the auspices of the CNTS do not undermine Asetek's compliance with \u00a7 287(a)'s marking requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Because there are genuine disputes of fact whether Asetek marked substantially all of its patented articles, the Court denies AVC's motion for summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Finally, AVC seeks summary judgment on the priority date of the '362 patent and AVC's liability for Asetek's lost profits. ECF No. 186 at 26-31. In response, Asetek contends that neither issue is in dispute in this case and urges the Court not to decide them, given that those issues may arise as actual disputes in other litigation involving these patents. ECF No. 203 at 29. AVC's reply identifies no claim in this case that would be impacted by the resolution of these issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 207 at 18.

The Court GRANTS Asetek's partial motion for summary judgment that (1) the claims of the '362 and '764 patents are not invalid and (2) that AVC's equitable defenses to infringement fail. Finally, the Court DENIES AVC's partial motion for summary judgment on induced infringement, contributory infringement, willful infringement, extraterritorial sales, and marking compliance.
