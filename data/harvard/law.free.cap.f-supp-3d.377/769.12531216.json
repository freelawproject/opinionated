LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs have filed this putative class action against certain contractors who were involved in designing and implementing an automated fraud detection system brought on line in 2012 by the State of Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA). They also have sued certain functionaries and decisionmakers of the UIA in their individual capacities. The plaintiffs allege that they were accused wrongfully of making fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits, and then had their property confiscated by the State with no notice, all by means of the automated system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST) has subpoenaed the plaintiffs' records from the UIA (which are the main focus of the plaintiffs' claims) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, but the UIA has refused to produce any records. It has filed a motion to quash the subpoena, now before the Court, contending the information sought is privileged, and the burden of producing the information is excessive. The parties argued the motion orally on February 6, 2019, at which time plaintiffs' counsel agreed that none of his clients have asserted or intended to assert a privilege over these records for purposes of this case and would consent to disclosure. The Court allowed the parties and the UIA to file supplemental briefs, which have been received. Finding no merit in the UIA's arguments, the Court will deny the motion to quash the subpoena and order prompt compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs have alleged that the UIA, with the help of outside contractors SAS Institute Inc., FAST, and CSG Government Solutions, designed and implemented a flawed automated system that examined unemployment compensation claims to detect fraud. The system, known as the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS), searched for discrepancies in the records of unemployment compensation recipients after coordinating collection procedures with employers, other state agencies, and the federal government. MiDAS's electronic \"cross-checking\" mechanism alerted the UIA when income was\n   reported for claimants or when some activity affected a claimant's eligibility for benefits. MiDAS, using an \"income-spreading\" formula, would calculate a claimant's weekly income based on an average of total income received over a quarter, and then \"spread\" the income over each week in the quarter, regardless of whether a claimant truthfully reported no income in one or more weeks. If the system identified a discrepancy between an employer record and corresponding information in the claimant's application, the claimant's file was flagged as a potential case of misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A \"flag\" caused MiDAS to initiate an automated process that transmitted questionnaires to the claimant, seeking a response within ten days. The questionnaires posed multiple choice questions that resulted in a robo-determination of fraud if a triggering answer were selected. The questionnaires were to be shared with claimants via their Michigan Web Account Management System (MiWAM) accounts, but in some instances, the system failed to send the questionnaires, or the questionnaires were sent to dormant MiWAM accounts. And because MiDAS reviewed claims from the six preceding years, questionnaires were sent to claimants whose benefits had expired already. The system did not provide any other means of notifying claimants of the questionnaire's existence. And a claimant received no other notice of the alleged fraud determination. Failure to respond or selecting one of the triggering answers in the questionnaire resulted in a default determination that the claimant knowingly and intentionally misrepresented or concealed information to receive benefits unlawfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once a default determination was made, an initial letter demanding repayment and assessing penalties and interest was to be issued to the claimant. There was no opportunity to appeal or otherwise contest the finding at that point in the process. The statement sent to claimants indicated that penalties for non-payment may include interception of the claimant's state and federal income tax refunds, garnishment of wages, and legal collection activity through a court of law. Other consequences, discussed in other opinions filed in this case, followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cahoo v. SAS Inst.

The documents sought are defined as \"[a]ll Communications and Documents related to\" those individuals, \"including all Documents and Communications related to their unemployment claims, adjudications, appeals, and re-adjudications.\" FAST also asked for \"[a[ ]ll Communications and Documents related to the Project that were transmitted to the Auditor General.\" Subpoena, ECF No.164-2, PageID.4010-11.

At a status conference, counsel for the plaintiffs, who professed authority to speak for the six additional identified claimants, stated that those individuals would consent to disclosure. Apparently, the UIA had not received written consent forms when it filed its motion, nor had it received them when it filed its supplemental brief. But those consents ought to provide an easy resolution to the UIA's quandary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The UIA has devoted much of its brief to explaining why it filed the motion to quash the subpoena. Another federal regulation says that if the agency receives a subpoena for UC records, it must file such a motion\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   \"a court has previously issued a binding precedential decision that requires disclosures of this type, or a well-established pattern of prior court decisions have required disclosures of this type.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20603.7\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 603.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Ohio Oct. 17, 2017), counters that it matters not that the cases favoring disclosure come from other district courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court need not resolve that territorial question. The issue raised by this argument is whether the UIA is required to file the motion to quash. It has done so, perhaps taking a cautious approach. Even if it had been excused from taking that step by a pattern of decisions that addressed its obligation to disclose, its decision to contest the subpoena moved it past the consideration mandated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20603.7\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 603.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 603.7 provides no guidance on how such a motion to quash a subpoena, when filed, should be decided.

The impact of the MiDAS system's functioning and operation - the triggers, notices, responses, and robo-adjudication - all have a direct bearing on the plaintiffs' claims and FAST's defenses. The information is discoverable and ought to be produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B. Undue Burden\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The UIA separately argues that requiring production of unemployment records for the six non-party individuals subjects the UIA to an undue burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(d)(3)(A)(iv). \"Undue burden is to be assessed in a case-specific manner considering 'such factors as relevance, the need of the party for the documents, the breadth of the document request, the time period covered by it, the particularity with which the documents are described and the burden imposed.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re: Modern Plastics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516938\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/244/#p251\">\n    890 F.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am.

FAST disagrees, arguing that the claimant files for the non-party individuals are \"relevant\" and \"proportional to the needs of the case.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). As noted earlier, the relevance of the individuals' files is manifest, and as discussed below, the cost of production is not exorbitant. The UIA says generally that the files may contain \"voluminous pages of data that are not relevant or informative.\" But they have not identified any particulars to support that hypothetical argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, although the UIA is not a named defendant in this case, its employees certainly are. The claimants' files constitute the corpus of the claims against the defendants. Shielding the State defendants from the information that is contained in those documents simply because the request may be overinclusive is not in the interest of justice. It is premature to expect the defendants to refine their request at this early stage of discovery. The UIA has not demonstrated that the request as\n   to the non-party individuals is unduly burdensome, when the files are readily available in its database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The UIA also says it should not be required to produce the information because it would be costly to assemble. The thrust of this argument, however, is not so much that it should be relieved from compliance altogether, but that it should not be required to shoulder the costs of production. In support, it points to language in the federal regulation that allows the imposition of conditions on production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20603.7\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 603.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"Only if such motion [to quash a subpoena] is denied by the court or other forum may the requested confidential UC information be disclosed, and only upon such terms as the court or forum may order, such as that the recipient protect the disclosed information and pay the State's or State UC agency's costs of disclosure.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   One condition identified in section 603.7(a) - protection of the information - has been addressed by the parties already.

And the information sought is simply not available from other sources. The UIA maintains the information for the precise purpose of administering its unemployment compensation system, which is the system the plaintiffs allege it wrongfully administered, causing the injuries in this case. All of the parties to this case will benefit in having the information available to them, as the files presumably will illustrate the manner in which MiDAS was used to make the fraud determinations as to the claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The cost of production is uncertain. The UIA apparently has endeavored to maximize its estimate, tendering an affidavit by administrative law specialist Teresa Burns, who states that the costs to respond to the subpoena with delivery via an encrypted flash drive or encrypted email will be $ 8,238.03 and $ 8,218.80, respectively. In its supplemental brief, it mentioned an interim cost estimate to produce the documents in paper form, although the subpoena specifies a different mode of production. It is not clear why the disclosure must be\n   made in an encrypted format. It also is not clear based on Ms. Burns's affidavit that the costs were calculated in accordance with the requirements of section 603.8(c). The Court asked the parties to confer and refine the cost estimates. But based on the supplemental briefs, it appears that the parties are still at an impasse on such details as the mode of production and the overall costs of compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   FAST argues that (1) the UIA is not a disinterested party because it was substantially involved in the system that spawned this litigation; (2) the UIA can bear the costs of production as easily as the entity defendants; and (3) because this case is of public importance, the UIA has a duty to bear the costs of compliance. The UIA responds that that (1) it does not have an interest in the outcome of the case; (2) there has been no showing that the Agency can bear the costs more readily than FAST; and (3) while the case may be of some public importance, this factor alone does not tip the scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is disingenuous for the UIA to argue that it has no interest in this litigation. As the Court noted at the hearing, production is not unduly burdensome. The cost estimate of approximately $ 8,000, even with the encryption charge, is rather modest. In terms of proportionality, these are core documents and are necessary for the lawsuit to be defended and most likely prosecuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nonetheless, the cost of production is essentially a taxpayer expense, and the federal regulations contemplate at least some measure of cost sharing. So does Rule 45.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Modern Plastics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516938\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/244/#p251\">\n    890 F.3d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f an objection is made and the court orders the non-party to comply, the court must protect a non-party from\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   expenses resulting from compliance.\") (emphasis added). But until a firm estimate of the cost of producing the material in a usable format is presented, the Court will not allocate the specific expenses of production. Those expenses will be shared by all the parties in the case, including the State defendants. And the absence of a firm estimate will not delay production of the documents that have been subpoenaed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There is no privilege that excused the UIA from responding to the subpoena.
