Obercian's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 41 ) and Plaintiff Aerotek, Inc.'s (\"Aerotek\") Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 48 ). This employment dispute arises from Obercian's December 1, 2016 departure from Aerotek and subsequent employment at Beacon Hill Staffing Group, LLC (\"Beacon Hill\"). The Motions are ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2018). For the reasons outlined below, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Obercian's Motion and deny Aerotek's Cross-Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 13, 2014, Obercian began working for Aerotek, a Maryland company that provides recruiting and staffing services to companies across the United States. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, ECF No. 37 ). Aerotek hired Obercian for the position of Operations Manager of Clinical Solutions for its affiliate, Aerotek Scientific, LLC, in Wayne, Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). In her role as Operations Manager, Obercian focused on the life sciences field and oversaw particular clients and engagements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; McKenna Dep. 13:4-7, May 30, 2018, ECF No. 44-2 (sealed)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On her first day of employment with Aerotek, Obercian signed an Employment Contract (the \"Agreement\") that contained three provisions which form the core of this dispute: a Noncompete Provision, a Nonsolicitation Provision, and an Early Resolution Conference (\"ERC\") Provision. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-29). Under the Noncompete Provision, Obercian may not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [F]or a period of eighteen (18) months [after termination of employment] ... directly or indirectly engage in or prepare to engage in, or be employed by, any business that is engaging in or preparing to engage in any aspect of AEROTEK's Business for which [Obercian] performed service or about which [Obercian] obtained Confidential Information during the two (2) year period preceding termination of [Obercian's] employment, within a radius of fifty (50) miles from the office in which [Obercian] worked at the time [Obercian's] employment terminated or any other office in which [Obercian] worked during the two (2) year\n   period preceding termination of [Obercian's] employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24; Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. [\"Def.'s Mot.\"] Ex. 4 [\"Agreement\"] \u00b6 3, ECF No. 41-4 ). The Nonsolicitation Provision prohibited Obercian from:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [c]ommunicat[ing] with any individual, corporation or other entity which is a customer of AEROTEK and about which [Obercian] obtained Confidential Information or with which [Obercian] did business on AEROTEK's behalf during the two (2) year period preceding termination of [Obercian's] employment for the purpose of (i) entering into any business relationship with such customer of AEROTEK if the business relationship is competitive with any aspect of AEROTEK's Business for which [Obercian] performed services or about which [Obercian] obtained Confidential Information during the two (2) year period preceding termination of employment, or (ii) reducing or eliminating the business such customer conducts with AEROTEK.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 24; Agreement \u00b6 4). The ERC Provision required Obercian to give Aerotek:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [W]ritten notice at least fourteen (14) days prior to (a) violating [the Noncompete Provision or Nonsolicitation Provision]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and/or (b) challenging the enforceability of [the Noncompete Provision or Nonsolicitation Provision] (including subparts), and will participate in a mediation or in-person conference if requested to do so by AEROTEK within thirty (30) days of such a request in order to help avoid unnecessary legal disputes. Should [Obercian] fail to comply with this Paragraph's notice or mediation/in-person conference requirement, [Obercian] acknowledges and agrees that such failure will serve as a waiver of [Obercian's] right to challenge the enforceability of [the Noncompete Provision or Nonsolicitation Provision].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 27; Agreement \u00b6 13). In September 2014, Obercian transitioned to the role of Practice Lead. (McKenna Dep. 13:19-14:13). As Practice Lead, Obercian acted as a liaison between various Aerotek departments to support customers' needs. (McKenna Dep. 13:11-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 1, 2016, Obercian resigned from Aerotek. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 30). Around December 5, 2016, Obercian began working for Beacon Hill as a Division Director of the Beacon Hill Pharma division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). In her position at Beacon Hill, Obercian recruited and placed individuals in positions with Beacon Hill clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). She worked in Beacon Hill's King of Prussia, Pennsylvania office, which is located approximately ten miles from her former Aerotek office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Aerotek sued Obercian. (ECF No. 1 ). On June 5, 2018, Aerotek filed an Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 37 ). Aerotek's Amended Complaint alleges a single Count: breach of contract (Count I). (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-48). Aerotek seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 20, 2018, Obercian filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint and Counterclaim (ECF No. 40 ). Obercian brings a single Counter claim, alleging a violation of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (the \"MWPCL\"), Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. [\"L &amp; E\"] \u00a7\u00a7 3-501\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2018) (Count I). (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-12, ECF No. 40 ). Obercian seeks monetary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Obercian filed her Motion for Summary Judgment on July 13, 2018. (ECF No. 41 ). On August 3, 2018, Aerotek filed an Opposition and Cross-Motion for Summary\n   Judgment. (ECF No. 48 ). Obercian filed an Opposition and Reply on August 24, 2018. (ECF No. 52 ). Aerotek filed a Reply on September 24, 2018. (ECF No. 58 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First,\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   adopts\n   <em>\n    Allegis\n   </em>\n   's conclusion without any discussion of how the factual distinctions between the cases affect the court's consideration of the provision's enforceability. Specifically, the employee in\n   <em>\n    Allegis\n   </em>\n   founded his own company, whereas the employee in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   left Aerotek to work for a preexisting business.\n   <em>\n    Allegis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , therefore, implicate different proscriptions in the Noncompete Provision-the first and second proscription, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allegis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202612604\">\n    2014 WL 2612604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012806598\">\n    2015 WL 12806598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Second, both\n   <em>\n    Lajiness\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   depart from a fundamental principle of contract interpretation: \"courts should avoid interpreting contracts so as to nullify their express terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Calomiris v.

Interpreting the second proscription of the Noncompete Provision as a mere prohibition on holding a position with a competitor that involves the same work the employee did at Aerotek could make the first proscription superfluous. Under this reading, both proscriptions would bar an ex-Aerotek employee from engaging in the same work that they performed at Aerotek. The Court, therefore, declines to adopt the reasoning of either\n   <em>\n    Lajiness\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that the second proscription in the Noncompete Provision is overbroad, and therefore, unenforceable. But this is not the end of the Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \" '[B]lue pencil' excision of offending contractual language without supplementation or rearrangement of any language is entirely in accord with Maryland law.\"\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

The first prohibits direct or indirect engagement in the same area or type of work that an employee engaged in while at Aerotek. The second prohibits an employee from working for a business that engages in the same type of work that the employee was engaged in while at Aerotek, regardless of the employee's role at that business. The second proscription is not illustrative of or indivisible from the first. Instead, it is separated from the first proscription by the word \"or,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating that these are two distinct promises.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1425051\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/116/435/#p438\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (reasoning that the word \"including\" indicates that two parts of a restrictive covenant form one indivisible promise). Because the first proscription and the second proscription are two distinct promises, the Court will excise the offending provision-the second proscription-from the Noncompete Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After this excision, the Noncompete Provision reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [F]or a period of eighteen (18) months [after termination of employment] [Obercian] shall not directly or indirectly engage in or prepare to engage in any aspect of AEROTEK's Business for which [Obercian] performed services or about which [Obercian] obtained Confidential Information during the two (2) year period preceding termination of [Obercian's] employment, within a radius of fifty (50) miles from the office in which [Obercian] worked at the time [Obercian's] employment terminated or any other office in which [Obercian] worked during the two (2) year period preceding termination of [Obercian's] employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus, under the remaining proscription in the Noncompete Provision, Obercian is prohibited from working in the same areas that she either worked in or learned confidential information about during her last two years at Aerotek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Factual Enforceability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Obercian next argues that no genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding her alleged violation of the remaining proscription in the Noncompete Provision. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A genuine dispute of material fact exists as to the scope of Obercian's duties at Aerotek, and, therefore, the overlap, if any, between her work at Aerotek and her position at Beacon Hill. Obercian argues that at Beacon Hill she focused solely on staffing, (Obercian Dep. 214:1-4), and that the work she performed at Aerotek centered on \"a service that's provided to companies in the research industry that is completely separate and different in every way, distinguished in every way from staffing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   53:1-5; 53:11-13). She emphasized that Aerotek was providing \"platforms and systems and processes and documents. And that is what made us quite different from staffing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   55:10-13; Obercian Decl. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 53-1 (sealed)). She testified that she \"[r]arely\" used her expertise to evaluate candidates while at Aerotek, (Obercian Dep. 56:8-15; 59:5; 312:7-17; 314:11-17), and that she \"didn't recruit\" candidates, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   56:18-19; Obercian Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Instead, she focused on the \"kind of solutions and services\" that Aerotek clients required. (Obercian Dep. 59:5-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Aerotek, for its part, underscores that Obercian was responsible for reviewing the resumes of individuals who might be able to fill positions with Aerotek's clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   59:22-61:2; 312:18-23). Aerotek also emphasizes that Obercian was \"a mentor to [the] recruiting team,\" and that she chose to sit in proximity to the recruiters to \"interact and understand\" their work, in order to \"act as a mentor and advise them.\" (McKenna Dep. 34:21-22; 35:15-36:5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Aerotek, the Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to Obercian's job duties during the relevant time period. As a result, the Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that Obercian did not violate the Noncompete Provision. Accordingly, the Court will deny Obercian's Motion as to the Noncompete Provision. The Court next addresses the facial and factual enforceability of the Nonsolicitation Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Nonsolicitation Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Obercian challenges the Nonsoliciation Provision in the Agreement as overbroad and, therefore, unenforceable. She also contends that no genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding her alleged breach of the provision. The Court first considers whether the Nonsolicitation Provision is enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Facial enforceability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Obercian argues that the Nonsolicitation Provision is unenforceable because it prohibits Obercian from soliciting both actual and prospective Aerotek customers.

The parties agree that the term \"customers\" is not defined in the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Obercian argues that Aerotek defines customer to include a prospective customer, even if Aerotek never bills these prospective customers for any service. (Billingslea Dep. 14:5-20, May 30, 2018, ECF No. 44-1 (sealed)). Aerotek counters that it would defer to the dictionary definition of customer. (Billingslea Dep. 51:6-52:2, May 30, 2018, ECF No. 49-12 (sealed)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In this case, a reasonably prudent person would likely understand the term \"customer\" to have a single meaning: someone who has conducted business with Aerotek. Because the Agreement's language is clear, and, compellingly, because Aerotek does not argue that the Nonsolicitation Provision should apply to prospective customers, the Court concludes that the Nonsoliciation Provision does not apply to prospective customers. Because Obercian does not challenge the facial enforceability of the Nonsolicitation Provision on any other grounds, the Court further concludes that the Nonsolicitation Provision is enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Factual Enforceability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Obercian argues that no genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding her alleged breach of the Nonsolicitation Provision. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Nonsolicitation Provision bars Obercian from communicating with any Aerotek customer that she either learned confidential information about while at Aerotek, or that she did business with on Aerotek's behalf during the two years prior to her departure. (Agreement \u00b6 4). The provision does not, however, bar all communications. It only bars communications with such Aerotek customers under two circumstances: (1) when the communication is made for the purpose of \"entering into any business relationship\" that is competitive with any aspect of Aerotek's business that the employee either worked in, or about which the employee obtained confidential information during the two years preceding the employee's departure; or (2) when the communication aims to \"reduc[e] or eliminat[e] the business such customer conducts\" with Aerotek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Aerotek alleges that Obercian violated the Nonsolicitation Provision by meeting with Alcobra Pharma (\"Alcobra\"), an Aerotek customer, while working at Beacon Hill. Obercian does not dispute that she worked with Alcobra while she was employed at Aerotek, or that she subsequently met with Alcobra when she was employed by Beacon Hill. (Obercian Decl. \u00b6 16). She contends, however, that this meeting did not violate the Nonsoliciation Provision because she did not meet with Alcobra for the purpose of entering into a business relationship with Alcobra or for reducing or eliminating Aerotek's business with Alcobra. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-16). Aerotek counters that Obercian identified Alcobra as a prospective client of Beacon Hill, and therefore, she violated the Nonsoliciation Provision by meeting with them. (Obercian Dep. 286:4-289:20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to Aerotek, there exists a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Obercian met with Alcobra for the purpose of soliciting business while working for Beacon Hill, and, as a result, violated the Nonsolicitation Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The parties also dispute whether Obercian violated the Nonsoliciation Provision by conducting business, on Beacon Hill's behalf, with Immunocore, an Aerotek\n   customer that Obercian allegedly learned confidential information about during her time at Aerotek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Obercian raises a twofold objection to the evidence Aerotek submitted in support of this alleged violation. Obercian argues: (1) the Court should not consider the declaration of Samantha Spieller (the \"Spieller Declaration\") and related evidence because Aerotek submitted this evidence after the Court's discovery deadline, thereby depriving Obercian of the opportunity to respond to this evidence; and (2) Aerotek has not established that Obercian obtained confidential information; instead, Aerotek demonstrates that Obercian could have accessed confidential information. The Court addresses Obercian's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Obercian maintains that the Court should not consider evidence Aerotek submitted after the close of discovery. Specifically, Obercian notes that Aerotek designated Kevin McKenna as its Rule 30(b)(6) corporate representative who would discuss the work Obercian performed at Aerotek during the two years preceding her departure, not Spieller. (Am. Notice of Rule 30(b)(6) Dep., ECF No. 53-2 ). Obercian contends that McKenna was unprepared for his deposition and unable to provide specific information regarding Obercian's alleged work for Immunocore. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McKenna Dep. 40:17-45:8). To supplement McKenna's testimony, and after the close of discovery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aerotek submitted the Spieller Declaration\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support its contention that Obercian accessed confidential information about Immunocore. In her declaration, Spieller states that she gave Obercian information about Immunocore. (Spieller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11-12, ECF No. 49-11 (sealed)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aerotek has not provided the Court with any explanation for the belated submission of Spieller's Declaration and the documents Spieller references. Nor does Aerotek explain why it did not produce this evidence prior to the discovery deadline or identify Spieller as a potential witness. Because Obercian did not have an opportunity to challenge this evidence during discovery and Aerotek has proffered no explanation for its tardiness, the Court will not consider the Spieller Declaration, or the documents referenced in the Spieller Declaration, in resolving this Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 37(c)(1) (\"If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence\n   on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spotswood v.

Aerotek counters that Obercian had access to two proprietary databases-the RWS database and Salesforce databases-that contain confidential information. (McKenna Dep. 78:21-79:9). But McKenna stated that he did not know what specific information Obercian accessed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   78:9-17). McKenna also noted that \"everyone\" at Aerotek should access RWS \"at some point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   31:1-4). In addition, Aerotek submitted an email chain that demonstrated Obercian offered to speak about Immunocore during a business development call. (Obercian Dep. Ex. 29, ECF No. 49-1 at 270 (sealed)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the email does not demonstrate whether Obercian had access to confidential information about Immunocore, or whether she was merely well-versed on Immunocore's market performance. Thus, viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to Aerotek, there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Obercian accessed confidential information on Immunocore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Obercian violated the Nonsolicitation Provision in her interactions with Immunocore. A genuine dispute of material fact exists, however, as to Obercian's contact with Alcobra. Accordingly, the Court will deny Obercian's Motion as to the Nonsolicitation Provision. The Court now turns to the enforceability of the ERC Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Early Resolution Conference Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Obercian argues that the ERC Provision is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, and therefore, unenforceable.

In\n   <em>\n    Cheek\n   </em>\n   , the Court reasoned that allowing consideration in the underlying contract to remedy a lack of consideration for an arbitration clause would preclude the court \"from ever finding an arbitration agreement invalid for lack of consideration when performance of a contract has already occurred, no matter how illusory the arbitration agreement was.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 669. The same reasoning applies here.

If Obercian fails to comply with either the ERC Provision's notice requirement or Aerotek's request for mediation, she waives any right to challenge the enforceability of the Noncompete and Nonsolicitation Provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ERC Provision contains no parallel requirement that Aerotek submit to mediation at Obercian's request, or a commitment on Aerotek's part to mandatory mediation.

Discretionary performance bonuses are not earned until an employee has performed in a satisfactory manner throughout the entire performance and evaluation period and a bonus amount, if any, has been determined. Accordingly, if separated employees have part of their compensation associated with a discretionary performance bonus, they are eligible to earn and receive such bonus only if they are actively employed throughout the entire performance and evaluation period. Employees whose employment is separated prior to the end of a performance and evaluation period are not eligible for a discretionary performance bonus, because such bonuses are not determined or earned until the conclusion of the performance and evaluation period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (Pl.'s Cross-Mot.

Ex. A, ECF No. 49-1 at 189 (sealed)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Obercian counters with her\n   2016 Compensation Letter, which sets forth an \"EBR Bonus Potential\" of $ 30,000.000 and, in great detail, outlines the sliding scale of goals that must be achieved in order to earn the bonus. (Def.'s Opp'n Pl.'s Cross-Mot. [\"Def.'s Opp'n\"] Ex. O [\"2016 Compensation Letter\"], ECF No. 53-7 (sealed)). Exhibit A to the 2016 Compensation Letter identifies four goals-Clinical Solutions Aggregate Spread, Clinical Solutions PIT spread, New Start/New Spread, and 8 New Client Wins-that account for 30%, 30%, 20%, and 20% of the $ 30,000.00 EBR Bonus Potential, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The 2016 Compensation Letter makes no mention of Aerotek retaining discretion over the bonus. Furthermore, the four identified goals cumulatively account for 100% of the EBR Bonus Potential, leaving nothing to Aerotek's discretion. By its plain language, therefore, the 2016 Compensation Letter provides no indication that Obercian's bonus is discretionary.

The Noncompete Provision only prohibits Obercian from engaging in the type of work that she performed at Aerotek during the two years preceding her departure. Obercian's last day at Aerotek was December 1, 2016, so only her work from December 1, 2014 to December 1, 2016, is relevant for this analysis.
