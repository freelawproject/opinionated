On January 3, 2018, ISDH denied the application. On January 22, 2018, WWHA lodged an administrative appeal. The administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a nonfinal order holding the denial erroneous, but on December 18, 2018, the ISDH Appeals Panel, the agency's \"ultimate authority\" under Indiana administrative law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204-21.5-1\">\n    Ind.

ISDH predicated its initial denial on its determination that \"WWHA failed to meet the requirement that the Applicant [be] of reputable and responsible character and the supporting documentation provided inaccurate statements or information.\" Dkt. 43 Ex. 1, at 2. Specifically, \"[i]n response to [ISDH's] request to list all of the abortion and health care facilities operated by WWHA, its parent, affiliate, and subsidiary organizations, WWHA failed to disclose, concealed, or omitted information related to additional clinics.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=410%20Ind.%20Admin.%20Code%2026\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Appeals Panel elaborated that WWHA had failed to be forthcoming about its \"affiliates.\" Dkt. 67 Ex. 1, at 8. WWHA argued, and the ALJ had apparently agreed, that it had properly disclosed all of its \"affiliates\" as that term is used in the Indiana statutes governing nonprofit corporations like WWHA, Ind. Code art. 23-17. Dkt. 43 Ex. 2, at 3. Relying on those and other scattered statutes as well as a decision of the Indiana Court of Appeals, the Appeals Panel disagreed, finding that several undisclosed abortion providers were \"affiliates\" of WWHA. Dkt. 67 Ex. 1, at 9. Accordingly, the Appeals Panel held, \"[WWHA] provided inaccurate statements to ISDH in [WWHA's] supporting documentation and its license application should be denied pursuant to 410 [Ind.

Thus, even if a petition for judicial review has been timely filed by WWHA (as noted above, we have found no record of one), any decision on such petition is highly unlikely to construe that requirement, narrowly or otherwise. And if the requirement were to be addressed at all, it is highly likely to be addressed only to the extent of determining, first, whether inaccuracies in documentation supporting a license application are sufficient to sustain a finding of no reputable and responsible character, and, second, whether WWHA actually submitted inaccurate documentation-which depends in turn on the meaning\n   of \"affiliates\" as a matter of state corporations law.
