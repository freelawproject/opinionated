ROBRENO, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Kevin Goodspeed sought medical assistance from a physician for a foot injury. Defendant was a participant covered by an employee benefit plan. Under the benefit plan, Defendant received $ 82,088.36 for his medical expenses. After the medical treatment was concluded, Defendant and his wife sued the treating physician for claims premised on medical malpractice. The case against the physician was settled, resulting in Defendant and his wife receiving a net settlement of $ 304,463.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The terms of the benefit plan required subrogation of any recovery from the malpractice action, up to the amount paid by the benefit plan for Defendant's medical costs. Defendant did not repay the benefit plan, but instead deposited the net settlement proceeds into his and his wife's jointly-held bank account. The couple then made various purchases from the account, including a $ 62,000 van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As administrator of the plan, Plaintiff Board of Trustees of the National Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan (\"the Plan\") brought suit under the Employee Retirement\n   Income Security Act (ERISA) seeking reimbursement of the medical benefits it paid on behalf of Defendant pursuant to the benefit plan. In an action brought under the ERISA, the Plan can only obtain equitable relief. Accordingly, a necessary element of the Plan's claim is the existence of one or more specific funds against which an equitable lien could be attached (either because the fund itself is the \"thing\" at the heart of the equity matter, or the fund is traceable to that \"thing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court ordered bifurcated discovery, proceeding first on the issue of whether there is an appropriate fund for an equitable lien, assuming that Plaintiff had a meritorious claim. Discovery on this issue has now been concluded. Defendant has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Plan has failed to identify an appropriate fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court finds that there are specific funds against which an equitable lien could be attached through traceability, and therefore will deny Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Parties and Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant resides in Flushing, New York, and participated in the employee benefit plan administrated by the Plan. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, 8. From late-2013 to mid-2014, Defendant sought medical treatment for heel pain from Dr. Howard Rose, an orthopedist. ECF No. 27-6 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Defendant claims to have suffered injuries to his Achilles tendon arising from Dr. Rose's treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. In connection with the injuries, and under the terms of the benefit plan, the Plan paid $ 82,088.36 in medical expenses to various medical services providers on Defendant's behalf. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2016, Defendant and his wife sued Dr. Rose in state court in New York, with Defendant bringing claims of medical malpractice and lack of informed consent, and his wife bringing a claim of loss of consortium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late 2017, they settled their claims, netting $ 304,463.22 after fees and costs were deducted, and the case was discontinued by stipulation on October 6, 2017. ECF No. 27-1 \u00b6 9, Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Plan learned about the New York case during its pendency, and on March 3, 2017, notified the couple's attorney, George J. Calcagnini, Esq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Plan's lien on the proceeds of any settlement. ECF No. 27 Ex. F. Notwithstanding this correspondence, Mr. Calcagnini distributed to the couple the entire net settlement proceeds and did not submit or withhold any payment to the Plan. ECF No. 27-1 \u00b6 9 ; see also ECF No. 27 Ex G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plan filed this action on November 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. The Plan alleges that the terms of the benefit plan required Defendant to reimburse the Plan for the medical benefits paid from the proceeds of the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.

Here, Defendant uses \"separate\" to try to seed the idea that the fund must be entirely separate from anything else,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , some type of stand-alone fund. The argument is erroneous and not supported by the case law cited by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The concept of equitable relief is premised on the allegation that a defendant holds or at one time held a specific thing over which a claimant had some claim, in whole or in part; the claimant is not seeking relief from the defendant's other property (the general assets).\n   <em>\n    Montanile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 658-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If \"separation\" were a necessary fact for the imposition of an equitable lien, a claimant could never obtain such a lien over a settlement which either exceeds the amount of benefits paid or includes monies for other claims brought against a third party who provided the settlement funds. Moreover, where a defendant converts the specific thing into something else, perhaps successively several times over, the question becomes whether the defendant's current possessions are traceable to the original, specific thing. The law does not require a claimant to meet Defendant's \"separate-fund\" test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Supreme Court has spoken on the matter.

That party has no right to the fund, and cannot assert any right to the fund by conveying it to a tenancy by the entireties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Erie Cnty. v. Lamberton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1118247\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/297/406/\">\n    297 Pa. 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20A.%2086\">\n    147 A. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 (1929) (\" 'It is a familiar principle that neither a trustee nor any in privity with him can acquire any right by a breach of the trust', and tenants by entireties are in contemplation of law in privity.\" (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant calculated that under New York law, joint tenancy with rights of survivorship provides the same or similar types of protection as Pennsylvania law on tenancy by the entireties. Even if the protections were the same, as Defendant argues, it makes no difference to the outcome here because, as pointed out above, a tenancy by the entireties in this case would not shield the settlement from the reach of the equitable lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, both the $ 200,000 certificate of deposit and the $ 62,000 van are traceable to the settlement fund. Neither of these could be characterized as nontraceable items such as services, food, or travel. The fact that both items first passed through the joint account owned by Defendant and his wife does not confer \"nontraceable\" status upon these two items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Allocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Defendant argued that the lack of allocation in the settlement\n   fund defeats the equitable lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27-2 at 15. In particular, Defendant argues that the settlement fund cannot be the initial fund because there was no allocation of the settlement between the two claims brought by Defendant (medical malpractice and lack of informed consent) and the one claim brought by his wife (loss of consortium).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20A.%2086\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court rejects this argument. It is undeniable that at least part of the settlement fund was derived from Defendant's claims in the New York litigation. Therefore, an equitable lien can be attached to the settlement fund and any items traceable to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin Sprocket &amp; Gear, Inc. v. Durrette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011334180\">\n    2008 WL 11334180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (N.D. Ga. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Now that traceable assets have been identified, the Court finds that the allocation of the settlement fund is now properly at issue. Because the certificate or deposit and van are traceable to the settlement fund, the issue of allocation must now be addressed in the merits briefing at the conclusion of all remaining discovery in this case. Therefore, the Court will give the parties an opportunity to engage in discovery (including appropriate expert discovery if warranted) and will address allocation in combination with the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There is no genuine dispute of material fact concerning the existence of funds that are traceable to the settlement proceeds against which an equitable lien can be imposed. The Court finds that there are specific funds against which an equitable lien could be attached through traceability, namely the $ 200,000 certificate of deposit and the $ 62,000 van. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied, and the Plan will be granted partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The case will proceed to discovery on the issue of allocation and on the merits of Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    1st\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    May, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , upon consideration of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 27 ), and Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply Brief (ECF No. 35 ), for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   1) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 27 ) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   2) Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED;\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   3) Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply Brief (ECF No. 35 ) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   4) An in-person conference will be held to discuss scheduling for further discovery, dispositive motions, and a trial date.
