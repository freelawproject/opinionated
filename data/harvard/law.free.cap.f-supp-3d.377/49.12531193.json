On November 3, 2016, the Honorable Mark G. Mastroianni adopted a report and recommendation denying Harvard's Motion to Stay or Dismiss (Dkt. No. 23), which argued for dismissal on the basis of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction or, alternatively, that Plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a claim (Dkt. No. 77). The parties have since consented to this court's jurisdiction for all purposes (Dkt. No. 125).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 73. On June 29, 2018, Harvard filed its Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings (\"Defendant's Motion\") (Dkt. No. 140), which Plaintiffs oppose. For the reasons set forth below, the court will deny Harvard's Motion in part and grant it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because \"any new facts contained in the answer, to which no responsive pleading by the plaintiff is required, are deemed denied,\" the principle relevant\n   facts remain those asserted in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Kando v. Rhode Island State Bd. of Elections\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263258\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/53/#p58\">\n    880 F.3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1st Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Harvard, an undergraduate and postgraduate school and a recipient of federal funding, controls, maintains, and administers webpages, websites, and other internet locations on which it makes available to the general public, free of charge, a vast array of content, consisting of courses and other educational and general interest materials (Compl. at pp. 1, 7, 8, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 24, 25-28). Included within the online content are thousands of audio and audiovisual files, which communicate information aurally (Compl. at p. 1, \u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harvard creates and produces some, but not all, of the content (Compl. at p. 8, \u00b6 28). Millions of people around the world have accessed the online audiovisual content that Harvard makes freely available (Compl. at pp. 1, 8, 12, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 28, 41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that some audiovisual content appears on websites and platforms maintained and controlled by Harvard, such as Harvard Extension School and Open Learning Initiative, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Institute of Politics John F. Kennedy Jr.'s Forum, and the Woodberry Poetry Room, while some audiovisual content is presented on third party platforms such as YouTube, iTunes U, and SoundCloud (Compl. at pp. 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). Only a fraction of the online content that Harvard makes available has timely, accurate captioning (Compl. at p. 4, \u00b6 8). Some captioning is so inaccurate as to make the content inaccessible (Compl. at p. 10, \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 12, 2015, Plaintiffs filed this two-count lawsuit against Harvard. Plaintiffs claim that Harvard's failure to provide the captioning necessary to ensure effective communication and an equal opportunity for deaf and hard of hearing individuals to benefit from its online audiovisual content violates the prohibitions against disability-based discrimination codified in Section 504 and Title III (Compl. at pp. 25-29, \u00b6\u00b6 88-102). On November 3, 2016, the court denied Harvard's motion to dismiss, concluding that Plaintiffs had made out plausible claims for relief under Section 504 and Title III (Dkt. Nos. 50, 77). After Harvard answered Plaintiffs' complaint (Dkt. No. 82), the parties spent approximately a year in settlement talks and mediation to resolve or narrow the issues. When no agreement could be reached, Harvard filed this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.
