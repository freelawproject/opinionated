HAZEL, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens who entered the United States without inspection or who have been ordered removed from the United States are eligible to apply for lawful status that will permit them to reside permanently in the United States, but only after leaving the United States to complete a procedure called consular processing. This process often results in long periods of separation, and many spouses have thus chosen not to apply for lawful status. In 2016, in recognition of this problem, United States Customs and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") promulgated a rule that allowed spouses with final orders of removal to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility prior to leaving the United States to begin the consular processing procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff-Petitioner Wanrong Lin and his American-citizen wife, Plaintiff-Petitioner Hui Fang Dong (collectively, \"Petitioners\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   applied for this waiver and, on August 29, 2018, arrived at a USCIS office for a mandatory interview to confirm that their relationship was bona fide. After the interview concluded, Lin was escorted into a separate room where he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") officers. Petitioners filed a complaint and petition for habeas corpus, alleging that his arrest, detention, and removal are in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

The APA bars agency action that is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). An agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency disregards rules or regulations still in effect or departs from a prior policy without \"articulat[ing] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Defendants have thus taken a rule that was promulgated for one purpose and used it for the opposite purpose. As the\n   <em>\n    Calderon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   courts also concluded, this is precisely the kind of arbitrary and capricious behavior the APA is designed to prevent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527141\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/944/#p955\">\n    330 F.

Supp. 3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants have not, and cannot, reconcile the purpose of the DHS rule and an apparent policy of arresting and deporting applicants who arrive for their I-130 interviews. \"If left unchecked, this 'new policy' would render the provisional waiver a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528011\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/400/#p408\">\n    341 F. Supp. 3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants contend that the arrest and deportation of Lin do not violate the regulations because he has not completed the Form I-212 application for consent to reapply for admission, and thus is ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver. In promulgating the rule, DHS expressly decided that applicants are ineligible to fill out the I-212 until after the I-130 was approved, and ineligible to complete the I-601A until after the I-212 was approved.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%20536\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01 at 547-48. It was DHS's arrest and attempted removal of Lin immediately after his interview related to Form I-130 that prevented him from completing the second step of the process, Form I-212. To allow removal under these circumstances would permit the government to erect an impenetrable barrier to completion of the provisional waiver process and, indeed, to use it as a trap for unsuspecting applicants. Therefore, the Court holds that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on his claim that the arrest and attempt to remove him at the conclusion of his interview violated the Administrative Procedure Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the second prong of the preliminary injunction analysis, the Court finds Petitioners would both suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction. Mr. Lin would be asked to fend for himself in a country he has not lived in since 2002. He has no family in Shanghai, and it is unclear how he will care for himself. He would be indefinitely separated\n   from his wife and his three adolescent children. His wife would suffer both the emotional harm of being separated from her husband and raising their children alone, as well as the economic harm from losing her partner in their family-owned restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As to the third prong, the balance of the equities also tips in favor of Petitioners. They have followed DHS's own promulgated rules. Defendants suggest that Petitioners have not been diligent in their pursuit of an immigrant visa. Not so. DHS recognized, in promulgating the very rule at issue here, that the choice not to pursue an immigrant visa and the accompanying years of family separation is a reasonable choice in light of the circumstances. That Petitioners have not filed a Form I-212 during the pendency of this litigation while Lin's residence has remained uncertain, especially given their experience at the Form I-130 interview stage, says nothing about Petitioners' diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, this order is in the public interest, as it requires DHS to comport with its own rules and regulations, and bars arbitrary and capricious agency action towards vulnerable undocumented immigrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Petitioners' Motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 15, is granted. Defendants shall be preliminarily enjoined from removing Mr. Lin from the United States pending further proceedings.
