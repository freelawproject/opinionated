Western States has sued Defendant Andre Schoorl, as the individual in charge of the California Department of Industrial Relations, who it identifies as the agency in charge of implementing the test adopted by Dynamex. Western States has also named California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as a Defendant on grounds that Becerra is responsible for enforcing the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now before the Court is Defendant Becerra's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 6 ), as joined by Defendant Schoorl (ECF No. 11 ) (hereinafter \"Defendants\" unless otherwise specified). Defendants first claim that Western States lacks standing to assert its claims to enjoin application of the ABC test, and that accordingly jurisdiction is lacking under Federal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(1). Defendants then assert that because Western States cannot succeed on its preemption arguments under the FAAAA, applicable federal motor vehicle safety regulations, or the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, Western States' lawsuit fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) in any event. As set forth below, while the Court does find that Western States has standing to pursue its claim, Defendants' Motion is nonetheless GRANTED on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Western States is a nonprofit trade association with over 1,000 member companies and 5,000 affiliated member motor carriers. Western States' member carriers operate in interstate, intrastate, and foreign commerce, and range in size from single truck owner-operators, to fleets with over 350 trucks. According to Western States, given fluctuating demand for trucking services, companies have hired smaller carriers on a temporary basis for decades, and those smaller carriers frequently hire their services out to contractors and other trucking companies as independent contractors. Thousands of non-employee independent contractors are used in the industry as a result, including owner-operators who both own and drive their own equipment. In addition, the trucking industry also includes brokerage services that arrange for such independent contractors to provide transportation services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its 2018\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   decision, the California Supreme Court articulated a new standard, the so-called ABC test, in order to distinguish between employees and independent contractors for purposes of California's wage orders. Wage orders are constitutionally-authorized, quasi-legislative regulations issued by the California Industrial Welfare Commission to provide for both minimum wages and the general welfare of employees.\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    4 Cal. 5th at 914, n.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    232 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    416 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the wage orders include an alternate definition of employ as meaning to \"engage, suffer or permit to work\", however,\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   reasoned that definition also had to be considered in assessing the scope of employment under the wage orders. Finding the term to be \"exceptionally broad,\"\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   found that the suffer or permit to work standard had to be \"interpreted and applied broadly to include within the covered 'employee' category all individual workers\" reasonably viewed as working within the hiring entity's business.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    at 952-953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    232 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    416 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

That made for a more wide-range and inclusive definition of employment than had previously been applied. Accordingly, for purposes of California wage orders, and given the protective history and purpose of the suffer or permit to work standard contained therein,\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   rejected a multifactor, totality-of-the-circumstances standard for distinguishing between employees and independent contractors (which it found difficult to easily and consistently apply, particularly in advance).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 954-56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    232 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    416 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead,\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   held that, for purposes of California wage orders, the burden should be placed on the hiring entity to establish that the worker was an independent contractor under the three-part ABC test. That test requires that\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   of the following factors be established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (B) that the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (c) that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation or business of the same nature as the work performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    232 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    416 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Western States, this test fundamentally \"discarded decades of settled\n   California law\" by discarding previous precedent for assessing whether an individual is deemed an employee or an independent contractor. Compl., \u00b6 32. Western States avers that because trucking business models were developed in light of that prior precedent, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   , the implications of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   for determining employee status \"throws into question the legality of the entire trucking industry in California.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. By requiring that independent contractors not be engaged in the same work as the hiring entity, Western States claims that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   upends its members' flexibility to hire small, independent carriers, and especially owner-operators, for transportation needs. As such, according to Western States,\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   limits the ability of its members to easily obtain drivers on a short-term basis without making those drivers employees. Moreover, as a result of the additional expense attendant with conferring employee status, Western States opines that its members could be forced to raise prices, reduce services, and/or limit available routes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As indicated above, Western States' Complaint makes three primary claims. First, it contends that the ABC test adopted by\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   directly impacts the price, routes, and services of its motor carrier members, and is therefore preempted by federal law in the form of the FAAAA. Second, Western States claims that the ABC test \"on its face discriminates against out-of-state and interstate trucking companies,\" thereby violating the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66. Third and finally, Western States maintains that the ABC test is preempted in any event for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations as enacted at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300-399\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300-399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300-399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300-399\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"IBT\"), whose intervention request in this matter was granted by Order filed November 13, 2018 (ECF No. 27 ) submitted its own brief in support of Defendants' Motion (ECF No. 6 ), and that brief posits another standing argument. According to IBT, the allegations of Western States' Complaint are insufficient to confer associational standing since there has been no showing that any Western States' member has suffered or will suffer harm in the aftermath of the\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On a substantive basis, both Defendants and IBT argue that the FAAAA does not preempt\n   <em>\n    Dynamex's\n   </em>\n   interpretation of state law, since its criteria for establishing a viable independent contractor relationship has \"no more than [an] indirect remote and tenuous\" impact on prices, routes and services subject to FAAAA oversight, and consequently is not preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Californians for Safe and Competitive Dump Truck Transp. v.

Finally, with regard to Western States' claim that the ABC test adopted by\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   violates the Dormant Commerce Clause, Defendants and IBT maintain that any burden imposed on interstate commerce by the test is not excessive in relation to state interests in properly classifying employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To the contrary, Defendants submit that Western States simply seeks an advisory opinion as to whether potential\n   application of the ABC test adopted by Dynamex could violate its members' rights under federal law. While Defendants concede that a \"genuine threat of imminent prosecution\" can meet the case or controversy requirement, they maintain that this matter lacks any allegation of threatened enforcement at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

IBT, for its part, contends that Western States has failed to identify even one member who has any \"concrete plan\" to not comply with Wage Order No. 9 as construed by\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   , let alone whether there has been any specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings to demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   will be imminently enforced against that member. As such, both Defendants and IBT argue that this matter should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction given the lack of any justiciable controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Western States takes issue with these contentions. As alleged in its Complaint, it has over 1,000 member companies and another 5,000 affiliated member carriers who provide work for some 10,000 drivers, mechanics, support personnel and managers. Compl, \u00b6 1. In addition to claiming that any of those workers could initiate a misclassification claim at any point, Western States goes on to allege that the probability of such claims goes beyond mere speculation. It points out that in just one of California's 58 counties, at least seven class action lawsuits expressly based on Dynamex were filed within the first three months following issuance of the Dynamex decision. Pl.'s Opp., 4:27-5:1. Western States maintains that this flurry of complaints shows that the threat of legal liability is quite real. Moreover, and in any event, Western States goes on to claim that the circumstances of this matter show that its members \"have a concrete interest in knowing whether they need to dramatically change their business models in order to insulate themselves from liability\" in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   , particularly since they routinely use independent subcontractors as subhaulers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:12-22. According to Western States, to the extent it identifies a conflict between state and federal regulations (here the California Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   versus the strictures of the FAAAA and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations) that alone can create a justiciable controversy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Fed.

It has shown that application of the\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   ABC test not only fundamentally affects its current business model in how independent contractors are characterized, but also has already spawned litigation given the purported sea change that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   represents in terms of those relationships.

Associational Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As indicated above, in addition to supporting Defendants' claim that Western States has failed to show any real legal controversy, the IBT goes one step further in also arguing that no associational standing is present. According to IBT, an association like Western States has standing to represent its members' interests only when the operative complaint \"make[s] specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member has suffered or would suffer harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Summers v.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As indicated above, Wage Order No. 9 is the applicable wage order providing how persons employed in the transportation industry shall be paid. The definition of \"employ,\" as requiring application of the ABC test pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   , is not limited to Wage Order No. 9. Instead, that definition is also \"included in the definitions set forth in each of the other 15 wage orders governing other industries in California.\"\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    4 Cal. 5th at 926, n.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    232 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514467\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/232/1/\">\n    416 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, while Wage Order No. 9 may specifically relate to the transportation industry, the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   , which applies to all California wage orders in its application of the ABC test, does not. Consequently, Western States' attempt to distance itself from caselaw generally applicable to labor regulations, on grounds that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   specifically targets the transportation industry, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Californians for a Safe &amp; Competitive Dump Truck Transp. v.

Similar to the circumstances confronted in this matter, the parties in\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   argued that since complying with the Prevailing Wage Law would increase its labor costs and price structure, and potentially compel it to redirect and reroute equipment to compensate for lost revenue, the provisions of the FAAA should preempt application of the Law. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that this kind of effect upon prices, routes and services was \"indirect, remote, and tenuous\" and did not \"frustrate[ ] the purpose of deregulation by acutely interfering with the forces of competition\" so as to result in FAAAA preemption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713416\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/1184/#p1189\">\n    at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   , Western States argues here that wage orders, which apply across the gamut of California industry, should be preempted simply because they happen to also include transportation workers. Also like\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   , Western States claims that because application of California's wage laws may affect the cost of transportation services, they should be subject to FAAAA preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Mendonca's\n   </em>\n   holding that any such effects did not rise to the level of triggering preemption given their only indirect impact on prices, routes and services is equally applicable to this case. Western States' argument that\n   <em>\n    Mendonca\n   </em>\n   should be distinguished on grounds it involves prevailing wage laws of general applicability is unavailing given the fact that the linchpin of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   (that employment for purposes of California wage orders should be determined by reference to the ABC test) applies across the board as to all wage orders even though the particular wage order before the Court (Wage Order No. 9 ) happened to involve only the transportation industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Another more recent Ninth Circuit decision is also instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Dilts v. Penske Logistics, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n    769 F.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014), the court held that the FAAAA did not preempt California's meal and rest break laws. As\n   <em>\n    Dilts\n   </em>\n   noted, '[t]he sorts of laws that Congress considered included barriers to entry, tariffs, price regulations and laws governing the types of commodities that a carrier could transport,\" with\n   Congress \"not intend[ing] to preempt generally applicable state transportation, safety, welfare or business rules that do not otherwise regulate prices, routes, or services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n    at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Dilts\n   </em>\n   consequently rejected any notion that the FAAAA preempted rules like prevailing wage laws or safety regulations on grounds that they are \"several steps removed from prices, routes or services, \"even if employers must factor [such] provisions into their decisions about the prices that they set, the routes that they use, or the services that they provide.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n    at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And, as\n   <em>\n    Dilts\n   </em>\n   concluded, \"even if state laws increase or change a motor carriers' operating costs, broad laws applying to hundreds of different industries with no other forbidden connection with prices, routes, and services -- that is, those that do not directly or indirectly mandate, prohibit, or otherwise regulate certain prices, routes, or services-are not preempted by the FAAAA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266766\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/637/\">\n    at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotes and citations omitted). Here, too,\n   <em>\n    Dynamex's\n   </em>\n   interpretation of the term \"employ\" as used in California across-the-board wage orders does not run afoul of the FAAA simply because that interpretation may have some effect on transportation services.

Again, the Court disagrees. Nothing in either\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   or Wage Order No. 9 precludes a motor carrier from hiring an independent contractor for individual jobs or assignments; instead, all that is required if a carrier chooses to so hire is that the wage order's requirements be satisfied.
