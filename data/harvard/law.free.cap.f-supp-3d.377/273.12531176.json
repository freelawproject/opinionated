INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In February of 2015, Emilio Gonzalez claims that he spoke out against corruption and discrimination in the Office of the Comptroller of the City of New York. His conduct put a bullseye on his back within the office and inspired his coworkers to launch a campaign to end his fourteen-year career in civil service. In response to his coworkers' behavior, Mr. Gonzalez filed this lawsuit, asserting-among others-claims of discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. The defendants have moved to dismiss. Because Mr. Gonzalez fails to allege that the conduct that he complains of was motivated by his membership in protected groups, the defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mr. Gonzalez Uncovers the Alleged Corruption, Reports it, and is Demoted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Emilio Gonzalez (\"Mr. Gonzalez\" or \"Plaintiff\") is a Hispanic-American male who is over forty years old\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and has been working in the Office of the Comptroller of the City of New York (the \"Comptroller's\n   Office\") for over fourteen years. Dkt. No. 76, Third Amended Complaint (the \"TAC\"), at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Mr. Gonzalez began his career in the Comptroller's Office around December 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Since about February 1, 2016, and at all times relevant to this case, Mr. Gonzalez has faced various medical problems, including herniations in his spinal column, which affect his neck, back, and waist and make it difficult to work behind a desk for any appreciable length of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Comptroller's Office, Mr. Gonzalez worked with a number of co-workers who he has named as defendants in this suit. At all times relevant to this case, Mr. Gonzalez worked with Seunghwan Kim, who was an assistant comptroller and Mr. Gonzalez's superior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Mr. Gonzalez also worked with James Cox, who served as the director of settlements and adjudications in the Bureau of Law and Adjustments (the \"Bureau\") of the Comptroller's Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Mr. Cox was subordinate to Mr. Kim, but senior to Mr. Gonzalez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Gonzalez also worked with Katherine Reilly, who served as deputy director of settlements and adjudications in the Bureau of the Comptroller's Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Ms. Reilly was also senior to Mr. Gonzalez, but subordinate to Mr. Cox and Mr. Kim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15,17. The final employee that Mr. Gonzalez worked with and identifies as a defendant is Maria Maglio-Scotti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Ms. Maglio-Scotti was chief of the motor vehicles unit in the Bureau of the Comptroller's Office and was also senior to Mr. Gonzalez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Gonzalez contends that the conduct giving rise to his case derives from his efforts to shine a light on corruption within the Comptroller's Office. Specifically, Mr. Gonzalez alleges that, from the time that Mr. Kim was appointed assistant comptroller through January 2016, he personally informed Mr. Kim that employees in the Department of Education (the \"DOE\") were intentionally altering claim dispositions to reflect higher rates and speed of performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. Mr. Gonzalez also asserts that he told Mr. Kim that DOE employees were in the habit of settling cases without proper investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Kim failed to act and said that \"he did not care so long as the cases were moving and the statistics were high.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Gonzalez alleges that Mr. Cox and Ms. Reilly also exhibited indifference to misdeeds within the Comptroller's Office. With respect to Mr. Cox and Ms. Reilly, Mr. Gonzalez claims \"it was clear ... that they wanted cases disposed of, not based on merit but upon political considerations[,] which made the Comptroller look good in the eyes of the public and his political supporters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2015, Mr. Gonzalez was promoted and became the division chief of the property damage division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Mr. Gonzalez contends that Mr. Kim asked him to terminate Luc Pierre, a black employee in the division, \"because he was making more money than any of his colleagues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Gonzalez claims that he asked Mr. Kim whether he wanted to fire Mr. Pierre because of his race and-according to Mr. Gonzalez-Mr. Kim responded, \"yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Mr. Gonzalez found nothing to warrant Mr. Pierre's termination and, furthermore, because he \"felt it would be wrong to terminate [him] simply because\" of his race, Mr. Gonzalez refused to fire Mr. Pierre as Mr. Kim instructed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During his tenure as division chief, Mr. Gonzalez also represents that he brought practices within the Comptroller's Office that he believed were prohibited by the New York City Charter, the NYC Conflicts of Interest Board, and by state and federal laws to the attention of Mr. Kim,\n   Mr. Cox, and Ms. Reilly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. These offenses, Mr. Gonzalez claims, included: i) settling claims without proper investigation; ii) expending, approving, or otherwise authorizing the payment of taxpayer money on claims that were not properly investigated; iii)settling claims that \"amounted to a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   scheme to buy taxpayer votes\"; and iv) reprimanding, punitively reassigning, or otherwise disciplining employees based on their race.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Mr. Gonzalez further claims that he continued to inform Mr. Kim of corruption by employees within the DOE team and that he refused to settle claims based on the \"personal interests, career ambitions, and political considerations of his supervisors,\" including Mr. Kim and Mr. Cox.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In August 2015, Mr. Gonzalez applied for a position as the deputy director of settlements and adjudications, but was not selected for the job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. Mr. Gonzalez claims that a \"white female candidate with inferior credentials\" was selected for the position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 15, 2016-less than one year after his promotion to division chief-Mr. Gonzalez was demoted to a position with a reduced salary and lesser responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. In this demoted position, Mr. Gonzalez claims that he that he had fewer responsibilities than when he began in the Comptroller's Office in 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Gonzalez posits that he was demoted because he refused to settle claims based on political considerations and without proper evaluation and investigation and, furthermore, because he refused to terminate Mr. Pierre as Mr. Kim had directed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Before his demotion in January 2016, Mr. Gonzalez never had any performance issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. Although he was told that his demotion represented a broader reorganization strategy, Mr. Gonzalez argues that the Comptroller's Office has a pattern and practice of discriminating against older employees of color.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Gonzalez Files Complaints About Alleged Retaliation and is Eventually Terminated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 21, 2016, Mr. Gonzalez filed an internal grievance (the \"Internal Grievance\") against Mr. Kim, Mr. Cox, Ms. Reilly, and Ms. Maglio-Scotti (collectively, the \"Individual Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. In the Internal Grievance, Mr. Gonzalez accused the Individual Defendants of unlawfully discriminating and retaliating against him for his refusal to participate in the fraudulent and improper settlement of claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Two months later-in November 2016-Mr. Gonzalez filed an unlawful discrimination and retaliation complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"EEOC Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 13, 2017, Mr. Gonzalez filed a complaint with the Department of Investigations of the City of New York (the \"DOI Complaint\") alleging that his supervisors unlawfully discriminated against him and that employees of the Comptroller's Office engaged in corruption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After his filing of the Internal Grievance, the EEOC Complaint, and the DOI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Complaint, Mr. Gonzalez claims that Mr. Kim, Mr. Cox, Ms. Reilly, and Ms. Maglio-Scotti \"began to act together and in concert to harass and intimidate [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. On February 13, 2017-one month after Mr. Gonzalez filed the DOI Complaint-the Individual Defendants filed charges of employment misconduct (the \"Employee Misconduct Charges\") against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Mr. Gonzalez represents that the substance of the Employee Misconduct Charges consisted of incidents that date as far back as November 2, 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. The Individual Defendants also took Mr. Gonzalez to trial at the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (the \"OATH\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. Mr. Gonzalez contends that the Individual Defendants brought the Employee Misconduct Charges against him in hopes of ending his civil service career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 30, 2018, the City terminated his employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mr. Gonzalez's Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Gonzalez filed this lawsuit in August 2017, after the Individual Defendants filed the Employee Misconduct Charges. In the operative complaint-the TAC-Mr. Gonzalez asserts a litany of claims and names the Individual Defendants in their personal and official capacities as well as the City of New York (the \"City\") as defendants (collectively, the \"Defendants\"). In count one, Mr. Gonzalez asserts a claim of retaliation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1983 as well as the New York City Human Rights Law (the \"NYCHRL\") against the Individual Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC at \u00b6\u00b6 58-67.

In\n   <em>\n    Duplan v.

The Second Circuit reached this conclusion because it found that \u00a7 1983 already provided a remedy against state actors and that therefore, \"there is no reason to infer from the rights-conferring language of \u00a7 1981(c) that it creates an additional, and duplicative, remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516720\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/612/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516720\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/612/#p621\">\n    at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants ask this Court to dismiss the litany of claims Mr. Gonzalez asserts under \u00a7 1981 on these grounds. Mr. Gonzalez raises two counterarguments in response. First, Mr. Gonzalez contends that\n   <em>\n    Duplan\n   </em>\n   only requires the Court to dismiss the claims that he asserts against the City, not against the Individual Defendants because, he contends,\n   <em>\n    Duplan\n   </em>\n   's holding is limited to municipalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 87, Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (\"Plaintiff's Opposition\") at 6. On this point, the Court disagrees. In\n   <em>\n    Duplan\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit made clear that \" \u00a7 1981 does not provide a separate private right of action against\n   <em>\n    state actors.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516720\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/612/#p621\">\n    888 F.3d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Municipal employees, such as the Individual Defendants in this case, are state actors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roddini v. City Univ. of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 02 CIV. 4640 (LAP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20435981\">\n    2003 WL 435981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2003) (explaining that \"state employment has generally been deemed sufficient to render the [individual] defendant a\n   state actor\"). Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Duplan\n   </em>\n   's holding applies to the Individual Defendants and bars Mr. Gonzalez from asserting claims under \u00a7 1981 against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As his second counterargument, Mr. Gonzalez argues that\n   <em>\n    Duplan\n   </em>\n   does not preclude him from asserting claims under \u00a7 1981 against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Opposition at 6. Again, this argument falls short. In\n   <em>\n    Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"the express action at law provided by \u00a7 1983 for the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and law, provides the exclusive federal damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1981 when the claim is pressed against a state actor.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p735\">\n    491 U.S. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p735\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p735\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   has been interpreted to encompass not only governmental entities, but also individuals sued in their individual capacities who are also state actors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whaley v.

Accordingly, Mr. Gonzalez is barred from asserting claims under \u00a7 1981 against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims that Mr. Gonzalez asserts under \u00a7 1981 in counts one through seven is GRANTED. The Court denies Mr. Gonzalez leave to replead these claims because any attempt to replead would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advanced Magnetics, Inc. v.

As an initial matter, Mr. Gonzalez abandoned these claims. In their Memorandum of Law, Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's claims against the City under \u00a7 1983 because he failed to plead that the challenged actions were part of a municipal policy, practice, or custom, or that any of the Individual Defendants were municipal policymakers, as required under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Sept. 29, 2017). The Court follows the same approach here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To state a claim of discrimination under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege two elements: \"(1) the employer discriminated against him (2) because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Isbell v.

Here, even assuming-favorably to Mr. Gonzalez-that the TAC adequately pleads a claim for discrimination based on his race or age under \u00a7 1983, his claims against the Individual Defendants fail because he does not allege that they were personally involved in any alleged constitutional deprivations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lovick v.

The TAC provides the greatest detail with respect to Mr. Kim, but still fails to allege his personal involvement in any of the constitutional deprivations that Mr. Gonzalez claims that he experienced. As explained above, Mr. Gonzalez alleges that Mr. Kim instructed him to fire Mr. Pierre because of his race and, furthermore, that he disparately treated older, non-white employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 41-42,45-47. Still, the TAC does not allege that Mr. Kim was personally involved in Mr. Gonzalez's demotion, in his failure to be promoted, or in any other conduct that can be construed as discriminatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC at \u00b6\u00b6 35-38. The other allegations that Mr. Gonzalez describes that involve Mr. Kim are cursory, non-specific, and, therefore, fail to adequately plead his personal involvement. Mr. Gonzalez contends, for example, that \"the Comptroller's Office ha[d] a pattern and practice of discrimination against older employees of color, especially since [Mr.] Kim became an [a]ssistant [c]omptroller.\" TAC at \u00b6 41. Similarly, Mr. Gonzalez contends that Mr. Kim \"aided and abetted [his] demotion and salary cut.\" TAC at \u00b6 42. These allegations do not adequately plead Mr. Kim's personal involvement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guzman v.

Accordingly, Mr. Gonzalez's claims asserting discrimination under \u00a7 1983 against the Individual Defendants fail and Defendants' motion to dismiss the discrimination claims articulated in counts two and five against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities is granted.

With respect to the denied promotion in August of 2015 and the demotion in January of 2016, Defendants contend that Mr. Gonzalez cannot present these as incidents of retaliation because they occurred before he complained of any unlawful discrimination or retaliation, thereby negating any inference of retaliatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Memorandum at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In response, Mr. Gonzalez contends that he engaged in two additional protected activities that Defendants fail to recognize. First, Mr. Gonzalez contends that he engaged in protected activity in February of 2015 when he refused to comply with Mr. Kim's directive to fire Mr. Pierre because of his race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Opposition at 11. Second, Mr. Gonzalez argues that he engaged in protected activity each time that he \"brought to the attention of his supervisors between August 2015 and January 2016 the improper settlement of claims and the fact that many of the beneficiaries of these settlements were Caucasian.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As such, Mr. Gonzalez rejects Defendants' claim that the August 2015 failure to promote and January 2016 demotion lacked an inference of retaliation: it was his refusal to fire Mr. Pierre and his repeated speaking out against the discriminatory settlement of claims in the Comptroller's Office that served as a predicate for the adverse actions that he suffered in February 2015 and January 2016. The Court agrees that Mr. Gonzalez has alleged that he engaged in protected activity by refusing to comply with Mr. Kim's order to fire an employee because of his race and by allegedly opposing his supervisors' discriminatory practices in claim settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p91\">\n    801 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants argue that Mr. Gonzalez fails to satisfy the causation element of his retaliation claims even if the Court considers his alleged refusal to fire Mr. Pierre in February 2015 to be protected activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 89, Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law (\"Defendants' Reply\") at 9. Defendants do not respond to Mr. Gonzalez's second, additional basis of protected activity: his claim that he brought discriminatory practices to the attention of his supervisors multiple times between August 2015 and January 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court agrees that Mr. Gonzalez's refusal to comply with Mr. Kim's alleged instruction to fire Mr. Pierre in February of 2015 is too far in time from any of the allegedly retaliatory actions that the Individual Defendants carried out to adequately plead the causation element of Mr. Gonzalez's retaliation claims through temporal proximity on its own. Mr. Gonzalez's refusal to terminate Mr. Pierre occurred more than six months before the first retaliatory action that he complains of, which was a failure to promote.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood v.

Mr.\n   Gonzalez does not specify how frequently, or on which dates he informed his supervisors of the improper conduct.

Here, drawing all inferences in Mr. Gonzalez's favor, the window of time in which he claims that he advised his supervisors of the discriminatory claim resolution practices in the Comptroller's Office overlaps with the denial of his promotion in August 2015 and his demotion in January 2016. Accordingly, the Court concludes that he has adequately pleaded the causation prong of his retaliation claims with respect to these two allegedly retaliatory acts indirectly, by alleging that that the protected activity of repeatedly opposing discrimination was closely followed by adverse actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants also challenge the other two incidents of alleged retaliation that Mr. Gonzalez pleads because, as before, they contend that the time period between Mr. Gonzalez's protected activities and the allegedly retaliatory events is too remote to satisfy causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Memorandum at 17. Mr. Gonzalez, in response, argues that the TAC satisfies the causation element for these retaliatory actions by pleading retaliatory animus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Opposition at 11. In cases involving claims of retaliation asserted under \u00a7 1983, judges in this District have concluded that a plaintiff can allege facts that give rise to a plausible inference of retaliatory animus sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petyan v.

Aug. 15, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court reaches the same conclusion here. Before he refused to fire Mr. Pierre in February of 2015, Mr. Gonzalez contends that he never had any performance issues or was the subject of any disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 54. As explained above, Mr. Gonzalez's refusal to fire Mr. Pierre is too removed from any of the retaliatory acts that Mr. Gonzalez describes for it to satisfy the causation prong of his claims through temporal proximity alone. Nevertheless, in the TAC, Mr. Gonzalez pleads that his refusal to terminate Mr. Pierre in February of 2015 initiated a sequence of events that satisfactorily plead causation by suggesting retaliatory animus. After he refused to comply with Mr. Kim's supposed instruction to fire an employee because of his race, Mr. Gonzalez contends that Mr. Cox, Ms. Reilly, and Ms. Maglio-Scotti exhibited hostility toward him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. In February of 2015 and throughout the following months, Mr. Gonzalez alleges that he repeatedly told his supervisors of discriminatory practices and corruption within the Comptroller's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Then, in August of 2015, Mr. Gonzalez contends that he was passed over for a promotion in favor of a less-credentialed candidate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. In September of 2016, Mr. Gonzalez filed the Internal Grievance and in November 2016-after being demoted in January 2016-the Individual Defendants refused to elevate him to a position that he had had previously held for many years and for which he was qualified.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 72-76. Mr. Gonzalez then filed the EEOC charge in November of 2016. In February of 2017, the Individual defendants filed the Employee Misconduct Charges against him. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Mr. Gonzalez has adequately pleaded the causation prong of his retaliation claims by pleading facts that suggest an inference of retaliatory animus for all four of the retaliatory acts that Mr. Gonzalez pleads in his complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's claims of retaliation under \u00a7 1983 against the Individual Defendants as asserted in counts one, two, three, four, and five is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    First Amendment Retaliation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To state a claim for First Amendment retaliation, a plaintiff must plead that: \"(1) he has a right protected by the First Amendment; (2) the defendant's actions were motivated or substantially caused by [plaintiff's] exercise of that right; and (3) the defendant's actions caused him some injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The speech at issue with Mr. Gonzalez's First Amendment retaliation claim is his alleged informing Mr. Kim, Mr. Cox, and Ms. Reilly about corrupt and discriminatory practices in the Comptroller's Office.

At the same time, determining whether an employee spoke pursuant to his official duties or as a citizen often \"requires consideration of various facts that may not be before the court at the motion to dismiss stage.\"\n   <em>\n    Denicolo v.

That is the case here. The\n   Court cannot determine from the allegations in the TAC that Mr. Gonzalez's protestations-both orally to his supervisors and in the form of the Internal Grievance-were made pursuant to a\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   to report, and, therefore, were made as an employee rather than as a citizen.

Because the Court cannot, at this stage, determine that Mr. Gonzalez's complaints were part of his official duties, the Court declines Defendants' invitation to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez First Amendment Retaliation claims on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denicolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526970\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/204/#p215\">\n    328 F.Supp.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claims at the motion to dismiss stage because the court could not determine, based on the facts pleaded in the complaint, that the plaintiff spoke pursuant to her official duties and not as a citizen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   ii. Speaking on a Matter of Public Concern\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court also concludes that, in the TAC, Mr. Gonzalez alleges that his statements touched matters of public concern. Mr. Gonzalez alleges that he spoke out against the corrupt administration of the Comptroller's Office-such allegations about the misuse of the public fisc are certainly of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anemone v.

As described above, the adverse actions that Mr. Gonzalez alleges that he suffered fall within these categories.

Mr. Gonzalez had worked in the Comptroller's Office for fourteen years without incident. After he began reporting misconduct to his supervisors and filed the Internal Grievance, he alleges that he was treated with hostility, denied a promotion, and demoted. As set forth in greater detail in Section (B)(iii)(2)(a), in the TAC, Mr. Gonzalez alleges facts that satisfy the causation element with respect to his claim of retaliation for his allegedly protected speech both indirectly, through temporal proximity, and directly by alleging retaliatory animus. Because the Court concludes that Mr. Gonzalez has adequately pleaded a claim for First Amendment retaliation, Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim against the Individual Defendants is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Hostile Work Environment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Mr. Gonzalez contends that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on his race, age, and disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC at \u00b6\u00b6 85-99. The TAC does not provide facts explaining how the Individual Defendants created a hostile work environment based on Mr. Gonzalez's race or age. Mr. Gonzalez, however, provides more details with respect to his disability. As explained above, Mr. Gonzalez faced various medical problems during the period of time relevant to this case, including herniations in his spinal column.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87. In either March or April of 2016, Mr. Gonzalez contends that Ms. Maglio-Scotti-who was his direct supervisor and, he contends, aware of his medical issues with his spine, neck, back, and waist-directed him to sort through and move 54 heavy boxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88. Because his doctor had not cleared him to undertake the kind of heavy lifting that Ms. Maglio-Scotti instructed him to perform, Mr. Gonzalez contends that he asked her if he could have assistance in completing the task.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. Ms. Maglio-Scotti, Mr. Gonzalez claims, refused his request and he completed the task independently to avoid a charge of insubordination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 90-91. Because he had exhausted his leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Mr. Gonzalez represents that he sought leave without pay to allow him to recover from his disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. He contends that the Individual Defendants refused to consider him for this leave of absence and cites this as further evidence of a hostile work environment based on his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   To plead a claim for a hostile work environment under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must include facts plausibly demonstrating that \"the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Littlejohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287583\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/297/#p314\">\n    795 F.3d at 320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bermudez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246021\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/783/560/#p602\">\n    783 F.Supp.2d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, Mr. Gonzalez's hostile work environment claims based on his race and age fail.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The Court highlights the fact that Mr. Gonzalez has not pleaded this claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \"ADA\") for an alleged failure to reasonably accommodate his disability. Instead, he has stated his claim as a hostile work environment claim based on his disability under \u00a7 1983. As described above, in the TAC, Mr. Gonzalez alleges that Ms. Maglio-Scotti knew of his disability before she asked him to move the 54 boxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC at \u00b6 88. He further contends that, because\n   of his disability, he asked Ms. Maglio-Scotti whether he could have assistance in completing the task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90. After she denied this request, Mr. Gonzalez alleges that he completed the task, which further exacerbated his disability, and then Ms. Maglio-Scotti repeatedly denied his requests for leave to recover from his disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93; Plaintiff's Opposition at 13.

In the TAC, Mr. Gonzalez does not further describe the content of Ms. Maglio-Scotti's e-mails. Here, the predicate acts for Mr. Gonzalez's disability-based hostile work environment claim are Ms. Maglio-Scotti's supposed forcing Mr. Gonzalez to move the boxes by himself even though she knew of his disability and despite his request for assistance, her alleged repeated denial of his requests for leaves of absence, and, finally, her sending him numerous e-mails. Again, to plead a claim of hostile work environment, a plaintiff must allege conduct that \"is objectively severe or pervasive-that ... creates an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive....\"\n   <em>\n    Spence v.

Defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's claims under \u00a7 1981 as articulated in counts one through seven is granted. Mr. Gonzalez is denied leave to replead these claims. Defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's claims asserted against the City under \u00a7 1983 as stated in counts four and six is granted. Mr. Gonzalez is\n   granted leave to replead these claims. Defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's claims against the Individual Defendants in their official capacity under \u00a7 1983 as articulated in counts one through seven is granted. Mr. Gonzalez is granted leave to replead these claims. Defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's claims of discrimination and hostile work environment against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities under \u00a7 1983 and the NYCHRL as set forth in counts two and five is granted. The Court grants Mr. Gonzalez leave to replead these claims. Defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzalez's retaliation claims against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities under \u00a7 1983 and the NYCHRL as articulated in counts one, two, three, four, and five is denied.

When deciding a motion to dismiss, a court may consider \"facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference in the complaint,\" along with documents so heavily relied upon that they are integral to the complaint.\n    <em>\n     DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787826\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/104/#p111\">\n     622 F.3d 104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 111 (2d Cir. 2010). For a document to be integral to a complaint, \"the plaintiff must have (1) actual notice of the extraneous information and (2) relied upon th[e] document[ ] in framing the complaint.\"\n    <em>\n     Houlahan v. Raptor Trading Sys., Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 16 CIV. 9620 (PGG),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203231662\">\n     2018 WL 3231662\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2018). Exhibit A is a copy of the Notice of Charge of Discrimination concerning Mr. Gonzalez's 2016 EEOC Complaint. Mr. Gonzalez references this document and appears to have relied on it in framing the TAC.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , TAC at \u00b6 49 (\"On or about November 7, 2016, GONZALEZ filed an unlawful discrimination and retaliation complaint with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ... against his supervisors at the Comptroller's Office.\"). Exhibit B is a copy of the DOI Complaint. As with Exhibit A, it appears that Mr. Gonzalez relied on Exhibit B in framing the TAC.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 50 (\"On or about January 13, 2017, GONZALEZ filed an unlawful discrimination complaint against his supervisors with the Department of Investigations of the City of New York and complained of corruption by members of the NYC Comptroller's Office.\"). The same holds true for Exhibit D. Exhibit D is a copy of the Employee Misconduct Charges that the Individual Defendants filed against Mr. Gonzalez. The Employee Misconduct Charges are integral to the TAC.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 52 (\"On or about February 13, 2017, within one month of the aforesaid corruption/discrimination complaint, defendants filed charges of employee misconduct against GONZALEZ.\");\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 79-89, 101. Accordingly, the Court was permitted to consider Exhibits A, B, and D in deciding the Motion to Dismiss. The Court reaches a different conclusion with respect to Exhibits C and E. Exhibit C is a copy of the Department of Investigation of the City of New York's referral to the Office of the Comptroller's General Counsel. The TAC is devoid of any reference to Exhibit C. Furthermore, Defendants concede, in their memorandum in support of the Motion to Dismiss, that the TAC neither explicitly nor implicitly mentions this exhibit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defendants' Memorandum at 3, n.2. Because Exhibit C is neither integral to nor integrated into the TAC, the Court did not consider it in deciding the Motion to Dismiss. Finally, Exhibit E is a copy of the report and recommendation that Administrative Law Judge Noel R. Garcia issued at the conclusion of Mr. Gonzalez's proceedings before OATH, which recommends his termination. In the TAC, Mr. Gonzalez references that Defendants took him to trial before OATH.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 53, 79-81,101,103. Nevertheless, Mr. Gonzalez's allusions to OATH in the TAC focus on the charges that Defendants brought against him in that form. There is no indication that Mr. Gonzalez relied on the report and recommendation of Administrative Law Judge Garcia in formulating the TAC. Because Exhibit E was neither integral to nor incorporated into the TAC, the Court did not consider it in deciding the instant motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    While, in count seven, Mr. Gonzalez asserts a claim of retaliation against the City for his termination, the claim fails under \u00a7 1983 for the reasons articulated in Section (B)(i).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
