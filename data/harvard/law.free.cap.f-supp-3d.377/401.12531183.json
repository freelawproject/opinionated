FURMAN, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The United States Housing Act of 1937 establishes a complex scheme of financial assistance to low- and middle-income renters. Section 8 of the Act (\"Section 8\"), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f, provides for - among other types of aid - \"project-based assistance,\" pursuant to which the federal government, through state and local agencies, subsidizes rental units on a project- or development-wide basis. Under certain circumstances, an owner of such a development can opt out of the program and \"convert\" the development into unsubsidized, market-rate housing. When that happens, tenants may remain in their apartments and receive tenant-specific financial assistance through Section 8's \"Enhanced Voucher\" program. Section 8(t) of the Housing Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   governs how much such tenants have to pay toward their rent. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") has long interpreted that provision to mean that, when an Enhanced Voucher recipient's income falls by a certain amount, the statute prescribes that the tenant must permanently pay the same percentage of monthly income in rent that she had paid at the time her building was \"converted.\" As described below in more detail, the net effect of that interpretation is that a participating tenant whose income decreases by the requisite amount but later recovers can end up paying more than she would have paid if her income had never declined at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The question presented here - which arises on cross-motions for summary judgment and appears to be one of first impression - is whether HUD's interpretation of Section 1437f(t) is correct. Plaintiffs Robert Rodriguez, Elaine Pinnock, and Jovanny Pichardo are participants in the Enhanced Voucher program who experienced significant, but temporary, dips in their monthly income. Now that their incomes have recovered, HUD's interpretation of Section 1437f(t) requires two of them to pay more in rent than they would have had to pay had their incomes remained the same all along - a result that Plaintiffs believe is inconsistent with the statute. They bring this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against two federal Defendants - HUD and its Secretary, Ben Carson (together, the \"Federal Defendants\") - and two local Defendants - the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (\"HPD\") and its Interim Commissioner, Eric Enderlin (the \"City Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 50 (\"Am. Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 61-71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' implementation of the Enhanced Voucher program violates both\n   Section 1437f(t) and the Constitution's equal protection guarantees.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that HUD's interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the Housing Act (and thus does not reach Plaintiffs' constitutional claims). In particular, HUD misreads Section 1437f(t)(1)(D) - which sets a\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   rent payment for tenants whose incomes have declined the requisite amount - as though it imposes a minimum as well. And HUD ignores the background statutory provision that sets the rent payment obligations for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Enhanced Voucher recipients, subject to a minimum and, when applicable, a maximum. The upshot is that, by misreading the statute, HUD is requiring two of the Plaintiffs to pay more than the statute says they should have to pay. (As discussed below, the rent of the third Plaintiff is unaffected.) It follows that those Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment against the Federal Defendants. By contrast, the Court concludes that there is no basis or need to award relief separately as to the City Defendants, both because the claims against those Defendants fail as matter of law and because they are required by law to enforce the applicable federal standards, which the Court clarifies today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court begins with a description of the relevant statutory scheme and HUD's interpretation of it, and then turns to the facts relevant to each of the Plaintiffs.

The program is funded by the federal government, but administered by local public housing authorities - in New York City's case, by HPD.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Park Vill.

Congress enacted this program \"[f]or the purpose of aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(a). Generally speaking, Section 8 offers two types of housing assistance: first, \"tenant-based\" assistance, pursuant to which HUD provides vouchers to tenants, who can then use those vouchers to pay rent at the housing unit of their choosing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(f)(7), (o) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.1\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; and second, \"project-based\" assistance, pursuant to which owners of housing units enter into long-term contracts with HUD to rent the units to low-income families meeting Section 8 eligibility requirements in exchange for rental assistance from the government,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(b), (f)(6) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20886.309\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 886.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886.311.

And, the 2001 Notice provides, \"[o]nce this change in the enhanced voucher minimum rent becomes effective for a family, the enhanced voucher minimum rent for the family remains that specific percentage of income (e.g., 32 percent) and will not revert to a specific dollar amount, even if the family income subsequently increases or decreases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205.100\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205.100\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to HUD's interpretation of the statute, then, if the income of a family participating in the Enhanced Voucher program declines by fifteen percent or more, the statute locks in a new rent-payment rate that remains in place even if the family's income goes up thereafter. Moreover, because the new calculation is percentage-based, that means that a family's rent payment increases as the family's income increases, to the point where the payment can even exceed what the statutory maximum would have been had the family not experienced an intervening \"significant decline\" in income. And, if the family's rent payment increases to the point where it exceeds the actual contract rent of the family's housing unit, the family will stop being eligible for Section 8 housing aid altogether.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 72 (\"Ruiz Decl.\"), Ex. F, at 16. Thus, HUD interprets the statute governing Section 8's Enhanced Voucher program to provide\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   generous housing aid to families whose income has never dropped by fifteen percent or more than to families that have experienced such financial shocks. Put differently, a family that experiences a \"significant decline in income\" can end up receiving much less in federal housing aid than a family whose income has stayed constant or grown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Section 1437f(o), in turn, cross-references and imports the formula set forth in Section 1437a(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/#p189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(o)(2)(C). There, finally, one finds a straightforward formula: As relevant here, Section 1437a(a)(1) provides that an Enhanced Voucher recipient \"\n   <em>\n    shall pay\n   </em>\n   as rent\" the higher of \"30 per centum of ... monthly adjusted income\" or \"10 per centum of ... monthly income.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437a(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That is not the end of the matter, however. Pursuant to Section 1437f(t)(1)'s plain terms, the default formula furnished by Section 1437a(a)(1) is subject to the \"except[ion]\" set forth in Section 1437f(t)(1)(A), which, in turn, is \"subject\" to Section 1437f(t)(1)(D). Critically, though, those subsections do not prescribe a new formula for calculating an Enhanced Voucher recipient's rent in all instances. Instead, Subsection (A) provides that an Enhanced Voucher recipient may not pay \"less than the amount\" he or she was paying in rent at the time his or her building was converted, thereby setting a floor below which the rent prescribed by Section 1437a(a)(1) cannot fall.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(A). Subsection (D), in turn, provides a maximum that applies when \"the income of the assisted family declines to a significant extent\": In that instance, the family's rent share \"shall not exceed the greater of 30 percent or the percentage of income paid at the time\" of conversion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   HUD errs by reading Subsection (D) to provide a new formula that kicks in when \"the income of the assisted family declines to a significant extent\" and then applies at\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   times thereafter. On HUD's reading, that is, the formula in Subsection (D) displaces the formula set forth in Section 1437a(a)(1) for any family whose income drops by a sufficient amount. As the text and structure of Section 1437 make clear, however, Subsection (D) does no such thing. To the extent they apply, Subsections (A) and (D) impose minima and maxima, respectively - that is, they supplement, and only selectively supplant, Section 1437a(a)(1)'s default rule for a family's rent payment, which Section 1437f(t)(1) says \"shall\" apply to Enhanced Voucher assistance by way of Section 1437f(o). In other words, Subsections (A) and (D) do not displace Section 1437a(a)(1) altogether. Instead, the subsections interact: first, by setting a minimum payment for Enhanced Voucher recipients, and then by adding an\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   payment for those Enhanced Voucher recipients who experience a significant decline in income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under the statutory scheme as a whole, therefore, a recipient of Enhanced Voucher assistance \"shall pay\" the higher of thirty percent of her monthly adjusted income or ten percent of her monthly income, rounded to the nearest dollar, as a contribution towards her monthly rent obligation - unless those calculations would yield a dollar amount less than what she paid at the time her building was converted to market-rate housing, in which case, she must pay that dollar amount. Then, despite all of that, if the tenant experiences a \"significant decline\" in income, her rent payment must not exceed the greater of thirty percent of her monthly income or\n   the percentage of monthly income she had paid at the time of conversion. But because neither Subsection (A) nor Subsection (D) displaces Section 1437a(a)(1)'s general formula, Section 1437a(a)(1)'s prescribed payment obligation continues to govern, provided that it is consistent with the minima and maxima imposed by Subsections (A) and (D). At all times, that is, an Enhanced Voucher recipient's rent \"shall be\" prescribed by Section 1437a(a)(1) - except that it may not be less than the minimum prescribed by Section 1437f(t)(1)(A) and, in the event of a sufficient decline in income, more than the maximum prescribed by Section 1437f(t)(1)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rodriguez's experience illustrates both how Congress intended the statutory scheme to work and how HUD has misconstrued it. At the time Rodriguez's landlord converted his building to market-rate housing, Rodriguez's monthly rent payment was $ 671, or eighty-six percent of his monthly adjusted income of $ 780.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 35. Under the formula set forth in Section 1437a(a)(1) - which applies by way of the interplay between Section 1437f(o) and (t) and - that would mean that his rent post-conversion should have been the higher of thirty percent of his adjusted monthly income or ten percent of his unadjusted monthly income. But because of Section 1437f(1)(A), Rodriguez's rent could not be lower than $ 671 - the dollar amount that he paid at the time of conversion - and that is the rent that he was charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. A few years later, when Rodriguez's adjusted monthly income dropped to $ 352 - on HUD's view (which is not challenged here), a \"significant\" decline within the meaning of Section 1437f(t)(1)(D) - Subsection (D)'s conditional maximum kicked in. Thus, while Section 1437a(a)(1)'s formula continued to apply, he could not be required to pay more than the greater of thirty percent of his monthly income or the percentage of his monthly income that he was paying in rent at the time of conversion, which was eighty-six percent. As eighty-six percent is obviously greater than thirty percent, HUD calculated Rodriguez's new maximum rent payment to be eighty-six percent of his monthly income, or $ 303.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That much was consistent with the statutory scheme. But then Rodriguez's income went up again - to the point that eighty-six percent of his adjusted monthly income was $ 1400 (implying that his adjusted monthly income was $ 1628).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. On HUD's interpretation, Subsection (D) continued to prescribe the rent formula, and thus his rent was set at $ 1400. In doing so, however, HUD ignored the fact that the background rule - that Rodriguez \"shall pay as rent\" the greater of thirty percent of adjusted monthly income or ten percent of unadjusted monthly income - still governed, subject only to the minima and maxima set forth in Section 1437f(t)(1)(A) and (D). Thirty percent of $ 1628, rounded to the nearest dollar, is $ 488 - less than Rodriguez's conversion-date rent payment of $ 671 - so under Subsection (A), his rent payment should have been at least $ 671. Assuming without deciding that Subsection (D) continued to apply to Rodriguez even after his income increased, however, Subsection (A)'s minimum could raise Rodriguez's rent payment only to the extent that it also complied with Subsection (D)'s maximum. Subsection (D) says that Rodriguez's rent payment could not exceed the greater of thirty percent of his monthly income ($ 488) or the conversion-date percentage, eighty-six percent ($ 1400) - making the new maximum $ 1400. But $ 671 - the rent payment required by applying Subsection (A)'s minimum to the figure that Section 1437a(a)(1) would otherwise impose -\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   less than $ 1400. It therefore does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"exceed the greater of 30 percent\n   or the percentage of income paid at the time of the eligibility event for the project,\" and is thus fully compliant with Subsection (D). Based on HUD's erroneous interpretation of Section 1437f(t), therefore, Rodriguez has been paying $ 729 more in rent than he is required by statute to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Having concluded that HUD's 2001 Notice is inconsistent with the statute, the Court turns to the question of relief. With respect to the Federal Defendants, although Plaintiffs seek several forms of relief in their Amended Complaint - a declaratory judgment, an injunction requiring Defendants to recalculate Plaintiffs' rent payments, an injunction requiring Defendants to issue \"retroactive subsidy credits as appropriate\" to make up for the rent overcharge imposed on them by HUD's unlawful formula, and attorney's fees and costs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Comp. 16 - they request only a declaratory judgment in their summary judgment briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. 34; Docket No. 93 (\"Pls.' Reply\"), at 10. As to Rodriguez and Pichardo, that request is plainly well founded, as granting a declaratory judgment settles the primary legal dispute among the parties and may even \"finalize the controversy\" without further need for judicial intervention.\n   <em>\n    Dow Jones &amp; Co. v. Harrods Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092796\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/357/#p359\">\n    346 F.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359-60 (2d Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (discussing the factors to consider in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief). Furthermore, there is no indication that Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment merely as an opportunistic procedural measure or that by awarding such a judgment the Court would encroach on another sovereign legal system.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092796\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/357/#p359\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, at least in the first instance, a declaratory judgment provides a \"less formidable alternative to injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Rome, N.Y. v. Verizon Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9264205\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/168/\">\n    362 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 n.3 (2d Cir. 2004). That is, armed with a judgment declaring their rights under the Housing Act, Rodriguez and Pichardo may not need additional coercive relief. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment declaring their statutory rights against the Federal Defendants - and reserve judgment on the question of other relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to Pinnock, however, the Court concludes that declaratory relief is not warranted - at least not on the present record. While the Court has broad discretion to award declaratory relief, an exercise of that discretion must await a \"specific dispute over imminent activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Velvet Underground v. Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274444\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/890/398/#p409\">\n    890 F.Supp.2d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The record does not indicate that such a dispute exists with respect to Pinnock. As of June 2017, Pinnock was required to pay $ 603 in monthly rent - less than the dollar amount she was paying at the time of conversion because she was concededly subject to Subsection (D)'s maximum at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruiz Decl. Ex. E, at 11; Am. Compl. \u00b6 43. A proper interpretation of the statute would have yielded the same amount. Recognizing this, Pinnock alleges in the Amended Complaint that she will find herself in the same position as the other Plaintiffs \"[a]s soon as she begins collecting her Social Security benefits,\" but she does not say when that will be. Am. Compl. \u00b6 47. In the absence of such evidence, the Court is unable to determine whether her claim is \"of sufficient immediacy ... to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Velvet Underground\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274444\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/890/398/#p409\">\n    890 F.Supp.2d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court will therefore deny Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment with respect to Pinnock and dismiss her claims, both without prejudice\n   to refiling or renewal if and when her claims ripen into a \"specific dispute over imminent activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274444\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/890/398/#p409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274444\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/890/398/#p409\">\n    at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition, the Court concludes that there is no basis or need to order relief against the City Defendants, for two independent reasons.

First, Enhanced Voucher recipients are \"assisted under\" Section 1437f(t), not 1437f(o); the fact that Section 1437f(t) imports Section 1437f(o)'s background formulas by cross-reference does not change that.
