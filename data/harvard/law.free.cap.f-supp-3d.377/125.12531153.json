SMITH, Chief Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (\"Defendants' Motion\"), ECF No. 21, to which Plaintiffs have objected, ECF No. 23. For the following reasons, Defendants' Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2016, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed the Rhode Island Bridge Replacement, Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund Act of 2016 (\"RhodeWorks Act\"), R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-1 et seq., to redress the fact that 23 percent of Rhode Island bridges are \"classified as structurally deficient\" and the sources of revenue on which the state had historically relied to fund its transportation infrastructure are insufficient to fund the necessary maintenance and improvements to those bridges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-2(2) - (7). The General Assembly found that large commercial trucks \"cause in excess of seventy percent (70%) of the damage\" to Rhode Island's roads and bridges but contributed\n   \"less than twenty percent (20%) of the state's total annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure.\" R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-2(8). The General Assembly also found that, even after making several changes to the state's funding strategy, there still existed a \"funding gap between the revenue needed to maintain all bridges in structurally sound and good condition and the annual amounts generated by current dedicated revenue sources.\" R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-2(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To fill this funding gap, the General Assembly passed the RhodeWorks Act, which authorized RIDOT to collect tolls exclusively from \"large commercial trucks\" and expressly prohibited RIDOT from collecting similar tolls from any other type of vehicle, including \"passenger cars.\" R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-4, - 5. Under the Act, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (\"RIDOT\") is vested with the power to determine the locations and amounts of the tolls, while the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (\"RITBA\") collects the tolls and deposits the revenues into a special account, called the \"Rhode Island bridge replacement, reconstruction, and maintenance fund\" (\"RI Bridge Fund\"), that can be used only to fund the \"replacement, reconstruction, maintenance, and operation of Rhode Island bridges\"; surplus revenues \"shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain\" in this special account. R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 42-13.1-4, - 9 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RITBA's Mot. Intervene 1, ECF No. 16. The Act imposes a $ 20.00 daily limit on the amount of tolls that a truck making a \"border-to-border through trip\" using I-95 may be charged. R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-4(c). In contrast, the Act imposes a $ 40.00 daily limit on the amount of tolls that a truck making other trips may be charged. R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-13.1-4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first toll facilities became active in June 2018 and, at the time the Complaint was filed, tolls were being collected at two locations in southwestern Rhode Island on I-95. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. Plaintiffs-various trucking, transport, and freight companies-filed a Complaint in July 2018 asking this Court to declare the tolls unconstitutional and to enjoin their collection. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13. Plaintiffs contend that the tolling regime violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because (1) it intends to discriminate in favor of in-state, and against out-of-state entities; (2) it has the practical effect of discriminating against trucks traveling in interstate commerce; and (3) it imposes excessive costs on interstate vehicles as it is not a fair approximation of the payers' uses of the tolled facilities. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants - Peter Alviti, in his official capacity as the Director of RIDOT, and RITBA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   - have moved to dismiss on three grounds. First, they argue that the tolls constitute \"a tax under State law\" as described in the Tax Injunction Act (\"TIA\") and, therefore, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin the \"assessment, levy or collection\" of those tolls.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs.' Mot.\") 7-25, ECF No. 21. Second, even if the tolls are not \"taxes\" under the TIA, they argue that principles of comity and federalism nonetheless require the Court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Defs.' Mot. 25-30. Third, Defendants argue that the Eleventh Amendment protects them from suit. Defs.' Mot. 30-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Tax Injunction Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The TIA provides: \"The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties do not dispute that Rhode Island state courts offer a \"plain, speedy and efficient remedy\" for Plaintiffs' Commerce Clause claims. Therefore, the only question before the Court is whether the RhodeWorks tolls constitute \"a tax\" under the TIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The question presents a close call, one which pits the actual language of the TIA and the context surrounding its enactment in the 1930s against several more modern decisions of the First Circuit that attempt to distinguish between fees and taxes. \"The Supreme Court has not addressed the precise issue in dispute here, the means of defining a 'tax' for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Landfill, Inc. v. Stark/Tuscarawas/Wayne Joint Solid Waste Mgmt. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397204\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/835/#p838\">\n    166 F.3d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 (6th Cir. 1999). It has, however, differentiated between a \"tax\" and a \"toll\" in other situations, most notably in its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sands v. Manistee River Imp. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523851\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/123/288/\">\n    123 U.S. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523851\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/123/288/\">\n    8 S.Ct. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523851\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/123/288/\">\n    31 L.Ed. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1887). In that case, a Michigan law allowed private corporations to clean up and improve sections of the Manistee River and then charge tolls to recoup the costs of that clean up. The improvements had to be approved by the governor and the attorney general; the toll amounts had to be set by an administrative agency and could only be imposed upon the improved section of the river based on the distance traveled; and the use of the improved area had to remain open to all travelers, subject to their payment of the tolls. Sands used the improved section of river to transport his logs downstream but failed to pay the requisite tolls, leading the plaintiff, Manistee River Import Co., to sue for the payment of the delinquent tolls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his defense, Sands argued that the imposition of tolls, \"without notice to the parties interested, or affording them any opportunity of contesting the validity or propriety of such tolls,\" amounted to a deprivation of property without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523851\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/123/288/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 114-15 ; U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Sands further argued that the Michigan statute allowing for the imposition of tolls violated the Contracts Clause because a 1787 ordinance provided that navigable waters in the territory of Michigan would be forever free from taxes, imposts, and duties. According to Sands, the ordinance functioned as a contract between the federal government and the citizens of the territory and the imposition of tolls on the Manistee River amounted to a \"tax\" in violation of that contract.\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523851\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/123/288/\">\n    8 S.Ct. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court first held that the tolls did not violate the Due Process Clause because a toll did not constitute a taking of property \"any more than there is a taking of property from a traveler in requiring him to pay for his lodgings in a public inn ... The tolls exacted from the defendant are merely compensation for benefits conferred, by which the floating of his logs down the stream was facilitated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523851\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/123/288/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It further found that it was impossible to give Sands, or any other citizen \"who may have occasion to use the stream,\" notice or opportunity to \"present their views upon the tolls to be charged\" because \"[s]uch parties cannot be known in advance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In expounding on why imposing a \"toll\" did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process, the Court distinguished tolls from taxes, observing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no analogy between the imposition of taxes and the levying of tolls for improvement of highways; and any attempt to justify or condemn proceedings in the one case, by reference to those in the other, must be misleading. Taxes are levied for the support of government, and their amount is regulated by its necessities. Tolls are the compensation for the use of another's property, or of improvements made by him; and their amount is determined by the cost of the property, or of the improvements, and considerations of the return which such values or expenditures should yield.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court also rejected Sands' Contracts Clause argument. It primarily relied on the fact that the U.S. Constitution preempted all existing laws, including the 1787 ordinance at issue, and that Michigan assented to this preemption when it became a state in 1837.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116. However, it took the opportunity to opine that, even in the absence of preemption, there was a distinction between \"taxes\" and \"compensation for improvements,\" which would defeat the Contracts Clause claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117 (\" 'By the terms [']tax, impost and duty,['] mentioned in the ordinance, is meant a charge for the use of the government,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    compensation\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    improvements\n   </em>\n   .' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Huse v.

Defendants' point is that the Court chose to describe these so-called \"tolls\" as taxes because that was what they really were, not because that is what the legislatures chose to call them. The point is a fair one inasmuch as the Court could have found the fees to be tolls regardless of the label. But these cases do little to undermine the fundamental distinction between tolls and taxes found by the Court in the\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Defendants contend that, to determine whether an exaction is a \"tax\"\n   <em>\n    within the meaning of the TIA\n   </em>\n   (as opposed to the pre-TIA landscape discussed above), the Court must engage in the three-pronged test set forth in\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular Telephone Co. v.

To determine whether an exaction constitutes a \"tax\" or a \"regulatory fee,\" the court laid out three factors for consideration: (1) the nature of the entity imposing the exaction; (2) the scope of the population subject to the exaction; and (3) whether the revenues from the exaction are expended for general public purposes, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether the revenues provide more narrow benefits to regulated individuals and entities and serve to defray the agency's cost of regulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/\">\n    at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although none of these factors is dispositive, in close cases, the First Circuit has instructed courts to \"emphasize the revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether it provides more narrow benefits to regulated companies or defrays the agency's costs of regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/\">\n    at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The first factor - the nature of the entity imposing the charge - clearly favors finding the RhodeWorks tolls to be fees or tolls, and not taxes.

Even if, as Plaintiffs argue, this amount constitutes only a small percentage of Rhode Island's overall state budget, these truck \"tolls\" still serve a critical revenue-raising purpose (transportation infrastructure), that but for their collection, would require the General Assembly to fund through general revenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

The use of a special fund here is little more than a budgeting device that is allowing the state to pay for what would otherwise be raised through general revenue taxation through a separate off-budget fee. The use of the fund does not change the character of the fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   and the analysis of\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   are not at odds. The holding in Sands that tolls are not taxes is still good law; and the TIA would not operate to deprive district courts of jurisdiction in a case that challenged the constitutionality of an actual toll. But for a fee to be a toll - as conceived by\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   and consistent with the\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   test - it must have certain characteristics: per\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   , it must be a fee that compensates the owner of something for use of that thing by another - a ferry, a private highway - or to compensate a person for certain improvements to property made by him. In other words, there is a direct correlation between the fee or toll and the use of the property. As stated in the Cooley treatise above, it is \"a demand of proprietorship\" not sovereignty. In contrast, a tax, as the\n   Court said in\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   and the First Circuit discussed in\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   , is essentially a revenue raising device, a demand of the sovereign. It is often, but not always imposed on a broad class of persons but, more importantly, it supplants other government revenue sources which would be needed to fund necessities like roads and bridges and the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, the facts are clear that the fees, while dubbed \"tolls,\" are really a highly targeted and sophisticated tax designed to fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements that would otherwise need to be paid for by other forms of tax-generated revenue.
