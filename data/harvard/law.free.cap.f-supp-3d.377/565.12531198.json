Blake, United States District Judge\n   This employment contract dispute arises out of Eric Rodgers's decision to leave his job as a Sales Representative in the plaintiff's trade binding division and to take a position with Fox Group, Inc., a company similarly engaged in commercial bindery services. Count I alleges breach of contract and is brought against Mr. Rodgers alone. Count II, brought against Fox Group, Inc., alleges tortious interference with contractual relations. Count III, levied against both defendants, alleges misappropriation of trade secrets. Both defendants have moved for dismissal as a matter of law. (Fox Group, Inc. Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 11 ; Rodgers's Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 13.) The briefing is complete. The motions to dismiss will be granted. The plaintiff's noncompete contract claim will be dismissed with prejudice; all other claims will be dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff, who asks to amend its tort claim if held to be insufficiently pleaded, may do so. Similarly, it may seek to amend its complaint to provide specific facts pertaining to the confidential information or trade secrets allegedly taken and/or misused. If the plaintiff decides to file an amended complaint, it may plead facts, if any exist, relevant to whether Mr. Rodgers was the sole sales representative in the sales territory or the extent of his contact with customers in the sales territory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Rodgers took a sales position in Bindagraphics's trade binding division in November 2013. Compl. \u00b6 6. This was a customer-facing position within a specific geographic region called \"Eric's Territory,\" constituted of forty-six customers roughly located in the geographic triangle between New York, NY; Harrisburg, PA; and Wilmington, DE. Compl. \u00b6 11; Compl. Ex. 4. Mr. Rodgers was provided confidential customer lists and other proprietary information. Compl. \u00b6 9. Upon joining Bindagraphics, Mr. Rodgers signed an employment contract, which, as relevant here, included a non-solicitation clause, a covenant not to compete, and a provision pertaining to trade secrets and confidential information. The precise language of these promises bears directly on the merits inquiry to follow. Therefore, the relevant sections are set forth here in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    5. Covenants Against Competition\n   </em>\n   .

Accordingly, Employee hereby expressly covenants and agrees that during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year immediately following the date on which he is no longer an Employee of Employer, he will not, directly or indirectly, for himself, or on behalf of any other person, corporation or other entity (except Employer):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   a.

Fox Group, Inc. levies additional challenges to the tort claim, asserting that damages have been insufficiently pled and the term \"Sales Territory\" is illusory. (Fox Group, Inc. P &amp; A Mot. Dismiss at pp. 1-2, ECF No. 11-1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Rodgers argues that the plaintiff has failed to identify a protectable trade secret. (Mr. Rodgers P &amp; A Mot. Dismiss at pp. 1-2, ECF No. 13-1.) The plaintiff has responded to these arguments (ECF No. 15 ) and the defendants have filed a consolidated reply. (ECF No. 17 ).

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-39. Mr. Rodgers contends that this claim must fail because the \"clear and unambiguous\" language of the contract reveals it to be overbroad and geographically untethered, rendering the contract itself unenforceable, and because the plaintiff has failed to allege a breach. (Mr. Rodgers P &amp; A Mot. Dismiss at pp. 4-5, 14, ECF No. 13-1.) Bindagraphics asserts that the employment contract is not overbroad and that, even if it were, the court can narrow it instead of declaring it wholesale unenforceable. (Resp. Defs.' Mots.

Compl. \u00b6 11. And cultivating such relationships was part of his job description. Compl. \u00b6 10. When viewed in the light most favorable to Bindagraphics, and through the innumerable cases similarly pertaining to customer goodwill, it is clear that Bindagraphics had a legally protected interest in the goodwill Mr. Rodgers built as a trade binding sales representative.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DPGM II\n   </em>\n   , 116 Fed.

The provision is limited to competitors in the trade binding industry within Mr. Rodgers's sales territory and which sell products or services to Bindagraphics customers or potential customers during Mr. Rodgers's tenure in their service. Customers are limited to those served by Bindagraphics in the year preceding Mr. Rodgers's departure or those with whom Mr. Rodgers spoke within one year of the individual being a Bindagraphics customer. Prospective customers are those solicited by Mr. Rodgers or Bindagraphics in the year preceding Mr. Rodgers's termination. The scope of this prohibition is not confined to sales positions or work akin to Mr. Rodgers's duties on behalf of Bindagraphics. Instead, it would prohibit Mr. Rodgers from working in any capacity for a competitor that met the above criteria, even one unrelated to sales. As numerous courts in this district have held, the fact that Mr. Rodgers is prohibited from working in any capacity for a competitor renders the restriction wider than reasonably necessary to forestall the loss of customer goodwill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Courts applying Maryland law have found similar noncompete covenants to be facially overbroad. In\n   <em>\n    Paul v.

It therefore prohibits Jones from working in any capacity with any company that competes or may compete in any way with MCS. This sweeping prohibition is not reasonably necessary to protect the customer goodwill Jones created, and it is not narrowly tailored to that end. It constrains the list of Jones's potential employers instead of targeting possible goodwill-thieving activities.\"\n    <em>\n     MCS Servs., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203895380\">\n     2010 WL 3895380\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (internal citations omitted). The present covenant similarly proscribes direct or indirect action by the employee and does not cabin its effect to positions where Mr. Rodgers might traffic in customer goodwill.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The Fourth Circuit has ratified this logic. In\n    <em>\n     DPGM II\n    </em>\n    , it deemed facially overbroad a restrictive employment covenant prohibiting \"any activity which may affect adversely the interests of\" the employer, because, in part, the restrictive covenant was \"in no way ... specifically targeted at preventing [the defendants] from trading on the goodwill they created while serving [the plaintiff s] customers.\" 116 Fed. App'x. at 438. In\n    <em>\n     RLM Communications, Inc. v.

The character and extent of revision required is not permitted under the blue-pencil doctrine. The noncompete covenant remains facially overbroad. And it is therefore unenforceable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Nonsolicitation Covenant\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The same rules apply to the nonsolicitation covenant Bindagraphics seeks to enforce. By its terms, the nonsolicitation covenant declares that, for one year following his termination, Mr. Rodgers will not directly or indirectly solicit any customer or prospective customer for products or services the same as, or similar to, those sold by Bindagraphics's trade binding division. The covenant additionally forbids Mr. Rodgers from selling, or being otherwise involved in the sale of, any such product or service to customers or prospective customers during that year. As in the noncompete covenant, customers are limited to those within Mr. Rodgers's sales territory who were either served by Bindagraphics in the year preceding Mr. Rodgers's departure or with whom Mr. Rodgers spoke within one year of them being a Bindagraphics customer. Prospective customers are those solicited by Mr. Rodgers or Bindagraphics in the year preceding Mr. Rodgers's termination. Here too, the question is whether the scope and duration of the prohibition is reasonably necessary to prevent Mr. Rodgers from trading on customer goodwill.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The nonsolicitation clause at issue here is broader in scope than reasonably necessary because it applies to prospective customers and the passive sale or provision of services to a customer that Mr. Rodgers did not solicit. First, the covenant's restriction on solicitation of prospective customers, those within the sales territory solicited by Bindagraphics in the year preceding Mr. Rodgers's departure, is not narrowly drawn to cover only those with whom Mr. Rodgers had contact. Instead, while Mr. Rodgers may have contacted some prospective customers in his capacity with Bindagraphics, the prohibition includes all potential customers solicited by\n    the Bindagraphics trade binding division, drawing a wide prohibition well beyond Mr. Rodgers's personal connections. Courts in this district have found restrictive covenants that attempt to reach prospective customers to be overbroad.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202462492\">\n     2017 WL 2462492\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (explaining \"the bar on soliciting [the plaintiff's] prospective customers, which includes those with whom the former employee may have had no personal contact, further renders the non-solicitation provision overbroad.... A prospective customer, under the plain meaning of the term, has not previously done business with [the plaintiff] and thus would not have been the subject of customer goodwill generated by a former ... sales representative.\") (internal citations omitted);\n    <em>\n     Seneca One Fin., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271759\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/214/457/#p461\">\n     214 F.Supp.3d at 464\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating \"Seneca One has identified no authority that would support a right to protection of potential customers, and its inclusion of all individuals who have been in contact with Seneca One in its definition of 'Customers' is breathtaking in scope.\"). Limiting contact with prospective customers is sufficiently untethered from the protected goodwill concern to render this provision overbroad.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Next, the covenant here purports to limit Mr. Rodgers's ability to sell \"or otherwise service\" any Bindagraphics trade binding division customer. This provision reaches far beyond customers solicited by Mr. Rodgers. It extends to unsolicited bids from customers who initiate contact with Mr. Rodgers, his work on projects solicited or arranged by other employees, and work on behalf of customers who patronize both competitors. As with a restriction barring solicitation of potential customers, the risk this provision seeks to forestall is a risk of greater competition. This is not a protected interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     DPGM II\n    </em>\n    , 116 Fed App'x. at 438.

Because this provision is not reasonably necessary to the employer's protected interest it is facially overbroad.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In contrast to the noncompete provision, it is possible that the facially overbroad components of the nonsolicitation covenant are sufficiently separate (and severable) as to be blue-penciled. But while Bindagraphics asserts that the nonsolicitation clause can be narrowed to conform to Maryland law,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss at pp. 10-11, ECF No. 15, it does not put forth a particular proposal for how the provision might be blue-penciled to pertain only to customers with whom Mr. Rodgers interacted. With what is before it, the court prefers not to decide whether the nonsolicitation promise can be narrowed, and if so, whether it is reasonably necessary both facially and as-applied to Bindagraphics's protected interest.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly,\n    Bindagraphics's nonsolicitation claim will be dismissed without prejudice.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Count II: Tortious Interference with A Contract\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Under Maryland law, tortious interference with a contract occurs when a third party intentionally interferes with another in his or her business or occupation and induces a breach of an existing contract, of which the defendant was aware, causing damages to the plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Fowler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4398285\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/89/448/#p465\">\n     89 Md.

Ex. 4], which Sales Territory shall be subject to amendment and revision by Employer, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time (as so amended and revised, the 'Sales Territory').\" Compl. Ex. 4, ECF No. 1-4 at p. 17. While the Bindagraphics customer Mr. Rodgers is alleged to have contacted after his departure was located geographically within the sales territory, and indeed was listed by name on the original \"Eric's territory\" list, this is ostensibly a facial challenge to the contract's enforceability. A promise is illusory if \"the promisor retains an unlimited right to decide later the nature or extent of his performance.\"\n     <em>\n      Cheek v.

That said, courts generally \"prefer a construction [of a contract] which will make the contract effective rather than one which will make it illusory or unenforceable.\"\n     <em>\n      Kelley Constr.

The tendency of the law is to avoid the finding that no contract arose due to an illusory promise when it appears that the parties intended a contract.\" 2 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 5.28 (2018). And any \"benefit to the promisor or ... detriment to the promisee is sufficient valuable consideration to support a contract.\"\n     <em>\n      Vogelhut v.

Critically here, \"Maryland law generally implies a covenant to act in good faith and deal fairly with the other party or parties to a contract. This principle\n     <em>\n      governs the manner in which a party may exercise the discretion accorded to it by the terms of the agreement.\n     </em>\n     In performing, the party with discretion is limited to exercising that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.\"\n     <em>\n      Manning v.

Md. 2012) (emphasis supplied) (internal citations omitted). Unlike the arbitration-clause cases cited by Mr. Rodgers, a contract is not facially unenforceable merely because it delegates discretion to define one of its terms on an ongoing basis to a single party, where both parties otherwise incur binding obligations. Bindagraphics's ability to change the dimensions or businesses included in the sales territory is closer to an \"open term\" that has good reason to change over time, is premised upon a mutually enforceable agreement, and is limited by the implied covenant to act in good faith and fair dealing, than it is an illusory promise that \"does not actually bind or obligate the promisor to do anything.\"\n     <em>\n      Cheek\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"586449\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/378/139/#p149\">\n      378 Md. at 148\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"586449\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/378/139/#p149\">\n      835 A.2d 656\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-59\">\n     To the extent that there is a separate confidentiality covenant in the employment contract in question, the court does not assess its enforceability because the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege a breach.
