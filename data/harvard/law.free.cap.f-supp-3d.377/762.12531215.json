Holly is a defendant in this case, it filed a petition for\n   bankruptcy on July 26, 2018 (Dkt. 22), which stays this matter as to J.C. Holly only. The Funds move for summary judgment against Timothy and Brian Thayer, as J.C. Holly's principals, for breaching their fiduciary duty to make fringe benefit contributions on behalf of J.C.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There are three issues that must be resolved in this case. First, the Funds must show that J.C. Holly failed to meet its obligation of making fringe benefit payments to the Funds. Second, the Funds must show that Timothy and Brian Thayer were fiduciaries of the unpaid fringe benefit contributions and breached their fiduciary duties. Finally, they must justify damages against Timothy and Brian Thayer. The Court will take each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. J.C. Holly's Unpaid Fringe Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Funds' claim against J.C. Holly is brought under Section 515 of ERISA, which requires employers to make contributions to employee funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In any action under this subchapter by a fiduciary for or on behalf of a plan to enforce section 1145 of this title in which a judgment in favor of the plan is awarded, the court shall award the plan -\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (A) the unpaid contributions,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (B) interest on the unpaid contributions,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (C) an amount equal to the greater of--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (i) interest on the unpaid contributions, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (ii) liquidated damages provided for under the plan in an amount not in excess of 20 percent (or such higher percentage as may be permitted under Federal or State law) of the amount determined by the court under subparagraph (A),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (D) reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the action, to be paid by the defendant, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (E) such other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). Contributions are plan assets as soon as they are due and owing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Plumbers Local 98 Defined Ben. Pension Fund v.

Mich. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Thayers make much of the fact that the CAM Agreement was not part of the 1986 CBA signed by Brian Thayer. But this argument is immaterial, because J.C. Holly's obligation to make fringe benefit payments is identical under the AGC Agreement, which is expressly identified in the 1986 CBA. There is no dispute of\n   material facts that J.C. Holly is obligated to make fringe benefit contributions to the Funds. There was some dispute as to the amount of unpaid contributions, but the matter was resolved through a subsequent review by Wayne B. Kless of Stefansky, Holloway &amp; Nichols, who conducted two audits of J.C. Holly and confirmed the outstanding unpaid benefits with J.C. Holly's office manager, Janet Thayer. Kless Aff., Ex. 11 to Pl. Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 2-9 (Dkt. 23-11). The amount of unpaid fringe benefits as of August 1, 2018 is $ 36,166.89.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The Thayers do not dispute this amount. Therefore, J.C. Holly failed to meet its obligation of making fringe benefit payments to the Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Timothy and Brian Thayer are ERISA Fiduciaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Funds argue that Timothy and Brian Thayer, as President and Vice President respectively, are individually liable for breaching their fiduciary duties under ERISA to ensure that the J.C. Holly met its contribution obligations. The Thayers argue that they are not fiduciaries because the Funds unethically attempted to collect unpaid fringe benefit contributions outside of the statute of limitations. Resp. at 6-7 (Dkt. 28). They further argue that rather than misappropriating funds from J.C. Holly, they loaned money to J.C. Holly to keep the company afloat. The Thayers' arguments miss the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under ERISA, \"a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent [ ] he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A). \"[P]ension and benefit fund contributions are plan assets as soon as they are\n   <em>\n    due and owing\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Trustees of the Operating Engineers' Local 324 Pension v.

Resp. at 6-7. The Thayers offer no authority for this argument, and the Court could not locate any such authority. To be clear, any dispute regarding what portion of the benefits is beyond the statute of limitations has been resolved, as the Thayers concede.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. But any prior efforts to collect on stale claims, whether well-intentioned or not, have no bearing on the Funds' right to proceed on claims that are no stale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, the Thayers argue that there is no evidence showing that employee contributions were withheld and, therefore, there could be no misappropriation of plan assets. Resp. at 8. But there is no dispute that J.C. Holly is delinquent on contribution\n   payments to the Funds. The Funds have provided two audits and associated discrepancy information charts detailing the unpaid contributions related to a J.C. Holly employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4-7 to Pl. Mot. (Dkts. 23-4, 23-5, 23-6, 23-7). The Thayers make no attempt to discredit this information or explain why this documentation is somehow lacking. As noted above, this district has \"universally treat[ed] delinquent payments to ERISA funds as de facto mismanagement of plan assets\" from which personal liability flows.\n   <em>\n    Glencorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356554\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/178/600/#p607\">\n    178 F.Supp.3d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit has said that \"refusal to pay the funds as required under the CBA does not rise to the level of exercising discretionary control or authority such that fiduciary status attaches.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheet Metal Local 98 Pension Fund v.

In their response brief, the Thayers admit to paying company creditors instead of paying the delinquent fringe benefit contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Thayers argue that they did not misappropriate funds by pointing to the fact that they have made personal loans to J.C. Holly and personally guaranteed other loans to J.C. Holly, which were used to pay other creditors, including paying legal fees, insurance, and operating expenses. Resp. at 7. But this is irrelevant to whether they breached their fiduciary duty. The fringe benefit contributions became plan assets when they were due and owing. The Thayers had possession of the plan assets and were responsible for transmitting the contributions to the Funds, which made them ERISA fiduciaries.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A) (\"[A] person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent [ ] he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets.\"). However, rather than make the fringe benefit contributions to the Funds, the Thayers chose to pay other creditors. And when J.C. Holly took out loans to cover its expenses, the Thayers again chose to pay other creditors, rather than become current on the outstanding fringe benefit contributions. The Thayers breached their fiduciary duties by using plan assets to pay other creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yeseta v.

The\n   <em>\n    McGuire Steel\n   </em>\n   court, on the other hand, explained that \u00a7 1332(g)(2) applies to employers only, which the company president was not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The Court finds the\n   <em>\n    McGuire Steel\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The remedies under \u00a7 1132(g)(2) flow from delinquent contributions by an \"\n   <em>\n    employer\n   </em>\n   who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, J.C. Holly, and not the Thayers, is the employer. The Thayers' liability to the Funds is found under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for losses caused by their breach of a fiduciary duty. There is no question that fiduciaries under \u00a7 1109 are personally liable for any losses resulting from a breach of fiduciary duties, such as unpaid fringe benefits and interest. Liquidated damages, on the other hand, \"do not serve to make good to the plan any losses and do not constitute appropriate equitable relief....\"\n   <em>\n    Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftworkers Local 2, Albany, N.Y.

Therefore, the Court finds that Timothy and Brian Thayer's liability is limited to unpaid fringe benefit contributions and interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court finds that the audits reliably show that $ 36,166.89 of unpaid contributions are owed to the Funds as of August 1, 2018. However, the Court is unable to determine the method used to support an interest award of $ 15,290.75.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Liquidated Damages and Interest Computations, Ex. 8 to Pl. Mot. (Dkt. 23-8). The interest rate on the unpaid funds appears to have been calculated at either 12% or 18% per annum and there is no explanation as to why either rate should apply. Therefore, the Court will grant in part the Funds' requested relief for unpaid fringe benefit contributions only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court grants in part and denies in part the Funds motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 23) as follows: The motion is granted as to the liability of Timothy Thayer and Brian Thayer in the amount of $ 36,166.89 in unpaid fringe benefit contributions owing under the audits. The motion is denied\n   without prejudice as to the Funds' claim for interest. The Funds can file a new motion\n   <strong>\n    on or before April 12, 2019\n   </strong>\n   setting forth a calculation of interest with any supporting documentation. The motion is denied with prejudice as to the Funds' claim for liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Thayers also move for summary judgment in their response brief in violation of the Local Rules. Resp. at 6 (Dkt. 28). Eastern District of Michigan Local Rule 7.1 provides that \"[u]nless the court permits otherwise, each motion and response to a motion must be accompanied by a single brief.\" Mich. LR 7.1(d)(1)(A). The Thayers' brief cannot simultaneously serve as both a single brief in support of their response and a single brief in support of an independent motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
