WUFSI, a subsidiary of Western Union, operates a \"Money Transfer System\" through which consumers send money to other individuals in the United States and around the world.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Each of the named Plaintiffs alleges that she was defrauded by an unnamed third-party fraudster who convinced her to send a fraudulent money transfer order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Money transfer orders sent through WUFSI are subject to a set of contractual terms and conditions (\"Terms and Conditions\") located on a pre-printed Send Money Form.\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   [# 33] at 10, 12-13. The Terms and Conditions in place at the time of each of the named Plaintiffs' alleged money transfers included arbitration clauses, requiring the parties to arbitrate any disputes individually, rather than on a class-wide basis (the \"Arbitration Clauses\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Defendants maintain that the Terms and Conditions are included in both the Send Money Form customers fill out to send money and on the receipts given to customers after sending money transfer orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Defendants also assert that before a customer can send money using a Send Money Form, WUFSI's standard business practices require the customer to sign the form, agreeing to the accompanying terms and conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Once the information on the Send Money Form is verified by a Western Union clerk on location, the clerk then prints a receipt for the customer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The analysis begins by examining whether enforceable Arbitration Clauses exist between the parties.

Next, the Court resolves whether Defendant WUFSI is bound by an Arbitration Clause, and whether Defendants Western Union and Ersek may enforce arbitration through equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After determining whether Arbitration Clauses exist, the Court then examines whether the existing Arbitration Clauses are enforceable and whether Plaintiffs' disputes fall within their scope. Regarding enforceability, the Court examines the enforceability of an Arbitration Clause which names an arbitrator who is no longer available for consumer disputes. Additionally, the Court determines whether a separate Arbitration Clause is unconscionable. Finally, regarding the scope of Plaintiffs' disputes, the Court examines whether Plaintiffs' RICO claims fall within the scope of the Arbitration Clauses under the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the Parties are Bound by the Arbitration Clauses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court starts by determining which parties are bound by the Arbitration Clauses. Defendants argue that an enforceable Arbitration Clause exists from each alleged fraudulent transaction asserted by each named Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   [# 33] at 18. In support of this argument, Defendants argue that each named Plaintiff assented to the Terms and Conditions in order to send her money transfers as required by WUFSI's standard business practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Additionally, Defendants argue that WUFSI is bound by the relevant Arbitration Clauses, and that both Arbitration Clauses apply to non-signatory Defendants Western Union and Ersek through the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs, by contrast, deny that Plaintiffs Kazmiera Frazier (\"Frazier\") and Koaleshia Simon (\"Simon\") ever agreed to Defendants' Terms and Conditions, which contain the Arbitration Clauses.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 52] at 26-32. Plaintiffs argue that WUFSI is not bound by the Term and Conditions, and therefore it cannot compel arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Clause therein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. Further, Plaintiffs argue that the nonsignatory Defendants Western Union and Ersek also cannot enforce arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes Plaintiffs' position regarding who among Defendants is bound by the Terms and Conditions, and thus the Arbitration Clauses. It appears that Plaintiffs assert that none of the named Defendants are parties or signatories to the Terms and Conditions. Plaintiffs argue that WUFSI cannot be bound by the Terms and Conditions and Arbitration Clauses as a nonsignatory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Further, Plaintiffs argue that as nonsignatories to the Terms and Conditions, Defendants Western Union and Ersek are also not bound by the Arbitration Clauses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. It appears Plaintiffs argue that there is no Defendant who is bound by the Terms and Conditions giving rise to their substantive claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-37.

Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court addresses Plaintiffs' two arguments regarding attorneys' fees together. As stated above, Plaintiffs argue that the NAM Arbitration Clause deprives Plaintiffs of their automatic right to attorneys' fees as a prevailing party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The NAM Arbitration Clause requires arbitration to be conducted under the NAM Rules, which state that the arbitrator \"may\" award the total costs of arbitration or legal representation to one party, or apportion costs as the arbitrator deems appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 52] at 16;\n   <em>\n    Levitt Decl.\n   </em>\n   [# 52-2] at 20. Because RICO\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   mandates\n   that prevailing parties \"shall recover\" costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, Plaintiffs argue that the discretion left to the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs denies Plaintiffs their guaranteed right of recovery of attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 52] at 16. Further, Plaintiffs argue that the arbitrator discretion in the NAM Rules would also improperly expose Plaintiffs to the risk of paying Defendants' attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants argue that the NAM Arbitration Clause does not preclude Plaintiffs' right to pursue statutory RICO claims.\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   [# 56] at 14. In support of this argument, Defendants assert that the NAM Rules, while granting discretion to the arbitrator in awarding fees, do not mandate that the arbitrator \"disregard applicable law in rendering any decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Defendants also argue that similar arguments regarding discretionary fee awards by the arbitrator have been rejected in the Tenth Circuit and by the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Here, nothing in the NAM Arbitration Clause requires Plaintiffs to incur their own costs and attorneys' fees if they prevail, nor does it require Plaintiffs to pay Defendants' attorneys' fees if they lose.\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   [# 33-2] at 8. Additionally, while the NAM Arbitration Clause requires Plaintiffs to bear some arbitration cost, that cost is expressly limited to $ 125.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiffs' concern that the arbitrator will ignore Plaintiffs' rights to attorneys' fees and costs under the appropriate RICO statute is speculative.\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/#p89\">\n    531 U.S. at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/#p89\">\n    121 S.Ct. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Plaintiffs' have not demonstrated that the NAM Arbitration Clause strips them of their statutory rights under RICO to pursue claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs point to three cases in support of their position.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 52] at 16-18.

Discovery Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Turning to discovery costs, Plaintiffs assert that the provision of the NAM Arbitration Clause providing that \"the\n   costs of discovery must be commensurate with the amount of the claim\" precludes effective vindication of Plaintiffs' RICO claims.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 52] at 19. Plaintiffs argue that the broad and technical nature of RICO claims, and the burden of establishing a pattern of racketeering activity, warrant extensive discovery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204621766\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that a \"single three-hour deposition...limited solely to the issue of arbitrability\" would cost over $ 500.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Therefore, Plaintiffs contend that limiting Plaintiffs' discovery to the amounts commensurate with each Plaintiffs' individual claim (a range of $ 525-$ 12,000) effectively precludes Plaintiffs' RICO claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendants assert that the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors Restaurant\n   </em>\n   , and other federal courts have applied that same reasoning specifically to RICO claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    570 U.S. at 231-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   [# 56] at 17. The Court agrees. In\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors Restaurant\n   </em>\n   , no plaintiff's claim exceeded $ 38,549, and the cost of discovery was estimated at over $ 1 million.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    570 U.S. at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court found \"the fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue the remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the possibility that discovery costs will greatly outweigh the amount recoverable in Plaintiffs' arbitration claims does not prevent Plaintiffs from pursuing their statutory RICO rights.
