Compl. at \u00b6 26 [Dkt. # 1]. Soon after the murder, Bauman, a D.C. resident and public relations and communications consultant,\n      <em>\n       see id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 22, 51, was referred to the Rich family by friends of Seth Rich and volunteered to act as the family's spokesperson,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 27. To this day, Seth Rich's murder remains unsolved, but D.C. law enforcement officials have stated their belief that he was killed during a botched robbery.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 29. Nevertheless, the murder spawned a number of conspiracy theories aiming to connect Seth Rich's death to the hack and leak of DNC emails to Wikileaks during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 2. Indeed, on August 10, 2016, Wikileaks released a statement addressing, if not inflaming, these conspiracy theories, noting that its policy of neither confirming nor denying its sources should not be inferred to suggest that Seth Rich was a Wikileaks source or that his murder was connected to Wikileaks' activities.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 32.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      Months later, in early 2017, defendant Butowsky, a Texas resident and businessman and cable news commentator,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 40, contacted the Rich family and offered to hire and pay a private investigator to investigate Seth Rich's murder,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 30. The family apparently agreed, and Butowsky hired former D.C. police investigator (and fellow cable news commentator) Rod Wheeler.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 10. At the same time, Butowsky allegedly was pressing Fox News to report on supposed evidence linking Seth Rich to Wikileaks and the leaked DNC emails.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 50. Fox News ultimately ran such a story on May 16, 2017, entitled \"Slain DNC staffer had contact with Wikileaks, investigator says.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 33. According to the article, Wheeler believed that the D.C. police were covering up the true circumstances of the murder.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 35. Wheeler immediately denied the attribution in the Fox News article and publicly stated that he did not personally have evidence of a cover up.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. In response, Bauman released a statement on the Rich family's behalf denying any link between Seth Rich and Wikileaks and condemning as politically motivated the conspiracy theories suggesting the same.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 40. On May 23, 2017, Fox News retracted its reporting about a Seth Rich murder coverup.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Over the ensuing months, Butowsky allegedly made a series of public statements about Bauman's role in the controversy surrounding Seth Rich's murder. For example, on the same day that Fox News retracted its article, Butowsky stated in an online World Net Daily interview that the DNC \"assigned\" Bauman to act as the Rich family spokesman, that Bauman was a \"Democrat crisis management person,\" and that he \"finds Bauman's involvement with the family extremely suspicious.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 53. A few days later, Butowsky gave an interview to New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer, during which he observed that \"it seemed like Bauman's job is just to discredit and try to go after people.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 56. And on August 2, 2017, Butowsky told CNN that \"Bauman is simply a hired guy who will say anything\" and that he \"should apologize to the country for crafting a lie.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 74.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      Like Butowsky, defendant Heavin, a fellow Texas resident and frequent news commentator,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 18, made public statements about Bauman's involvement in the Seth Rich matter. On May 28, 2017, Heavin appeared on a radio program and claimed that Bauman is a \"DNC cleaner\" brought in to \"propagandize\" and who \"would lie, cheat, and steal to ... avoid the truth.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 57. A month later, Heavin appeared on InfoWars' The Alex Jones Show and accused Bauman of being \"a Democratic hitman\" who \"cover[s] up media issues around the Democratic Party\" and stated that Bauman's involvement was \"very very suspicious.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. InfoWars aired the episode online and on social media and radio platforms.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      On May 21, 2018, Bauman sued,\n      <em>\n       inter alia\n      </em>\n      , Butowsky and Heavin for defamation, defamation per se, and false light.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 128-55.

There is, for example, no \"neighboring forum\" exception permitting me to consider Heavin's Maryland contacts in determining his amenability to suit in D.C. There is also no support for the proposition that merely speaking about a forum (or about entities within that forum)-e.g., producing a film about or seeking employment with the federal government, discussing one's relationships with federal government officials-can confer specific jurisdiction in the absence of identifiable forum contacts.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      This dearth of legal foundation might explain why Bauman posits these contacts as analytically relevant\n      <em>\n       without\n      </em>\n      citation to legal authority.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.

In that light, Butowsky's statements effectively conveyed his view that Bauman was not serving as a neutral purveyor of fact but instead was acting to quell the questions and debate surrounding Seth Rich's death.

Accordingly, Butowsky's statements,\n     although clearly hyperbolic, are not actionable in defamation.\n      <footnotemark>\n       9\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-47\">\n      <strong>\n       b. Remaining Causes of Action\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-48\">\n      Bauman also brings claims for defamation per se and false light against Butowsky. For the reasons stated above, Bauman has not stated a claim for defamation per se, which occurs when a defendant falsely accuses the plaintiff of committing a crime or other unlawful act.\n      <em>\n       See, e.g.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Guilford Transp. Indus., Inc.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11185866\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/760/580/#p597\">\n       760 A.2d at 600\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Additionally, \"[w]hen a false light claim is based upon the same factual allegations as a defamation claim, the two are analyzed identically.\"\n      <em>\n       Parisi v. Sinclair\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783073\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/845/215/\">\n       845 F.Supp.2d 215\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 218 n.1 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing\n      <em>\n       Blodgett v.

Bauman therefore also has failed to state a false light claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-49\">\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        CONCLUSION\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-50\">\n      For the foregoing reasons, Heavin's Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and Butowsky's 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim are hereby\n      <strong>\n       GRANTED\n      </strong>\n      , and this case is\n      <strong>\n       DISMISSED\n      </strong>\n      as to those defendants.
