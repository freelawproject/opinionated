Compl. at \u00b6 26 [Dkt. # 1]. Soon after the murder, Bauman, a D.C. resident and public relations and communications consultant, <em>see id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 22, 51, was referred to the Rich family by friends of Seth Rich and volunteered to act as the family's spokesperson, <em>id.</em> at \u00b6 27. To this day, Seth Rich's murder remains unsolved, but D.C. law enforcement officials have stated their belief that he was killed during a botched robbery. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 29. Nevertheless, the murder spawned a number of conspiracy theories aiming to connect Seth Rich's death to the hack and leak of DNC emails to Wikileaks during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 2. Indeed, on August 10, 2016, Wikileaks released a statement addressing, if not inflaming, these conspiracy theories, noting that its policy of neither confirming nor denying its sources should not be inferred to suggest that Seth Rich was a Wikileaks source or that his murder was connected to Wikileaks' activities. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 32.</p><p id=\"p-11\">Months later, in early 2017, defendant Butowsky, a Texas resident and businessman and cable news commentator, <em>id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 40, contacted the Rich family and offered to hire and pay a private investigator to investigate Seth Rich's murder, <em>id.</em> at \u00b6 30. The family apparently agreed, and Butowsky hired former D.C. police investigator (and fellow cable news commentator) Rod Wheeler. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 10. At the same time, Butowsky allegedly was pressing Fox News to report on supposed evidence linking Seth Rich to Wikileaks and the leaked DNC emails. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 50. Fox News ultimately ran such a story on May 16, 2017, entitled \"Slain DNC staffer had contact with Wikileaks, investigator says.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 33. According to the article, Wheeler believed that the D.C. police were covering up the true circumstances of the murder. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 35. Wheeler immediately denied the attribution in the Fox News article and publicly stated that he did not personally have evidence of a cover up. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. In response, Bauman released a statement on the Rich family's behalf denying any link between Seth Rich and Wikileaks and condemning as politically motivated the conspiracy theories suggesting the same. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 40. On May 23, 2017, Fox News retracted its reporting about a Seth Rich murder coverup. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.</p><p id=\"p-12\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"5\" href=\"#p5\" id=\"p5\">*5</a>Over the ensuing months, Butowsky allegedly made a series of public statements about Bauman's role in the controversy surrounding Seth Rich's murder. For example, on the same day that Fox News retracted its article, Butowsky stated in an online World Net Daily interview that the DNC \"assigned\" Bauman to act as the Rich family spokesman, that Bauman was a \"Democrat crisis management person,\" and that he \"finds Bauman's involvement with the family extremely suspicious.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 53. A few days later, Butowsky gave an interview to New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer, during which he observed that \"it seemed like Bauman's job is just to discredit and try to go after people.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 56. And on August 2, 2017, Butowsky told CNN that \"Bauman is simply a hired guy who will say anything\" and that he \"should apologize to the country for crafting a lie.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 74.</p><p id=\"p-13\">Like Butowsky, defendant Heavin, a fellow Texas resident and frequent news commentator, <em>id.</em> at \u00b6 18, made public statements about Bauman's involvement in the Seth Rich matter. On May 28, 2017, Heavin appeared on a radio program and claimed that Bauman is a \"DNC cleaner\" brought in to \"propagandize\" and who \"would lie, cheat, and steal to ... avoid the truth.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 57. A month later, Heavin appeared on InfoWars' The Alex Jones Show and accused Bauman of being \"a Democratic hitman\" who \"cover[s] up media issues around the Democratic Party\" and stated that Bauman's involvement was \"very very suspicious.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. InfoWars aired the episode online and on social media and radio platforms. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.</p><p id=\"p-14\">On May 21, 2018, Bauman sued, <em>inter alia</em> , Butowsky and Heavin for defamation, defamation per se, and false light. <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 128-55. Bauman alleges that Butowsky's and Heavin's statements about his involvement in the Seth Rich matter are false and have harmed his professional reputation and his physical and emotional health. <em>Id.</em> On June 15 and 19, 2018, respectively, Butowsky and Heavin moved separately to dismiss Bauman's claims for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) and failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). [Dkt. ## 12, 14].</p><p id=\"p-15\"><strong><em>LEGAL STANDARD</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-16\">To survive a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of the factual basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over a defendant. <em>See</em> <em>Crane v.

As Heavin is a non-resident defendant, the existence <em>vel non</em> of personal jurisdiction is governed by a familiar two-part framework, under which I must determine (1) whether Bauman has satisfied the District's long-arm statute, <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">D.C. Code \u00a7 13-423</extracted-citation>, and (2) if he has, whether the exercise of jurisdiction would comport with constitutional due process. <em>See</em> <em>Forras v. Rauf</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310081,4085399\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1102/\">812 F.3d 1102</extracted-citation>, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2016) ; <em>Kopff v.

As set forth below, Bauman has not satisfied the D.C. long-arm statute, and I therefore need not reach the constitutional portion of the analysis.</p><p id=\"p-21\">While D.C.'s long-arm statute enumerates over a half-dozen bases for the exercise of personal jurisdiction, <em>see</em> <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">D.C.

Heavin's Mot. to Dismiss at 6-18 [Dkt. # 24]. That provision confers personal jurisdiction over persons who commit tortious acts outside of D.C. that cause injury in the District \"if, and only if, the defendant 'regularly does or solicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from [goods used or consumed, or] services rendered' in the District.\" <em>Forras</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310081,4085399\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1102/\">812 F.3d at 1107</extracted-citation> (quoting <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">D.C. Code \u00a7 13-423</extracted-citation>(a)(4) ). Section (a)(4) does not reach to the limits of the Constitution's Due Process Clause: \"the District government has made a deliberate decision not to allow access to D.C. courts to every person who is injured here and otherwise could bring a claim for civil redress.\" <em>Kopff</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5372167\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/425/76/#p81\">425 F.Supp.2d at </extracted-citation>82 ; <em>see also</em> <em>Crane v.

Cir. 1987) (section (a)(4) does \"not occupy all of the constitutionally available space\"). Instead, in addition to injury within the District, D.C.'s long-arm statute requires what courts refer to as a \"plus factor\"-i.e., the tortfeasor regularly does business or engages in persistent conduct in, or derives substantial revenue from, the District.</p><p id=\"p-22\">According to Bauman, Heavin's \"plus factor\" is his alleged persistent course of D.C. conduct, which is shown by Heavin: (1) \"broadcast[ing] his defamatory statements via websites that were directed at D.C. and could interact with its residents\"; (2) holding a leadership position in a company <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"7\" href=\"#p7\" id=\"p7\">*7</a>called Curves North America, which Heavin founded and which maintains \"an active corporate registration in D.C.\" but no operating franchises; (3) traveling to D.C. for President Donald Trump's inauguration and perhaps also on one other occasion; (4) causing a 2012 corporate donation by Curves International-the parent company of Curves North America-to American Crossroads, a D.C.-based political action committee, and personally contributing to other D.C.-based political organizations; (5) \"routinely promot[ing] his status as a 'mover-and-shaker' \" who is in regular communication with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky; (6) claiming to be under consideration to be U.S. Ambassador to Haiti and otherwise attempting to obtain a political appointment to federal office; (7) producing and acting in a film that concerns the federal government and maintains social media accounts that on two occasions have trained their ire on nationally prominent political figures; and (8) speaking at a conference held in Maryland by a D.C.-based political organization. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Opp'n to Def. Heavin's Mot. to Dismiss at 10-16.</p><p id=\"p-23\">Unfortunately for plaintiff, the foregoing patchwork of purported D.C. conduct does not satisfy \u00a7 (a)(4) of the D.C. long-arm statute. How so? As a threshold matter, many of Heavin's supposed contacts with the District are immaterial to the personal jurisdiction analysis. There is, for example, no \"neighboring forum\" exception permitting me to consider Heavin's Maryland contacts in determining his amenability to suit in D.C. There is also no support for the proposition that merely speaking about a forum (or about entities within that forum)-e.g., producing a film about or seeking employment with the federal government, discussing one's relationships with federal government officials-can confer specific jurisdiction in the absence of identifiable forum contacts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This dearth of legal foundation might explain why Bauman posits these contacts as analytically relevant <em>without</em> citation to legal authority. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.

As the complaint makes clear, Bauman was serving as the Rich family spokesman, <em>see,</em> <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"13\" href=\"#p13\" id=\"p13\">*13</a><em>e.g.</em> , Compl. at \u00b6 1, 6, 13-that is, Bauman was \"speak[ing] as the representative of another or others ... in a professional capacity,\" <em>Spokesman</em> , Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://wwvv.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spokesman (last visited March 27, 2019). In that light, Butowsky's statements effectively conveyed his view that Bauman was not serving as a neutral purveyor of fact but instead was acting to quell the questions and debate surrounding Seth Rich's death. Reasonable consumers of political news and commentary understand that spokespeople are frequently (and often accurately) accused of putting a spin or gloss on the facts or taking an unnecessarily hostile stance toward the media or others, presumably in order to best represent their clients. And on hot-button issues of the day, spokespeople often become lightning rods themselves for such criticism.</p><p id=\"p-40\">In context, then, Butowsky's \"discredit\" and \"say anything\" statements simply reflect an oft-expressed opinion that a spokesperson on this or that side of a topical debate or controversy has gone too far. <em>See</em> <em>Washington v. Smith</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7825326\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/893/60/#p64\">893 F.Supp. 60</extracted-citation>, 64 (D.D.C. 1995) (\"readers of a sports preview magazine understand that a considerable portion of the magazine's content is subjective opinion,\" and the statement contained therein \"must be viewed in this context\"). Moreover, the excerpted articles containing the two statements show that Butowsky was quoted in direct response to Bauman's public denial of Butowsky's allegations and his suggestion that Butowsky had wronged the Rich family. Compl. at \u00b6 56, 74. Given the controversy surrounding the murder (much of it created by Butowsky himself), it may well have been <em>accurate</em> to say that Bauman's job, at least in part, was to say whatever necessary on behalf of the Rich family to \"cause disbelief in the accuracy or authority of\" Butowsky's and others' allegations. <em>See Discredit</em> , Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. As such, the statements are not provably false.</p><p id=\"p-41\">Butowsky's August 2, 2017 statement to CNN that Bauman \"should apologize to the country for crafting a lie,\" Compl. at \u00b6 74, is, however, a closer call. \"As explained by the Supreme Court, a statement such as 'I think Jones lied' can be false\" if Jones in fact did not lie or the speaker did not truly believe that Jones lied. <em>Benic v.

As discussed, Bauman was serving as a spokesman at the center of a heated public controversy over the Seth Rich murder, and he and Butowsky were sparring in the mainstream and fringe press from opposite sides of the fray. <em>See</em> <em>CACI Premier Tech., Inc. v. Rhodes</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5762587\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/280/#p304\">536 F.3d 280</extracted-citation>, 304 (4th Cir. 2008) (Duncan, J., concurring) (noting that in \"[t]he medium of talk radio,\" \"hyperbole and diatribe\" are \"preferred tools of discourse\" and expression is \"not infrequently caustic and offensive\"). Butowsky made the \"crafting a lie\" statement to a cable news reporter in response <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"14\" href=\"#p14\" id=\"p14\">*14</a>to Bauman's public criticism of him-during a live CNN interview-for failing to apologize to the Rich family and the public for continuing to stand by the conspiracy theory. Compl. at \u00b6 74 &amp; n.51. Two months earlier, Bauman had told CNN that anyone continuing to stand by the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich's death has \"a transparent political agenda or [is] a sociopath.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 6. Butowsky's statement thus was not a random affront on a private individual; it was the latest reprisal in a charged, back-and-forth public exchange between Bauman and Butowsky over Butowsky's role in spreading a conspiracy theory about Seth Rich's murder. In <em>Schnare v. Ziessow</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Fed.%20Appx.%20847\">104 Fed.Appx. 847</extracted-citation> (4th Cir. 2004), the defendant accused the plaintiff of making \"an outright lie\" in response to the plaintiff's assertion that the defendant had acted unethically. <em><extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Fed.%20Appx.%20847\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Fed.%20Appx.%20847\"> at 851</extracted-citation>. The Fourth Circuit held that the accusation of lying was not actionable because, in context, the charge was a \"vigorous and angry expression[ ] of disagreement.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Fed.%20Appx.%20847\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Similarly, in <em>Horsley v.

Random House, Inc.</em> assuages any lingering doubt about the \"crafting a lie\" statement. In that case, Lane sued a publishing company for defamation for taking out advertisements in The New York Times for a book called \"Case Closed,\" which purported to settle the longstanding controversy over who shot President John F. Kennedy by drawing the \"inescapable conclusion\" that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone. <em>Lane</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\">985 F.Supp. at 144</extracted-citation>. The advertisement included Lane's photograph-along with five other prominent Kennedy assassination theorists whose views were contradicted by the new book-and the caption \"GUILTY OF MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\"> at 144-45</extracted-citation>. The Court held that the caption was non-actionable hyperbole because it did not state any provably false facts. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\"> at 150</extracted-citation>. Instead, the statement was one of subjective belief that could not be verified (unless the Kennedy assassination controversy itself were resolved). <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\"> at 150-51</extracted-citation>. The Court rejected Lane's argument that the publication had accused him of \"public deceit\" and \"intellectual dishonesty\" and that such claims could be proven false by resort to evidence of Lane's personal veracity and integrity because again, Lane's veracity (or lack thereof) was bound up with the underlying unresolved controversy. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"58412\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/985/141/#p149\"> at 151</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-44\">While there is, of course, no real comparison to be made between the public debate over the Kennedy assassination and Seth Rich's murder, this case does share much with <em>Lane</em> . Like the Kennedy assassination, the circumstances surrounding Seth Rich's death remain unresolved. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 29. Perhaps this would be a different case if the murderer had been caught, tried, and convicted and the motive made public; the present state of play, however, effectively precludes a factual determination as to the falsity of Butowsky's statement. <em>See</em> <em>Campbell v. Citizens for an Honest Gov't, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087763\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/560/#p577\">255 F.3d 560</extracted-citation>, 577 (8th Cir. 2001) (\"[w]hile we are not aficionados of conspiracy theories, we suppose that if [defendant's] assertions are true, there would be inherent difficulties in verifying <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"15\" href=\"#p15\" id=\"p15\">*15</a>or refuting such a claim\"). To be sure, my decision in this case in no way condones Butowsky's conduct. But our Circuit Court has said that \"where the question of truth or falsity is a close one, a court should err on the side of non-actionability.\" <em>Moldea II</em> , 22 F.3d at 317. I will heed that admonition.</p><p id=\"p-45\">The remaining statements-that Bauman is a \"Democrat crisis management person\" \"assigned\" by the DNC to act as the Rich Family spokesperson, Compl. at \u00b6 53-are not defamatory. To be defamatory, a statement must not only be capable of injuring the plaintiff \"in his trade, profession or community standing\" but also goes beyond mere offensiveness to \"make the plaintiff appear odious, infamous, or ridiculous.\" <em>Competitive Enterprise</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12199289\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/1213/#p1241\">150 A.3d at 1241</extracted-citation> (internal quotation marks omitted). As with falsity, whether a statement is capable of defamatory meaning is a threshold question of law for the Court. <em>Jankovic v. Int'l Crisis Grp.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564753,6047079\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1080/\">494 F.3d 1080</extracted-citation>, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The pleadings in this case make clear that Bauman is a public relations specialist, <em>see</em> Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 22, 51, and Bauman does not appear to dispute that his work often relates to Democratic Party causes, <em>see</em> Def. Butowsky's Mot. to Dismiss at 5-6 [Dkt. # 12]; Mem. in Supp. of Def. Heavin's Mot. to Dismiss at 1 [Dkt. # 14-1]; <em>see generally</em> Pl.'s Opp'n to Def. Heavin's Mot. to Dismiss; Pl.'s Opp'n to Def. Butowsky's Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 23]. Thus, an accusation of being a \"Democrat crisis management person\" would hardly harm Bauman professionally. Indeed, it could be easily viewed by many as a badge of honor. Nor would the assertion that Bauman had been tasked by the DNC to handle communications on a matter of public interest that had quickly become politicized make him appear odious.</p><p id=\"p-46\">Of course, defamatory meaning need not be express. <em>White v. Fraternal Order of Police</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537816,3483791\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/512/\">909 F.2d 512</extracted-citation>, 518 (D.C. Cir. 1990). A statement may be defamatory by implication if \"a reasonable person could draw a defamatory inference\" from the statement. <em>Parnigoni v. St. Columba's Nursery School</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591956\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/681/1/#p15\">681 F.Supp.2d 1</extracted-citation>, 15 (D.D.C. 2010). \"In other words, defamation by implication evolves from what a statement reasonably implies.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591956\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/681/1/#p15\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Here, the overarching defamatory inference that Bauman presents is that Butowsky's statements form part of a larger narrative accusing him of working alongside the DNC to conceal criminality \"at the highest echelons,\" to cover up Seth Rich's murder, and to impede law enforcement's investigation into the murder. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 59, 75, 129. But defamation by implication requires \"an especially rigorous showing,\" as the publication \"must not only be reasonably read to impart the false innuendo, but it must also affirmatively suggest that the author intends or endorses the inference.\" <em>Guilford Transportation Industries, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11185866\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/760/580/#p597\">760 A.2d at 596</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Chapin v.

In the article on which Bauman relies, Butowsky certainly states his opinion that the DNC is engaged in nefarious activities, and he suggests that Bauman appeared at the DNC's behest and that his role is deserving of suspicion. <em>See</em> Compl. at \u00b6 53. But the facts alleged are insufficient to show that Butowsky intended, or affirmatively endorsed, the implication that Bauman's job was, as the complaint puts it, to \"execute the DNC's plan to cover up Seth Rich's murder.\" <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 4; <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em> at \u00b6 129(b) (\"assigned and paid by the DNC to serve as the Rich family spokesperson so that he could obstruct the investigation into Seth Rich's murder\"). Accordingly, Butowsky's statements, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"16\" href=\"#p16\" id=\"p16\">*16</a>although clearly hyperbolic, are not actionable in defamation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-47\"><strong>b. Remaining Causes of Action</strong></p><p id=\"p-48\">Bauman also brings claims for defamation per se and false light against Butowsky. For the reasons stated above, Bauman has not stated a claim for defamation per se, which occurs when a defendant falsely accuses the plaintiff of committing a crime or other unlawful act. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Guilford Transp. Indus., Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11185866\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/760/580/#p597\">760 A.2d at 600</extracted-citation>. Additionally, \"[w]hen a false light claim is based upon the same factual allegations as a defamation claim, the two are analyzed identically.\" <em>Parisi v.

Bauman therefore also has failed to state a false light claim.</p><p id=\"p-49\"><strong><em>CONCLUSION</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-50\">For the foregoing reasons, Heavin's Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and Butowsky's 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim are hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong> , and this case is <strong>DISMISSED</strong> as to those defendants.
