(\"Tour Technology\") commenced the above-captioned action on October 4, 2017, against Defendant RTV, Inc. (\"RTV\"), alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 6,754,400 (the \"'400 Patent\"), a system and technology for rendering an image that enables,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , an individual on a computer in a remote location to explore a 360-degree virtual view of a setting as if the individual were at that setting. ( Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) After a discussion about the appropriate venue at a pre-motion conference on February 13, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 13, 2018, adding Defendants John Does I-X and Jane Does XI-XX, photographers and customers, respectively, of RTV, and allegedly residents of New York. (Minute Entry dated Feb. 13, 2018; Am.

(Not. of Mot. to Dismiss, Docket Entry No. 21 ; Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 21-1.) Plaintiff opposes Defendant's motion. (Pl. Mem. in Opp'n to RTV's Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pl. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 24.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that venue is improper in the Eastern District of New York, and transfers this action with respect to Plaintiff's claims against RTV to the Western District of Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Tour Technology is a New York corporation, with operations in Huntington, New York. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1.) Defendant RTV is a Michigan corporation, based in Traverse City, Michigan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff owns the '400 Patent, entitled \"System and Method for Creation, Processing and Visualization of Omni-Directional Images.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the '400 Patent on June 22, 2004. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24; '400 Patent, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 18-1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   software-based technology underlying the '400 Patent enables an individual on a computer in a remote location to explore a 360-degree virtual view of an indoor or outdoor location, for example, an apartment, hotel room, restaurant, or backyard, \"in a manner ... accepted by the viewer as substantially realistic.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; '400 Patent 2.) The '400 Patent generally protects a method for creating and generating photographic images that are commonly used as online virtual tour images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   RTV presents, produces, and hosts 360-degree virtual tour content for clients. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.) The clients are alleged to be individuals and businesses in New York and other states, \"seeking to sell, rent, purchase, lease, and/or promote private residences, commercial real estate, hotels, sporting and recreation facilities, schools, event venues, country clubs, golf courses, upscale lodging facilities, restaurants, nightclubs, and healthcare facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On its website, RTV states that it \"is a recognized leader in interactive 360 panoramic virtual tours, professional photography services, and virtual tour software.\" (RTV Recent Virtual Tours webpage, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. C, Docket Entry No. 18-3.) RTV's website also states that it is a \"leading provider of virtual tour technology,\" and offers virtual tour software for real estate professionals and business entrepreneurs. (About Real Tour Vision webpage, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. D, Docket Entry No. 18-4.) Plaintiff alleges that this constitutes infringement of the '400 Patent. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of its claims, Plaintiff contends that Defendants use the patented technology to produce photographic images for virtual tours, host those images on the Internet, and/or use those images in sales and marketing activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) In particular, Plaintiff alleges that the virtual tour images that appear on the RTV website \"indicate that the images are generated by the projection of a spherical image onto faces of a cube or a process equivalent thereto,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   where the spherical image was generated by the combination of multiple images,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58), and that Defendants are thus \"literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalen[ts], directly infringing, and indirectly infringing by way of inducing infringement and/or contributing to the infringement of the '400 Patent in the State of New York,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that RTV has a \"local presence\" in the Eastern District of New York, and that the John Doe photographers are employee photographers of\n   RTV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-41, 49-51.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that John Does \"are photographers resident in this [d]istrict and/or working within this [d]istrict\" and \"employed by RTV in the business of creating images configured to be used in infringing the patent in suit and are practicing the invention which is the subject matter of the patent in suit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Plaintiff also contends that the John Doe Defendants use process steps in their photography for RTV that are covered under the claims of the '400 Patent, including \"capturing images surrounding an origin point in at least two hemispheres surrounding the origin point,\" and \"assembling the images in a digital format to create a complete spherical image surrounding the origin point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Jane Does are customers of RTV and \"are commercial enterprises practicing the invention in connection with their businesses located in and/or operating in this [d]istrict\" and \"include real estate agents advertising, using the technology of the invention, homes for sale and rent in this [d]istrict, and hotel and hospitality facilities located in this [d]istrict and advertising, using the technology of the invention, rooms available for occupancy by guest-customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In addition, Plaintiff does not allege any facts to suggest that the John or Jane Doe Defendants have a regular and established place of business in the Western District of Michigan.

The system reforms the hemi-spherical images associated with the planar images taken by the fisheye lens, using specific laws of projections, corrects the radial and geometrical distortions as well as the color and light distortions and assembles the images into a complete spherical image, which is projected on a cube. Viewing of these images creates an impression of turning around in all the directions and of rectilinear movement in virtual space. The impression created is very similar to the human eye perception of the tri-dimensional space, and it permits continuously or a successive visualization of some three-dimensional images including specific details that a user may want to examine closer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    ('400 Patent 12.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The '400 Patent covers \"[a] method for digitally rendering omni-directional images comprising of the steps of: ... assembling ... images in a digital format to create a complete spherical image ...
