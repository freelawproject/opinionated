Plaintiff\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>in his brief states the case as follows: \u201cThe wife\u2019s sickness was of a malignant character; and the physician\u2019s attendance and treatment was part of the time daily, and part of the time weekly or monthly, according as the disease advanced, or according to the wife\u2019s presence in or absence from San Francisco. The cause was tried by the court without a jury\u2014the contention being, on the part of plaintiff, that the sickness treated was continuous and the same sickness throughout the whole time, and that the statute of outlawry only began to run from the termination of the service; that the last item in the account drew after it, or took in all the preceding items because a part of the same transaction.\u201d Defendant denied the indebtedness and pleaded the statute of limitation, and his contention was that each day\u2019s service was a separate cause of action, and the statute ran from each day, as the service was rendered. The court gave judgment for five days\u2019 attendance, or only those attendances that were within the two years before the complaint was filed. The appeal is from the judgment and from an order denying motion for new trial, and comes here on a statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">1. The statement contains no assignment or specifications of errors. There- is appended to the statement, but forming no part of it, what is designated as \u201cassignment of errors,\u201d but it is not authenticated as part of the record and is excepted from the stipulation certifying to the contents of the transcript. There is nothing to show that it was considered on the motion for a new trial. The appeal from the order is here, therefore, without any specifications of errors, and cannot be considered. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 659, subd. 3; <em>Sprigg v. Barber, </em>122 Cal. 573, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\"><em>2. </em>The appeal from the judgment alone can be considered, and we are to determine only whether the findings support the judgment. The court found that plaintiff\u2019s assignor attended defendant\u2019s wife at different times \u201cwithout any express agreement with her or with defendant to attend her for any stipulated length of time, or any stipulated sum of money\u201d; that Dr. Daywalt was \u201cfree to render his account for services up to any time and collect for the same\u201d; that he charged three dollars for each visit to the house of defendant and two dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>for each visit at his office, which were reasonable charges, and that defendant\u2019s wife paid said doctor from time to time on account of his attendance, and that defendant and his said wife were free at any time to dispense with said doctor\u2019s services and employ another physician; that said doctor rendered a bill for five hundred and five dollars against defendant, no part of which has been paid; that said doctor attended plaintiff\u2019s wife on March 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st, and April 1, 1894; that plaintiff brought suit March 28, 1896; and, as conclusions of law, the court found that all the items of service rendered more than two years prior to the commencement of the action were barred by the statute of limitations, and plaintiff could only recover for services rendered on and after March 28, 1896, to wit, the sum of fifteen dollars for visits on March 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st, and April 1, 1894. Judgment was accordingly entered. The findings support the judgment; and, as we cannot examine the evidence to determine whether it supports the findings, the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">Haynes, C., and Gray, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Harrison, J., Van Dyke, J., Garoutte, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
