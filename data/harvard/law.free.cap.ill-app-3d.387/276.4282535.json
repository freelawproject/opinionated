The matter proceeded to an arbitration hearing under section 19(b) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) (820 ILCS 305/19(b) (West 2006)). The arbitrator found the claim compensable and awarded temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, medical expenses and penalties. The employer appealed to the Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (Commission), which unanimously affirmed the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The employer then sought review in the circuit court of Cook County, which subsequently confirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. The employer did not file an appeal from the order of the circuit court and began paying benefits.</p> <p id=\"b293-9\" pgmap=\"293(45) 294(97)\">On February 8, 2005, and May 11, 2005, the matter was heard by the arbitrator on the issue of the nature and extent of claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability. The arbitrator found that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled pursuant to section 8(f) of the Act. In doing so, the arbitrator excluded from evidence an independent medical examiner (IME) report issued on September 6, 2004, by Dr. Charles Slack and proffered by the employer. The report was excluded based upon the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the report had not been produced prior to the commencement of the hearing in the matter. Pursuant to Commission precedent (Marks v. Acme Industries, Inc., Ill. Ind. Comm\u2019n Rep. 02 IIC 0892 (November 22, 2002)), the arbitrator held that the commencement of the hearing began with the treating physician (Dr. Chmell) being deposed on May 7, 2004.</p> <p id=\"b294-3\" pgmap=\"294\">The employer appealed to the Commission, which affirmed and adopted the decision of the arbitrator with one dissent (Commissioners Pigott and DeMunno in the majority, with Commissioner Lindsey dissenting). In her dissent, Commissioner Lindsey distinguished the instant matter from Marks, noting that, unlike Marks, in the instant case the IME had not issued a report until after the treating physician\u2019s deposition. Further, Commissioner Lindsey criticized Marks as being wrongly decided.</p> <p id=\"b294-4\" pgmap=\"294\">The employer then sought review in the circuit court of Cook County, which confirmed the decision of the Commission. We reverse.</p> <p id=\"b294-5\" pgmap=\"294\">At issue here is whether the Commission erred in excluding the IME report of Dr. Charles Slack, issued on September 6, 2004, because it was not disclosed to the claimant prior to the May 7, 2004, commencement of the treating physician\u2019s deposition. The parties dispute the appropriate standard of review. The claimant maintains that the issue involves an evidentiary ruling, which is to be upheld unless it is an abuse of discretion. Homebrite Ace Hardware v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 351 Ill. App. 3d 333, 337 (2004). The employer maintains that the appropriate standard of review is de novo, as what is at issue is whether Dr. Slack\u2019s report is barred by section 12 of the Act. We note that resolution of the matter involves a question of statutory construction, and the appropriate standard of review is de novo (King v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 189 Ill. 2d 167, 171 (2000)); we therefore review de novo.</p> <p id=\"b294-6\" pgmap=\"294\"> Our analysis begins with section 12 of the Act, which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"AIc\" pgmap=\"294\">\u201cIn all cases where the examination is made by a surgeon engaged by the employer, and the injured employee has no surgeon present at such examination, it shall be the duty of the surgeon making the examination at the instance of the employer to deliver to the injured employee, or his representative, a statement in writing of the condition and extent of the injury to the same extent that said surgeon reports to the employer, *** said copy to be furnished the employee, or his representative as soon as practicable but not later than 48 hours before the time the case is set for hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 820 ILCS 305/12 (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b295-2\" pgmap=\"295\">The facts in the instant matter are not in dispute. After an initial hearing to determine causation, the employer paid TTD and medical. The claimant continued to treat for his injuries. The parties began discussing a settlement regarding permanency; however, these discussions were unsuccessful. The claimant scheduled an evidence deposition with his treating physician, Dr. Chmell, which took place by agreement of the parties on May 24, 2004. At the time of the deposition, a hearing before an arbitrator was anticipated, although a hearing date had yet to be set. The matter remained pending for several months following Dr. Chmell\u2019s deposition, without a hearing date being set.</p> <p id=\"b295-3\" pgmap=\"295\">Still with no date set for a hearing before an arbitrator, the employer scheduled an independent medical examination as provided in section 12 of the Act, with Dr. Slack, which took place on August 26, 2004. We find no indication in the record that the claimant\u2019s attorney objected to the IME, and the claimant, in fact, appeared for the IME on August 26, 2004. At that time, Dr. Slack issued a report in conjunction with his examination, dated September 6, 2004. This report was tendered to the claimant\u2019s attorney on September 20, 2004. In a letter to claimant\u2019s counsel, the employer\u2019s counsel asked if claimant would stipulate to the admission of Dr. Slack\u2019s report, or whether claimant would wish to depose Dr. Slack. The employer received no response.</p> <p id=\"b295-4\" pgmap=\"295\">The matter was called for hearing before an arbitrator on February 8, 2005. After testimony and certain exhibits were admitted, the employer attempted to have admitted as evidence Dr. Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report. The claimant objected, citing the Commission decision Marks v. ACME Industries, which is a Commission decision standing for the proposition that the \u201chearing\u201d referred to in section 12 of the Act (\u201c48 hours before the case is set for the hearing\u201d) is the treating physician\u2019s deposition. The arbitrator rejected the Slack report as being in violation of section 12 of the Act, as interpreted in the Marks decision. The arbitrator then concluded that, since Dr. Chmell\u2019s opinions as to permanency were unrebutted (due to the exclusion of Dr. Slack\u2019s report), the claimant was permanently and totally disabled.</p> <p id=\"b295-5\" pgmap=\"295\">The matter was appealed to the Commission, which affirmed and adopted the arbitrator\u2019s decision, with one dissent. The circuit court confirmed, and the employer appealed.</p> <p id=\"b295-6\" pgmap=\"295(52) 296(77)\">On appeal, the employer maintains that Dr. Slack\u2019s report should have been admitted as it complied with section 12 of the Act, notwithstanding the Marks decision. At the outset, we note one important factual distinction between the instant matter and the facts in Marks. In Marks, the employer had the examining physician\u2019s report in hand prior to the treating physician\u2019s deposition, but failed to provide a copy of the report to the claimant until after the conclusion of the treating physician\u2019s deposition. Here, Dr. Slack\u2019s report did not even exist at the time of Dr. Chmell\u2019s deposition. In fact, the claimant participated without objection in Dr. Slack\u2019s examination, and Dr. Slack\u2019s report was tendered only a few days after the examination and well before the arbitration hearing.</p> <p id=\"b296-3\" pgmap=\"296\"> The employer urges this court to ignore the Commission\u2019s decision in Marks and focus instead upon this court\u2019s decision in Ghere v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 278 Ill. App. 3d 840 (1996). In Ghere, the issue was whether the \u201c48-hour prior to hearing\u201d disclosure required in section 12 applied to treating physicians\u2019 reports as well as examining physicians. In holding that section 12 did in fact apply to treating physicians\u2019 reports, this court noted clearly that the \u201chearing\u201d referred to in section 12 was the \u201carbitration hearing.\u201d The Ghere court noted that the purpose of the 48-hour rule was to prevent surprise medical testimony at the arbitration hearing:</p> <blockquote id=\"b296-4\" pgmap=\"296\">\u201cWe believe the purpose of section 12 would be frustrated if we read section 12 to only apply to examining physicians. It seems to us from the language of section 12 that the purpose in having the employee\u2019s physician send a copy of his records to the employer no later than 48 hours prior to the arbitration hearing is to prevent the employee from springing surprise medical testimony on the employer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ghere, 278 Ill. App. 3d at 845.</blockquote> <p id=\"b296-5\" pgmap=\"296\">Given this court\u2019s prior determination that the purpose of section 12 is to prevent surprise medical testimony at the arbitration hearing, the Commission\u2019s ruling in Marks that the \u201chearing\u201d referred to in section 12 is the treating physician\u2019s deposition is completely at odds with this court\u2019s statement of the purpose of section 12. The Commission\u2019s decision to exclude Dr. Slack\u2019s report was error as a matter of law. We note that had Dr. Slack\u2019s report been completed but withheld until after Dr. Chmell\u2019s deposition, the outcome may have been different.</p> <p id=\"b296-6\" pgmap=\"296\">We therefore reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision confirming the Commission\u2019s decision excluding Dr. Slack\u2019s report pursuant to section 12 of the Act as being error as a matter of law and remand for further proceedings before the Commission.</p> <p id=\"b296-7\" pgmap=\"296\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b296-8\" pgmap=\"296\">McCULLOUGH, P.J., and GEOMETER and DONOVAN, JJ., concur.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b297-2\" pgmap=\"297\">JUSTICE ROBERT E. GORDON,</author> <p id=\"ARt\" pgmap=\"297\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b297-3\" pgmap=\"297\">I agree with the result reached by the majority, but I write separately to more fully address the issues raised by the parties.</p> <p id=\"b297-4\" pgmap=\"297\">In refusing to allow the employer to introduce into evidence Dr. Charles Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report, the arbitrator, whose decision in this regard was adopted by the Commission, found that the \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d in this matter began when the claimant\u2019s treating physician was deposed on May 7, 2004. As Dr. Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report was not tendered to the claimant until after the treating physician\u2019s deposition, the arbitrator concluded that the September 6, 2004, report was barred under section 12 of the Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) (820 ILCS 305/12 (West 2004)).</p> <p id=\"b297-5\" pgmap=\"297\">The relevant portion of section 12 of the Act provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b297-6\" pgmap=\"297\">\u201cIn all cases where the examination is made by a surgeon engaged by the employer, and the injured employee has no surgeon present at such examination, it shall be the duty of the surgeon making the examination at the instance of the employer to deliver to the injured employee, or his representative, a statement in writing of the condition and extent of the injury to the same extent that said surgeon reports to the employer and the same shall be an exact copy of that furnished to the employer, said copy to be furnished the employee, or his representative as soon as practicable but not later than 48 hours before the time the case is set for hearing. *** If such surgeon refuses to furnish the employee with such statement to the same extent as that furnished the employer said surgeon shall not be permitted to testify at the hearing next following said examination.\u201d 820 ILCS 305/12 (West 2004).</blockquote> <p id=\"b297-7\" pgmap=\"297\">Section 12 of the Act explicitly states that an examining physician\u2019s report must be provided to the injured employee no later than 48 hours before the start of a hearing and that, if the report is not disclosed, the examining physician will not be allowed to testify. The Act, however, fails to define \u201chearing\u201d or \u201ctestify.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b297-8\" pgmap=\"297\">The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Comprehensive Community Solutions, Inc. v. Rockford School District No. 205, 216 Ill. 2d 455, 473, 837 N.E.2d 1 (2005). The best indication of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. People ex rel. Ryan v. Agpro, Inc., 214 Ill. 2d 222, 226, 824 N.E.2d 270 (2005). Where, as in this case, the terms of a statute are undefined, they are given their plain and ordinary meaning. Price v. Philip Morris, Inc., 219 Ill. 2d 182, 243, 848 N.E.2d 1 (2005).</p> <p id=\"b297-9\" pgmap=\"297(21) 298(76)\">A \u201chearing\u201d is generally defined as \u201csynonymous with trial.\u201d Donovan v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 125 Ill. App. 3d 445, 449, 465 N.E.2d 1071 (1984). Therefore, given its plain and ordinary meaning, a hearing begins when the parties start to present their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator, not with the taking of an evidence deposition. See In re Marriage of Wright, 92 Ill. App. 3d 708, 710, 415 N.E.2d 1196 (1980) (rejecting a claim that a trial begins with the taking of an evidence deposition), vacated as moot, 89 Ill. 2d 498, 434 N.E.2d 293 (1982).</p> <p id=\"b298-3\" pgmap=\"298\">In this case, it is undisputed that Dr. Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report was tendered to the claimant more than 48 before the arbitration hearing commenced on February 8, 2005. Accordingly, the employer complied with section 12 of the Act, and the September 6, 2004, report should not have been excluded.</p> <p id=\"b298-4\" pgmap=\"298\">Furthermore, Dr. Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report should not have been barred because the report is not testimony. According to section 12 of the Act, if an examining physician fails to furnish a report to the injured employee, the physician \u201cshall not be permitted to testify.\u201d 820 ILCS 305/12 (West 2004). \u201cTestimony\u201d is commonly defined as \u201c[ejvidence that a competent witness under oath or affirmation gives at trial or in an affidavit or deposition.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1485 (7th ed. 1999). As the September 6, 2004, report was not made under oath or affirmation, it cannot be considered \u201ctestimony\u201d and, therefore, is not subject to exclusion under section 12 of the Act.</p> <p id=\"b298-5\" pgmap=\"298\">Finally, I do not believe that Dr. Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report was merely commutative of evidence already before the arbitrator and the Commission. Although a previous report from Dr. Slack, dated December 15, 2002, was admitted into evidence, the basis for Dr. Slack\u2019s opinions differed in the two reports. In his September 6, 2004, report, Dr. Slack analyzed nearly two years of additional treatment and testing. Consequently, I cannot say that the improper exclusion of Dr. Slack\u2019s September 6, 2004, report was harmless error. Cf. Greaney v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 358 Ill. App. 3d 1002, 1013, 832 N.E.2d 331 (2005) (\u201cWhen erroneously admitted evidence is cumulative and does not otherwise prejudice the objecting party, error in its admission is harmless\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b298-6\" pgmap=\"298\">For these reasons, I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the cause for further proceedings before the Commission.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
