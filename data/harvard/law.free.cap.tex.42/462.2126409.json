The statute does not prescribe that the party from wham an attack is feared must be actually present before preparation is made for self-defense. It is easy to imagine circumstances under which the danger might be most imminent, though the person from whom it was threatened was not immediately present. The court should. have admitted the evidence and submitted the defense as a question of fact to the jury, giving them, of course, proper instructions as to the meaning of the statute. In reversing and remanding the cause for this error, it is proper to call attention to the indictment under which the ruling in the case of The State <em>v. </em>Duke, just decided, is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
