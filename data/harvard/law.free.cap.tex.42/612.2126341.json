That this lot was liable, under and by virtue of the city charter, and the ordinances passed thereunder by the City Council, to be assessed for one-third of the cost of improving that portion of the said street, which fronts, adjoins, and is opposite to the said lot (not counting the intersections of streets which is paid for by the city alone). That the said street, including that portion which fronts, adjoins, and is opposite to the said lot, was improved by being \u201c shelled \u201d by the city of Galveston, which improvement was finished and completed by the city on the 19th day of July, 1872. That on' the \u2014 day of July, 1872, the sum of two hundred and eight dollars and fifty-four cents was r\u00e9gularly and legally assessed against the said lot; the said assessment being one-third of the cost of improving by \u201c shelling \u201d that portion of the said street which fronts, adjoins, and is opposite to the said lot. That the said assessment was to be paid in five equal annual installments; the first of which was due and payable upon the completion of the said improvement, and the others were due and payable annually thereafter, with interest from date of assessment till paid, at the rate of ten per centum per annum.

(Alabama, Section 36, Article 4; Section 1, Article 12; Arkansas, Section 46, 47, and 49, Article 5; California, Sections 31 and 37, Article 4; Florida, Sections 17 and 22, Article 4; Georgia, Section 28, Article 1; Illinois, Section 9, Article 9; Iowa, Section 30, Article 3; Kansas, Section 5, Article 12; Maryland, Section 48, Article 3; Michigan, Section 38, Article 4; Missouri, Sections 5, 8, and 14, Article 11; Nevada, Section 8; Article 8; North Carolina, Section 7, Article 7; New York, Section 1, Article 8, Section 9, Article 8; Ohio, Section 6, Article 13; Oregon, Section 5, Article 11; South Carolina, Sections 8 and 9, Article 9; Tennessee, Section 29, Article 2; Virginia, Section 20, Article 6; West Virginia, Section 9, Article 10; Wisconsin, Section 3, Article 11.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-5\">The Constitution of Michigan gives power to Legislature to incorporate cities and towns, and to confer on them such legislative powers as it deemed necessary. (Dillon, Section 145.) Other States, as appears from the same authority, have similar provisions in their Constitutions\u2014that of Kentucky, Ohio, and Louisiana. But in the Constitution of the State of Texas not one word is said about giving other powers to corporate municipal bodies than the Legislature itself can exercise within the limits of the State. The School Boards may have such legislative powers conferred on them as the Legislature may deem necessary, but not cities and towns. The wording of the restrictive clauses of our Constitution covers the whole limit of the State to its fullest extent. Section 19, Article 12, says: \u201c All property in the State shall be taxed in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as directed bylaw; \u201d and further, <em>\u201c </em>taxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the State.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-6\">Now, defendant submits that under this rule the Legislature cannot levy special taxes on property, by size or quality,, not having regard to value, nor, unless authorized by some other provision of the Constitution, can they authorize a creature of their own creation to do what they are forbidden to do themselves. (41 Georgia,-21; 45 Alabama, 310.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>If the court will examine the Constitution they will find no such provision, and the only places where cities are mentioned is the second clause of Article 5, and Section 25 of Article 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-4\">If the nineteenth Section of Article 12 means what it says, it applies in the State as well within the limits of cities and towns as outside of them. The city is only a creature of the Legislature, and can it be <em>given by its </em>creator <em>greater </em>powers than the creator is authorized to exercise itself <em>% </em>The decisions in other States can have no effect on this, unless it is shown that the Constitutions under which they were made were like ours in this particular, that the power of the Legislature over the subject of taxation is the same in the city as it is in the country, unless the Constitution makes a different rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\">Where the Legislature have granted a charter to a city in this State, prior to the late war, with powers not strictly authorized by the Constitution, before taking effect to change the general law, it was submitted to the people, and if accepted by them they became parties to it, and consented to the provisions which, without their consent, would have been contrary to.the bill of rights and the clauses and articles on the subject of taxation. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, Articles 5280, 5251, 5252.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-6\">This very charter, which is claimed to be superior in power to the Legislature itself, was so submitted to the people by the Legislature of 1866, which had not been imbued with the doctrine that unlimited powers in localities within the State, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, could be imposed on the people without their consent, and when the people examined the charter and saw the enormity of powers granted, they voted it down by an overwhelming majority. (The charter is set out in Special Laws of 1866, page 307, Section 107.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-7\">The Legislature of 1871, under the present Constitution, imposed it on the people, with enlarged powers, and, without their consent, it became a law, and took effect from and. after its passage, and was declared a public law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-8\">The citizens of Galveston, therefore, cannot be construed to be parties to this charter, and so bound by its provisions. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>expressed their decided dissent when granted the opportunity, and accepted it, as the whole people accepted reconstruction, because they could not help themselves. (30 Texas, 604; Paschal\u2019s Digest, 5280, 5251, 5252.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-5\">And defendant submits that, being a public law, and passed by the Legislature under a Constitution that covers the citizens of Texas within its limits with its <em>cegis, </em>it cannot, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, levy and impose taxes, otherwise than in proportion to value, and equal and uniform in its operation on all the citizens throughout the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-6\">It is contended that the Legislature\u2019s powers are only restricted by the Constitution, and that it has all powers of government not restricted by the Constitution; then, by the bill of rights and general provisions, the power to apply a citizen\u2019s property for a public use, without his consent, without just compensation, is withheld from the general powers of government, and any law authorizing taxation otherwise than in proportion to value, and equal and uniform -in the limits of Texas, whether in city or country, is void, \u201cand all laws'contrary to \u201cthe following provisions shall be void (Section 23, bill of \u201c rights), and these assessments claimed in this suit are to be \u201cimposed, levied, and assessed as taxes.\u201d (Constitution, Section 9, Article 12. See also Section 32, Article 12.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-7\">* ** * In this charter, where strict provision to avoid debt is made, and bonds for this work are restricted to the amount required for two streets paved otherwise than with shells. In July, 1871, the City Council start this work, to be paid for in bonds, which are only authorized to be issued to pay for the two thoroughfares to be paved \u201c otherwise than \u201c with shells,\u201d and prosecute their work to completion without assessments. Is there any power in the charter to borrow money and issue bonds, and make a debt on the city for this work ? Search it through, and not one scrap or sign of such right is given; the contract to pay in bonds for this work was <em>ultra vires </em>and void. (Mayor <em>v. </em>Ray, U. S.

Defendant\u2019s plea, of this different mode for paving the streets with shells and paying for it with bonds, made a charge on the general revenue, instead of a burden on the property (as in the bonds authorized in the second proviso to the first article of title ninth), was ruled out by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-8\">Now defendant submits that, as the Council disregarded the charter in creating this debt and in trying to impose it on the property, that the act of the Legislature was necessary to issue the bonds to pay for this work, and that the Council having paid for it in these bonds, which are by the very terms of their issue to be paid out of the general revenue, the Council have no power to levy the cost also, on the particular property; as it is now (following defendant\u2019s construction of the situation), this work was done <em>ultra vires, </em>and is now paid for by the whole city, and the general fund charged with its cost by the law authorizing the issue, and the Council have no power over it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b630-9\"><em>Walter L.

Said amount being for one installment on said assessment for the payment of which appellee claims a lien on said lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">As there is no statement of facts in the record, we can consider only such of the errors assigned as relate to the action of the court in overruling the exceptions to the petition, or as brings in question its sufficiency to warrant the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">There is in the record a bill of exceptions, which seems to have been intended by appellant, and which no doubt he supposed would serve, as a statement of facts, as well as a bill of exceptions. Evidently, however, it can not be so treated or considered. In the first place, it does not distinctly purport or state that it contains all the evidence adduced on the trial of the cause. But if it did, the objection to it would not be obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A bill of exceptions and statement of facts are alike intended to be incorporated into and become parts of the record of the case. Still they are altogether different in their character and purposes, as well as in the manner of their preparation and authentication. The first serves to perpetuate in the record the ruling of the court to which the party presenting the bill excepts. Only such facts are set out in it, as are necessary for the proper understanding of the action of the court to which the exception is taken. In its preparation and completion the opposite party has no necessary connection, and is frequently not even cognizant of its contents until it has become a part of the record. While the latter is intended to embody in the record all the evidence introduced on the trial, as agreed to by the parties and approved by the court; or if the parties fail \u25a0to agree, as certified to by the court after examining the statements prepared by them respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In our liberal practice; discarding mere matters of form, the statement of facts may be made to serve the purpose also of a bill of exceptions ; for the reason that it bears upon its face the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>concurrent assent of the parties and the court. But as-this is not necessarily the case witli a hill of exceptions, and as it does not ordinarily purport to be authenticated in the manner requisite for the authenticity of a statement of facts, it cannot be so regarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We are led to inake these comments to guard, in other cases, against a similar mistake. It is an oversight into which counsel have fallen, no doubt, by reason of the liberality and freedom in our practice and procedure in respect to mere matters of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">It is claimed by appellant that the charter of the city of Galveston does not authorize any part of the cost of improving its streets with shells to be assessed on the property fronting on the street. In support of this proposition it is said that it is only two-thirds of the cost of improving such streets as, under the charter, may be paved otherwise, than with shells, which may be assessed against the property fronting on said street; while the cost of improving the streets by shells must, it is claimed, be defrayed by the city from its general revenue. We are of opinion,-however, the plain language of the charter is a complete answer to this objection to the petition. Authority is given by the charter to the city council, to grade, shell, repair, pave, or otherwise improve any avenue, street, or alley, or any portion thereof within the limits of the city, whenever, by a vote of two-thirds of the aldermen present, they may deem such improvement for the public interest, provided that the city pay one-third and the owners of the property two-thirds thereof, except the intersection of the streets, which is to he paid for by the city alone. This general power of improving the streets is limited by a proviso that not more than two thoroughfares, within certain designated limits, shall be paved otherwise than with shells within any period of two years. But this does not limit the authority given the city to improve any of the streets with shells when deemed, by two-thirds of the aldermen present, for the public interest, or alter the rule laid down in the charter, apportioning, between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>city and the owners of lots fronting on the street, the cost of improving it with shells. BTor do we think the power given by the charter to assess two-thirds of the cost of the improvements upon the owners of the lots taken from the city by the Act of December 2, 1871, authorizing the city <em>\u201c </em>to issue bonds to pay \u201c its overdue debt, to improve its streets by grading, shelling, \u201c paving, and repairing the same, and building culverts, break- \u201c waters,\u201d etc., etc. There is, so far as we can see, no necessary conflict in the provisions of the charter as to this matter and this statute. It purports to be a grant of power to the city, and not a limitation or restriction upon its existing powers.</p>\n<p id=\"ACAx\">It is also insisted by appellant that a tax cannot be levied by the Legislature, or under authority conferred by it, unless it is equal and uniform through the State or district to which it applies, and that it must be in proportion to the value of the property subject to the levy. The views of the court in regard to the constitutional provisions providing for and regulating the levy and assessment of <em>ad valorem </em>and other taxes for purposes of general revenue, have been fully expressed in cases recently decided, and need not be here repeated. That the authority for making assessments for local improvements is derivable from and in exercise of the taxing power, and not that of eminent domain, can not, we think, admit of question. (People <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc., of Brooklyn, 4 N. Y., 419.) If, then, this charge against appellant for one-third of the cost of improving the street on which his lot fronts is to be regarded as a property-tax within the meaning of the Constitution (Article 12, Section 19), it must be held invalid because it is'not contemplated by the charter authorizing it, and, in fact, is not susceptible, under the ordinance by which it is made, of being assessed as a property-tax for general revenue as required to be by the Constitution. (Article 12, Section 28) We cannot hesitate to. say, however, that it has been so frequently decided, that there can be no question that it is now clearly settled by the great weight of authority, that the constitutional provisions having reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>to taxes for general revenue are not applicable to assessments like this for.local improvements. We are not prepared to dissent from the conclusions reached ip the numerous cases in which it has been thus held, under similar constitutional provisions as with us, until stronger reasons and better authority for so doing than we have yet seen shall be shown us.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In discussing this- subject it is said by Judge Cooley (Const. Lim., p. 497): \u201c But, in addition to these cases, there are others \u201c where taxes are levied directly on property, which are, never- \u201c theless, held not to be within the constitutional provisions. \u201c Assessments for the opening, making, improving or repairing \u201c of streets, the draining of swamps, and the like local works, \u201c have been generally made upon property with some reference \u201c to the supposed benefits which the property would receive \u201c therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ArS2\">\u201c The Constitution of California requires,\u201d says Judge Dillon (Mun. Corps., Secs. 499, 501), \u201c that taxation shall be equal \u201c and uniform throughout the State,\u201d and that \u201c all property in \u201c the State shall be taxed in proportion to its value,\u201d still it is held that the word taxation, as here used, refers <em>to the </em>general taxes to defray the ordinary expenses of the State and its subordinate local governments, and not to assessments for local improvements. \u201c That assessments, though a branch of the tax- \u201c ing power, need not necessarily be exercised on the <em>ad </em>\u201c <em>valorem </em>principle, but the Legislature is at liberty to adopt a \u201c different basis of apportionment, such as frontage, benefits \u201c received, or superficial contents.\u201d (Emory <em>v. </em>Cass Co., 28 Cal., 345.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">\u201c So in Missouri, it is held that assessments against adjacent \u201c owners for benefits received from opening, etc., of streets are \u201c a valid exercise of the taxing power, and do not contravene \u201cthe provisions of the Constitution <em>\u2018 </em>that all property subject \u201cc to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value.\u2019 \u201d (Garret <em>v. </em>St. Louis, 25 Mo., 405.) Like decisions have been made in Louisiana, Kansas, and Kentucky, and in many of the other States. (See Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>590-603, and numerous cases cited in the notes to these sections.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The other objections to the petition are not deemed of sufficient importance to require any special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Other questions of much interest have been discussed, which we are not authorized to consider in the absence of a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
