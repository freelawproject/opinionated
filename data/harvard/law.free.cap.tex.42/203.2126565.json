Appellee Fawcett received the certificate of election, and appellant, on the 28th day of February, 1874, being after the -expiration of thirty days from the return day, brought this suit to vacate said certificate, claiming that he'was himself elected, having received a majority of the votes cast by the qualified voters of the precinct. By an amended petition, filed April 13th, 1874, he alleged, that within thirty days after the election, he, in writing, duly notified defendant, as would appear in the trial, that he would contest the validity of his certificate of election, stating the grounds on which he relied ; but does not state, nor does the record otherwise show, how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>said notice was served, nor that a copy of the same had been filed with the clerk of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Appellee excepted to the petition, on the ground that the mode prescribed by law for contesting elections had not been pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The exceptions were sustained and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The act regulating contested elections (Gren. Laws of 1873, p. 67), is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u201cSec. 1. That any person intending to contest the election of \u201c any one holding a certificate of election to any office in this State, \u201c shall within thirty days after the return day, give him notice \u201c thereof, in writing, and deliver to him, his agent, or attorney, \u201c a written statement of the grounds on which he relies to sus- \u201c tain such contest, and the person holding said certificate of \u201c election, shall, within ten days after receiving such notice, de- \u201c liver, or cause to be delivered to said contestant, his reply to \u201c said statement, and such notice, statement, and reply, shall be \u201c served on the parties in person, if they can be found ; if not, \u201c upon their agent, or attorney, or by leaving the same with some \u201c person over the age of sixteen years, at the usual place of abode, \u201c or business of the party upon whom they are to be served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u201c Sec. 2. If the contest be for the validity of an election for \u201c any district or county office, a copy of the notices and other \u201c papers served on the parties, shall be filed with the clerk of \u201c the District Court of the county in which the residence of the \u201c party holding the certificate of election is ; and when so filed, \u201c the entry of the trial of said contest shall be made upon the <em>\u201c </em>docket of said court, the same as other causes, and shall be \u201c tried at the next term of said District Court, and upon the <em>\u201c </em>rules governing proceedings in other causes, etc.\u201d There are other provisions in the act, which also repeals all former laws relating to contested elections, but enough has been quoted for the purposes of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The case of Lindsay <em>v. </em>Luckett (20 Texas, 516) was decided under a statute containing substantially the same provisions in regard to notices and the filing of copies (Pas. Dig., Arts. 607, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>608, 609), except that the contest for county officers was to be in the County or Commissioners\u2019 Court. The court held that the \u201c notice and statement of the grounds of contest filed with the \u201c clerk, are made the predicate on which the power of the court \u201cis set in motion.\u201d We regard that case as conclusive of this. It is contended by appellant, however, that the District Court, under the constitution, having jurisdiction \u201cof all suits, complaints, and pleas whatever, without regard to any distinction \u201c between law and equity, when the matter in controversy shall \u201c be valued at; or amount to one hundred dollars, exclusive of \u201c interest,\u201d has jurisdiction to try cases of contested elections, independent of the statute. It is true that the District Court has jurisdiction, as has been often held, to try the right to an office. (Banton <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 Texas, 402; Bradley <em>v. </em>McCrabb, Dallam, 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">To decide the result of an election is a question of a different character, \u201cpart of the process of political organization, and \u201c not a question of private right.\u201d (Huselman <em>v. </em>Rems, 41 Penn. St. Repts., 396; and see Arbury <em>v. </em>Beavers, 6 Texas, 469, and Baker <em>v. </em>Chisholm, 3 Texas, 157; Walker <em>v. </em>Tarrant Co., 20 Texas, 16.) Where the law has provided a mode of deciding cases of contested elections, designed to be final, the courts have no authority to adjudicate such cases, other than that the law may give to them. (Batman <em>v. </em>McGowan, 1 Metcalf, 533; Grier <em>v. </em>Shackelford, 3 Brevord, 490; Skerrett\u2019s Case, 2 Parsons, 509, as reported in Brightly\u2019s Lead. Cases on Elections, p. 320; Ewing <em>v. </em>Filley, 43 Penn. St., 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The. case of McKinney <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 26 Texas, 5, is cited in support of the constitutional jurisdiction of the District Court over cases of contested elections. The statute then in force authorized the trial of such cases in the District Court by the judge, and also gave the right of appeal to the Superior Court. The <em>decision </em>was that these courts had the right to hear and determine the cause. Some allusions are made in the opinion to the constitutional jurisdiction of the District Court, the object of which is not very clear, but certainly nothing is decided in conflict with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The law has provided in what way elections may be contested, with the evident design that no other shall be .pursued. The jurisdiction of the District Court was dependent upon compliance with the pre-requisites prescribed by the law ; and as the record does not show such compliance, we think the case was correctly dismissed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
