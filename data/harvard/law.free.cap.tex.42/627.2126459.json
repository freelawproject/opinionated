That said ordinance was the only one for the assessment and collection of city taxes in existence, until the enactment and passage of an ordinance for the assessment and collection of taxes on 4tli June, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-7\">By Branch T.

E. </em>Trezevant, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN7iB\">It does not appear from plaintiff\u2019s petition that the city of Galveston had any power to create the bridge debt. It appears on the contrary that it had no such power; that the creation of the said debt was <em>uli/i'a vires. </em>It is submitted that the Act of the Legislature could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>not, under Section 14, Article 1, of the Constitution of 1845, forbidding the enactment of retroactive laws, have the effect to give the city the power to lev}7 a tax to pay interest, etc., on bonds issued without authority of law ; certainly not on those bonds issued before the passage of said act. (Sedgwick, 143, notes.).</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-5\">Appellant demurred specially that plaintiff\u2019s petition does not allege what amount of bonds were issued, nor what bonds, if any, are outstanding liabilities against the city of Galveston.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-6\">The petition should have contained this allegation, so that the court might know whether or not the issuance of the bonds was excessive, or was for the proper amount and in accordance witli the contract for the construction of the bridge; so that the court* might know whether or not there was a subsisting debt against the city for the payment of which the tax was levied ; so that the court know whether or not the power of the city to levy the tax had been exhausted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-7\">The allegation that the collection of the tax is necessary and essential to pay the said debt and interest, is only the opinion of the pleader, and gives no information as to the necessity for the collection of the tax sued for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-8\">Appellant demurred specially, in substance, that the levy of the tax of one per cent, and one-fourth of one per cent, is in excess of the limit prescribed by Section 1, Article 1, Title 5, of the Charter. That Section is as follows : <em>\u201c </em>The City Council <em>\u201c </em>shall have power, within the city, by ordinance, to annually <em>\u201c </em>levy and collect taxes, not exceeding one per cent, on the as- \u201c sessed value of all real and personal estate and property in <em>\u201c </em>the city,\u201d etc., etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-9\">It is evident that in this restriction upon the taxing power of the city, the Legislature considered that the exercise of the power within the limit prescribed w*as all-sufficient for the legitimate purposes and wants of the city, then existing, and that might thereafter arise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-10\">It is submitted that, if the bridge tax be held to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>legally levied, then under this restriction in the charter, the City Council had no authority to levy for general purposes for the year 1871 a tax exceeding three-fourths of one per cent. (Dillon, Sections 610 and 107.) And that the tax of one per cent, being in excess of the limit prescribed by the charter, the levy is illegal and void, and the city has no right to re-' cover this tax or any part of it. See Joyner <em>v. </em>Egremont, 3 Cush., 567, which was a suit to recover a tax levied in excess of the limit prescribed by law, and therefore held illegal. See also numerous cases cited in Cooley, 519, and Blackwell on Tax Titles, 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-4\">We propose to discuss next our second assignment of error, which is, that the court erred in admitting as evidence the ordinance as set forth in chapters on page-\u2014.of the Devised Code of Ordinances. * * * _ * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-5\">Again, as appears from the statement of facts, there was no ordinance for the assessment and collection of taxes other than the ordinance of May 7, 1866, until June 4, 1872. This ordinance, passed May 7, 1866, is in conflict with, and repugnant to, the present charter in every particular, and from the beginning to the end of it, and was repealed by the present charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-6\">It was either under the ordinance as originally passed, May 7, 1866, or under that ordinance as changed and mutilated by the compiler, that the assessment roll of taxes for the year 1871 was made. It was under this ordinance that the value of defendant\u2019s property was fixed at ten thousand seven hundred dollars, and the tax for general purposes was assessed against him at one hundred and seven dollars, and bridge tax at twenty-six dollars and seventy-five cents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-7\">Without this assessment, or a proper assessment, the city of Galveston had no right of action against appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-8\">This is true both upon reason and authority. (R. R. Co. v. Com., 1 Bush., 250; Shewalter <em>v. </em>Brown, 35 Miss., 423; People <em>v. </em>Hastings, 29 Cal., 449, approved in Reily <em>v. </em>Lancaster, 39 Cal., 354; Hews <em>v. </em>Rice, 40 Cal., 255; Blackwell on Tax Titles, chaos. 5 and 6.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Walter L. Mann, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b642-5\">Moore, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">It is unnecessary to give any special consideration to the action of the court-on the exceptions to the petition. Our views on the questions presented by it will be sufficiently manifest in the consideration given to other points, in the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Ho valid objection has, we think, been shown to the levy of such taxes by the city as are authorized by its charter, nor was the objection to the authority of the officer by whom the assessment was made well taken. The repeal of the former charter by the present Act incorporating the city of Galveston, did not operate as an 'immediate and absolute repeal and obliteration of all ordinances adopted by the city, under and while its former charter was in full force and effect. Only such of these ordinances as were in conflict with or i-epugnant to the new charter were superseded by it. The mere change of the officer upon whom duties provided for and regulated in an ordinance were devolved, in no way affected the validity of such ordinance, or annulled its provisions. Its requirements and the purposes it was ordained to effect, in all essential particulars, were as necessary for the interest and well-being of the corporation after the new charter was granted as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Hor has anything been shown to induce us to question the validity of what are termed the \u201c bridge bonds.\u201d The creation of\" the debt, and issuance of the bonds, if not expressly authorized in the charter of the city, then in force, was nevertheless expressly sanctioned and approved by an Act of the Legislature. The Legislature was not restrained from authorizing the levy of taxes to pay the interest and principal of such bonds by the constitutional inhibition against the passage of reti\u2019oactive laws. It cannot be maintained that the debt was not in furtherance of a corporation purpose. It was not, therefore, <em>ultrra vires, </em>and such a one as could not be created by the corporation with the sanction of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We are, however, of opinion, the taxes levied under the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>nance exceeded the limit of authority conferred by its charter on the city. Section 1, Article 1, of Title 5, of the present charter, reads : \u201c The City Council shall have power within, the \u201c city by ordinance, to annually levy and collect taxes, not <em>\u201c </em>exceeding one per cent, on the assessed value of all real and \u201c personal estate and property in the city, not exempt from <em>\u201c </em>taxation bv the Constitution of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">While the repeal of the former charter, under which the bridge or any other debt, due by the city, was created, and its incorporation under a new Act, in no way affected the liability of the city for the payment of such debts, even though its subsequent liability for them had not been expressly declared, as it is in the new charter; still it cannot be held that a mere authorization to raise a specific tax, to pay such debt, remains in force after the new charter takes effect. If it had been made to appear that the levy of a tax of one-fourth of one percent. until the payment in full of \u201c the bridge debt,\u201d had entered into and formed a part of the contract with holders of the bonds, there might arise a.different question: But if such is the fact, it i\u00e1 not shown in this case. But even if this had been shown, still, in view of the direct limitation in the charter of the amount of taxes which may be levied by the city, the practical effect would be the same. If a specific tax, one-fourth of one per cent, to discharge this particular debt, should be levied, if so stipulated, a proportional deduction would have to be made in the general levy, so as to keep the annual levy within the limit fixed by the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">That the charter must be held to limit the amount of taxes which may be annually levied by the city, on the facts as presented in this case, we think quite obvious. (Joyner <em>v. </em>Egremont, 3 Cush., 567; Cooley, Const. Limit., 519; Black, on Tax Titles.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The judgement is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Beversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
