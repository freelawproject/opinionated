(See Paschal\u2019s Digest, Article 1443.) It is upon these sections, -and the interpretation given to it by our courts, that the motion to exclude the testimony was founded. This article furnishes a rule regulating the evidence, and not the pleading. (Robinson <em>v. </em>Brinson, 20 Texas, 440; Drew <em>v. </em>Harrison, 12 Texas R., 279-282; Kelly <em>v. </em>Kelly, 12 Texas R., 454; Lee <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 12 Id., 417.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-21\">In Lee <em>v. </em>Hamilton, it is held that a plea denying a partnership not sworn to, as required by the statute, was properly treated by the court as a nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In Drew <em>v. </em>Harrison, Judge Hemphill held that a plea putting in issue a partnership not sworn to, should have been regarded as a nullity by the court. (Lee v. Hamilton, 12 Texas, 417, etc.; Drew <em>v. </em>Harrison, Id., 282.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">If, therefore, such a plea is a nullity, of course no evidence could be admitted in support of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">In Kelly <em>v. </em>Kelly, the point raised was in many respects similar to the question raised in this case. In that case defendant pleaded a receipt. The plaintiff did not, by any proper pleadings, impugn the receipt or put in issue its genuineness\u2014in other words, it was not sworn to. Justice Wheeler reversed and remanded the case, because \u201cthe judge in his \u201c charge gave the jury to understand that they were at liberty \u201c to disregard a receipt which had- not been properly attacked \u201c by the pleadings.\u201d (Kelly <em>v. </em>Kelly, 12 Texas K., 454.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">This is the error complained of in the case at bar. The plea attacking the genuineness of the receipt in question, was not sworn to, and yet the court permitted testimony to be introduced under the plea; and in effect charged the jury, that they might disregard the receipt, which had not been properly attacked by the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-9\">The decisions above referred to were made upon Article 741, Hartley\u2019s Digest. By a comparison of the articles in Paschal and Hartley, it will be seen that the language of the two is precisely the same, and the construction given by the court to the one will he equally applicable to the other. (Hartley\u2019s Digest, Article 741; Paschal\u2019s Digest, Article 1443.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-10\">Upon these authorities it is submitted, that the court erred in admitting the testimony under the amended petition of plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-11\"><em>Winch &amp; Shaffer, </em>for appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahg\">cited Underwood <em>v. </em>Parrot, 2 Texas, 180; Wells <em>v. </em>Fairbank, 5 Texas, 582; Williams <em>v. </em>Bailes, 9 Texas, 61; Drew <em>v. </em>Harrison, 12 Texas, 279; Andrews <em>v. </em>Jones, 36 Texas, 149; Parsons\u2019 Mercantile Law, 23; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>1 Greenl.

The other receipt being for two hundred and ninety-four dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The plaintiffs amended their pleadings, and averred that a credit had been given defendant, on their account, for two hun died dollars, paid by defendant in April, 1873, and that the receipt signed by them for four hundred dollars, in June, included the amount of the two hundred dollars which, was already credited on the account rendered to defendant in April, 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Plaintiffs, in their amendment, stated that the receipt signed by one of the plaintiffs in July, 1873, for two hundred and ninety-four dollars and thirty cents, was signed in ignorance of its contents; that defendant had written the receipt, stating the payment of this amount, which plaintiff had signed in ignorance of its contents, defendant having paid him not more than one hundred and ninety-four dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The jury having found for the plaintiff the amount sued for, the defendant seeks a reversal of the judgment, and assigns as errors, the ruling of the court in admitting evidence to contradict the receipt for two hundred and ninety-four dollars and thirty cents, when the pleadings setting up the fraud of defendant or mistake of plaintiffs, was not sworn to; and the error of the judge in charging the jury in effect, \u201c that as to said receipt \u201c for two hundred and ninety-four dollars and thirty cents, it \u201c was open to explanation; and that if the proof showed that said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201c receipt, by mistake or by fraud, was for a la'i'ger sum than was <em>\u201c </em>in fact paid, then the jury should allow only actual payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">We perceive neither error in the admission of the evidence, or the charge as quoted. The amendment of plaintiff was not a plea of <em>non est </em>factum., it was not in the nature of one ; it was an acknowledgment of having signed the receipt, and a statement of facts, which, if proven as evidence, could leave no other impression on the mind of a listener, than that by fraud or mistake, plaintiff, Muschke, had given defendant a receipt for one hundred dollars more than was paid him. That a receipt given for money or other property may be explained or contradicted by parol evidence, will not be seriously denied, when, as in this case, the pleadings authorize the introduction of proof; this being so, the charge of the court was properly framed to meet the real question at issue. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">There was consequently no error in overruling the motion for a new trial, the evidence sustaining the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
