The scheme of association inaugurated by David White, in 1837, for the formation of a stock company for the sale of the land on which the City of Galveston is built, was never carried out by him so as to make those persons to whom he had issued stock partners under his certificates, in compliance with their terms; but it left those who held shares in the land by purchase from him for a valuable consideration, associates with M.

Scott and others, brought their suit against the Galveston City Company, May 15, 1868. They alleged the mortgage and power of sale by Menard to White, dated December 13, 1836, and annexed a copy as an exhibit to their petition, dated the 10th December, 1836. That, on the 2d February, 1837, said White, by virtue of said power of sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>conveyed to Andrew J. Yates the one-thousandth part of said league and labor of land, which was conveyed down to the plaintiffs, by reason whereof plaintiffs became and are entitled legally and equitably, and owners of the one-thousandth part of said league and labor of land. Copy of this certificate of title and of the <em>mesne </em>conveyances were annexed to the petition. The petition alleged that, by means of this certificate they became entitled to all the rights represented and commonly known as certificates of stock in the Galveston City Company. It referred to the printed form of association annexed to' their certificate, as showing the manner in which Menard and his associates held titles to shares of said league and labor of land on the 1st of September, 1838. It alleges the incorporation of the stockholders of the Galveston City Company February 5, 1841, which corporation still exists, and that plaintiffs are stockholders in said company. That in December, 1867, they presented their share of stock to be recognized as genuine and legal, which was refused by the company.

That the issuing, by the trustees, of stock to the full value of said land, without reference to certificate Mo. 153, sold by White, was a fraud on the rights of plaintiffs, of which they had no notice until 1867, when they presented their certificate to the company, which refused to recognize its validity.

Alleged the conveyance to the trustees, in disregard of and adversely to the acts of White and rights of those claiming under him; the issuance, by the trustees, of the entire-one thousand shares of stock ; the formation of the company and its subsequent incorporation ; and that from 1837 to the time of suit the property had been held, and the entire action and proceedings of the stockholders and company conducted adversely to the right claimed by plaintiff, during all which time, for inore than thirty years, the right claimed by plaintiff had been in no manner asserted or set up, but plaintiffs had been guilty of laches for that period, until now, when all the parties acquainted with the original transaction are dead, facts cannot be proved from lapse of time, and plaintiff\u2019s claim is invalid, fraudulent, stale, and unconscionable, and they pray the court to decree the share to be canceled or of no effect, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">June 11, 1869, plaintiffs, Scotts, amended, alleging specially the authority of White from Menard to issue the share sued on, and that the said share and the acts of Menard and White were thereafter ratified by the company and their grantors.

That since that time, no claimant of said White stock had been known; that the entire one thousand shares of trustee stock had issued <em>bona fide </em>to parties; and have been a subject of dealing and commerce, and they and their assigns and successors had ever since held the same, and all the property and rights of the company had been held under and by theta adversely to all other rights, and that said plaintiffs in delaying any attempt to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>lish their pretended claim for more than thirty years, during which Menard, White, Yates and Allen, have all died, and all evidence of the original transaction been lost, have been guilty of such negligence and laches as should prevent other or further answer to their suit. That the allegations of fraud are too general to enable particular answer to be made, but were wholly without foundation or color. Prayer for dismissal of suit, cancelment of plaintiff's claim, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\">The evidence disclosed that all claim of title of the Bepublie of Texas to the league and labor of land on which the city of Galveston is now situated, was relinquished to M. B. Menard, and his associates, by Act of Congress of 9th December, 1836. This act was construed by this court as a grant intended for a town site. (23 Texas, 351.) Menard was to pay for this grant fifty thousand dollars, and to provide for this payment to the satisfaction of David White, of Mobile, Alabama. On the 10th of December, 1836, Menard executed a mortgage, with power of sale of this league and labor of land to secure the payment to White of fifty thousand dollars, acknowledged to have been advanced by him. This instrument contained: 1st, A general mortgage for the repayment of fifty thousand dollars; 2d, A power therein to White at any time to sell a sufficient portion of the same to pay himself the said fifty thousand dollars ; 3d, Becital of agreement with White, that he should assist Menard in the sale of the league and labor, which was contemplated to be sold in shares, lots, or such other manner as might be agreed upon, and receive ten per cent, of the proceeds over and above the fifty thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">The previous grant of this league and labor of land, known as the Seguin title, was owned by nine other parties in conjunction with Menard, some of whom made sale of their interests, in whole or part. In February, 1837, Menard and his associates determined to make a joint stock of this property ; organize a company, and issue shares of stock to represent the property, and proceed with the building up of the city of Galveston. They chose Dr. Levi Jones, who had become a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>prietor since the Congressional Act, as the agent for this Galveston City Company enterprise, and it was understood that in the latter part of March, 1837, Jones and Menard were to proceed North, effect the organization, isspe the stock, put it in market, and initiate the enterprise. Jones reached New Orleans late in March, 1837. He there met Menard, and from him learned that David White, in the city of Mobile, Alabama, had formed the plan of a Galveston City Company, and was issuing and selling shares in this company. Menard had seen him; had denied his powers and endeavored to stop their exercise, but found White inexorable, and was advised by lawyers, that White\u2019s powers \u201c were coupled with an interest; \u201d and that he had Menard in his power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-4\">Jones and Menard then went to Mobile and negotiated with White several days ineffectually. They published in the Mobile papers a denial and revocation of all powers on the part of White, who had then issued, as far as they could ascertain, one hundred and eighty-one or one hundred and eighty.-three shares in this company\u2014one hundred and fifty of them to Allen &amp; Yates, who were among the co-proprietors\u2014and thirty-one or thirty-three sold to individuals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">The evidence of Jones indicates that Menard denied White\u2019s power to issue these shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">Menard and Jones proceeded to Bichmond, Virginia. There they were met with another Galveston City Company enterprise. During the revolution. President D. G. Burnett-, under the laws of the Consultation, had issued to David Triplett a title to six hundred and forty acres of land on Galveston Island, in the heart of the present city, and conflicting with the subsequent grant to Menard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">Jones testified, that doubt or controversy as to their title, would have rendered it wholly unmarketable, and the result was a compromise with Triplett, by which they agreed to give to the Virginia Company one-fifth of the stock to be issued. Conveyances were then made by Menard and Triplett of the joint title to this league and labor of land to trustees, W. B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Johnson, Thomas Green, and Levi Jones, for the formation of the Galveston City Company. The property to be represented by one thousand shares of stock, to be issued by these trustees \u2014the stockholders to elect directors, -who should hold the land, survey it up, divide it into lots, etc., and proceed with their sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">The plaintiffs contended that this trust-deed contained a legal recognition of each and every share issued by David White as valid shares, already executed and in existence, and entitled to recognition as part of the stock of the new company, and that those trustees and the subsequent company have ever since been in the recognition and under the obligation of this trust for the David White shares. The defendant, on the contrary, insisted, that whilst it was true, as a practical matter of business, that payment to White had to be provided for, and that what was supposed to be ample means for a settlement with White and claimants under him, were provided, that any recognition of the validity of the White stock would have been absurd, and was avoided in the most careful manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">The entire one thousand shares of stock, representing all the capital and rights of the company were issued by the trustees \u2014known as the \u201c trustee stock.\u201d One of the books, of two hundred shares, was delivered to the Virginia parties. Another, Menard reserved to himself to 'settle with White and claimants under White, and reported in 1838 or 1839, that this was done, leaving about seventeen shares of that book, which were also issued in those years. The company continued to be managed by directors from 1838, and the stockholders were incorporated. From 1838 to the trial, the only stockholders ever known to the Galveston City Company, before or since incorporation, recognized by it, or represented by it in any manner or form, having vote, management or interest in the company, were the \u201ctrustee stock,\u201d issued by Johnson, Green, and Jones, or two of them, and its re-issues, since authorized. Flo such thing as David White stock had been known, nor, according to the evidence, would have been recognized as having any status or interest whatever. David White shares in Galveston City stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>were unknown to the agent of the company who had acted as such for fifteen years, and unknown to Green, one of the trustees. The company has never sold lots for cash, except to provide for its necessary expenses. It had only sold lots in exchange for and cancellation of its own stock. Every purchaser of a lot in the city of Galveston since 1838, from the Galveston City Company, had been required to become the owner of the stock of the company; and only by its surrender and cancelment, to an equivalent value in stock, could purchases be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\">A jury was waived, and cause submitted to the District Judge, who decreed in behalf of plaintiffs, requiring the Galveston City Company to issue to them a share of stock in said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">The following instruments were read in evidence as constituting the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 right:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Exhibit \u2018 C.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">\u201c Whereas, the government <em>de facto </em>of the Republic of <em>\u201c </em>Texas, by an Act of Congress passed on the 9th day of De- <em>\u201c </em>cember, A.D. 1836, released and relinquished unto Michael <em>\u201c </em>B.

To consider laches, there must be some period of time from which to commence the count of years. When shall it be? The contract was completely executed when the certificate was paid for and delivered. We had nothing to do within any time whatever to perfect our interest. Nothing could have been demanded of us, except in the event of the dissolution of the company or its total repudiation of the scheme of its organization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">This was not the case. She went on waxing strong by constant but modest growth ; gave no notice that dividends would be declared, because none have ever yet been declared. Such of its members as saw fit, united in the election of its officers and its general management. Possibly, not one-half of the Stock has ever indicated its existence by the participation of the owner in any of the public or private acts of the company. Never until December, 1867, when we presented our certificate of stock, had anything been done, with or without notice, or pretended to have been done,- tending to indicate a repudiation of our membership. The company may have thought all the White certificates taken up and substituted, but never did they dream of denouncing one or more that had not been taken up, but, seemingly, was ever ready to recognize them, until December, 1867. This, then, is the period of time from wdiich the count of years shall begin. The very records of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>pany are a complete replication to the plea of laches, even upon the precise hypothesis out of which the doctrine of laches has grown. It is said to have become the settled rule of courts of equity to regard that as right which had been universally recognized as right for more than thirty years, and that contracts cannot be enforced, nor rights or privileges asserted or disturbed, when the seal that covered their origin bore the impress of thirty years, because it is said the courts will presume in favor of the party who has thirty years to back the assertion of his right, upon the hypothesis that witnesses contemporary with the original transactions will ordinarily have died, and evidence become lost or destroyed within that period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-5\">This cannot be the rule in the case at \u201c bar.\u201d The certificate of stock has always been, and still is, the only evidence of right to a share. This certificate has never been-lost; nor are we attempting to establish our right to one after thirty years. We present the original document itself; and all the evidence (ex-, cept as to value) connected with it, or embraced in the record, is matter from among the archives and books of the company themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-6\">S\u00f3 even if this had been a case wherein laches could apply, the application could not be made, for the very reason upon which the plea would be allowed does not exist. The consideration of the loss of evidence cannot be. entertained by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-7\">2. But the appellants were never our trustees. Their officers (whom we do not sue for breach of trust) were. The company were, and are, a whole, of which we were and are one integral part. We were not compelled to be an active member, unless we so desired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-8\">If dividends had ever been declared, and we had delayed\u2014 say thirty years\u2014to demand our share of them, we would be chargeable with laches, and' our associates could not be held responsible for our particular dues, especially if they have been diverted or novel interest have grown up through our indif\u00ederonce and delay.. This has never been held to apply beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>dividends. A share of stock is something that moth and rust doth not corrupt, nor mere time enable a company to break through and steal. Nothing but a dissolution of the company, and a destruction of the capital stock can ever oust the interest of the holder. A share\u2014once paid for\u2014can never be touched, except by the overt act of the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-4\">We respectfully challenge the reference to a single case, either from a court of law or equity, wherein a stockholder in a corporate or joint-stoclc company has ever been held to lose his interest in the capital stock through \u201c lapse of time,\u201d or laches, in the assertion of such interest. And yet this is precisely what this court is asked to do, for the first time in the jurisprudence of any civilized country. If we were ever a stockholder (which is admitted substantially), we are so still.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">If we -were and are, what are our rights ? and what should we expect from the court in the premises\u2014this highest tribunal of justice? The case in the court below w^as tried by the Judge, a jury having been waived ; and, therefore, if there be error, but not such as to justify reversal, this court, according to custom, will reform and render, without remanding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-6\">This, we think, we have the right to ask upon this particular point. The evidence of the Secretary of the appellants\u2014the only witness testifying upon this point\u2014shows that at the time we demanded a recognition of our stock, so as to enable us to place it upon the market, shares were worth, when sold altogether, ten thousand dollars; when divided and sold, fourteen thousand dollars. Had our share been recognized and a certificate in present marketable form substituted, as we demanded, and as had been done with all others, we could easily have divided it and sold it for fourteen thousand dollars. The company undertook the responsibility of refusal to issue ns a share (or certificate for a share) in the form we had the right to demand, and thereby unjustly and illegally deprived us of the use of fourteen thousand dollars. This the company should be adjudged to pay us, together with interest, from day of presentation, demand and refusal\u2014say from 1st January, 1868, to day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>of judgment\u2014the demand having been made some time in December, 1867.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-5\">Could we have shown a higher value in shares since that time, we would be entitled to a decree for the highest, because we could have exercised our option to hold or sell. \u2022 We had the right to sell at the highest figure (say fourteen thousand dollars) proven, and could have used our money ever since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-6\">We therefore ask a final decree for fourteen thousand dollars, with interest from January 1st, 1868, at eight per cent, per annum, against appellants. We should not now be forced to accept the share, after having been forced to so much expense and delay, and after the stock has depreciated. The option should be with us as to which we would receive, under the decree, and not with the company as to which they would now tender.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">We respectfully refer to the following authorities as precisely in point: (Randon <em>v. </em>Barton, 4 Texas, 289; Calvit <em>v. </em>McFadden, 13 Texas, 324.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-8\">Roberts, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7n\">The appellees obtained a decree establishing their right to a share of stock in the Galveston City Company, as now existing and acting under its act of incorporation, from which an appeal has been taken to this court. The jury was waived and the case submitted to the court upon the pleading and evidence, and it is assigned for error that the decree was not justified by the evidence under the law applicable thereto. There Avere various exceptions taken to the pleading and to the evidence, which, being overruled, are also assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Without considering the questions arising upon these exceptions, for the present, it is believed that a satisfactory conclusion may be arrived at by a proper construction of the written instruments upon which the suit is founded, in connection with the evidence adduced in explanation of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The first question that presents itself is, what is the legal import of the certificate sued on, and what right did it vest in the holder when issued by White as the agent of Menard? It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>is an instrument in the nature of a deed of conveyance for an undivided interest (the one thousandth part) of a league and labor of land, on, and including the east end of Galveston Island, to be held subject to certain articles of covenant and association with other jpersons, who should hold similar deeds for shares in said land, which articles were attached to, and made a part of tlip deed, and prescribed the terms and contingencies upon which such association was afterwards to be formed, as well also as the objects of such association, when it should be formed and put into action, which were to lay off and erect a city upon said land, for their mutual and joint profit. It made him an associate with Menard and other holders of like instruments, as a part-owner of the land then, obligated by a concurrent agreement to become, upon certain contingencies and terms (some of which were expressed and some not), an associate with Menard, and such others, as a co-partner in a partnership, in the shape of a joint-stock company, to be organized for the possession, management, and disposition of said land, in the erection of a city. There is upon the face of this instrument, when regarded as vesting in the holder a part-ownership of the land, a condition subsequent, which put it in the power of Menard to vacate it, upon failure of compliance, and that was the payment of an additional sum in blank, if indeed an additional sum over that of five hundred dollars was contemplated to be paid, according to the scheme of which this instrument was 'a part, under the direction of White, as the agent of Menard. This is not referred to as constituting of itself a want of title to part-ownership, but to show that it left a door open for Menard to set up and claim a want of compliance, if, in fact, an additional payment was contemplated in any subsequent adjustment of such right that may have been made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The next question is, how was this interest of part-ownership to be changed into a partnership interest in the land <em>\\</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">By Menard giving notice to the shareholders at some time thereafter not named (being a blank in the articles), of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>number of shares then sold, after which the shareholders 'should appoint directors who should be the attorneys in fact of all the shareholders in the management of said business, and whose appointment might be renewed every year, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shareholders. And a majority of said shareholders, or the board of directors appointed by them, might require Menard, upon notice given to. him, to execute a title to said land to trustees selected by them, to be held in trust for the shareholders or their assigns, and to be disposed of in lots under the direction of the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">But so far as the evidence shows, Menard never gave any such notice, and the shareholders never appointed any directors, and Menard' never executed a deed of trust to the land to trustees, named and appointed by the said shareholders, who held certificates of shares under Menard, through his agent, White. The association so as to make the part-owners or shareholders, under the scheme attempted to be carried out through White, wholly failed. It was abandoned by Menard himself in pursuit of another, and White himself, after issuing one hundred and eighty-one or one hundred and eighty-tliree certificates of shares, upon what terms and consideration does not fully appear, ceased to operate upon said scheme, and never, so far as appears, even attempted to form an association by a meeting of the shareholders of his certificates, but instead of that, finally acquiesced in, and took stock in another association, which supplanted his scheme ; which fact is mentioned here now only to show, by affirmative evidence, that he never carried out the scheme of association inaugurated by him, whether right or wrong, so as to make the persons associates-as partners, by virtue of their acts under his certificates, in compliance with their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">So far then as this point is concerned, up to the period thus far considered, it is perfectly immaterial whether White\u2019s scheme of ultimate association was sanctioned in its origin by Menard or not. The failure of his scheme left those who held, by a full valuable consideration, shares in said land from him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>associates with Menard as part-owners, but not associates as partners, by virtue of the certificates or deeds issued by him, and so they may continue to be up to the present time, if he liad full authority, as would appear to be the case from his mortgage and power of sale, to do what he did, as to selling the land, unless such right has been submerged into some other, or they have lost it by limitation or laches, pleaded or to be pleaded as a bar to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">It is contended by plaintiffs below, that the holder of the share one hundred and fifty-three in book A, issued by White, upon which this suit is brought, was fully recognized' as a valid right by the deed of trust, made at Richmond, by Menard and Triplett, in compromise of their conflicting interests; and that by said recognition, the holder of said certificate became an equal partner in the association, afterwards formed at Galveston, styled the Galveston City Company, in pursuance of the terms of said deed of trust to Jones, Johnson &amp; Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">It will be seen that the first branch of this proposition might be true without its being at all necessary that the second branch of the proposition should follow from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">To appreciate properly each branch of the above proposition, and their true relation to each other, it is necessary to consider that this league and labor of land was granted by the Congress of Texas to \u201c Menard and such associates as he may hereafter <em>\u201c </em>include,\u201d for the purpose of building a town upon it; that Hardin, Yates, Allen, Baker, Jack, and others, to the number of nine, who were in some way concerned with him in the grant, not disclosed in this record, were silent owners of some sort of interest in it, and that they were not the persons designated in this act, as the associates that he might thereafter include in the grant. From the mortgage to White, and the obligation to Hardin, both only a few days after the grant, it reasonably appears \"that these nine silent owneffe of an interest confided the title to the land, and the management of the enterprise to Menard, holding him responsible only for their shares of the net profits of it, and that some such scheme as that which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>afterwards put forward by White, as his agent, was contemplated, without its exact terms being settled, which is evidenced also by the generalities, as well as the blanks in the certificates issued by White.</p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">The basis of the scheme was that Menard should continue to hold the legal title to the land until an organized association was formed by the shareholders, who were to be associates, by him thereafter included, and until they, or the directors appointed by them, should notify and direct him to convey the legal title to trustees selected by them, thereafter to be under their control; and also that White should assist Menard in the sales of the shares, and, after he was paid his fifty thousand dollars advanced by him, have <em>\u201c </em>ten per cent on the amount re- \u201c maining in consideration of his services.\u201d It is equally probable that White had five books prepared, with two hundred certificates of shares similar to one hundred and fifty-three of book A; for by reference to the Menard papers in evidence White speaks of turning over five hundred shares and retaining enough to make himself safe. And again, on the 7th of March he speaks of \u201c the balance of the unsold stock of the Galveston stock, together with the stock-book 0,\u201d being turned over to Menard upon certain conditions. It appears that Allen and Yates, two of the silent owners of interests in this land, not content to leave the enterprise to the management of Menard, went to Mobile early in March, 1837, and drew out from White their proportional shares. Allen drew out one hundred shares, and paid White five thousand dollars. Yates drew out fifty shares, and paid by his note two thousand five hundred dollars. Whether this payment was their proportions of the fifty thousand dollars due from Menard to White, or only the ten per cent, commissions on them, treating them as sales of stock by White, it was throwing the stock upon the market in a way to produce competition in the sale of it by such of the original owners as might choose to break off from Menard, and which would inevitably, in a short time, run down the price of it, and most probably put it out of Menard\u2019s power to pay the debt to White, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>which he had made himself personally responsible. In addition to this, he had in trust the interest of those joint-owners who still confided in him. Hence, when he met Jones in Hew Orleans, the first week in April, 1837, just having come from Mobile, he was dissatisfied with White\u2019s arrangements, and when he and Jones could not alter them, he determined to repudiate them, of which he then gave notice in the newspapers, and coming back to Hew Orleans on the 11th day of April, 1837, entered into an agreement of compromise with Triplett, who, with his associates, had a claim to six hundred and forty acres on the east end of the island, which was consummated on the 18th of the same month by a deed of trust from Menard and Triplett to Johnson, Green, and Jones, to the said six hundred and forty acres, and by Menard to Jones for the balance of the league and labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">This scheme contemplated a cooperative, though not in all respects a joint plan, for the sale of stock, shares, and scrip, through said trustees. It made no reference whatever to the White shares, or to White, further than to provide that Jones should pay him the balance of his debt out of the first sales of stock. Menard at once parted with the legal title to the land, which of course was entirely inconsistent with his thereafter performing what was expected of him, in forwarding the perfection of the association in the White scheme. This scheme, originating in the compromise, also failed, and never matured into the formation of a joint-stock company. It is probable that Dr. Jones went to work under this plan in the erection of a city, for we find in the subsequent arrangement founded on this, that a sale by him of ten squares or parts of squares was expressly ratified. But the compromise was remodeled in Richmond,Virginia, by articles of agreement between Menard, Triplett, Neblett, Gray, Green, and Jones, on the 15th day of June, 1837, by which the legal title to the whole of the league and labor of land was conveyed to Johnson, Green, and Jones, in fee simple, as trustees and commissioners, to execute and carry into effect the purposes, terms, and intentions of the agreement then entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>into. It was provided therein, <em>\u201c </em>that said league and labor of \u201c land shall, by the said trustees or commissioners, he divided <em>\u201c </em>into one thousand shares, of which the four hundred shares, \u201c for which certificates have already been issued by the said \u201c Jones, shall be regarded as four hundred shares, and the law- <em>\u201c </em>ful holders of said certificates shall be on the same footing, \u201c and entitled to the same rights with the holders of certificates \u201c issued under the present articles, and upon surrendering their \u201c said certificates, new certificates in lieu thereof shall be issued \u201c by the said commissioners or trustees.\u201d It provided that the remaining six hundred- shares should be sold by the trustees in such manner as they should deem expedient, the proceeds of which were to be divided in the proportion of one-third to Triplett, and those claiming- under or through him, and two-thirds to Menard, and those claiming under or through him.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">It provided, that out of the first proceeds of the sales, after paying the expenses of the trust or commission, the debt to White, believed to be less than fifty thousand dollars, should be paid, and one-third of which amount should be paid to Triplett, or those claiming through him.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">It provided for the regulation of the price of the Jones certificates still not sold, and that it should not be less than others sold for, and also provided for each party having an interest, to take certificates for it without paying money.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">It provided that the trustees, when they thought enough certificates of shares had been sold, should call a meeting of the shareholders, and in such meeting Menard should represent the unsold Jones certificates, and two-thirds, and Triplett one-third of the unsold certificates of the remaining six hundred, and that the trustees should hold the land subject to the orders of the shareholders.'</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">This instrument -has been thus extensively quoted to show that almost -every provision requires the exhibition of outside facts to make its terms intelligible. For instance, if the trustees should divide the land into one thousand shares, how are the six hundred to be numbered, and how many books of certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>cates were then made? If Jones had already issued four hundred certificates, how was it that some of them were unsold, and must not he sold at a less price than other certificates, and while unsold to he represented by Menard, upon a meeting of the shareholders ? The evidence of Green explains, that the whole of the one thousand certificates of stock were drawn up and signed in five books, A, B, C, D, and E, four hundred of which dn books A and B, were given to Menard at once, two hundred in book E, was kept by him \u201c for parties in interest <em>\u201c </em>under Triplett,\u201d and four hundred were delivered to Dr. Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The evidence of Jones shows that he had never previously issued any certificates, and that his name in that respect is a fiction in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Green says that books A and B were for four hundred shares, to or by Dr. Levi Jones or Menard, before the compromise, and which were to be renewed for uniformity in the new plan. If we examine the certificate one hundred and fifty-three of the book A, spoken of by Green, we will see that it was issued by Jones,- Johnson, and Green, trustees, <em>\u201c </em>in consideration of the return of the certificate of corresponding book and number, as formerly issued by said Levi Jones (one of the first four hundred shares).\u201d As Jones did not issue it, we naturally search for the certificate Ho. one hundred and fifty-three, in book A, that was issued by some one having some connection with this matter, and in doing so, by the aid of Dr. Jones\u2019s evidence, we find it in White\u2019s book, A, made previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Dr. Jones says that book A was given to Menard to settle with those who held certificates of shares under White, and the form in which they were written is consistent with that object. The reasons why White\u2019s name was not mentioned may well be supposed to be, that White had not consented to this scheme, which was being organized in direct hostility to his own, and he, and those holding his certificates, might go on to organize under his plan; that Tates and Allen, original owners of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>interest, had drawn their full share under the White plan, and much more than they would be entitled to under the new scheme under the compromise with Triplett, which would require Menard, in justice to himself and his other original co-proprietors, to have equitably settled with them, and those who might hold under them; that if litigation arose between the parties, then standing in direct antagonism, the use of Jones\u2019s name would not commit the new combination to a recognition of the White scheme ; that if there could be a satisfactory arrangement made with White, and those who held under him, to come into the new scheme, an easy way was provided for an equitable deduction of their claims if necessary, and a substitution of certificates out of the new book A, and thereby, as Green says, preserve a uniformity in the shape of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">All this is strongly indicated inferen tially in the provisions of the trust-deed, which recognized unsold Jones stock in the hands of Menard, and to be represented in the meeting of stockholders by him, and in the prohibition of such Jones stock being afterwards sold under the regular price of stock, which was fixed in the outset at fifteen hundred dollars per share.</p>\n<p id=\"AgH\">Now if it be legitimate to explain this fiction in the trust-deed, and show that it was introduced with reference to the interest of White, and of those -who held under him, which it is thought would certainly be proper under appropriate pleadings for that purpose, it is equally legitimate .to explain, as Dr. Jones does, how, and through whom, their interests were to be managed, so as to introduce, them into this new scheme as stockholders and partners, and that results in showing that it was to be done by a settlement and equitable adjustment with Menard, requiring both consent and action on their part, as well as his. Those who held under White, being then only part-owners, it certainly required their assent and action, in complying with the prescribed terms of surrendering their certificates, that constituted a charge on the land, in order to introduce them into the new scheme of association as partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Under this scheme the stock was disposed \u00f3f, and the association was organized by the stockholders, who held what is termed the Trustee Stock, and by those only, who took actual exclusive possession of the land, and proceeded to carry out the objects of the association. White, Allen, Yates, and others holding White stock, came into it, and received stock under it. The White scheme, as an association of stockholders, never was formed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">These were the persons who were incorporated as \u201cthe \u201cstockholders of the Galveston City Company, 'under the \u201csame name and style,\u201d on the 5th day of February, 1841, at which time there were only ten certificates of the trustee stock, of book A, in the hands of Menard, which, on the 7th of May, following, were issued to Origin Sibley, and William Dennis, who had bought and paid for five shares each in 1837, from White, at the rate of five hundred dollars per share. The certificate number one hundred and fifty-three, of the trustee stock with others, was issued by Menard, by order of the Board of Directors, to Dr. Jones in payment of his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Thus was the door closed, certainly by the 7th of May, 1841, that had been provided,, through which the holder of the White stock, number one hundred and fifty-three, now sued on, could enter said organized' company as a stockholder, by the means that had been provided for that purpose, under its terms of association, as the Galveston City Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">If then he was wrongfully debarred, he had a cause of action for damages, or he might have elected to prosecute his right to a part of the land, and claim partition. Had he made this claim while Menard had in his hands certificates devoted to the purpose, under the provisions of the association, he might, upon- establishing a <em>lonco fide </em>right to this share, have forced his way into the company, as a stockholder, by a decree of a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">But such a suit now, or a suit in the alternative for damages, after the lapse of more than twice the length of our longest limitation, and after nearly every person is dead, who, if alive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>could make plain what must now be dimly seen, must be held to be barred as a stale demand. The principles of law involved in this exposition of the case, pertain mainly to the well-known, distinction between a tenant in common or part-owner of an interest in land, and a partner or stockholder in an incorporated real-estate joint-stock company, and the means by which the one or the other position, in relation to persons and property, may be assumed or created.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In its application to the facts of this case, we think the court erred in rendering a decree in favor of the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The exceptions of defendant below to the admission of transfers of the White certificate, No. 153; the alleged deficiency of evidence of the right of Mrs. Scott- to recover as the widow of one of the Scott brothers; and the alleged error of the court in not sustaining defendant\u2019s special exceptions to plaintiffs\u2019 general allegation of the ratification of their right by the defendant, are all questions, the law of which is well settled, and present no great difficulty, except in the application of it to the particular facts of each case, which may vary in each trial of the same case, and therefore it is hardly necessary to say anything upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Eeversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
