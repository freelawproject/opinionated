On appeal to the Superior Court, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that as a matter of law the commissioner had failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 12-359 (b). The commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. Because we conclude that the commissioner was not required to comply with \u00a7 12-359 (b) under the circumstances of this case, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The facts are not in dispute. The decedent, Anna G. Schwartz, a resident of Trumbull, died on February 18, 1987. The Probate Court for the district of Trumbull appointed the defendant, Samuel Schwartz, the decedent\u2019s husband, to serve as the executor of her will. The defendant executor filed a succession tax return with the Probate Court, which received a certified copy of the return on April 11, 1988. Upon filing the return, the defendant paid the commissioner $28,733.38, the amount of the succession tax and related interest due according to the defendant\u2019s calculations. On October 12,1988, the commissioner computed and assessed the succession tax in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 12-367 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and mailed the computation and assessment to the defendant. The commissioner\u2019s assessment reported a balance due of $12,597.21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Article four of the decedent\u2019s will provided for the creation of a trust under which net income was to be paid to her husband on a monthly basis. Her husband was also given the right to withdraw $5000 from the trust principal each year, provided that he request such a withdrawal within the first three months of the calendar year. Upon the death of her husband, the trust corpus was to pass to the decedent\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In a cover letter accompanying the succession tax return, the defendant outlined his calculation of the succession tax. Since the succession tax rates vary based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent and the amount of property transferred,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the executor had to allocate the value of the trust ($500,000) between the Class AA lifetime beneficiary (the husband) and the Class A residuary beneficiary (the son) in order to calculate the succession tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The commissioner and the defendant agree that the value of the husband\u2019s life interest in the net income of the trust is taxable at Class AA rates applicable to spouses of decedents. They disagree, however, over the proper treatment of the defendant\u2019s right to invade the trust principal in calculating the succession tax. In his calculation of the succession tax for the husband, the defendant did not include any amount related to the right to invade the trust principal because the defendant did not consider that right to be taxable to the husband. In the commissioner\u2019s calculation of the succession tax, however, the value of the husband\u2019s interest in the trust includes both the value of his life interest in the net income of the trust and the value of his right to invade the trust principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The defendant applied for a hearing before the Probate Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-359 (b) in order to settle the question of the treatment to be accorded the right to invade the trust principal. The Probate Court concluded that because the commissioner had failed to file an objection to the defendant\u2019s succession tax return pursuant to \u00a7 12-359 (b), he could not contest the defendant\u2019s position that the right to 'withdraw trust principal was not taxable to the husband.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal to the Superior Court, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because it likewise concluded that the commissioner had forfeited his right to challenge the defendant\u2019s treatment of the right to invade trust principal by failing to make a timely objection under \u00a7 12-359 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Before reviewing the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the proper interpretation of \u00a7 12-359 (b), we must provide a brief background on the Connecticut succession tax. \u201cAn inheritance or succession tax is a tax imposed on the privilege of receiving property from a decedent at death.\u201d <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 238, 377 A.2d 305 (1977). General Statutes \u00a7 12-359 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> outlines the information that the taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>must provide on the succession tax return. \u201cSection 12-359 (b) delineates the method of objecting to valuations and concessions of taxability of individual items set forth in the succession tax return and sets out the scope of the Probate Court hearing and determination on the objections. Section 12-359 (b) further provides the method of determining the gross taxable estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>upon which the tax computation shall be based.\u201d <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>182 Conn. 40, 44, 438 A.2d 1 (1980). If the commissioner fails to file an objection under \u00a7 12-359 (b) to \u201cvaluations\u201d or \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d in the taxpayer\u2019s succession tax return, he forfeits the right to challenge the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of the \u201cvaluation\u201d or \u201ctaxability\u201d issue in calculating the succession tax. Id., 47. Section 12-367 (a) requires the commissioner of revenue services to compute and assess the succession tax, while \u00a7 12-367 (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the taxpayer with the right to a hearing before the Probate Court to challenge the commissioner\u2019s computation of the succession tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The defendant argues that his characterization of the right to invade trust principal as nontaxable in calculating the succession tax is a claim of nontaxability to which the commissioner was required to object under the \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d language of \u00a7 12-359 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commissioner claims, to the contrary, that the defendant\u2019s treatment of the right to invade trust principal as nontaxable for succession tax purposes is neither a \u201cvaluation\u201d nor a \u201cconcession of tax-ability\u201d within the meaning of these terms in \u00a7 12-359 (b), and that the commissioner therefore was not required to file an objection under \u00a7 12-359 (b) in order to challenge the defendant\u2019s treatment of this right as nontaxable. The commissioner argues that the terms \u201cvaluations\u201d and \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d apply only to valuation or taxability issues that affect the determination of the amount of the net taxable estate,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and do not apply to issues that affect only the rate of taxation of property which the taxpayer has included in the gross taxable estate at a value that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>not challenged by the commissioner. Because he had no objection to the amount the defendant reported as the net taxable estate, the commissioner asserts that he had no objection to any \u201cvaluations\u201d or \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d as those terms are used in \u00a7 12-359 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The basic goal of statutory construction is to determine and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 19, 23-24, 566 A.2d 658 (1989); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 589, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). \u201c Tn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment [and] to the legislative policy it was designed to implement . . . .\u2019 <em>[Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra]; <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 128, 527 A.2d 672 (1987); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 502-503, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973).\u201d <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 24. \u201cA succession tax statute must be construed as a whole; its various provisions are in pari materia and must be construed together so as to carry out the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>supra, 245-46; see <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Section 12-359 (a) requires that \u201can appraisal by the fiduciary or transferee, at its fair market value on the date of decedent\u2019s death, of each item of property, the transfer of which may be taxable . . . [and] a statement as to whether, or to what extent, the reported transfers are conceded taxable\u201d be included in the succession tax return. Pursuant to \u00a7 12-359 (b) the commissioner is required to file within one hundred twenty days of receiving the succession tax return \u201ca statement in writing setting forth in detail such objections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>as he may have to the <em>valuations </em>or <em>concessions of tax-ability </em>appearing [on the succession tax return].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 12-359 (b) further provides that \u201c[t]he value of the gross taxable estate as set forth in the tax return or any amendment thereof, or as altered by written agreement between the commissioner of revenue services and such fiduciary or transferee <em>or as set by the probate court upon a hearing under this subsection </em>or under subsection (b) of section 12-367 shall be the basis for computing the succession tax.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This final sentence establishes that the primary purpose of a hearing under \u00a7 12-359 (b) is to resolve disagreements between the taxpayer and the commissioner over \u201cvaluations\u201d or \u201cconcessions of tax-ability\u201d that affect the value of the gross taxable estate. This court has recognized that \u00a7 12-359 (b) provides a procedure for determining the value of the gross taxable estate when this amount is in dispute. <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>supra, 44. If, for instance, the commissioner and the taxpayer disagree over the fair market value of real property included in the gross taxable estate; see, e.g., <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>1 Conn. App. 529, 473 A.2d 1235 (1984); or over whether the assets of a trust are subject to the succession tax; see, e.g., <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>supra; the commissioner must then file an objection under \u00a7 12-359 (b) in order to challenge the taxpayer\u2019s characterization of these issues of \u201cvaluation\u201d and \u201ctaxability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The defendant argues that the question of how to treat the right to invade the trust principal for succession tax purposes involves a question of the taxability of the invasion power and that \u00a7 12-359 (b) required the commissioner to object to his treatment of the power as nontaxable if he wished to impose a tax. This argument fails to recognize that, because the primary purpose of a hearing under \u00a7 12-359 (b) is to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>differences as to the value of the gross taxable estate, \u201cvaluations\u201d or \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-359 (b) refer only to those valuations or concessions of taxability that affect the amount a taxpayer reports as the gross taxable estate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parties agree that the entire value ($500,000) of the trust assets is taxable for succession tax purposes. The succession tax treatment of the defendant\u2019s right to invade the trust principal affects only the allocation of the net taxable estate between the Class AA beneficiary (the husband) and the Class A beneficiary (the son).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, it affects only the rate at which the trust assets are taxable, and not the amount of the estate subject to the imposition of a succession tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-359 (b) is inconsistent with other succession tax provisions embodied in the statutes. \u201c[Statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murtha, </em>179 Conn. 463, 466, 427 A.2d 807 [1980]; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491 [1978].\u201d <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>supra, 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Section 12-367 (a) provides that \u201c[t]he tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be computed and assessed by the commissioner of revenue services.\u201d The rate of the Connecticut succession tax is based on both the value of property transferred and the identity of the persons receiving the property. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u00a7 12-344 (a); <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>supra, 237. Determining the allocation of the net taxable estate between the various classes of beneficiaries is thus a necessary step in the process of computing the succession tax. G. Wilhelm, Connecticut Estates Practice Death Taxes (2d Ed.) \u00a7 80, pp. 178-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>supra, 235-36, this court faced the issue of determining the proper allocation for succession tax purposes of a marital deduction trust as between the Class A and Class AA beneficiaries. Noting that the real issue concerned the <em>rate </em>of taxation, the court characterized the issue as involving a question of \u201cthe correctness of [the commissioner\u2019s] computation.\u201d Id., 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Since the question of the taxability of the right to invade the trust principal affects only the rate of the succession tax, and not the taxability of the trust assets, and since the determination of the appropriate rate is an integral part of the process of computing the succession tax, the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-359 (b) would require the commissioner to file an objection to an issue that arises only at the time of computation of the tax. This interpretation is not consistent with the fact that \u00a7 12-367 (a) places the duty of computing the succession tax upon the commissioner, not the taxpayer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is settled that when two constructions [of a statute] are possible, courts will adopt that construction which makes the statutes effective and workable, and not one which would lead to difficult and unfathomable results. <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 582, 368 A.2d 103 [1976]; <em>Atwood </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 621, 363 A.2d 1038 [1975].\u201d <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>supra, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 12-359 (b) does not leave an executor or administrator in the defendant\u2019s position without a remedy.

Unless such fiduciary or transferee concedes the correctness of the commissioner of revenue services\u2019 opinion or the commissioner of revenue services withdraws his objection, the commissioner of revenue services, fiduciary or transferee may file in the court of probate for the district within which the transferor resided at the date of his death or, if the transferor died a nonresident of this state, in the court of probate for the district within which the real estate or tangible personal property is situated, an application for a hearing upon those items set out in such return as to which the commissioner of revenue services objects.

The commissioner or any person interested may appear before such court at such hearing and be heard on any matter involved in the determination of the tax or the computation thereof, including, if no hearing has been held previously under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 12-359, any matter which could have been heard at such a hearing. If there is no appearance on behalf of the commissioner and it appears to the court that such computation ought to be modified, such hearing shall be adjourned for not less than ten days and notice of the time and place of such adjourned hearing and of any proposed change in such computation shall be given to the commissioner, who may appear and be heard thereon. At such hearing, or adjournment thereof, the court shall determine all matters properly before it, including the amount of such tax and shall enter upon its records a decree for such amount. A copy of the decree of the probate court shall be forwarded forthwith to the commissioner and the fiduciary or transferee by the judge or clerk of such court. Subject only to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, the computation of the tax by the commissioner of revenue services shall be conclusive upon the state and all persons interested unless a hearing is held thereon as herein provided, in which case the decree of the probate court shall be conclusive upon the state and all persons interested unless an appeal is taken as provided for appeals from other decrees and orders of such court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\"> The defendant also claims that this court cannot reverse the ruling of the trial court unless we find that the Superior Court was clearly erroneous in ruling that the defendant treated the right to invade trust principal as nontaxable. Although it is true that the clearly erroneous standard is applicable when a factual finding of the trial court is challenged; <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); there is no issue of fact in this case. The Superior Court\u2019s determination that the defendant did not concede the taxability of the right to invade trust principal is relevant only if this taxability issue is one that falls within the meaning of \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 12-359 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\"> On Schedule 3 (Summary of Taxable Estate) of the defendant\u2019s succession tax return, the defendant was required to provide the amount of various types of property included in the gross taxable estate. These amounts are listed in a column labeled \u201cvalue or amount conceded taxable.\u201d The net taxable estate is determined by subtracting from the gross taxable estate deductions for expenses such as attorneys\u2019 fees, funeral expenses, and debts of the deceased. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-350.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\"> We need not decide, on the present record, whether the reported amounts of the various deductions from the gross taxable estate under General Statutes \u00a7 12-350 are \u201cvaluations\u201d or \u201cconcessions of taxability\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 12-359 (b). It is sufficient for this case to hold that the commissioner need not object under \u00a7 12-359 (b) when he does not dispute the amount reported as the gross taxable estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\"> By treating the right to invade the trust principal as not taxable, the defendant allocated a greater portion of the trust to the son and a lesser portion to himself than the commissioner did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> Although it is true that the taxpayer must make a preliminary calculation of the succession tax since the succession tax is due when the return is filed; G. Wilhelm, Connecticut Estates Practice Death Taxes (2d Ed.) \u00a7 80, p. 180; this calculation is not binding on the commissioner since it is the commissioner who has official responsibility for calculating the succession tax under General Statutes \u00a7 12-367 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
