(defendants),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and were consolidated for trial before the <em>Hon. John M. Alexander, </em>state trial referee, exercising the powers of the Superior Court. Seeking, inter alia, injunctive relief and civil penalties pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-226,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the commissioner alleged: (1) in the first case, that the defendants had (a) violated the terms of a final consent order entered into between herself and the defendants and (b) oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ated a solid waste facility, as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-207 (4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> without a permit \u201cby arranging for the dumping of wood and other demolition waste\u201d on property in the city of Bridgeport; and (2) in the third case, that the defendants had failed to, or would not, in the future, comply with several provisions of a final decision and order, issued by the commissioner, related to the disposal of demolition waste on property in the city of Bridgeport.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In both cases, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the commissioner, from which the defendants have appealed and the commissioner has cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In the second, fourth and fifth cases, the commissioner alleged that the defendants had \u201cdumped wood and other demolition waste\u201d and had operated a solid waste facility, as defined in \u00a7 22a-207 (4), on property not owned by the defendants in the towns of Trumbull and Ansonia and the city of Bridgeport, respectively. An amended prayer for relief in each case requested that the trial court order the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-250 (c) and (e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>In the second and fourth cases the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the commissioner, from which the defendants have appealed and the commissioner has cross appealed. In the fifth case the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants, from which the commissioner has appealed. We find error on the appeals in the second and fourth cases, and no error on the appeals in the first, third and fifth cases. With respect to the cross appeals on the first and third cases, we remand for further articulation concerning the stay of execution of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The trial court found the following facts relating to the first and third cases involving the property in Bridgeport. The commissioner\u2019s allegations concerned the defendants\u2019 placement of demolition waste on property owned by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) and on adjoining property leased by the defendants for use in their demolition business. Both parcels were located on Singer Avenue, in the city of Bridgeport. After the defendants had completed demolition of a building, the generated debris was often brought to the Singer Avenue properties rather than to a certified landfill. Portions of this debris were then transported to other locations, when and if such locations were found by the defendants. The trial court noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201caccumulation of demolition debris at Singer Avenue at the [time of trial could] be described as tremendous,\u201d and, after viewing the property in question, that the debris was \u201cvery high, unsightly, and [had] been found by the Commissioner to cause imminent and substantial danger to the environment.\u201d Water supply and sewer lines belonging to United Illuminating Company, running under a portion of the Conrail property by virtue of an easement, were damaged as a result of the accumulation of demolition debris. Evidence was presented that the leaching effect of the debris would affect groundwater in the area. Finally, the trial court found that some of the debris on the Conrail property had been deposited by persons other than the defendants, but concluded, nevertheless, that such debris was \u201cof minor consequence,\u201d and that it was \u201cnot unfair to require [the defendants] to take the entire responsibility\u201d for all of the debris.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">As a result of these activities, the commissioner, on February 22, 1988, issued two orders to the defendants pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in the first case, No. SW-258, commanded the defendants \u201cto wholly and absolutely cease and desist from further disposal or transfer of solid waste\u201d at the Conrail property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On March 1,1988, this order was made a final consent order as agreed by both the defendants and the commissioner. The order in the third case, No. SW-259, commanded the defendants \u201cto correct [several] violations and to bring the [Conrail property] into full compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements,\u201d in accordance with a remedial schedule established by the commissioner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In April, 1988, public hearings, at which the defendants appeared, were held concerning order No. SW-259; see General Statutes \u00a7 22a-225 (b);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>which an adjudicator in the department of environmental protection made written findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining that: (1) the defendants had \u201coperated and maintained without a permit, a bulky solid waste land disposal facility and transfer station\u201d at the Singer Avenue property; (2) in order to protect United Illuminating Company\u2019s water and sewer lines, it was necessary that \u201cthe bulky waste and solid waste deposited on the [Conrail property] by the [defendants] must be removed . . . with all due diligence and as soon as practical to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state\u201d; and (3) removal of the \u201cunauthorized waste\u201d would require \u201cthe full cooperation of both Conrail, as the site\u2019s owner, and [United Illuminating Company] as a holder of rights of way.\u201d On the basis of these conclusions, the adjudicator, on July 14,1988, affirmed the commissioner\u2019s prior order and commanded that the defendants \u201c[immediately stop and do not resume waste disposal and/or waste transfer operations\u201d at the Conrail property or at the property leased by the defendants. In addition, the final order; see General Statutes \u00a7 22a-225 (c);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> set forth a comprehensive compliance schedule requiring the defendants to remove the waste deposited on the Conrail property.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>On the basis of the evidence presented at a trial conducted in December, 1988, and January, 1989, the court found ample support for the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 activities at the Singer Avenue properties would \u201cgive rise to imminent and substantial damage to the environment or to [the] public health.\u201d In both cases, the court concluded that the defendants had violated the terms of the orders issued by the commissioner. In fact, the court noted, the defendants\u2019 violations of both orders had been \u201cflagrant.\u201d The court ordered, therefore, in the first case, that the defendants: (1) \u201crefrain from the further disposal or transfer of solid waste at the Conrail Property . . . and on water and sewer easements,\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a civil penalty of $100,000; (2) \u201cpay to the State of Connecticut, in accordance with [\u00a7 22a-226] . . . the sum of $10,000 for each day of violation, beginning March 11,1988,\u201d a period of twenty-five days; and (3) pay a civil penalty of $50,000 rather than $250,000 if orders entered in the case were timely complied with and if the solid waste was removed from the Conrail property within five months from the date of the judgment, April 24, 1989. The court ordered, in the third case, that the defendants: (1) comply with the final order, with minor exceptions, of the commissioner; (2) \u201cdesist and refrain from threatening, interfering with or intimidating, or attempting to threaten, interfere with, or intimidate, [any] officer, agent, or employee of the State of Connecticut or of United Illuminating Company\u201d; (3) pay a civil penalty, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-226, of $500,000, \u201cfor the period beginning September 22, 1988, when the appeal from [order No. SW-259] was dismissed\u201d;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (4) pay a civil penalty of $75,000 rather than $500,000 if all orders entered in the first and third cases were timely obeyed. Having ordered the defendants, in the first case, to cease further disposal or transfer of solid waste on the Conrail property, the trial court, in the third case, ordered that the defendants immediately \u201cstop and do not resume waste transfer operations\u201d at the Singer Avenue property leased by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The defendants have appealed from both of these decisions, claiming that the trial court: (1) erred in concluding that their conduct violated the final administrative orders issued by the commissioner; and (2) abused its discretion by ordering that the defendants perform remedial measures and pay civil penalties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>without properly considering their financial ability to do so. The commissioner has cross appealed in both cases, claiming that the trial court erred: (1) in the third case, by vacating a prior contempt finding for violation of a temporary injunction made in a prior proceeding in the Superior Court; (2) by making the civil penalties in both cases conditional, dependent upon further action by the defendants; and (3) in the third case, by failing to order the removal of demolition debris from the Singer Avenue property leased by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The defendants first argue that the trial court erred in concluding that they had violated the terms of the final orders issued by the commissioner. In the first case, the defendants assert that the trial court could not have properly concluded that they had operated a \u201csolid waste land disposal and/or transfer facility\u201d on the Conrail property after March 1, 1988, the date of the original consent order, since: (1) the trial court\u2019s ruling in the fifth case, that the debris placed on the property was deposited only on a temporary basis, \u201cconclusively established the non-existence of a \u2018solid waste disposal area\u2019 on the Conrail property\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe evidence was grossly insufficient to prove the operation of a transfer station on Conrail\u2019s property.\u201d In the third case, the defendants assert that: (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish the operation of a \u201csolid waste land disposal and/or transfer facility,\u201d after July 13, 1988, the date of the commissioner\u2019s final order in that case; and (2) to the extent that the imposition of civil penalties was based on the defendants\u2019 failure to perform remedial measures contained in order No. SW-259, the trial court\u2019s decision was erroneous since the defendants were prevented, by virtue of an injunction in a related federal case, from entering the Conrail property.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The commissioner counters these arguments by asserting that: (1) mere \u201c[pjroof that waste was disposed of or transferred justifie[d] an injunction enforcing the [consent] order\u201d in the first case; (2) the issue of whether the defendants had operated a solid waste disposal area or transfer station was effectively established by the final administrative decisions in each case; (3) the evidence was sufficient in both cases to establish that the defendants had operated a \u201csolid waste land disposal and/or transfer facility\u201d; and (4) performance of the remedial measures ordered by the commissioner was not impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u201cAs a general proposition, the governing principle is that administrative adjudications have a preclusive effect when \u2018the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 422, 86 S. Ct. 1545, 16 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1965).\u201d <em>Convalescent Center of Bloomfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>208 Conn. 187, 195, 544 A.2d 604 (1988); <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>163 Conn. 309, 318, 307 A.2d 155 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S. Ct. 903, 34 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1973). \u201c[A] valid and final adjudicative determination by an administrative tribunal has the same effects under the rules of res judicata, subject to the same exceptions and qualifications, as a judgment of a court.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 83 (1). \u201cOur rules of res judicata are based on the public policy that \u2018a party should not be allowed to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate.\u2019 <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 Conn. 310, 318, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983). . . .\u201d <em>Duhaime </em>v. <em>American Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>200 Conn. 360, 363-64, 511 A.2d 333 (1986). \u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is that aspect of res judicata which prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties upon a different claim.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>supra, 316; see <em>Orselet </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>206 Conn. 542, 544-46, 539 A.2d 95 (1988); <em>Duhaime </em>v. <em>American Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Applying these principles, particularly those of collateral estoppel, to the facts of these cases, it must first be noted that in regard to both orders, the defendants have had an adequate opportunity to litigate the issue of whether their activities were encompassed within the statutory definitions of a \u201csolid waste facility\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-207 (4); or a \u201ctransfer station\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-209-l;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as claimed by the commissioner. In both cases, the orders of the commissioner specifically stated that the defendants were \u201coperating a solid waste land disposal and/or transfer facility.\u201d In the first case, the defendants, foregoing an opportunity to contest the commissioner\u2019s order, entered into a final consent order, agreeing to be ordered \u201cto wholly and absolutely cease and desist from further disposal or transfer of solid waste\u201d at the Conrail property. Such an order, just like a stipulated judgment or consent decree, will be given preclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>effect \u201cto the same extent as a judgment or decree rendered after answer and contest.\u201d <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>189 Conn. 29, 31, 453 A.2d 1162 (1983); <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>204 Conn. 38, 48-49, 526 A.2d 1329 (1987). In the third case, the defendants appeared at the hearing held by the commissioner, which resulted in a final order finding that the defendants had \u201coperated and maintained without a permit, a bulky solid waste land disposal facility and transfer station\u201d on the Conrail property, and directing that the defendants \u201cstop and do not resume waste disposal and/or waste transfer operations at the Conrail Property or at the [property leased by the defendants].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Since the defendants had consented to, or abandoned their opportunity to challenge, the commissioner\u2019s initial conclusion that their activities constituted operation of the proscribed facilities, the sole question to be answered by the trial court was whether the activities prohibited by the orders continued after their issuance by the commissioner. Recognizing that the issue of whether the defendants\u2019 past behavior constituted a violation of the relevant statutes had been determined between the parties under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the trial court noted \u201cthat the final order of the plaintiff does not forbid the operation of the waste facility as such. Rather, it requires that the defendants \u2018stop and do not resume waste disposal and/or transfer operations.\u2019 \u201d Providing further amplification while hearing the commissioner\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction in the third case, the court stated that the commissioner\u2019s order \u201cmeans just what it means in plain English, without reference to any statute. In other words, it\u2019s to stop doing what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s about it.\u201d The court also concluded that \u201cby use of the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>waste disposal and/or waste transfer operations, is meant the dumping of demolition debris on the . . . property [leased by the defendants], and processing it and transferring it to other locations. Any one of those things would constitute a violation of this order.\u201d The trial court was entirely correct in this conclusion, since, quite simply, these defendants were, before the trial court, foreclosed from contesting the commissioner\u2019s determination that their activities prior to the orders were in violation of the applicable statutes and regulations. See <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>supra, 45; <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. <em>Price, </em>193 Conn. 414, 428-29, 479 A.2d 187 (1984); <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corporation, </em>170 Conn. 27, 30-33, 364 A.2d 208 (1975). The question becomes, therefore, whether the trial court had before it evidence that the defendants did \u201c[a]ny one of those things\u201d prohibited by the orders after the dates on which the commissioner\u2019s orders became final.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In the first case, order No. SW-258 stated that the defendants were engaged in \u201clandfilling and/or transfer operations\u201d on the Conrail property. These statements were further amplified in order No. SW-259, which stated that \u201c[demolition waste has been deposited over an area of [the] Conrail property measuring approximately one acre in size. The height of the waste above the elevation of Singer Ave. varies from approximately 8 feet to 25 feet deep, and waste has also been placed below the original grade of the property into virgin soil.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is in relation to these activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ties that we must review the evidence presented at trial, in order to decide whether the court was justified in determining that the defendants had violated the terms of the commissioner\u2019s prior orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">First, the defendants stipulated, at a postjudgment hearing relating to the court\u2019s imposition of conditional civil penalties, that, even fifteen months after issuance of the final order in the third case, they were \u201cnot in compliance . . . with each and every one of [the] ten [remedial] terms\u201d set forth in the order and incorporated, with minor changes, into the trial court\u2019s judgment in that case. Second, the trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 activities in each case had been in \u201cflagrant\u201d violation of the commissioner\u2019s final orders. In response to the defendants\u2019 motions for articulation, the court indicated that these conclusions were based, in the first case, on its own viewing of the Conrail property as well as the testimony of a detective from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>state police department. That detective offered testimony from which the court could have concluded that the defendants both discarded and removed debris from the Conrail property \u201cseveral times during each day,\u201d when he had observed their activities on at least twenty-eight weekly occasions after March, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In the third case, the court indicated that its conclusion rested upon evidence cited in a memorandum provided by the commissioner in response to the defendants\u2019 motion. That memorandum referred to another witness, who had given testimony indicating that the defendants had deposited and removed debris from both the Conrail and the defendants\u2019 leased property on a \u201cfairly continuous\u201d basis from February, 1988, until the summer of 1988. Further, the memorandum summarized testimony from which the court could have concluded that the defendants, between December 12, 1988, and February 17,1989, had placed debris on their leased property in an amount sufficient to cover one quarter of the parcel to a depth of twenty-five to thirty feet. The memorandum also noted that the defendants had not, as of May 30,1989, begun any of the remedial measures contained in the commissioner\u2019s final order, citing the defendant Cappozziello\u2019s testimony that he did not \u201cbelieve [he] answered the clean up orders</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We conclude, on the basis of our review of the evidence cited, that the trial court was entirely justified in ruling that the defendants had violated the terms of both orders issued by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The defendants next argue that the trial court\u2019s decision in the third case is erroneous to the extent that the penalties imposed were based on the defendants\u2019 failure to perform the remedial measures set forth in the commissioner\u2019s final order. The defendants assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>that they were prevented from accomplishing those clean up measures by virtue of an injunction in a federal case brought by Conrail, prohibiting the defendants from entering the Conrail property. Thus, the defendants argue, since \u201c[t]he inability of a party to obey an order of the court, without fault on his part, is a good defense to the charge of contempt\u201d; <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 57, 539 A.2d 995 (1988); civil penalties should not have been imposed on them for their failure to carry out the remedial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The injunction on which the defendants rely was issued by a United States District Court judge on February 18,1988, and ordered, \u201con consent,\u201d that the defendants were \u201cenjoined\" from <em>trespassing </em>or encouraging others to <em>trespass </em>on plaintiffs property, or from digging, dumping demolition debris and other materials ... on plaintiff\u2019[s] property . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The order contains absolutely nothing prohibiting the defendants from entering the Conrail property in order to remove debris that they had previously dumped there, and in fact, in its proposed form, had required that the defendants do precisely that. That clean up order was deleted, however, when the injunction was actually issued by the federal judge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Further, the defendants do not explain how they could be trespassers on the Conrail property, if they entered under the authority of the commissioner\u2019s final order, No. SW-259, or with the consent of Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The commissioner\u2019s final order commanded Conrail, as well as United Illuminating Company, which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>parties to the administrative and trial proceedings, to give just such consent. That order provided that \u201c[Conrail] and the United Illuminating Company are each ordered to assist in the correction of the violations addressed in this proceeding by allowing [the defendants] access to the Conrail Property for the <em>limited purpose of carrying out actions required by this order.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Even if this argument concerning the federal court injunction had been presented at trial, it was implicitly rejected by the court\u2019s verbatim adoption, in its judgment in the third case, of this portion of the commissioner\u2019s final order. Further, testimony presented to the court indicated that Conrail sought only to prevent the further dumping of debris on its property and did not oppose entry to remove the debris that was already there.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that entry upon property with permission of the owner, absent subsequent acts of abuse, is a defense to a claim of trespass.

Conn. 1975); prior to the imposition of penalties in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208, the legislature has directed the commissioner to \u201cadminister and enforce the planning and implementation requirements\u201d of our solid waste management statutes, chapter 446d. In addition, the commissioner \u201cshall examine all existing or proposed solid waste facilities and provide for their proper planning, design, construction, operation, monitoring, closure and postclosure maintenance . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208. In order to prevent damage to our environment, \u201c[t]he commissioner shall order the alteration, extension, limitation, closure or replacement of such facilities whenever necessary . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208. The defendants do not contest the commissioner\u2019s ability to impose remedial measures under her broad statutory author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ity. They do argue, however, that the cost of any remedial actions ordered must be considered before the court may impose civil penalties pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-226, which authorizes the imposition of a penalty \u201cnot to exceed ten thousand dollars per day,\u201d or injunctive relief against those who violate a final order of the commissioner. The defendants do concede that \u00a7 22a-226 \u201cvests wide discretion in the court since it is notably silent on the factors which must be considered by the court in deciding what a fair and proper civil penalty might be in any given situation.\u201d The defendants assert, nevertheless, that at the time of trial, it was \u201cmanifestly clear that any substantial penalty or fine imposed by the court in this case, given the company\u2019s financial condition, would render the business insolvent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">This court has not had prior occasion to rule upon the financial implications of civil penalties and injunctive relief imposed under our solid waste management statutes. In the absence of further guidance from the legislature, we find persuasive, although not binding, the authorities cited to us by both the defendants and the commissioner. We conclude that when trial courts are asked to impose penalties pursuant to \u00a7 22a-226 they are to be guided in the exercise of their discretion by considering such factors as those set forth in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (b) (6) (A), as well as by the two general goals set forth in the Civil Penalty Policy; Env. Rptr. (BNA) p. 41:2991-93; of the federal Environmental Protection Agency. See <em>Chesapeake Bay Foundation </em>v. <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, </em>611 F. Sup. 1542, 1556-57 (E.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 791 F.2d 304 (4th Cir. 1986), vacated on other grounds, 484 U.S. 49, 108 S. Ct. 376, 98 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1987). Those factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the size of the business involved; (2) the effect of the penalty or injunctive relief on its ability to continue operation; (3) the gravity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the violation; (4) the good faith efforts made by the business to comply with applicable statutory requirements; (5) any economic benefit gained by the violations; (6) deterrence of future violations; and (7) the fair and equitable treatment of the regulated community. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319 (d) (Cum. Sup. 1989);<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Pirg </em>v. <em>Powell Duffryn Terminals, Inc., </em>720 F. Sup. 1158, 1160 (D.N.J. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Environmental Waste Control, Inc., </em>710 F. Sup. 1172, 1242-45 (N.D.

Sup. 314, 322 (D.S.C. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Applying these factors to these cases, we first note that the trial court made the following relevant findings. In its memorandum of decision in the second case, the court noted that the individual defendant had \u201cbeen very active, and his work has included jobs that have added up to large sums of money. His records that were presented indicated that not everything was reflected in them, and that they were incomplete. Also, he failed to produce a copy of his 1986 income tax return even though he had been ordered to do so. His explanation as to this was not satisfactory. It is noted also that when he was previously fined for contempt, the court observed that the sum of $3500 per day was set so as to make a further violation unprofitable. However, this failed to deter the defendant.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[tjhere was evidence presented as to Mr. Capozziello\u2019s acts or threats of violence toward members of the plaintiffs staff. This conduct, while not bearing directly upon the merits, affected his credibility.\u201d While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the court noted that the individual defendant was \u201chard-working ... his questionable testimony, his intimidation of witnesses and his disregard for the order of the court greatly affect[ed] his credibility.\u201d As noted previously, the court also found that the defendants had \u201cflagrantly\u201d violated both of the orders issued by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The defendants have not sought further articulation of the factual basis underlying the court\u2019s imposition of injunctive relief and civil penalties in these cases. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051. \u201cThe correctness of a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. We do not presume error. The burden is on the appellant to prove harmful error.\u201d <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 7, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); <em>DiBerardino </em>v. <em>DiBerardino, </em>213 Conn. 373, 385, 568 A.2d 431 (1990). In the absence of further articulation of its reasoning \u201cit would be sheer speculation for this court to assume that the trial court applied the incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn. 224, 232, 520 A.2d 226 (1987); <em>DiBerardino </em>v. <em>DiBerardino, </em>supra. Since there was ample evidence before the trial court to justify the imposition of both remedial measures and substantial penalties, the defendants have not satisfied their burden of proving that the trial court failed to consider the defendants\u2019 financial condition prior to rendering judgment in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in ordering injunctive relief in the form of remedial measures or the imposition of civil penalties in the amount of $750,000. Although the defendants\u2019 ability to continue in the building demolition business was one factor for the court to consider, that factor alone should not be given overriding weight in the face of \u201cflagrant\u201d and repeated violations of our solid waste management statutes. Not only did the defendants fail to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the orders issued by the commissioner, but they also continued this behavior even after the trial court had imposed penalties for contempt in the amount of $3500 per day. Further, the trial court heard testimony that the individual defendant had attempted to intimidate, offered to fight, attacked, and threatened to kill persons employed by the commissioner to investigate the subject matter of these cases. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 ability to continue in the building demolition business was given its proper perspective in light of the other relevant factors we have set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In her first issue on the cross appeal, the commissioner argues that the trial court erred in the first case by vacating a previous order of the court, <em>Freed, J., </em>finding the defendants in contempt of a temporary injunction issued by the court, <em>Shaughnessey, J. </em>The court, <em>Hon. John M. Alexander, </em>state trial referee, concluded that Judge Freed had held the defendants in contempt for behavior that was not within the scope of the temporary injunction issued by Judge Shaughnessey. Specifically, Referee Alexander noted that it was undisputed that the defendants had been found in contempt for activities that had taken place on the Singer-Avenue property leased by the defendants for their demolition operations. Concluding that the temporary injunction had referred to only the Conrail property, and that it was \u201capparent that Judge Freed was not made aware of this oversight,\u201d Referee Alexander concluded that \u201cfairness and accuracy require[d] that [he] should intervene.\u201d The commissioner claims, however, that the temporary injunction included the property leased by the defendants, that Judge Freed was indeed aware of the arguments concerning the scope of the injunction, and that \u201c[Referee] Alexander construed the language of the injunction much more nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>rowly . . . . \u201d The commissioner contends that this issue should have been controlled by the law of the case, and that Referee Alexander, therefore, should have deferred to the ruling made by Judge Freed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cThe law of the case is not written in stone but is a flexible principle of many facets adaptable to the exigencies of the different situations in which it may be invoked.\u201d <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>186 Conn. 86, 99, 439 A.2d 1066 (1982). \u201cWhere a matter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily, the court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may treat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the opinion that the issue was correctly decided, in the absence of some new or overriding circumstance.\u201d Id. \u201cA judge should hesitate to change his own rulings in a case and should be even more reluctant to overrule those of another judge. . . . Judge shopping is not to be encouraged and a decent respect for the views of his brethren on the bench is commendable in a judge. Nevertheless, if the case comes before him regularly and he becomes convinced that the view of the law previously applied by his coordinate predecessor was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice if followed, he may apply his own judgment.\u201d Id., 99-100; see <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 458, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988); <em>Rosenblit </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>206 Conn. 125, 132-33, 537 A.2d 145 (1988); <em>Mac\u2019s Car City, Inc. </em>v. <em>American National Bank, </em>205 Conn. 255, 259-60, 532 A.2d 1302 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The temporary injunction issued by Judge Shaughnessey, on March 3,1988, ordered the defendants \u201cto wholly and absolutely desist and refrain from disposal or transfer of solid waste at 1 Singer Avenue . . . on property owned by [Conrail] and on water and sewer easements controlled by the United Illuminating Company . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The commissioner concedes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>property description contained in the temporary injunction is virtually identical to the description of the property on which the commissioner found the defendants were engaged in prohibited activities, which is contained in the final consent order entered in the first case. The commissioner also concedes that \u201cJudge Freed held the defendants in contempt for conduct wholly\u201d on the property leased by them, but argues, nevertheless, that the specific language of the injunction is not controlling since order No. SW-258 was entitled: \u201cIn the matter of an order to cease and desist unlawful disposal of solid waste on land known as 1 Singer Avenue, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and on adjacent land owned by the Consolidated Rail Corporation.\u201d The commissioner claims that this title of the order encompassed both the Conrail property and the property leased by the defendants, and that it was this description which Judge Freed considered when he found the defendants to be in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In support of this contention, the commissioner refers us to testimony given by the individual defendant before Judge Freed on October 31, 1988, that the property known as 1 Singer Avenue consisted of both the Conrail property and the property leased by the defendants.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That testimony does not, however, assist the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>commissioner, since it was accepted by all those involved that the Singer Avenue site consisted of two parcels, the Conrail property and the property leased by the defendants, but that the behavior for which the defendants were found to be in contempt had occurred on the leased property.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s assertion that Judge Freed was aware of the differing property descriptions in the injunction and the heading of her order, our review of the transcript from the contempt hearing reveals that Judge Freed was never alerted to the fact that \u201c1 Singer Avenue,\u201d as used in the temporary injunction, referred only to the Conrail property. In fact, Judge Freed specifically stated: \u201cAs I read the injunction the defendants are restrained from disposal or transfer of solid waste <em>at 1 Singer Avenue\u201d </em>(emphasis added), which according to the testimony he had heard referred to <em>both </em>the Conrail property and the leased property. Judge Freed was never informed that the temporary injunction actually included just the Conrail property within its commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">An injunction \u201cshould be clear and certain in its terms, so that the party upon whom it is served may readily know what he can or cannot do thereunder, seeing that the consequences of a breach may subject him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>to loss of property . . . . \u201d <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>58 Conn. 496, 502, 20 A. 618 (1890); <em>Palverari </em>v. <em>Finta, </em>129 Conn. 38, 40, 26 A.2d 229 (1942); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>65 Conn. 365, 396, 32 A. 939 (1895); <em>Rogers Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. 121, 125 (1871). The particular things forbidden by an injunction are \u201cto be determined from the terms of the injunctive order, read in view of the relief sought and the issues made in the case before the court which rendered it, and it will be given neither a wider nor a narrower scope than is warranted by such construction.\u201d 42 Am. Jur. 2d., Injunctions \u00a7 337; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>supra, 498-99. In this case, however, regardless of whether \u201cJudge Freed\u2019s decision reflected the intent of the initial order that was carried into the final order and the injunction enforcing it,\u201d as contended by the commissioner, the fact remains that the injunction, though using some language contained in the commissioner\u2019s original order, specifically enjoined the defendants from activities only on the Conrail property.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Under these circumstances the doctrine of the law of the case is patently inapplicable, since Judge Freed was never asked to rule upon the scope of the property description contained in the temporary injunction. See <em>Rosenblit </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>supra, 133. Rather, Judge Freed\u2019s decision reflects only his understanding that: (1) the defendants were prohibited from dumping or transferring solid waste at 1 Singer Avenue; (2) 1 Singer Avenue was comprised of both the Conrail property and the property leased by the defendants; and (3) the defendants had violated the terms of the injunction only by engaging in the prohibited activities on the Singer Avenue property leased by them, not the Conrail property. Referee Alexander, in turn, correctly concluded that Judge Freed\u2019s finding of contempt was plainly wrong, on the basis of the simple fact that the proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>did not meet the prohibition of the injunction limited to the Conrail property, and that this had not been brought to the court\u2019s attention. Cf. <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>214 Conn. 23, 37, 570 A.2d 673 (1990) (no abuse of discretion in setting aside judgment based upon ground not raised during prior trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In her initial brief on the cross appeals in the first and third cases, the commissioner argued that the trial court erred by ruling that the amount of the civil penalties would be conditional, depending upon the defendants\u2019 compliance with orders entered by the court as well as their removal of the solid waste from the Conrail site within five months of the date judgments were rendered in these cases, April 24, 1989. The commissioner now claims that this issue is moot, the trial court having already concluded that the conditions imposed by the judgments were not satisfied by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The judgment in the first case imposed civil penalties in the amount of $250,000, to be reduced to $50,000 \u201cif the defendants compl[ied] with the orders entered in [that] case and if they also removfed] the solid waste from the Conrail Property within five months\u201d from the date of judgment. Similarly, the judgment in the third case imposed civil penalties in the amount of $500,000, to be reduced to $75,000 if the \u201cdefendants timely obey[ed] all of the orders of the court entered in this case and in [the first case].\u201d On September 27, 1989, the commissioner filed motions in each case, requesting that the court rale that the conditions established in the judgments had not been met by the defendants. At a hearing conducted on October 27,1989, the defendants stipulated that none of the clean up orders entered in either case had been complied with. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>court accepted the stipulation and stated that it would hear argument on the commissioner\u2019s motions on November 17, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In the interim, the defendants filed applications for a nunc pro tunc order in each case, \u201capplying retroactively to April 24, 1989, staying judgments entered . . . pending a final determination of appeals of [those] judgments . ...\u201d At the hearing conducted on November 17,1989,-the defendants withdrew any claim that the prohibitory commands of the judgments should be stayed, and limited their request to one which would have stayed the running of the five month conditional period until this court had resolved the then pending appeals in these cases. Later in the hearing, however, the defendants limited their request even further, \u201casking that [the proposed stay] apply to the imposition of penalties, and really to nothing else,\u201d since the penalties imposed \u201cwould simply\u2014a business that would\u2014 would just be wiped off the face of the earth with that type of\u2014with that type of a fine imposed.\u201d In response to United Illuminating Company\u2019s concern that the five month conditional clean up period was also going to be stayed, the defendants confirmed the court\u2019s understanding that it was \u201cnot going to grant this stay as it applies] to the mandatory order,\u201d and the court concluded, consequently, that the defendants would \u201cstart in to clean up, and whether they do or not, <em>at least the order isn't going to be changed\u2014altered. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In light of the fact that they made \u201cno attack on either the prohibitory or mandatory provisions of the . . . injunctions,\u201d since they would be \u201ccrazy to try,\u201d the defendants concluded their presentation at the November 17,1989 hearing by requesting that tb\u00ab court \u201cgrant the motion determining that the condition for reducing the penalty in [both cases had] not been met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The court subsequently issued two memoranda of decision, the first noting that \u201c[i]t has been stipulated and the Court finds that the conditions in the judgment permitting the Reduction of a Portion of the civil penalty have not been met.\u201d In the second, the court concluded that the defendants had asked for \u201cthe stay only as it relates to the <em>imposition of a penalty or penalties. </em>[They do] not seek a stay as to the other orders, including the prohibitory and mandatory orders of the judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Recognizing that its order involved the possibility of both irreparable harm to the defendants and potential harm to the public as well as the other parties in these cases, the court concluded that the postponement of \u201cthe infliction of monetary penalties until the appeal is resolved will not unduly cause harm\u201d to the interests involved. The court ordered, therefore, that the defendants\u2019 request for stays of the judgments be granted \u201conly as [they involve] <em>the question of monetary penalties; </em>it is DENIED as to the remaining orders.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">During oral argument before this court, counsel for the defendants stated that it was his understanding of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the stay of execution that the time period for completion of the remedial measures would not begin to run until this court had issued a final determination of the various appeals and cross appeals in these cases. Although comments made by the trial court, during the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motions, tend to undercut this understanding, the fact remains that the memorandum concerning the stay of execution does not specifically answer the question of whether the five month conditional period was to be stayed pending appeal. Nor does the memorandum specifically impose the $750,000 civil penalty, with only collection to be stayed pending the outcome of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>appeals. Rather, the court ordered that stays be granted only in relation to \u201cthe question of monetary penalties.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cAn articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 435, 513 A.2d 620 (1986); <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>213 Conn. 686, 694-95, 569 A.2d 1126 (1990). Such an articulation is especially appropriate when, as in these cases, the payment of an additional $625,000 in civil penalties hangs in the balance. We conclude, therefore, that the question of whether this claim is moot depends entirely on whether the five month clean up period was to commence on April 24,1989, the date of the judgments, or on the date that this court issues its opinion. If the date of judgment is controlling, the commissioner\u2019s claim is moot, while if the date of this opinion is controlling, the defendants may still be able to avoid payment of the higher civil penalty. Since the answer to this question is not specifically contained in the memorandum of decision on the stay, we remand this case, sua sponte, for further articulation of the stay order of the court. <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>supra, 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On remand, the trial court must answer the following question. After consideration of the defendants\u2019 application for stays of execution, did the court stay the commencement of the five month period during which the defendants could have satisfied the clean up orders entered in the judgments, or did the stay of execution encompass only the actual payment of $750,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>in civil penalties? If commencement of the five month conditional period <em>was not stayed, </em>the court will enter orders requiring the defendants to make payment of the full amount of the civil penalties imposed in each case. If, on the other hand, the commencement of the five month conditional period <em>was stayed </em>by the court, this court, having supervision of a case on appeal; <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>supra; will fully consider the commissioner\u2019s claim of error. The trial court\u2019s articulation should be promptly filed with the clerk of this court for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In her final claim on the cross appeal in the third case, the commissioner argues that since the defendants violated her final order in that case, by depositing demolition debris on their leased property on Singer Avenue after the close of evidence at trial, the court erred by not ordering the defendants to remove the debris, as the court had done in the first case in relation to the debris located on the Conrail property. We conclude that this issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The commissioner submitted, nearly three months after the close of evidence, a motion for leave to amend her complaint. The amendment requested that the court order the defendants \u201cto remove the solid waste deposited at [their leased property] in violation of the final decision and order [of the commissioner] . . . and deposit it in a manner authorized by law . . . .\u201d At a hearing conducted by the trial court on April 17, 1989, the commissioner argued that her original complaint in this case did not include a request that the court order the defendants to remove debris from their leased property, for the simple reason that there was not a significant amount of debris on that property until after the completion of the trial. Consequently, when it became apparent to the commissioner that debris was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>being placed on that property, she asked to amend her complaint in the manner specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In response to the commissioner\u2019s request, the court concluded that, because the final order, No. SW-259, issued by the commissioner prohibited only the disposal or transfer of solid waste on the defendants\u2019 leased property, and did not order the removal of any such debris, the court was limited to the terms of that order and could not require the defendants to remove whatever debris they had placed there subsequent to the issuance of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Before discussing the merits of this issue, we must address a jurisdictional matter raised by the commissioner. In her initial brief, the commissioner informed us that as of September 28, 1989, the date the brief was filed, the defendants\u2019 leased property had been cleared of demolition debris.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The absence of any evidence that the defendants have deposited debris on their leased property after September 28,1989, raises the question of whether this issue is moot, in which case this court would be deprived of jurisdiction over the dispute, since we are powerless to issue advisory opinions. <em>Westport </em>v. <em>State, </em>204 Conn. 212, 217, 527 A.2d 1177 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>203 Conn. 420, 424-25, 524 A.2d 1148 (1987); <em>Reply of the Judges, </em>33 Conn. 586 (1867). The commissioner, however, relying upon <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>197 Conn. 566, 499 A.2d 1158 (1985), argues that we should address this issue since it is \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d Id., 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">To the extent that the commissioner\u2019s claim of error depends upon the court\u2019s failure to order the removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of debris placed on the defendants\u2019 leased property after the close of evidence in this case, that issue is truly moot since we can give the commissioner no practical relief. Quite obviously, the defendants cannot be ordered to remove debris that is already gone. See <em>Hallas </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>212 Conn. 338, 348, 562 A.2d 499 (1989); <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 249-50, 440 A.2d 310 (1982). Further, to the extent that the commissioner seeks a determination from this court that the trial court <em>could have, </em>on the basis of the commissioner\u2019s final order, required the removal of debris from the defendants\u2019 leased property, that issue, while possibly capable of repetition, would not evade review. We note that on April 24, 1989, seven days after the court\u2019s oral ruling on the commissioner\u2019s motion to amend her complaint, the court rendered its judgment in this case. That judgment included an order that the defendants comply with the entire final order of the commissioner and \u201cstop and do not resume waste transfer operations\u201d on their leased property. Future violations of this order, should any occur, would constitute a basis for a contempt of court proceeding; see <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>197 Conn. 141, 150, 496 A.2d 476 (1985); the punishment for which is within the sole discretion of the trial court; <em>Rogers Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>supra, 123; and \u201cshould be adapted and determined . . . with regard chiefly to the circumstances, character, and extent of the violation\u201d; <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>83 Conn. 417, 428, 76 A. 986 (1910); within the court\u2019s power to fashion equitable remedies. See <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Alliance, </em>127 Conn. 415, 418-19, 17 A.2d 525 (1941). We conclude, therefore, that the issue of whether the defendants should have been ordered, at the April 17, 1989 hearing, to remove the demolition debris deposited on their leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>property after trial, but removed some time prior to September 28, 1989, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In the second and fourth cases, the court concluded that the defendants had \u201cdumped\u201d demolition debris in the towns of Trumbull and Ansonia, in violation of \u00a7 22a-250 (c).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Both cases involved the defendants\u2019 agreement with private land owners allowing the defendants to place demolition debris, generated in the course of their business operations, upon the owners\u2019 properties. In the second case, the defendants claimed that they had no knowledge of the operation in Trumbull, and in both cases asserted that demolition waste was not included within the prohibitions set forth in \u00a7 22a-250 (c) and also that, in any event, that subsection was inapplicable to their actions since they had obtained the permission of the land owners prior to commencing their activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In its memoranda of decision in these cases, the court found that: (1) there was \u201cample evidence proving that the defendant was well aware of the operation\u201d involving the Trumbull property; (2) the disposal of demolition waste was included within the definition of \u201clitter,\u201d as that term is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-248 (4)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and, therefore, constituted \u201cdumping\u201d as that term is defined in General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u00a7 22a-248 (12);<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and (3) the defendants were liable for the imposition of fines, despite the fact that they had obtained permission of the property owners prior to depositing the demolition debris upon their properties, since \u201cif the legislature [had] intended that the owner\u2019s agreement alone would exonerate, this circumstance would have been included as an exception\u201d to the statute. The court found that dumping had occurred at the Trumbull property on at least twenty occasions and had occurred on at least fifteen occasions at the Ansonia property. On the basis of these findings, the court ordered, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-250 (e),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> that the defendants pay civil penalties of $8000 for the Trumbull violations and $9000 for the violations in Ansonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The defendants have appealed from these judgments, claiming that: (1) the court erred in the Trumbull matter by \u201crelying on ambiguous, equivocal and speculative evidence to support\u201d its factual finding that the defendants were \u201cwell aware of the [disposal] operation\u201d; (2) \u00a7 22a-250 (c) is applicable only to \u201cdumping\u201d committed by trespassers and not those who \u201cdump\u201d with permission of the land owner; and (3) as applied in these cases, \u00a7 22a-250 is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the defendants\u2019 right to due process of law. The commissioner has filed a cross appeal in both cases, claiming that the civil penalties imposed by the trial court were insufficient, \u201cgiven the amount and scope of the dumping.\u201d We agree with the defendants\u2019 second contention and, therefore, need not address any of the other issues raised by the defendants or the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Section 22a-250 (c) prohibits the dumping of any material, \u201cupon private property in this state not owned\u201d by the person dumping. Exceptions to this prohibition are provided when the activity occurs on property \u201cdesignated by the state or any political subdivision thereof for dumping\u201d and the person dumping is authorized to do so, or when the \u201cproperty is a licensed facility\u201d for dumping. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-250 (c). Since the defendants do not contest the court\u2019s finding that their activities were within the statutory definition of \u201cdump\u201d contained in \u00a7 22a-248 (12) and, further, do not claim that their activities were encompassed within one of the exceptions to \u00a7 22a-250 (c), we are confronted in these cases with the applicability of \u00a7 22a-250 (c) to situations in which \u201cdumping\u201d has occurred with the full knowledge and permission of the property owner.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201c \u2018Where the words of a statute fail to indicate clearly whether the provision applies in certain circumstances, it must be construed by this court . . . . \u2019 <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 550, 436 A.2d 266 (1980). Under our rules of statutory construction, this court is to be guided by the language, purpose and legislative history of the statute in question.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 405, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). Although \u00a7 22a-250 (c) clearly prohibits a person from \u201cdumping\u201d on land not owned by him without permission of the owner of that land, it is just as clear that civil penal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ties cannot be imposed, at least under this statute, upon a person who \u201cdumps\u201d on his own property. The situation presented in these cases is not expressly dealt with in the statute, since the land in question was not owned by the defendants, but their activities took place with the consent of the owners. The legislative history associated with this statute is no more illuminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">That history, as relied upon by the commissioner, reveals that \u00a7 22a-250 was amended by No. 87-531 of the 1987 Public Acts, to authorize civil penalties in the maximum amount of $10,000 for each violation of subsection (c), rather than the former penalties, limited to those provided for the commission of infractions of the law. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-164m.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The increased penalties, according to Representative Mary M. Mushinsky, were required since, \u201c[a]s legal bulky waste dump sites have become more scarce, haulers are dumping in <em>vacant lots and offroad areas </em>and small fines are no deterrent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 30 H.R. Proc., Pt. 33, 1987 Sess., p. 12,072. Representative Mushinsky went on to state that the increased fine was \u201cobviously intended for the major league haulers that have been flagrantly dumping and paying only a $99 penalty . . . which is no deterrent to them what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>soever. They, it is worth it for a hauler to dump several loads of bulky waste onto a vacant lot . . . . \u201d Id., 12,084-85. This explanation of the impetus behind the increase in the maximum authorized penalty does not relate to the situation at hand. If any implication is to be drawn, it is that the increased penalty was to be applied to haulers who dump without the permission of the land owner. There is no indication from the legislative history cited by the commissioner that \u00a7 22a-250 (c) was intended to apply to those who \u201cdump\u201d with the permission of the land owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The commissioner also argues that \u00a7 22a-250 (c) is a remedial statute, \u201cdesigned to benefit the people of the State of Connecticut by preventing pollution,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cshould be liberally construed to accomplish [its] purpose.\u201d <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 57, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). While we agree with the general proposition that environmental protection statutes are to be liberally construed, in these cases we are presented with the equally persuasive principle that as a penal law; see <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 316, 417 A.2d 343 (1979) ; \u00a7 22a-250 (c) must be strictly construed against the state and in favor of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 579, 556 A.2d 584 (1989). In interpreting the statute, we must \u201cassume that a reasonable and rational result was intended by the promulgating legislature.\u201d <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>208 Conn. 543, 553, 546 A.2d 226 (1988). Further, \u201c[t]he unreasonableness of the result produced by one among alternative possible interpretations of a statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would produce a reasonable result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 563; 429 A.2d 960 (1980) .</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22a-250 (c) could lead to completely unreasonable results in its applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tion, both to these defendants as well as to other persons who \u201cdump\u201d with the consent of the respective land owners. The court\u2019s conclusion, that the legislature would have specifically excluded from the operation of \u00a7 22a-250 (c) persons dumping with the permission of the land owner had it intended to do so, is one step beyond the relevant inquiry in this regard. While ordinarily, \u201cthe express mention in a statute of one exemption precludes reading others into it\u201d; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948); it must first be shown that the particular behavior in question is included within the activities prohibited by the statute. Cf. <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 589, 573 A.2d 699 (1990) (before the need for an exclusion arises, there must first be coverage within the defined scope of the insurance policy in question). Taken to its logical conclusion, the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22a-250 (c) would subject persons to civil penalties of up to $10,000 for merely assisting a land owner to \u201cdump\u201d upon his own property when no penalty could be imposed if the owner performed the same activity himself. It would be unreasonable to construe the exclusion for dumping by the owner to apply only when he performed the physical acts involved and to hold that it did not extend to those he had engaged to transport material to his land, such as his servants, agents or others, like the defendants, authorized to do so. The commissioner has not presented any reasonable basis for concluding that the intention of the legislature in excluding from \u00a7 22a-250 (c) dumping activities conducted by the owner was limited to those he performed personally and did not apply to the same deeds of other persons acting under his authority. The relevant history and language of this statute do not suggest that the legislature intended such an unreasonable result.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 22a-250 (c) was not intended to be applied to those who \u201cdump\u201d on land with the full knowledge and consent of the property-owner. Since that is precisely what transpired in these cases, the court erred in imposing civil penalties upon the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In the fifth case, the commissioner alleged that the defendants had violated \u00a7 22a-250 (c) by \u201cdumping\u201d demolition debris on the Conrail property and the property leased by the defendants. The trial court concluded, despite the fact that the defendants had not obtained the permission of the property owners prior to placing debris on the property, that the defendants had not engaged in \u201cdumping,\u201d as that term is utilized in \u00a7 22a-250 (c) and defined in \u00a7 22a-248 (12).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The commissioner has appealed from this judgment, claiming that: (1) the court erred by failing to give preclusive effect to a final order issued by the commissioner, in which it had been determined \u201cthat the defendants operated a solid waste disposal facility at the Conrail property, and that it was therefore the location utilized for the ultimate disposal of wastes\u201d; (2) the court erred by construing \u00a7 22a-250 (c) to require proof of an intent to leave the demolition debris on the Conrail property permanently; and (3) the activities of the defendants were encompassed within the word \u201cdump,\u201d as specified in \u00a7 22a-250 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The court found the following relevant facts. After the defendants had demolished a building it was neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>sary for them to dispose of the resulting debris. Since the cost of placing the debris in a legally certified landfill was very high, the defendants transported it from the various job sites to the properties on Singer Avenue, where it was kept until a place was found for its ultimate disposal. The defendants made no claim that they had acquired permission of the owners of the two Singer Avenue properties prior to placing such debris upon their land. The evidence was \u201cirrefutable\u201d that over the time period in question, the debris remained at Singer Avenue for a time and was later transported to other locations. For example, the debris that was deposited on the property in Trumbull; see part II of this opinion; had been transported there from the Singer Avenue properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On the basis of these facts, the court concluded that \u00a7 22a-250 (c) had not been violated by the defendants, since it could not be concluded \u201cthat the defendants intended to keep the debris at Singer Avenue permanently.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201cin order to \u2018dump,\u2019 one must necessarily \u2018discard\u2019 some forbidden object.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-250 (c) and 22a-248 (12). Since the evidence showed that \u201cwhen the material was deposited at [the Conrail property by the defendants,] it was done only on a temporary basis, and that the final act of discarding it did not take place until it was removed elsewhere,\u201d the court concluded that the defendants had not violated \u00a7 22a-250 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The commissioner first argues that the court erred by not giving preclusive effect to her determination, contained in final order No. SW-259, that the defendants had \u201coperated and maintained without a permit, a bulky solid waste land disposal facility and transfer station\u201d on the Conrail property. The commissioner contends that, since the court also concluded, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>third case, that the defendants had operated a solid waste facility at Singer Avenue and because such a determination necessarily included a finding that the Singer Avenue properties were \u201cthe location utilized for ultimate disposal of wastes\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-207 (4) and (6);<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the court could not have logically concluded in this case that the Singer Avenue properties were not utilized for the ultimate disposal of the debris placed there by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">When presented with this seeming inconsistency, by means of a motion for articulation, the court reiterated that it had not been shown, in this case, that the defendants intended to keep the debris at Singer Avenue on a permanent basis. Recognizing that this finding was at odds with its finding in the third case, that the defendants had operated a solid waste disposal facility, the court concluded that in the third case it had \u201cfound a number of reasons to sustain the Commissioner\u2019s order, any one of which would [have been] sufficient.\u201d The court concluded that its finding of the operation of a solid waste disposal area \u201cwas only one of the reasons,\u201d and that it was \u201cquestionable whether [it] was a valid reason.\u201d Consequently, the court adhered to its ruling that \u201cthe evidence did not establish the intent to keep the debris on the Conrail [property] permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">We have concluded, in part I, A, 1 of this opinion, that final orders promulgated by the commissioner are to be given preclusive effect when issues finally resolved, during the administrative process that resulted in the order, are sought to be relitigated during subsequent enforcement proceedings before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Superior Court. In applying this principle to this case, however, the commissioner overlooks the fact that the final order on which she relies concluded that the defendants\u2019 activities on the Singer Avenue properties constituted both a \u201cbulky solid waste land disposal facility <em>and </em>transfer station . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with the defendants that these findings, in relation to the same operative facts, are mutually exclusive, since, contrary to the finding of \u201cultimate disposal\u201d necessary for the operation of a \u201csolid waste facility,\u201d the operation of a \u201ctransfer station,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 22a-209-l of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and General Statutes \u00a7 22a-207 (5),<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> specifically contemplates that the solid waste will be \u201ctransferred to a vehicle for removal to another solid waste facility.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-209-l. Further, there is nothing in the record indicating that the issue of the final resting place of the debris deposited on the Singer Avenue property was necessarily litigated in the administrative proceedings conducted by the commissioner. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 Conn. 310, 316-17, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983); 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 27. In fact, the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the defendants had operated <em>both </em>a solid waste disposal facility and a transfer station would indicate that resolution of the question whether the deposit of the Singer Avenue debris was transitory in nature was unnecessary for the orders issued by the commissioner as a result of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Quite understandably, the commissioner does not rely upon the preclusive effect of the court\u2019s conclusion, in the third case, that the defendants had operated a solid waste disposal facility on the Singer Avenue property. \u201cFor a judgment to operate as res judicata and be conclusive evidence of a fact sought to be established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>it, it must appear that the fact was a material or essential one, and that the judgment could not have been rendered without deciding the matter.\u201d 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 423. Thus, \u201cthe general rule is that the judgment in the former action . . . is not conclusive as to matters . . . which were not necessary to uphold the judgment.\u201d Id.; <em>Coit </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>8 Conn. 268, 276 (1830). Since the court later determined that it was \u201cquestionable\u201d whether its finding, that the defendants had operated a solid waste disposal facility, was a valid reason for upholding the final order of the commissioner, we conclude that that finding was neither necessary to nor an alternate basis for the judgment rendered in the third case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 463, 497 A.2d 974 (1985); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>supra, 317; <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Gartenhaus Cafe, </em>15 Conn. App. 392, 402, 546 A.2d 284 (1988), aff\u2019d, 211 Conn. 67, 557 A.2d 540 (1989); 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 427. Consequently, that finding could not have precluded relitigation of the issue of whether the Singer Avenue property was intended to be the final resting place of the debris transported there by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The commissioner argues next that the court erred by injecting into the terms of \u00a7 22a-250 (c), a specific intent element requiring that there be proof of an intent to abandon waste permanently before there can be a violation of the statute. Quite simply, the commissioner argues that \u201c[t]he statute involved in this appeal says do not dump. It does not say do not dump with an intent to permanently abandon the dumped material. No intent standard appears in the statute itself and none should be imputed.\u201d While we agree with the commissioner, that proof of a specific intent is not required in order to establish a violation of \u00a7 22a-250 (c), we are not convinced that the trial court rendered its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>on this basis alone, and, consequently, conclude that the court did not err in rendering judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Section 22a-250 (c) prohibits unauthorized \u201cdumping\u201d of certain materials. As the court correctly concluded, before one can \u201cdump,\u201d one must first \u201cdiscard\u201d either a specified amount of \u201clitter,\u201d or certain other specified items. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-248 (12).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The meaning of the term \u201cdiscard,\u201d which is left undefined by the relevant statutory provisions, brings to the fore two principles of statutory construction. First, \u201cin the absence of ambiguity, courts cannot read into statutes, by construction, provisions which are not clearly stated\u201d; <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104, 110, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984); and second, when left undefined by the legislature, \u201c[t]he words of a statute are to be given their commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 25, 28, 535 A.2d 1311 (1988); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Regarding the first of these canons of construction, we agree with the commissioner, that \u00a7 22a-250 (c) does not require that she shoulder any burden of proof on the issue of whether the alleged violator specifically intended to abandon the waste permanently at the time it was illegally \u201cdumped.\u201d That does not, however, end our inquiry since the commissioner is required, by \u00a7 22a-248 (12), to present sufficient evidence from which the trier can conclude that the material \u201cdumped\u201d was also \u201cdiscarded.\u201d Since the word \u201cdiscard\u201d is not defined within the relevant statutory scheme, we must ascertain what the commonly approved meaning of that term is. In the context of illegal dumping, the most common usage that comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>to mind is \u201cthrow away.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (New College Ed.); <em>see American Mining Congress </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Agency, </em>824 F.2d 1177, 1184 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1987). To say that \u201cdiscard\u201d means to \u201cthrow away\u201d only further complicates the inquiry, since regardless of the term utilized, the intent of the alleged violator will always be relevant to the final determination of whether waste has been \u201cdiscarded.\u201d Concluding that intent is relevant is not, however, the same as requiring proof of specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In this respect, the question of whether waste has been \u201cdiscarded\u201d is similar to the factors that will be considered when it has been claimed that property has been abandoned. Although, before legal abandonment can be found, there must be proof of an intent to abandon; <em>Glotzer </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>125 Conn. 227, 233, 5 A.2d 1 (1939); that requirement can be met without resort to proof of specific intent. \u201cMost frequently, where abandonment has been held established, there has been found present some affirmative act indicative of an intention to abandon . . . but nonuser, as of an easement, or other negative or passive conduct may be sufficient to signify the requisite intention and justify a conclusion of abandonment.

Thus, rather than being obligated to prove that the defendants' \u201cdumping\u201d coincided with a specific intent to abandon what was \u201cdumped,\u201d proof of \u201cdiscarding\u201d is sufficient when the totality of the evidence reveals that the alleged violator has \u201cabandoned\u201d or \u201cthrown away\u201d or \u201cdiscarded\u201d the material in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tion for an indefinite period of time. We conclude that this inquiry does not require any in depth probing of the thought process of the alleged violator at the time of the \u201cdumping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court properly resolved this issue in favor of the defendants. While the commissioner relies entirely upon the court\u2019s finding that she had failed to establish \u201cthat the defendants intended to keep the debris at Singer Avenue permanently,\u201d the court also concluded \u201cthat when the material was deposited at Singer Avenue, it was done only on a temporary basis, and that the final act of discarding it did not take place until it was removed elsewhere.\u201d Thus, even if the court erred by placing upon the commissioner a requirement that she prove the specific intent of the defendants, there exists an alternate finding, utilizing the standard we have set forth above, that the defendants simply had not \u201cdiscarded\u201d demolition debris on the Singer Avenue property as required by \u00a7 22a-248 (12).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Finally, the commissioner asks this court to conclude, as a matter of law, that the defendants\u2019 actions at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Singer Avenue constituted \u201cdumping,\u201d and, therefore, violated \u00a7 22a-250 (c). On the basis of the evidence presented to the trial court, the commissioner now argues that \u201c[sjurely several thousand tons of demolition debris deposited on the Conrail Property and left there undisturbed for over one year when the trial was concluded have been \u2018dumped\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d \u00a7 22a-250 (c). While this might indeed be true in most cases, the simple answer to the commissioner\u2019s claim is that in this case the court concluded that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We have long held that \u201cwhere the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision.....\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). Our review of the court\u2019s memorandum, as well as the evidence presented, leads us to conclude that it did not err in ruling that the demolition debris placed on the Singer Avenue property was not \u201cdiscarded\u201d and, therefore, not \u201cdumped.\u201d In light of our conclusion that \u201cdiscarding,\u201d in relation to \u00a7 22a-250 (c), is to be determined on the basis of the totality of the circumstances presented, the size of the pile and the time it remains unmoved, while relevant, are not conclusive of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">With respect to the defendants\u2019 appeals in the first and third cases, the judgments are affirmed.

The trial court\u2019s conclusion is adequately supported by the evidence and quite clear: \u201cOn the factual issue presented in this case it is concluded that, when the material was deposited at Singer Avenue, it was done on a temporary basis, and that the final act of discarding it did not take place until it was removed elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Peters, C.

With respect to part III, I respectfully concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Since a remand for articulation has been ordered on other grounds, I would have preferred to ask the trial court to articulate as well the manner in which the commissioner failed to meet her burden of proof on the fifth cause of action. The trial court concededly should not have imposed on the commissioner the burden of proving the defendants\u2019 specific intent to violate General Statutes \u00a7 22a-250 by \u201cdumping\u201d demolition debris on the Conrail property and the property leased by the defendants. It is unclear to me that the trial court concluded, or could have concluded, that the defendants had not \u201cdiscarded\u201d the material in question for an indefinite period of time. Even though the constituent elements of the mountain of dumped material may have changed over time, the total accumulation of demolition material continued throughout to be \u201ctremendous,\u201d \u201cunsightly\u201d and a substantial danger to the environment. As a general matter, I am unpersuaded that the applicability of the \u201cdumping\u201d statute should turn on an atomistic a view of what has transpired here.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">I nonetheless concur in the judgment because the trial court\u2019s decision may well have reflected an understandable reluctance to impose yet another sanction on the same conduct that had already been heavily sanctioned in the first and third cases. Although there are technical distinctions between the statutory bases for the various cases, the court might reasonably have concluded that enough is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
