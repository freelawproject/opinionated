Dubreuil and Sons, Inc., a general contractor, and the defendant, the town of Lisbon, entered into a contract for certain additions and alterations to be made by the plaintiff to the town-owned Lisbon Central School in Lisbon. The plaintiff, claiming that it was entitled to compensation for extra work performed on the project, filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) on November 7, 1988. The defendant thereafter informed the AAA that the contract did not require the parties to arbitrate the plaintiffs claim and that it did not agree to arbitration. As a result, the AAA notified the parties by letter dated December 16,1988, that it \u201cwould hold this file in abeyance until such time as a court orders arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">In response to the AAA\u2019s letter of December 16, 1988, the plaintiff, by complaint dated January 7,1989, instituted an action in the Superior Court requesting an order compelling the defendant to arbitrate their differences in compliance with what it contended was their agreement requiring arbitration on the demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>of either party. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a \u201cMotion for Arbitration\u201d that was heard on the short calendar and denied by the trial court. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-410 (c). Later, a motion to reconsider and reargue the same motion was also denied. From those decisions of the trial court denying its application for an order to compel arbitration, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to ourselves, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The agreement between the parties, as it concerns arbitration, is embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 7.9.1, 7.9.2 and 7.9.3 of the standard American Institute of Architects\u2019 (AIA) printed contract document A201. The relevant portion of \u00a7 7.9.1 in its original form in the standard printed contract provided: \u201cAll claims, disputes and other matters in question between the Contractor and the Owner arising out of, or relating to the Contract Documents or the breach thereof . . . <em>shall </em>be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Section 7.9.1 of the standard printed contract form, however, was amended by the parties, apparently at the instigation of the defendant, by a typewritten addendum to the printed contract to read in pertinent part: \u201cAll claims, disputes and other matters in question between the Contractor and the Owner arising out of, or relating to, the Contract Documents or the breach thereof . . . <em>may </em>be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>After the plaintiffs appeal was transferred to this court, the trial court, in response to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for articulation, filed a written memorandum of decision articulating its reason for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for an order to compel arbitration. In its memorandum the trial court declared: \u201cIf one party could unilaterally compel the other party to resolve any disputes by arbitration, as the plaintiff contends, then the change in section 7.9.1 of the terms from \u2018shall\u2019 to \u2018may\u2019 would be meaningless.\u201d The trial court could reasonably have reached such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\u201cArbitration is a creature of contract.\u201d <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>183 Conn. 481, 488, 439 A.2d 416 (1981); <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>532 F.2d 861, 865 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 290, 377 A.2d 323 (1977). It is designed to avoid litigation and secure prompt settlement of disputes and is favored by the law. <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>supra; <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>174 Conn. 472, 480, 391 A.2d 137 (1978); <em>Board of Education v. Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>supra. \u201c \u2018But a person can be compelled to arbitrate a dispute only if, to the extent that, and in the manner which, he has agreed so to do. <em>Visselli v. American Fidelity Co., </em>155 Conn. 622, 624, 237 A.2d 561 [1967]; <em>Frager v. Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 274, 231 A.2d 531 [1967] . . . .\u2019 <em>Marsala v.

No one can be forced to arbitrate a contract dispute who has not previously agreed to do so. <em>Ginsberg v. Coating Products, Inc., </em>152 Conn. 592, 596, 210 A.2d 667 (1965). The issue of whether the parties to a contract have agreed to arbitration is controlled by their intention. <em>Hatcho Corporation v. Della Pietra, </em>195 Conn. 18, 20, 485 A.2d 1285 (1985); <em>First Hartford Realty Corpora</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>tion </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>181 Conn. 25, 33, 434 A.2d 314 (1980); <em>Lar-Rob Bus Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>170 Conn. 397, 402-403, 365 A.2d 1086 (1976). The intention of the parties is, in turn, a question of fact. <em>Ginsu Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., </em>786 F.2d 260, 262-63 (7th Cir. 1986); <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 123, 130, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987); <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 199, 520 A.2d 208 (1987); <em>Bead Chain Mfg.

Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 178, 474 A.2d 795 (1984); <em>First Hartford Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra; see <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>3 Conn. App. 423, 427, 488 A.2d 1290 (1985). The trial court\u2019s finding on that issue is not reversible by this court unless it was a finding that the court could not reasonably have made. <em>First Hartford Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra; <em>Heyman </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 215, 227-28, 423 A.2d 887 (1979); <em>Lar-Rob Bus Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra. The plaintiff can prevail on appeal, therefore, only if it is able to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the amended contract was clearly erroneous. <em>Ginsu Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., </em>supra; Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Cormier, </em>189 Conn. 371, 373, 456 A.2d 277 (1983); <em>Kakalik </em>v. <em>Bernardo, </em>184 Conn. 386, 393, 439 A.2d 1016 (1981); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>Albrecht, </em>19 Conn.

Ed. 1050 (1880)]; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whittlesey, </em>3 Conn. 560 [1821]; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>22 Conn. 379, 385 [1853].\u201d <em>Massaro </em>v. <em>Savoy Estates Realty Co., </em>110 Conn. 452, 458, 148 A. 342 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The trial court was confronted by a printed form contract containing arbitration provisions that originally included a provision that required that disputes arising under the contract \u201cshall be settled by arbitration.\u201d The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d denotes that the directive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>in the contract to arbitrate was mandatory. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>887 F.2d 705, 710 (6th Cir. 1989); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 572, 512 A.2d 893 (1986); <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>178 Conn. 381, 383, 423 A.2d 108 (1979); <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>163 Conn. 68, 74, 301 A.2d 258 (1972); <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>192 Ga. App. 329, 330, 384 S.E.2d 914 (1989); <em>Trumka </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>376 S.E.2d 178, 181 (W. Va. 1988). The deliberate substitution of \u201cmay\u201d for \u201cshall\u201d in the arbitration provision of the contract, on the other hand, is an indication that the parties expressly intended something other than mandatory arbitration. The word \u201cmay,\u201d unless the context in which it is employed requires otherwise, is not normally used as a word of command. <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Trinity Ambulance Service, </em>9 Conn. App. 386, 390, 519 A.2d 90 (1986), cert. dismissed, 202 Conn. 806, 520 A.2d 1287 (1987); <em>Trumka </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>supra; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.) The term \u201cmay\u201d generally imports permissive conduct and the use of discretion. <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 Conn. 337, 345, 441 A.2d 604 (1982); <em>Ridgeway </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>180 Conn. 533, 540, 429 A.2d 801 (1980); <em>Wye Community Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>26 Ark. App. 247, 254, 764 S.W.2d 55 (1989); <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 916; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Because the command word \u201cshall\u201d was deliberately removed from the contract by the parties and replaced by the word \u201cmay,\u201d it was not unreasonable for the trial court to have determined that the parties intended to modify their contract to provide for consensual rather than mandatory arbitration. See <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 429, 226 A.2d 380 (1967); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Phoenix State Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>138 Conn. 12, 16, 81 A.2d 444 (1951). We certainly cannot say that it was clearly erroneous for the court to have attributed such a meaning to the amended arbitration provision. See <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Cormier, </em>supra, 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Further, \u201c[wjhere there is a printed form of contract, and other words are inserted [in the printed form], in writing or otherwise, it is to be assumed that they take precedence over the printed matter.\u201d <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>15 Utah 2d 422, 425, 394 P.2d 77 (1964); <em>Quinlan </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>189 Ga. App. 8, 9, 374 S.E.2d 823 (1988); <em>Cale Development Co. </em>v. <em>Appeals Board, </em>94 App. Div. 2d 229, 234, 463 N.Y.S.2d 814 (1983), aff\u2019d, 61 N.Y.2d 976, 463 N.E.2d 619, 475 N.Y.S.2d 278 (1984); <em>Farmers Elevator &amp; Mercantile Co. </em>v. <em>Farm Builders, Inc., </em>432 N.W.2d 864, 868 (N.D. 1988); <em>Thiel Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Western Fire Ins. Co., </em>289 N.W.2d 786, 788 (N.D. 1980); <em>Scogin v. Camp, </em>556 S.W.2d 850, 852 (Tex. Civ. App. 1977); 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7 271, pp. 679-80. In this instance, therefore, the replacement in the form contract of the words, \u201cshall be decided by arbitration,\u201d by the typed words, \u201cmay be decided by arbitration,\u201d denoting consensual arbitration, could reasonably have been construed by the trial court to have been inconsistent with and to have superseded any residual wording of the printed form contract that might be compatible with binding arbitration. Otherwise, as the trial court stated, \u201cthe change in section 7.9.1 of the terms from \u2018shall\u2019 to \u2018may\u2019 would be meaningless.\u201d <em>See Bartlett &amp; Co., Grain v. Merchants Co., </em>323 F.2d 501, 506 (5th Cir. 1963); <em>Goodchild &amp; Partners, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Ready Tool Co., </em>100 Conn. 378, 381, 124 A. 38 (1924); <em>Allegheny Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>176 So. 2d 362, 365 (Fla. App. 1965); <em>S. &amp; D. Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Tamsett, </em>144 App. Div. 2d 849, 850, 534 N.Y.S.2d 800 (1988); <em>Farmers Elevator &amp; Mercantile Co. </em>v. <em>Farm Builders, Inc., </em>supra; see 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7 271, p. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that even though the wording of the contract\u2019s arbitration provision was changed to read \u201cmay\u201d arbitrate, rather than \u201cshall\u201d arbitrate, there remains other wording in the printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>portion of the contract in \u00a7\u00a7 7.9.1, 7.9.2 and 7.9.3 indicative of mandatory arbitration. The plaintiff claims that the remaining language in the printed form creates an ambiguity that should be construed against the defendant, who authored the change in the contract. See, e.g., <em>Ravitch </em>v. <em>Stollman Poultry Farms, Inc., </em>165 Conn. 135, 145-46, 328 A.2d 711 (1973). To the extent that such an ambiguity exists, \u201cthe rule should be applied which says typed matter controls the printed instead of the rule which says that a contract will be construed against the author. <em>Universal C.I.T. Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>150 Tex. 513, 243 S.W.2d 154 (1951); <em>Leslie Lowry &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>KTRM, Inc., </em>[239 S.W.2d 898, 900 (Tex. Civ. App. 1951)]; 17A C.J.S.

None of those cases, however, is analogous to the present case because they do not implicate the specific factual situation encompassed herein, i.e., a modification from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cmay\u201d of the contract provision concerning arbitration. Absent the express change, the result in this instance might very well have been different.
