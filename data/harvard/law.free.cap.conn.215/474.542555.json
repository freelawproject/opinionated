J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzP\">This administrative appeal principally challenges the statutory and constitutional propriety of the procedures underlying the decision of the defendant Connecticut Siting Council (Council) to grant a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to the defendant Exeter Energy Limited Partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(Exeter).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court, after a hearing, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> substantive, procedural, constitutional and evidentiary challenges to the Council\u2019s decision and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The plaintiffs filed a further appeal to the Appellate Court, which we transferred to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The essential facts are undisputed. Exeter proposes to build a plant that will burn waste tires in order to generate electricity and a number of other marketable byproducts. The department of public utility control has approved a twenty-five year contract for the sale of the electricity to Connecticut Light and Power Company. In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-50k and 16-50p, Exeter applied to the Council for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to affirm the propriety of the proposed location of Exeter\u2019s plant in Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Exeter applied for certification on July 31,1987, and gave public notice of its application in the Norwich Bulletin on July 30 and 31, 1987. The Norwich Bulletin is a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality of Sterling, where the facility is proposed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>located. Exeter served a copy of its application on each person, agency, commission, and municipal body specified in General Statutes \u00a7 16-50\u00cd (b). The Norwich Bulletin published notices on September 15 and 30, 1987, that the Council had scheduled a public hearing on Exeter\u2019s application for November 18,1987. The Council provided mailed notice of the public hearing to those listed in \u00a7 <em>16-501. </em>Public hearings were held in Sterling on November 18 and 19, 1987. Additional notices of subsequent public hearings, held on December 23, 1987, and February 9,1988, were published in the Norwich Bulletin on December 2, 1987, and in the Providence Journal on December 7, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The location of Exeter\u2019s proposed facility in Sterling is approximately two miles from the Rhode Island border, and about five miles from the Scituate Reservoir watershed, which provides water for 65 percent of the population of Rhode Island. A number of Rhode Island residents, including some of the present plaintiffs, were allowed to intervene and ultimately were accorded party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Although some of the plaintiffs requested additional time to prepare and to be heard, the Council denied all requests for further hearings beyond February 9, 1988, and refused to defer its announced schedule for its decision on the application. The Council\u2019s denial of further continuances was premised in part on its statutory obligation to rule on Exeter\u2019s application by May, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The Council issued Exeter the certificate that it sought on May 6, 1988. The Council made extensive findings of fact to support its conclusions that there was a public need for the electricity that would be produced by the facility and that the site proposed for the facility would not have a significant deleterious effect on the health and safety of Connecticut and Rhode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Island residents. In summarizing its environmental findings, the Council stated that \u201cthe effects associated with the construction and operation of the facility, including effects on the natural environment; ecological balance; public health and safety; scenic; historic and recreation values; forests and parks; air and water purity; and fish and wildlife are not significant either alone or cumulatively with other effects, are not in conflict with the policies of the state concerning such effects, and not sufficient reason to deny the application, and therefore, the Council will issue a Certificate for the Exeter waste tires to energy facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal to the Superior Court mounted a broad gauged attack on the Council\u2019s decision in favor of Exeter. The trial court, despite expressed reservations about whether some of the plaintiffs had demonstrated the prerequisite aggrievement to pursue an administrative appeal, considered all of the issues on their merits and ruled in favor of the defendants. It concluded that the voluminous record of the proceedings before the Council contained substantial evidence to support the Council\u2019s detailed findings and opinion. It rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory and constitutional contentions about the adequacy of the notices published with regard to Exeter\u2019s application. Finally, it determined that the Council had not substantially impaired or prejudiced the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to cross-examine adverse witnesses or challenge expert findings. The trial court accordingly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In their present appeal, the plaintiffs have pursued four issues. In addition to their disagreement with the trial court\u2019s reservations about the aggrievement of some of the plaintiffs, they maintain that the trial court should have found that the proceedings before the Council were fatally flawed in three respects: (1) noncompliance with the statutory notice of hearing require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ments prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-501,16-50m and 4-177; (2) violation of their constitutional rights to procedural due process because of inadequate notice, denial of continuances, and impaired opportunity to participate in the hearing process; and (3) improper reliance by the Council on expert findings not subjected to challenge by cross-examination. We decline to address the issue of aggrievement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and conclude, on the merits of the three remaining issues, that the judgment of the trial court should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In their claim of statutory impropriety, the plaintiffs maintain that the notice published by the defendants failed to comply with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-501, 16-50m, and 4-177<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>deprived the Council of jurisdiction to consider Exeter\u2019s certificate application. The plaintiffs do not contest the timeliness or the sufficiency of the content of the notice published in the Norwich Bulletin. They contend, however, that Sterling\u2019s proximity to Rhode Island required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the defendants to publish notice in that state as well. Because the Council held two days of hearings before notice was published in the state of Rhode Island, the plaintiffs assert that the Council\u2019s proceedings were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The trial court addressed this issue in its decision on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for articulation, wherein it stated: \u201cThe defendants did publish notice in the state of Rhode Island on December 3,1987. They were not required to do so. [T]he defendants complied with the notice requirements of the statutes cited by the plaintiff.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument for publication of notice in Rhode Island finds no support in the express language of the relevant provisions of the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-50g through 16-50z. Of the sections to which the plaintiffs allude, only \u00a7 16-50\u00cd specifically addresses the issue of who is entitled to public notice of proceedings concerning a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need. That section does not avail the plaintiffs, because it provides, in subsection (b), that an applicant has a duty to give notice to members of the general public in \u201c[e]ach municipality in which any portion of such facility is to be located, both as primarily proposed and in the alternative locations listed [in the application].\u201d See also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 16-50M (e). The Rhode Island plaintiffs are not entitled to public notice under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The other provision on which the plaintiffs principally rely is \u00a7 16-50m (c), which requires the Council itself to give public notice of the date and location of its hearings by \u201cgeneral notice to the public.\u201d See also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 16-50j-21. By reasonable implication, the object of the Council\u2019s notice must be the same as that of the applicant\u2019s notice, since \u00a7 16-50m (c), in the preceding sentence, incorporates \u00a7 16-50Z by reference. \u201cIt is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 Conn. 396, 401-402, 288 A.2d 435 (1971). We are obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>gated, furthermore, to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter. <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>214 Conn. 181, 187, 571 A.2d 89 (1990); <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 304-305, 559 A.2d 179 (1989). Read together, \u00a7\u00a7 16-50m (c) and 16-50Z (b) manifest the legislature\u2019s intention that the Council, like certificate applicants, is only required to give public notice to the members of the general public who live in the municipality where the proposed plant is to be built and operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Nothing in the general \u201creasonable notice\u201d requirement contained in the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 4-177, displaces the specific instructions for public notice contained in \u00a7\u00a7 16-50\u00cd and 16-50m. Textually, \u00a7 4-177 speaks of notice to \u201cparties\u201d; the plaintiffs have not asserted any deficiencies in the notices that they received once they became parties. More broadly, any potential conflict between the general provisions of \u00a7 4-177 and the specific provisions of the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act would have to be resolved in favor of the latter. <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra. The relevant \u201cmunicipality\u201d for public notice in this case was Sterling, not Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In addition to their statutory argument, the plaintiffs contend that the Council violated their constitutional rights to procedural due process. They maintain that they were deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard because the defendants: (1) provided constitutionally inadequate notice; (2) denied their requests for continuances; and (3) impaired their ability to participate fully in the administrative proceedings. The trial court considered and rejected each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>We assume, arguendo,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the plaintiffs had some procedural due process rights with regard to the administrative proceedings to consider Exeter\u2019s application for a certificate of environmental capacity and public need. The question that remains is the extent of the plaintiffs' due process rights. \u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972); <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 324-25, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The notice that the plaintiffs received in this case in fact enabled them to appear at, and to participate in, the hearings held by the Council. Their legitimate interest in contesting the environmental consequences of Exeter\u2019s application does not have the same individual impact as the interest of a person at risk of losing a professional license; <em>Lieb </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 411 A.2d 42 (1979); a long standing teacher facing dismissal; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Berlin Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 355 A.2d 265 (1974); or a utility company contesting utility rate adjustments. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>176 Conn. 191, 405 A.2d 638 (1978). At best, these plaintiffs can claim to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>a due process right, as members of the general public, to notice by publication. \u201cThe purpose of notice by publication to the general public is to \u2018 \u201cadvise all affected parties of their opportunity to be heard and to be apprised of the relief sought.\u201d \u2019 <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>168 Conn. 8, 14, 357 A.2d 488 (1975), quoting <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>[144 Conn. 690, 693, 137 A.2d 542 (1957)]. That purpose was fulfilled in this case.\u201d <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>20 Conn. App. 474, 481, 568 A.2d 799 (1990); see also <em>Eagan </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>20 Conn. App. 561, 566, 568 A.2d 811 (1990). The plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights to notice were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The plaintiffs are no more persuasive in their claim that they had a constitutional right to the continuances they requested from the Council. The trial court found that \u201c[u]nder CGS section 16-50p, the Council had ten months from the date of the application to issue its opinion.\u201d The plaintiffs have not challenged the validity of this holding, nor have they alleged that the Council acted in bad faith in insisting that it was required to conclude its public proceedings at some reasonable time before May 1, 1988, in order to meet this statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Requests for continuances invoke the discretionary authority of the adjudicating tribunal. \u201c[Q]n review every reasonable presumption in favor of the [tribunal\u2019s] ruling will be made. . . . The [tribunal\u2019s] decision will be reversed only if it represents a gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haye, </em>214 Conn. 476, 483, 572 A.2d 974 (1990), and cases therein cited. In deciding whether the denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process, we have not resorted to mechanical tests but have instead examined closely the particular facts of each individual case. Id. In the present circumstances, it was not unconstitutional for the Council, in good faith, to balance its statutory time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>constraints against the plaintiffs\u2019 desire for more time to present their objections to Exeter\u2019s proposal. The trial court found that \u201c[t]he Council scheduled additional public hearings and accepted submissions from the plaintiffs after the public hearings had ended.\u201d In light of these additional opportunities for the plaintiffs to voice their concerns, we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate an unconstitutional abuse of discretion in this case. See <em>Ridgeway </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>180 Conn. 533, 538, 429 A.2d 801 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We are equally unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 umbrella argument that they were unconstitutionally deprived of an opportunity to participate in the Council\u2019s \u201cthoughtful and meaningful consideration of environmental factors.\u201d <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 68, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). In addition to renewing their complaint of inadequate notice and denial of continuances, the plaintiffs focus on the Council\u2019s decision, at the February 9,1988 hearing, that the plaintiffs would be limited to presenting new information and would be precluded from questioning Exeter on information presented on or prior to the December 23, 1987 hearing. Many of the plaintiffs had, however, the opportunity, which they exercised, to scrutinize and criticize this information earlier. In addition, the trial court found, in its review of the transcript, that the plaintiffs had not in fact been prevented from asking any questions or making any submissions. Constitutional principles permit an administrative agency to organize its hearing schedule so as to balance its interest in reasonable, orderly and non-repetitive proceedings against the risk of erroneous deprivation of a private interest. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>supra, 335, 348-49; <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 364-65, 542 A.2d 672 (1988); <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 235, 506 A.2d 139, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 802, 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>S. Ct. 42, 93 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1986). The present record discloses no violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 procedural rights to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The plaintiffs contend, finally, that the Council violated the requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (3) in the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act that \u201ca party may conduct cross-examinations required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\u201d See also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 16-50j-28.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tain that they were deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the authors of Exeter\u2019s Exhibit 36, which was submitted to the Council after the close of evidence, and upon which the Council relied in its finding No. 135 that \u201c[t]he water quality of the Scituate and Providence Water Supply Board watersheds would not be adversely impacted by the proposed facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The trial court\u2019s findings put this claim into context. The court stated: \u201cPlaintiff Providence Water Supply Board offered a technical report which had not been filed early enough to be entered into evidence. A procedure was devised by the Council to accept the report, giving all parties the opportunity to file technical comments on the contents of the report. No party objected. Plaintiff Providence Water Board was granted an additional week to file a rebuttal. While possibly unwise, this procedure was in no way unfair to the plaintiffs. . . . Plaintiffs have not met their burden on their [claim] that they were prejudiced . . . .\u2019\u2019The plaintiffs have not challenged the accuracy of the court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a statutory violation cannot survive the finding that Exhibit 36 was proffered and received as commentary on the plaintiffs\u2019 own belated report. As the trial court aptly noted, we have held that \u201can expert regulatory agency may treat the testimony of expert witnesses as to which conclusions they would draw from facts or record as mere argument, which, if reasonable, may help the agency arrive at its decision . . . but which the agency may disregard if contrary to its knowledge or experience.\u201d <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Authority, </em>183 Conn. 128, 142-43, 439 A.2d 282 (1981). It was the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove that the Council in some way departed from its legal and proper charge of treating the exhibit as mere argument. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 537, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Lastly, even if we were to conclude that the record might be construed to show some marginal impairment of a right to cross-examine, the plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing prejudice. They have neither alleged nor proved that Exhibit 36 was the only record evidence to support the Council\u2019s finding that Exeter\u2019s proposed facility would have no significant environmental impact on the Rhode Island watersheds. The Council made voluminous detailed findings about the facility\u2019s likely effects on water and on the air. These findings consistently indicate that the facility, properly constructed in accordance with the Council\u2019s guidelines, would have no significant adverse environmental impact. The Council specifically found, furthermore, in reliance on an exhibit other than Exhibit 36, that: \u201cThe proposed facility would have no significant impact on the environment or water supply of Rhode Island over the 25-year operational term of the facility.\u201d The plaintiffs have therefore failed to establish any ground for overturning the decision reached by the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> Other defendants who filed answers in the Superior Court are Town of Sterling, Town of Plainfield, Joseph D. Tavema and Kenneth Rahn. The remaining defendants, Northeast Utilities, Connecticut Light and Power Company, Philip M. Small, Robert P. Jordan, Dennis Duprey, Foster Country Club and James Curry, were defaulted at trial, either for failure to file an appearance or to file an answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> The plaintiffs are Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc., Paul Cady, Curt Nelson, President, the Thames Valley Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Rhode Island State Representative Bradford Gorham, Rhode Island State Senator Leo Blais, Mike Benoit, Brett Stein, Gerald Kupperberg, M.D., Ralph B.

All the plaintiffs, with the exceptions of Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc., Cady and Nelson, are Rhode Island residents or agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"> Several plaintiffs had the necessary statutory aggrievement to raise, on the merits, all the issues that are presently before us. The trial court held that \u201ca number of plaintiffs, including the Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc. and the Providence Water Supply Board, filed verified pleadings with the Council\u201d that entitled them, as intervenors, to raise the environmental issues before the court. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19; <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 250-51, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984). The defendants have not challenged that holding or the environmental nature of the issues that we must decide. We need not resolve in this instance, therefore, whether those plaintiffs who sought party status by sending written requests to the Council met the statutory definition of aggrievement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-50Z provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) Each application shall be accompanied by proof of service of a copy of such application on: (A) Each municipality in which any portion of such facility is to be located, both as primarily proposed and in the alternative locations listed ....

If the agency or other party is unable to state the matters in detail at the time the notice is served, the initial notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved.

We need not resolve today the extent to which the act would confer such property rights in the absence of a showing of any specific personal or legal interest in the subject matter of the proceedings at issue. At least one of the Rhode Island plaintiffs, the Providence Water Supply Board, was an intervenor at the administrative level and hence had statutory aggrievement sufficient to raise all relevant environmental issues under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19. Statutory aggrievement ordinarily encompasses standing to raise constitutional as well as statutory issues that have an environmental nexus. <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 249-50, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\"> The Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, \u00a7 16-50j-28 provides: \u201crules of evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u201cThe following rules of evidence shall be followed in contested cases:</p>\n<p id=\"AdP\">\u201c(a) rules of privilege. The council shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law in Connecticut. Subject to these requirements and subject to the right of any party to cross examine, any testimony may be received in written form.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u201c(b) documentary evidence. Documentary evidence may be received at the discretion of the council in the form of copies or excerpts, if the original is found not readily available. Upon request by any party or intervenor, an opportunity shall be granted to compare the copy with the original, which shall be subject to production by the person offering such copies. Any documentary evidence that is admitted in the form of a copy or excerpt may be stricken at the discretion of the council upon the failure to produce the original thereof upon finding that the interest of any party or intervenor will be prejudiced substantially thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u201c(c) cross examination. Cross examination may be conducted if required for full and true disclosure of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u201c(d) FACTS NOTICED, council records. The council may take notice of judicially cognizable facts, including prior decisions and orders of the council. Any exhibit admitted as evidence by the council in a prior hearing of a contested case may be offered as evidence in a subsequent contested case and admitted as an exhibit therein; but the council shall not deem such exhibit to be judicially cognizable in whole or in part and shall not consider any facts set forth therein unless such exhibit is duly admitted as evidence in the contested case then being heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u201c(e) FACTS NOTICED, procedure. The council may take notice of generally recognized technical or scientific facts within the council\u2019s specialized knowledge. Parties and intervenors shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed by being notified before or during the hearing by an appropriate reference in preliminary reports or otherwise of the material noticed. This provision shall also apply to material noticed in any staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>memoranda or data that may be submitted to the council for its consideration in the determination of the contested case. The council shall nevertheless employ its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in evaluating the evidence presented at the hearing for the purpose of making its finding of facts and arriving at a decision in any contested case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
