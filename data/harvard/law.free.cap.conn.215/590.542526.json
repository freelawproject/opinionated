The plaintiff, Caldor, Inc., instituted the present action seeking a permanent injunction staying the effectiveness and enforcement of the regulation. The case was tried to the court and judgment was rendered for the defendants. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We subsequently transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reveals the following facts. The Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) prohibits \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). The legislature did not codify a comprehensive list of \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices,\u201d but rather articulated its intent that, in construing the scope of the statutory prohibition, \u201cthe [named defendant] and the courts . . . shall be guided by interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to Section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 (a) (1)) [prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u2018unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u2019], as from time to time amended.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b). The legislature delegated to the named defendant the authority to \u201cestablish by regulation acts, practices or methods which shall be deemed to be unfair or deceptive in violation of [CUTPA].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (c). The named defendant\u2019s authority is limited, however, by the statutory requirement that her regulations \u201cshall not be inconsistent with the rules, regulations and decisions of the federal trade commission and the federal courts in interpreting the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 42-110b (c), the named defendant promulgated \u00a7 42-110b-19 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, that provides in pertinent part: \u201cIt shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice to . . . (e) Advertise the availability of a manufacturer\u2019s rebate by displaying the net price of the advertised item in the advertisement, unless the amount of the manufacturer's rebate is provided to the consumer by the retailer at the time of purchase of the advertised item. A retailer will not be required to provide the purchaser of an advertised item with the amount of the manufacturer\u2019s rebate if the retailer advertises that a manufacturer\u2019s rebate is available without stating the net price of the item. For the purpose of this subsection, \u2018net price\u2019 means the ultimate price paid by a consumer after he redeems the manufacturer\u2019s rebate offered for the advertised item.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The plaintiff, a New York corporation engaged in the business of retail sales in Connecticut, instituted the present action, seeking a \u201cpermanent injunction staying the effectiveness of [Regulation \u00a7 42-110b-19 (e)] and its enforcement.\u201d At trial, the plaintiff argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the regulation is: (1) inconsistent with, and in excess of, the statutory authority granted to the named defendant; (2) in violation of substantive due process in that it is arbitrary and capricious; and (3) inconsistent with the protections that are afforded commercial speech pursuant to the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In addressing these claims, the trial court made the following findings of fact with respect to manufacturers\u2019 rebate programs. Such a program is a marketing technique that purports to return a portion of the purchase price to the consumer after purchase. The terms and conditions of a manufacturer\u2019s rebate, including the amount of the rebate, are determined by the manufacturer. While the terms and conditions vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and from product to product, three basic conditions are common to each manufacturer\u2019s rebate program. In order to obtain the rebate from the manufacturer, the consumer must deliver to a designated address: (1) a completed rebate certificate; (2) the original cash register receipt; and (3) a valid proof of purchase. The rebate certificate and the cash register receipt are obtained from the retailer and the valid proof of purchase is typically part of the package or container purchased by the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The language of the advertisement of a product for which a manufacturer\u2019s rebate is offered is determined by the retailer. An important marketing tool used by retailers is the prominent advertisement of a product\u2019s net price, i.e., the price of the product after subtracting the rebate allowance. Such net price advertising quickly \u201cgrabs\u201d the attention of the consumer. Advertisements by the plaintiff of products included in a manufacturer\u2019s rebate program display, in large type, the net price and, in small type, the regular price, the sale price and the amount of the manufacturer\u2019s rebate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The following is an example of the plaintiffs net price advertising:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">$1 after 50&lt;P mfr. rebate<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> reg. 2.99 sale 1.50</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">reg. 2.99 ea. sale 3/6.25 less 1.25 mfr. reb. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>3/$5</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The trial court noted that such advertising is factually untrue because the consumer necessarily incurs costs in obtaining the rebate from the manufacturer. At the very least, the consumer must incur the expense of mailing the required items to the address designated by the manufacturer. In the advertisement reproduced above, therefore, the consumer pays, at the time of purchase, $1.50 for the advertised product and then incurs the cost of obtaining the 50 cent rebate. The trial court determined that the net price advertising is likely to mislead a consumer into believing that the price of the product is $1, a belief likely to affect the consumer\u2019s purchase decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The trial court concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s net price advertising of a product included in a manufacturer\u2019s rebate program is \u201cdeceptive\u201d as a matter of law. Accordingly, the court held that: (1) in promulgating the regulation at issue, the named defendant acted within the authority granted her by General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (c); and (2) the advertising here at issue was not protected by the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this court raises three issues. First, the plaintiff contends that because its net price advertising of products included in a manufacturer\u2019s rebate program is not \u201cdeceptive\u201d as a matter of law, the trial court improperly sustained the regulation. Second, the plaintiff claims that the trial court mistakenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>determined that such net price advertising is not subject to constitutional protection. Finally, the plaintiff maintains that the trial court improperly refused to admit at trial certain evidence relevant to a determination of the statutory and constitutional validity of the regulation. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We turn first to the plaintiffs claim that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the statutory authority granted to the named defendant and, therefore, was improperly sustained by the trial court. The trial court determined that the plaintiffs net price advertising was \u201cdeceptive\u201d as a matter of law. This finding served as the basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that, in promulgating the regulation, the named defendant acted within the authority granted her by \u00a7 42-110b (c). The plaintiff claims that a proper application of the standards set forth by the federal trade commission compels a finding that its advertising is not \u201cdeceptive.\u201d Accordingly, argues the plaintiff, the regulation of its advertisements pursuant to \u00a7 42-110b is invalid. We conclude that the trial court properly sustained the regulation; we rely on different grounds than did the trial court, however, in reaching this conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Initially, we note that the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s advertising is not the focus of our inquiry, nor should it have been in the trial court. At issue in this appeal is the validity of the regulation promulgated by the named defendant. \u201c \u2018Judicial review of the [named defendant\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>istrative Procedure Act (General Statutes, c. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, [707-708,] 372 A.2d 110 (1976) [cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977)]. Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the [named] defendant.\u2019 <em>C &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>176 Conn. 11, 12, 404 A.2d 864 (1978); <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975); see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 [j].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2018The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [named defendant] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of [her] discretion.\u2019 <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 322, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 441, 423 A.2d 87 (1979); see also <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983).\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 773, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988); see also <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986). It is with an awareness of these limitations that we review the challenged regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Since the early 1980s the state department of consumer protection has received consumer complaints about manufacturers\u2019 rebate programs. In response to these complaints, the named defendant conducted an investigation of these rebate programs. The trial court\u2019s findings, discussed supra, detailed the relevant findings made during this investigation. The ultimate conclusion reached by the named defendant and affirmed by the trial court was that net price advertising of a product for which a manufacturer\u2019s rebate is offered misleads the consumer about the price the consumer will pay for that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The federal courts have determined that an act or practice is deceptive<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if three requirements are met. \u201cFirst, there must be a representation, omission, or other practice likely to mislead consumers. Second, the consumers must interpret the message reasonably under the circumstances. Third, the misleading representation, omission, or practice must be material\u2014that is, likely to affect consumer decisions or conduct.\u201d <em>Figgie International, Inc., </em>107 F.T.C. 313, 374 (1986). Given the findings concerning the inherently misleading nature of net price advertising where a manufacturer\u2019s rebate is involved, the named defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 42-110b (c), established by regulation that such advertising is in violation of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We conclude that in light of the evidence the regulation is consistent with the general statutory scheme that it is designed to implement. The limitations imposed on the named defendant\u2019s authority by the express language of \u00a7 42-110b do not require a contrary conclusion. First, in accordance with the mandate of \u00a7 42-110b (c), the regulation is not \u201cinconsistent with the rules, regulations and decisions of the federal trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>commission and the federal courts in interpreting the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\u201d Although the federal authorities have not established the net price advertising here at issue to be \u201cunfair or deceptive,\u201d they have also not adopted rules, regulations or decisions with which the challenged regulation is inconsistent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, although \u00a7 42-110b (b) provides that courts and the named defendant shall be <em>guided by </em>the federal interpretations given \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, they are not limited by such interpretations. \u201cAs originally enacted, [CUTPA] provided that state unfair or deceptive acts or practices were to be those <em>\u2018determined to be\u2019 </em>unfair or deceptive by the [Federal Trade Commission] or the federal courts. 1973 Pub. Acts 615, \u00a7 2 (a). However, the Act was amended in 1976 to provide only that courts in Connecticut [and the named defendant] were to be <em>\u2018guided by\u2019 </em>federal interpretations of \u00a7 5 of the [Federal Trade Commission Act]. The purpose of the change apparently was to permit . . . practices which had not yet been specifically declared unlawful by federal authorities to be nevertheless unlawful under CUTPA.\u201d (Emphasis <em>added.) Bailey Employment System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>545 F. Sup. 62, 71 (D. Conn. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Further support for the conclusion that the regulation is consistent with the named defendant\u2019s statutory authority derives from the fact that the regulation has received approval from the standing legislative regulation review committee as required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-170. Section \u00a7 4-170 provides in part that \u201c[n]o adoption, amendment or repeal of any regulation . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>shall be effective until the original of the proposed regulation approved by the attorney general, as provided in section 4-169 . . . [has] been submitted to the standing legislative regulation review committee .... The committee shall review all proposed regulations and, in its discretion . . . may approve [or] disapprove . . . any such regulation.\u201d \u201c[Legislative ratification of a proposed regulation supports the position that the regulation is consistent with the general statutory scheme that the regulation was designed to implement.\u201d <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 600, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); see also <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 129-30, 527 A.2d 672 (1987); <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 144, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The named defendant, therefore, acted within her statutory grant of authority in establishing net price advertising in the context of a manufacturer\u2019s rebate program as \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d in violation of CUTPA. That the named defendant did not eliminate the practice of net price advertising entirely, but rather chose to regulate the area more narrowly, does not render the regulation invalid. \u201cThe Commission is the expert body to determine what remedy is necessary to eliminate the unfair or deceptive trade practices which have been disclosed. It has wide latitude for judgment and the courts will not interfere except where the remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.\u201d <em>Jacob Siegel Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>327 U.S. 608, 612-13, 66 S. Ct. 758, 90 L. Ed. 888 (1946). The named defendant, relying on her expertise in the area, determined that an effective way to address the inherently misleading nature of net price advertising in the context of manufacturers\u2019 rebate programs is to require those retailers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>choose to use that type of advertising to make the rebate available at the time of purchase. We may not substitute our own judgment for that of the named defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">We conclude that, in promulgating \u00a7 42-110b-19 (e) of the regulations, the named defendant did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of her discretion. The trial court, therefore, properly determined that the adoption of the regulation was consistent with General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">We turn next to the plaintiffs claim that the regulation violates its right to free speech under the first amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Connecticut constitution. As both the plaintiff and the defendants concede, the net price advertising here at issue falls within the classification of \u201ccommercial speech.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has \u2018adopted a four-part test for determining the validity of government restrictions on commercial speech .... (1) The First Amendment protects commercial speech only if that speech concerns lawful activity and <em>is not misleading. </em>A restriction on otherwise protected commercial speech is valid only if it (2) seeks to implement a substantial governmental interest, (3) directly advances that interest, and (4) reaches no further than necessary to accomplish the given objective.\u2019 <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego, </em>[453 U.S. 490, 507, 101 S. Ct. 2882, 69 L. Ed. 2d 800 (1981)].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>212 Conn. 176, 182, 561 A.2d 1378, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1003, 110 S. Ct. 563, 107 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>We need not go beyond the first of these criteria. As we discussed previously, the named defendant\u2019s investigation yielded a finding that net price advertising of a product for which a manufacturer\u2019s rebate is offered is inherently misleading. As such, the plaintiff\u2019s advertising does not qualify for constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Finally, the plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit into evidence examples of other retailers\u2019 net price rebate advertising. In offering the evidence, the plaintiff stated that the evidence was relevant to the issue of \u201cdeception\u201d as set forth in its statutory challenge to the regulation and the issue of overbreadth as set forth in its constitutional challenge to the regulation. The court rejected the offer, stating that the form and substance of an advertisement of a competitor of the plaintiff was irrelevant to the controversy. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly focused only on the plaintiff\u2019s advertising. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">\u201cIt is beyond dispute that the trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevancy and materiality of evidence. <em>Hardisty </em>v. <em>Hardisty, </em>183 Conn. 253, 257, 439 A.2d 307 (1981).\u201d <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 355, 525 A.2d 57 (1987). The plaintiff first offered the examples of other retailers\u2019 advertising on the issue of \u201cdeception.\u201d As discussed previously, the question properly before the trial court was not whether a particular advertisement was deceptive as a matter of law, but rather, whether the named defendant\u2019s regulation was unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal, or in abuse of her discretion. The plaintiff also offered the evidence on its claim that the regulation was unconstitutionally overbroad. The United States Supreme Court has been reluctant, however, to apply the overbreadth analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>in the context of commercial speech. See <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 379-81, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, reh. denied, 434 U.S. 881, 98 S. Ct. 242, 54 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1977). We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in precluding at trial examples of other retailers\u2019 net price rebate advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Ct. 2875, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1983). Here, there was simply no evidence in the record at trial to show that the defendants had received any complaints suggesting that net price advertising was deceptive because the consumer expected to receive the advertised net price from the retailer at the point of purchase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Michael Krauss, the plaintiffs director of consumer and government relations, testified that over the course of eight years he did not receive a single complaint regarding a consumer\u2019s inability to receive the rebate amount in the store, or the net price. Krauss\u2019 testimony was corroborated by Kathleen Curry, consumer affairs bureau chief for the defendants. Complaints from consumers about rebate offers related exclusively to the process involved in obtaining the rebate, <em>not the advertising of the rebate itself </em>As a threshold matter, the evidence on the record is wholly insufficient to support the conclusion that there is a likelihood or a fair probability that a reasonable consumer would be misled or deceived by the net price advertising format at issue here. See <em>Figgie International, Inc., </em>107 F.T.C. 313, 373-74 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b) provides that the courts and the defendant shall be guided by the federal interpretations given \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Federal authorities have <em>not </em>established that the net price advertising here at issue is \u201cunfair or deceptive,\u201d and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the past has declined the named defendant\u2019s request that the FTC undertake a study, report or policy statement regarding rebates. The majority\u2019s statement, that \u201calthough \u00a7 42-110b (b) provides that courts and the named defendant shall be <em>guided by </em>the federal interpretations given \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, they are not limited by such interpretations\u201d (emphasis in original) is an inappropriate attempt to justify the conclusory, unsupported and therefore clearly erroneous determination of the trial court. <em>Season-All Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>R. J. Grosso, Inc., </em>213 Conn. 486, 498, 569 A.2d 32 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">This regulation unconstitutionally restricts the dissemination of what I perceive to be truthful commercial speech. \u201c \u2018Even though \u201ccommercial\u201d speech is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>involved, [this kind of restriction] strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. This is because it is a covert attempt by the State to manipulate the choices of its citizens, not by persuasion or direct regulation, but by depriving the public of the information needed to make a free choice. . . . [T]he State\u2019s policy choices are insulated from the visibility and scrutiny that direct regulation would entail and the conduct of citizens is molded by the information that [the] government chooses to give them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates </em>v. <em>Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, </em>478 U.S. 328, 351, 106 S. Ct. 2968, 92 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1986) (Brennan J., dissenting), quoting <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 557, 574-75, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980). \u201c[N]o differences between commercial and other kinds of speech justify protecting commercial speech less extensively where, as here, the government seeks to manipulate private behavior by depriving citizens of truthful information concerning lawful activities.\u201d <em>Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates </em>v. <em>Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
