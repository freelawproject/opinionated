Sugrue, </em>deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Mary M. Galvin, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Michael J.

He did not dispute the facts underlying the state\u2019s charges, but instead relied on a defense of mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">At trial, the defense sought to introduce testimony by the defendant\u2019s mother concerning genetic, family illnesses that he claimed were medically linked to his mental condition. The trial court excluded the testimony. On appeal, the Appellate Court set aside the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. Soltes, 20 Conn. App. 342, 566 A.2d 1374 (1989). Because the trial court\u2019s ruling appeared to have been based upon the order of testimony of the defense witnesses (the mother\u2019s testimony initially preceded the defense expert\u2019s testimony), we granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court err in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of the defendant\u2019s mother as to whether her \u2018other children suffer from any physical ailments, any medical problems\u2019 prior to any evidence that the defendant suffered from a genetic mental disorder?\u201d Upon further review of the transcript, however, we have concluded that the trial court also ruled to exclude the testimony on the independent ground that the mother was a nonexpert witness. It is to this basis for the exclusion that the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion is addressed. We are in agreement with the views expressed by the Appellate Court on that subject in its opinion, and it would serve no useful purpose to repeat that court\u2019s discussion here. Thus, we have concluded that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
