In a bifurcated hearing, the trial court found that the allegations in the petitions had been proven by clear and convincing evidence and that it was in the best interest of each child that the parental rights of the mother be terminated. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that the petition pertaining to each child alleged that the reasons for the termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights had existed for not less than one year, and that the mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated for three of the four grounds specified in \u00a7 17-43a (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> namely: (1) that each child had been abandoned by the mother; (2) that each child in a prior proceeding had been found to have been neglected or uncared for, and that the parent had failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>needs of each child, she could assume a responsible position in each child\u2019s life; and (3) that there was no <em>ongoing </em>parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The birth dates of the children named in the petitions are as follows: Barbara, October 14, 1980; Walter, January 1, 1983; and Margaret, November 21, 1984. The children were committed to DCYS on November 2, 1985, as uncared for and neglected, and the commitment was extended for an eighteen month period on October 22, 1987. The termination of parental rights petitions were filed on April 6,1988. On April 28,1988, counsel for the respondent mother appeared and denied the allegations in each petition. Hearings on the merits of the petitions were held on July 20, 27 and 28,1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearings, the petitioner presented the testimony of three DCYS treatment workers, Patricia Williamson, Annette Rizzolo and Theresa Polverari, to whom the cases of the children had been successively assigned prior to the filing of the termination petitions. The petitioner also presented the expert testimony of Ellis A. Perlswig, a child psychiatrist. Exhibits included a report containing a psychological evaluation of the family by Perlswig, and four letters written to DCYS by Barbara\u2019s foster mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Williamson was the treatment worker from the date of commitment until April, 1986. During that time, the respondent, who had a history of mental illness, began counseling, and a weekly schedule of visitation was established with Barbara at the DCYS office, and with Walter and Margaret at their foster home. In her visits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>with Barbara, the trial court found that on some occasions the respondent would promise to make a home for her, and on other occasions she would make critical comments about her appearance. These events caused such a disturbance in Barbara that her foster mother could not control her. The respondent did not visit Barbara in December, 1985, and when she resumed visitation with her in January, 1986, Barbara again evidenced control problems. As a result, DCYS requested and obtained a suspension of the respondent\u2019s visits with Barbara for three months beginning on February 14,1986. Barbara began counseling at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Rizzolo was the treatment worker from April, 1986, until August, 1987. She testified that, when she took over, visits with the children were arranged at the office of DCYS. The respondent\u2019s visits with Barbara were reinstated in June, 1986, once per month, and semimonthly with Walter and Margaret. The trial court found that, at these visits, the respondent paid little or no attention to the children. Instead, she spent most of the time talking to the treatment worker. In response to the suggestion of Barbara\u2019s therapist, the respondent\u2019s visitations with Barbara were suspended again in January, 1987, because of Barbara\u2019s disruptive behavior after the visits, which led to her admission to Highland Heights for day treatment. In April, 1987, Barbara\u2019s behavior deteriorated to the point where she was admitted to Highland Heights for in-patient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In August, 1987, the case was assigned to Polverari. She testified that the respondent\u2019s visits with Barbara continued once per month, and semi-monthly for Walter and Margaret. Polverari provided the respondent with transportation for visitations, although the respondent would not disclose her residence to Pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>verari. The trial court found that visitations continued reasonably well until November, 1987, when the respondent disappeared and refused to disclose her whereabouts to DCYS. She reappeared in February, 1988, and, thereafter, until the filing of the petitions, had several visits with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The trial court found that, from the date of the commitment to the time of trial, the respondent had lived in a variety of housing accommodations in New Haven. In July, 1985, she lived on Davenport Avenue. In November, 1985, she lived at a family shelter on Sylvan Avenue. Thereafter, she moved to Read Street. When she was evicted from there, she moved to Downing Street in the late spring of 1986. She lived at the YWCA shelter in the winter of 1986-87, and, in the summer of 1987, she moved to Hallock Avenue. The trial court found that, when .the petitions were filed, the respondent\u2019s whereabouts were unknown, and service on her was by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The trial court found further that, during the period between the commitment and the filing of the petitions, the respondent had attended several counseling sessions. She terminated counseling, however, and refused to continue after November, 1986. The trial court also found that, in the year prior to the filing of the petitions, the respondent had been employed at a pet store, and that she had maintained contact with the Hallock Avenue address. She did not, however, inform DCYS as to how she could be contacted, and visitations occurred only when she contacted DCYS.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The petitioner also presented the testimony of Perl-swig. The trial court admitted into evidence a report prepared by Perlswig, which contained a psychological evaluation of the respondent and the children. This report, dated February 2,1988, referred to interviews with the respondent and the children that had been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ducted by Perlswig from April 27, 1987, through June 24, 1987. The report also included an evaluation of Margaret by Linda C. Mayes, a pediatrician, that was conducted in June, 1987, and an evaluation of Walter by Fred Yolkmar, a physician, that was conducted in May, 1987. Perlswig stated in his report that he had also reviewed eight other reports on the family dating back to 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The trial court noted that Perlswig concluded that the respondent \u201csuffers from a severe mental disorder that seriously interferes with her capacity to care for, nurture, and protect the children. She has a diagnosis of schizophrenia which is expressed in fragmentation of her thinking, with delusional and paranoid ideation. Her illness prevents her from providing safe and appropriate care for her children. . . . [The respondent] is in need of psychiatric treatment and medication which she has refused.\u201d He described schizophrenia as a disruption of the thinking process, and opined that, at the time of commitment, it had been important for the respondent to be in treatment and take medication, but that now it was probably too late. He also noted that, in his interviews with the respondent and the children, the children did not recognize the respondent as their mother. The trial court found further that Perlswig was of the opinion that the chaotic environment in which the children had spent their early lives had retarded the development of their intellectual and motor skills to the extent of possibly permanent damage. In the opinion of Perlswig, the respondent was unable to parent children, and has never been able to provide the continuity and consistency of care that is required by young children.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">After the conclusion of the adjudicatory hearings, the trial court, on January 24,1989, filed a memorandum of decision wherein it found that the petitioner had, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>suant to \u00a7 17-43a (b), \u201cestablished each ground for termination by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d On May 2, 1989, the trial court filed a second memorandum of decision wherein, after making the six specific findings required by \u00a7 17-43a (d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it found that it was \u201cin the best interest of each of the children that the parental rights of the [respondent] be terminated.\u201d The trial court then rendered judgment terminating the parental rights of the respondent in and to Barbara J., Margaret J. and Walter J.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">On appeal, the respondent claims that the trial court erred: (1) in admitting letters from Barbara\u2019s foster mother as business records; (2) in admitting the report of Perlswig as a full exhibit without examining the portions that were based on hearsay evidence; (3) in finding abandonment without sufficient evidentiary support; (4) in not using the findings prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u00a7 17-43a (d) to establish a failure to rehabilitate; and (5) in finding no ongoing parent-child relationship without sufficient evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The respondent\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence letters from Barbara\u2019s foster mother to the DCYS treatment worker. We disagree. Specifically, at the hearings, the attorney for the children offered into evidence four letters sent to Barbara\u2019s DCYS treatment worker by her foster mother. The letters concerned, in part, the causal relationship between Barbara\u2019s disruptive behavior and visits with her mother. Counsel for the respondent objected to the proffered evidence, claiming that the letters were inadmissible hearsay and gratuitous communications from one who had no duty to report to DCYS. In an effort to overcome the objections by counsel for the respondent, the children\u2019s attorney made several foundational inquiries<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the DCYS treatment worker. On the basis of the worker\u2019s response to the inquiries, the court admitted the letters into evidence as business records. Notwithstanding the DCYS worker\u2019s responses to the preliminary inquiries, and the trial court\u2019s finding that the letters were business records, the respondent still argues that the foster mother had no duty to make any reports to DCYS about Barbara, and, therefore, the letters were not admissible as business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We have stated: \u201c \u2018To be admissible under the business record exception of General Statutes \u00a7 52-180,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cthe business record must be one based upon the entrant\u2019s own observations or upon information transmitted to him by an observer whose business duty it was to transmit it to him.\u201d <em>D\u2019Amato </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>140 Conn. 54, 59, 97 A.2d 893 (1953). Statements obtained from volunteers are not admissible though included in a business record because it is the duty to report in a business context which provides the reliability to justify this hearsay exception. Id. Information in a business record obtained from a person with no duty to report is admissible only if it falls within another hearsay exception. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 295, 334 A.2d 468 (1973).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 663-64, 491 A.2d 345 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 521, 539 A.2d 80 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The respondent recognizes in her brief, however, that there is a statutory duty, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-36,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for custodians of children to file reports to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>DCYS \u201cat such reasonable times and in such form and covering such data as said commissioner [of DCYS] directs.\u201d Nonetheless, she argues that the letters were not business records under \u00a7 52-180 because \u201cthe [DCYS] worker admitted that there was no formal or regular schedule of contact between herself as a case worker and a foster parent . . . and she does not impose a particular reporting format on a foster parent.\u201d This argument, however, misses the mark. Given the express statutory requirement that custodians of children \u201cshall make such reports\u201d as the \u201ccommissioner [of DCYS] directs,\u201d the fact that the worker does neither impose a particular reporting format on a foster parent, nor expect the duty uniformly to be observed by foster parents, will not vitiate or weaken the express duty imposed on foster parents by \u00a7 17-36. Moreover, under General Statutes \u00a7 17-37,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the commissioner of DCYS is required to exercise careful supervision of each child in his care, maintain contact with the child and foster parents and maintain such records as are necessary for the proper supervision of children under his guardianship or care. The duty of the foster parent to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>reports required under \u00a7 17-36, and the duty of the commissioner to receive reports and maintain records of his supervision and care of children as provided under \u00a7\u00a7 17-36 and 17-37, all enable the commissioner to perform his duty regarding children under his care. In sum, the trial court did not err in finding that Barbara\u2019s foster mother had a duty to make reports to the DCYS treatment worker. Therefore, the foster mother\u2019s letters to the DCYS treatment worker were admissible business records under \u00a7 52-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Next, the respondent claims that the trial court erred by admitting the report of Perlswig as a full exhibit, without examining the portions of the report that were based on hearsay evidence. We are not persuaded. Prior to admitting the report into evidence, over the respondent\u2019s objection, the court inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. This report you prepared, Doctor, does this represent the summation of your views with respect to this matter and your opinions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">\u201cDr. Perlswig: I believe that it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Overruled. Exception noted. Full exhibit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The report made reference to interviews conducted by Perlswig with the respondent and the children. In preparing his report, however, Perlswig had relied upon evaluations of Margaret and Walter by Mayes and Volkmar, respectively, as well as eight other reports on the family dating back to 1982. The respondent argues that \u201c[mjost of the sources would not be admissible in themselves, without the authors\u2019 presence for cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">\u201cThe fact that an expert opinion is drawn from sources not in themselves admissible does not render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the opinion inadmissible, provided the sources are fairly reliable and the witness has sufficient experience to evaluate the information. <em>Vigliotti </em>v. <em>Campano, </em>104 Conn. 464, 133 A. 579 (1926); <em>Schaefer, Jr. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>84 Conn. 501, 508, 80 A. 775 (1911). An expert may base his opinion on facts or data not in evidence, provided they are of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the particular field. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cuvelier, </em>175 Conn. 100, 107-108, 394 A.2d 185 (1978); see Fed. R. Evid. 703. This is so because of the sanction given by the witness\u2019s experience and expertise. <em>Burn </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Lumber Co., </em>94 Conn. 5, 6, 107 A. 609 (1919).\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 7.16.8 (c). \u201c[W]hen the expert witness has consulted numerous sources, and uses that information, together with his own professional knowledge and experience, to arrive at his opinion, that opinion is regarded as evidence in its own right and not as hearsay in disguise.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>447 F.2d 1285, 1290 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 954, 92 S. Ct. 1168, 31 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1972). The better reasoned authorities favor the admissibility of expert opinion that is partly derived from written sources. See, e.g., <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>307 F.2d 637, 641 (D.C. Cir. 1962); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1979) \u00a7 665b (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It is significant to note that the respondent has not challenged Perlswig\u2019s qualification as an expert. Moreover, Perlswig\u2019s affirmative response to the court\u2019s inquiry concerning whether his report was a \u201csummation of [Ms] <em>views . . . </em>and . . . <em>opinions\u201d </em>with respect to this matter strongly supports the inference that whatever \u201cviews\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d expressed by Perlswig in his report or in his testimony were his own \u201cviews\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d regardless of the documents or other data examined by him. (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, Perlswig was available for cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>concerning his report, and the respondent has not claimed that her cross-examination of Perlswig was in any way restricted. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting Perlswig\u2019s report into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Finally, the respondent has challenged all three grounds, as alleged by the petitioner and found by the trial court, for the termination of her parental rights. Because the grounds for termination of parental rights listed in \u00a7 17-43a (b) are in the alternative, our conclusion of no error on any one of the grounds makes it unnecessary to address any of the other grounds found by the trial court for the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-BC), </em>194 Conn. 252, 258, 479 A.2d 1204 (1984); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-BC), </em>189 Conn. 66, 69, 454 A.2d 1262 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u201c \u2018The termination of parental rights is defined as \u201cthe complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17-32a (e) (Rev. to 1972) [now \u00a7 45-61b (g)]. Although that ultimate interference by the state in the parent-child relationship may be required under certain circumstances, the natural rights of parents in their children \u201cundeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u201d <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 [1972]; see <em>In re Appeal of Kindis, </em>162 Conn. 239, 240, 294 A.2d 316 [1972]; <em>Cinque </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>[99 Conn. 70, 82, 121 A. 678 (1923)].\u2019 <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 425, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). Termination of parental rights is \u2018a most serious and sensitive judicial action.\u2019 Id., 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c \u2018Section 17-43a carefully sets out . . . four situations that, in the judgment of the legislature, constitute \u201ccountervailing interests\u201d sufficiently powerful to justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent. The commissioner of children and youth services, in petitioning to terminate those rights, must allege and prove one or more of the statutory grounds. In contrast to custody proceedings, in which the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration and in fact usually dictate the outcome, in termination proceedings the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun. No all-encompassing \u201cbest interests\u201d standard vitiates the requirement of compliance with the statutory criteria. <em>See Alsager </em>v. <em>District Court of Polk County, </em>[406 F. Sup. 10 (S.D. Iowa 1975), aff'd, 545 F.2d 1137 (8th Cir. 1976)]; <em>In re Adoption of Children by D., </em>61 N.J. 89, 293 A.2d 171 (1972); <em>Malpass </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 192 S.E.2d 794 (1972); Ketcham &amp; Babcock, \u201cStatutory Standards for the Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights,\u201d 29 Rutgers L.

(2) the parents of a child who has been found by the Superior Court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding have failed to achieve such degree of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>sonal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, they could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . . \u201d The petitioner makes the following allegations regarding each child in each petition: \u201cThe child has been found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected or uncared for. The parents have failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, they could assume a responsible position in the life of the child. . . . The previous reason(s) has/have existed for not less than one year.\u201d The trial court found that the petitioner established this ground in the petitions by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The only challenge asserted by the respondent against this finding is that the trial court\u2019s determination regarding her failure to rehabilitate herself was clearly erroneous because the trial court made the six specific findings pursuant to \u00a7 17-43a (d) at the disposition hearing instead of at the adjudicatory hearing. In reliance on <em>In re Shavoughn K., </em>13 Conn. App. 91, 534 A.2d 1243 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 805, 540 A.2d 374 (1988), and <em>In re Shannon S., </em>41 Conn. Sup. 145, 562 A.2d 79, aff\u2019d, 19 Conn. App. 20, 560 A.2d 993 (1989), the respondent argues that the six factors listed in \u00a7 17-43a (d) must be considered at the adjudicatory stage in a determination of failure to rehabilitate pursuant to \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2). We recognize that in In <em>re Shavoughn K., </em>the Appellate Court-stated: \u201cIn determining whether the parent has failed to rehabilitate herself to the extent that she could assume a responsible role in her children\u2019s lives, the court must consider the six factors listed in General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (d); <em>see In re Rayna M., </em>13 Conn. App. 23, 31-32, 534 A.2d 897 (1987).\u201d <em>In re Shavoughn K., </em>supra, 98. This Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>late Court statement was repeated in <em>In re Shannon S., </em>supra, 154. We have examined <em>In re Rayna M., In re Shavoughn K. </em>and <em>In re Shannon S., </em>for some authority or analysis that supports this proposition. Our examination and search, however, have been unsuccessful. <em>In re Shavoughn K. </em>cites <em>In re Rayna M., </em>but the <em>In re Rayna M. </em>reference is to a discussion of an amendment to \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) concerning a language change from \u201cat some future date\u201d to \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d that a parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child. See <em>In re Rayna M., </em>supra, 31-32. In fact, <em>In re Rayna M. </em>does not mention \u00a7 17-43a (d) and its six required findings at all. Thus, insofar as <em>In re Shavoughn K. </em>is applied to this case, we disagree with its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We therefore hold that a termination of parental rights judgment must be based on compliance with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 17-43a. A finding that the petitioner has proven by clear and convincing evidence at least one of the statutory alternatives listed in \u00a7 17-43a (b) is a predicate for consideration of the six factors listed in \u00a7 17-43a (d). We do not construe \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) as requiring consideration any different from the remainder of \u00a7 17-43a (b). Whether the six factors listed in \u00a7 17-43a (d) are expressly considered in conjunction with or subsequent to the trial court\u2019s determination of whether the petitioner has produced the statutorily required proof of at least one of the alternatives listed in \u00a7 17-43a (b) is without significance as long as no judgment of termination is rendered until after there has been full compliance with \u00a7 17-43a. Although \u00a7 17-43a does not mandate a bifurcated hearing, it does command a termination decision that clearly identifies the concerns of subsections (b) and (d). Bifurcating the termination decision, however, enables the trial court to focus clearly on the statutory requirements of each subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In the present case, inasmuch as the trial court meticulously made all of the statutorily required findings for the adjudications under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2), and, thereafter made all of the enumerated findings mandated under \u00a7 17-43a (d), we discern no substantive significance to the fact that the termination decision was bifurcated. Consequently, we find no error in the action of the trial court in rendering its termination decision after the bifurcated hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Our conclusion of no error regarding this finding makes it unnecessary for us to consider the claims of error regarding the other findings that the trial court used as a basis for the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights.

Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; or (4) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day to day basis the physicial, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child. If the court denies a petition for consent termination of parental rights, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving, and the plan of the parent for the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\"> At the hearing on July 20, 1988, counsel for the petitioner requested permission to withdraw the petition as to each person named as father of each child named in the petitions. Since there was no evidence of paternity with respect to any of the alleged fathers, the trial court granted the petitioner\u2019s request and allowed each petition to be withdrawn as to the alleged fathers named therein. Each petition continued, however, as to the mother, Maureen J.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (d) provides: \u201cExcept in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered or provided to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) the terms of any applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under such order; (3) the feelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to his parents, any guardian of his person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties; (4) the age of the child; (5) the efforts the parent has made to adjust his circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return him to his home in the foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to which the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to incidental visitations, eommunicatioins or contributions and (B) the maintenance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other custodian of the child; and (6) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> The following foundational inquiries were made to the DCYS treatment worker by counsel for the children: \u201cWere the letters received by you at DCYS?

Nevertheless, even if she had made this argument we would have concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding. In particular, the trial court found that the respondent: (1) visited the children sporadically; (2) refused to seek psychiatric treatment; (3) refused to divulge her whereabouts; (4) failed to appear at the hearings. Furthermore, Perlswig concluded: (1) that the mother has never been able to provide the continuity and consistency of care that is required by young children; and (2) that even if she were to seek psychiatric treatment at present, it would \"probably [be] too late.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
