The sole issue is whether the insured properly elected to accept less uninsured motorist insurance than the statutory amount required by General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2). We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the purported election was ineffective and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">. The relevant facts are as follows. On May 18, 1982, the plaintiff, The Travelers Indemnity Company (Travelers), had in force a business automobile liability policy insuring American Red Cross. Attached to the policy was a document dated May 18, 1982, executed in behalf of American Red Cross, entitled \u201cRejection of or Election of Minimum Limits Uninsured and Underinsured Motorists Insurance.\u201d The document stated that \u201cthe undersigned insured rejects uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorists insurance in all states where such rejection is permitted by law. In those states where such rejection is not permitted, the undersigned elects uninsured motorists insurance limits which are the lesser of the mandatory limits or the financial responsibility limits.\u201d At the time, \u00a7 38-175c required uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $20,000 for bodily injury or for death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On July 5, 1983, over one year later, the General Assembly enacted Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461, amending \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2). It required that every automobile liability policy \u201cissued or renewed on and after July 1, 1984,\u201d was to have uninsured motorist coverage equal to the liability coverage of the policy \u201cunless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the insured requests in writing a lesser amount . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The American Red Cross never requested any lesser amount as the parties responsible for such a decision at American Red Cross were never aware that such a statutory requirement then existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On July 1,1984, Travelers reissued its business automobile policy to American Red Cross. The policy provided $1,000,000 of liability coverage and $40,000 of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Thus, unless the American Red Cross election of May 18, 1982, constituted a request for a lesser amount of coverage within the meaning of the later amended \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), the uninsured motorist coverage, by operation of law, would be $1,000,000, the amount equal to the liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On February 7,1985, Joanne Malee, Ruth Glahn and Katherine Mazzaferro, were involved in a two car collision in Southington. The driver of the other car caused the accident. Malee and Glahn died in the crash and Mazzaferro was seriously injured. The insurance carrier for the other vehicle paid each of the claimants $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Unable to agree on whether the Travelers policy provided $1,000,000 or $40,000 of underinsured motorist coverage, the parties submitted the issue to arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The arbitration panel found that the May 18,1982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>election of minimum coverage by American Red Cross failed to satisfy the request for a lesser amount of coverage required by \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) and therefore, the underinsured motorist coverage was $1,000,000, i.e., the amount of the liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Travelers filed an application in Superior Court to set aside the arbitration ruling.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Hammer, J., </em>concluding, inter alia, that \u201cneither Travelers nor the Red Cross took any steps to comply with the express requirements of the statute (i.e. \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2)) with specific reference to the policy issued on July 1, 1984,\u201d confirmed the award. Travelers appealed to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">On appeal, Travelers claims that its insured\u2019s written election of May 18,1982, constituted a continuing directive to Travelers to provide the minimum uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (UM coverage) permitted by law, and thus, the May 18,1982 election served as an anticipatory request for a lesser amount of coverage as required by the subsequently amended statute. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 38-175c; see Public Acts 1967, No. 510; UM coverage, although available, was not required. Coverage was limited to the amount requested by the insured. In 1969, \u00a7 38-175c was amended to require parity of UM coverage with the <em>minimum limits </em>of liability coverage required by Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a). See Public Acts 1969, No. 202. In 1983, \u00a7 38-175c was again amended now to require parity of UM coverage with the <em>amount of liability coverage purchased by the insured </em>unless the insured specifically requested a lesser amount. See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461. Thus, examination of the recent history of \u00a7 38-175c discloses: (1) a heightened legislative interest in uninsured motorist protection; (2) a mandate to raise the amount of this protection; and (3) an intention to increase the public\u2019s consciousness as to the availability of this kind of insurance by requiring increased coverage unless the insured specifically requested otherwise. \u201cA statute is to be construed by considering its legislative history, language, purpose and the circumstances surrounding its enactment.\u201d <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 395, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We have no doubt that the General Assembly contemplated that an insured should make a purposeful and knowing decision to request a lesser amount of UM coverage. The legislative history of Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461 demonstrates the importance that the legislature attached to specific awareness of the content of the statute: \u201cUnder sub-section 2, it would require each insured who purchases more than the legally required amount of liability insurance would [sic] receive the same amount of uninsured motorist coverage. The insured would have an opportunity to waive in writing the additional uninsured motorist coverage. <em>This change would increase the consumer\u2019s awareness </em>of the value of low-cost uninsured motorist coverage which protects the insured and his family members. Apparently many drivers purchase $100,000.00 or more of liability coverage but leave their uninsured motorist coverage at the minimum of $20,000.00-$40,000.00. Sub-section 2 which <em>gives such a driver an increased amount of uninsured motorist coverage, unless he makes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>a conscious decision not to purchase it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 26 S. Proc., Pt. 9,1983 Sess., p. 3055, remarks of Senator Wayne A. Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Section 38-175c (a) (2) mandates \u201cuninsured motorist coverage with limits . . . equal to those purchased [by the insured] to protect against loss resulting from the liability imposed by law unless the insured <em>requests </em>in writing a lesser amount . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The verb speaks in the present tense. The statute does not say <em>\u201crequested\u201d </em>nor does it say <em>\u201cmay have requested in the past.\u201d </em>We are entitled to presume that if the legislature intended that past acts could constitute compliance with the mandate of requests for a lesser amount pursuant to the statute, language to that effect would appear in the statute. \u201c[W]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 421, 528 A.2d 811 (1987); <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54-55, 523 A.2d 477 (1987).\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Section 38-175c (a) (2) further provides: \u201cSuch written request shall apply to all <em>subsequent </em>renewals of coverage and to all policies or endorsements which extend, change, supersede or replace an existing policy issued to the named insured, unless changed in writing by the insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The adjective refers to succeeding or following renewals. There is no reference to requests for lesser amounts that may have accompanied prior renewals of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Finally, we observe that although the amendment was enacted on July 5, 1983, its effective date was stayed almost one full year to July 1,1984. In so doing, the legislature presumably intended to allow insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>carriers to notify their insureds of the act\u2019s new consequences and to furnish time <em>thereafter </em>for them to request the lesser amount of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Adoption of Travelers\u2019 argument would require us to overlook the fact that the American Red Cross election of minimum limits executed in May, 1982, seeks to comply with the terms of a statute that did not exist until July, 1983, and was not effective until July 1, 1984. Further, the claim that this constituted a conscious request for a lesser amount pursuant to the statute is irreconcilable with the fact that neither Travelers nor American Red Cross in negotiating the insurance contract was even aware that the 1983 amendment to the statute existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In sum, we conclude that in its enactment of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), the legislature intended that there be absolute parity between liability coverage limits and UM coverage limits as of July 1, 1984, and that any reductions in UM coverage would require a request for a lesser amount to be made after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In this opinion Peters, C.

I disagree with the conclusion reached by the majority that the document attached to the business automobile liability policy issued by the plaintiff to insure American Red Cross fails to satisfy the exception to the mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) for uninsured motorist coverage limits equal to liability coverage limits, \u201cunless the insured requests in writing a lesser amount.\u201d This rejection form, signed by an officer of the insured, unambiguously states that the insured \u201celects uninsured motorists insurance limits which are the lesser of the mandatory limits or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>financial responsibility limits.\u201d Under \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) that directive would afford uninsured motorists coverage of $20,000 per person, while the liability coverage limit is $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The majority relies upon the fact that \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) uses the present tense, \u201crequests,\u201d rather than \u201crequested\u201d and specifically makes \u201csuch written request\u201d applicable to \u201csubsequent renewals of coverage.\u201d It also maintains that because the request in this case preceded the enactment of the provision involved, it cannot be deemed to satisfy the statutory requirement for a written request. This analysis ignores the fact that the request of American Red Cross for the minimum uninsured motorist coverage permitted by law was a continuing directive that remained in force from May 18, 1982, when it was executed, until long after the date of the accident, February 7, 1985. The undisputed testimony indicated that American Red Cross sought to minimize its insurance costs by instructing its insurer to provide only the minimum coverage required in each state where it conducted its operations, that this was a deliberate decision fully agreed upon between the insurer and the insured, and that policies reflecting this understanding had been issued each year accordingly. Under the terms of these policies, American Red Cross is a self-insurer for the first $250,000 of any claim filed during the policy year. Its purpose in executing the request form obviously was to obtain the least costly coverage permitted by law and it instructed its insurer to achieve that result with respect to each of the fifty states in which it operated, regardless of the changes that might be made in the laws of a particular state during the policy period. It is a strained construction of the statutory language to hold that such a plainly continuing directive does not satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) for a written request for uninsured motorist coverage less than the liability limit of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>California State Auto Assn., </em>68 Cal.

In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>23 Cal. App. 3d 953, 100 Cal. Rptr. 565 (1972), a waiver executed in connection with the original issuance of a policy was held to apply to subsequent renewals even before the California statute contained such a provision expressly. In <em>Hellerstedt </em>v. <em>Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>429 N.W.2d 677, 679 (Minn. App. 1988), the requirement of a Minnesota statute that uninsured motorist coverage be offered to an insured was held to be satisfied when the insured had requested a prior insurer in issuing a fleet policy to provide \u201conly the insurance required by law on a per state basis,\u201d declining all optional coverage, and directed its present insurer to issue a similar policy. In <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>694 S.W.2d 314 (Tenn. App. 1985), the exception in a statute similar to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) allowing an insured to select in writing lower uninsured motorist limits than those otherwise mandated was deemed met by the execution of forms selecting such lower limits about two years before the statute became effective. I would follow these precedents, which give effect to the clear understanding between the insured and its insurer as reflected in the written documents evidencing their intentions, rather than construe \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) in such a manner as to frustrate those unambiguously expressed intentions, as the majority has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
