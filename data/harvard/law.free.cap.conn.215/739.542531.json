Prior to the trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress inculpatory oral statements he had allegedly made to a police officer during a custodial interrogation at the police station. After a hearing, the court denied the motion, and the police officer testified at the trial concerning the defendant\u2019s statements. The defendant testified at the hearing, but not at his trial. After a jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced to a term of fifty years imprisonment. On appeal from the judgment, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s admission into evidence of testimony concerning his inculpatory statements, arguing that he had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to remain silent and to consult with counsel prior to making the statements. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant was involved in drug dealing in the Pine Street area of New Haven. After a group of Jamaicans from the Liberty Street area of New Haven threatened to take over the Pine Street area narcotics trade, the defendant and two companions went to the Liberty Street area to shoot some of the Jamaicans and intimidate others into abandoning the takeover. When they arrived, they saw a man whom one of the defendant\u2019s companions identified as being Jamaican, not from personal knowledge, but from the man\u2019s appearance. The defendant and his companions opened fire on the unknown Jamaican and killed him. They fled on foot, but were confronted by two uniformed police officers who were in the area investigating an unrelated complaint. The officers pursued the assailants but caught only the defendant. Police later retrieved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>defendant\u2019s gun from under a car where he had thrown it during the chase, and found bullets and casings from the gun near the victim\u2019s body. During questioning, the defendant confessed to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The admissibility of a confession is initially a question of fact for the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 40, 554 A.2d 263 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schroff, </em>206 Conn. 182, 195-96, 536 A.2d 952 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 162-63, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). In view of the constitutional dimension of the issue, the trial court\u2019s finding of voluntariness is, however, subject to \u201can independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 478, 512 A.2d 189 (1986). We review the record in its entirety, and are not limited to the evidence before the trial court at the time the ruling was made on the motion to suppress. <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 348, 96 S. Ct. 1612, 48 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 576, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Our examination of the record relating to the interrogation reveals the following. The defendant was apprehended at his girlfriend\u2019s house, a few blocks away from where the police had begun the chase. He was arrested on a weapons charge and brought to the investigative services unit at New Haven police headquarters. The defendant told the arresting officer that he was fifteen years old, but by the time he was questioned had informed the officers of his correct age, seventeen. After the arrest, officers found that a man, Marlin Williams, had been shot to death at the site of the gunshots. The defendant was questioned, therefore, in connection with the victim\u2019s shooting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The defendant was taken to the third floor of the police station and brought to a conference room adjoining the principal central room (the detective bureau) with tall windows looking to the outside and to the adjoining detective bureau. The room was fairly large with no \u201chot lights.\u201d There he was interrogated by patrol officer Joseph Pettola. Although other police officers came in and out and did ask the defendant questions, the interrogation was primarily one-on-one, between the defendant and Pettola. Pettola testified that the interrogation began at 8:30 p.m., while the defendant first testified that it began at 7 p.m., but then conceded that it might have begun later. The interview ended either between 11:30 p.m. and midnight (according to Pettola) or between 12:45 and 1 a.m. (according to the defendant). Both sides agree that the interrogation took at least three hours. After the interrogation was over, Pettola prepared his written report of the interrogation, which he dictated at 2 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The Disputed Events</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">What happened during the interrogation is the core of the dispute. The police officer, Pettola, testified as follows. Before the questioning began, he took out a combined \u201crights\u201d card-waiver form* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> printed with stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>dard language informing the arrestee of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He gave the form to the defendant to read and also read it aloud to him. At the suppression hearing, Pettola testified that he asked the defendant whether he knew how to read, but at trial, he testified that he did not recall so doing. He did not ask the defendant any questions about his level of education or his prior experience with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">After reading the defendant the first section of the form, which advised the defendant of his rights, Pettola went on to read him the waiver section. Pettola went through the waiver section line by line, and after each line, specifically asked the defendant whether he understood that right and whether he waived that right. Each time he was asked whether he understood the right and whether he waived it, the defendant answered \u201cyes.\u201d Each time he answered \u201cyes,\u201d Pettola asked him to initial the form, but the defendant refused, saying he would not sign anything. When asked if he wanted to make a written statement, he refused. When Pettola brought out a tape recorder and asked him if he wanted to make a recorded statement, the defendant said, \u201cNothing on tape.\u201d Yet, when asked if he would give an oral statement, the defendant said, \u201c[I\u2019ll] do that.\u201d There were no witnesses other than Pettola to these responses. Although two or three police detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>lives were present at times during the interrogation, Pettola did not recall whether any of them had witnessed the defendant\u2019s oral waiver of rights, and the detectives never testified on this subject at either the suppression hearing or the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">After the defendant had agreed to make an oral statement, the questioning began. For approximately the next three hours, Pettola asked questions, and the defendant answered them. During the questioning, the defendant appeared calm and not intimidated. There was no indication that his mind was impaired by alcohol, drugs or any mental disability. First he gave exculpatory answers that Pettola in testimony referred to as \u201cthe wrong answers.\u201d Part way through the interview, however, the defendant began to explain his involvement in the killing. Once the defendant had given Pettola a story that Pettola found believable, because it was consistent with the information supplied by the arresting officers, the defendant said he would not answer any more questions, and the interview concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">At the suppression hearing, the defendant\u2019s version of the events differed materially from Pettola\u2019s. The defendant first testified that he was neither advised of his rights nor asked to waive them, that he was not shown a \u201crights\u201d card/waiver form, and that he had refused to answer any questions. When the hearing resumed after a recess, however, he changed his testimony. This time, he said that he was shown a waiver form, although it was not read to him, and that he was asked to sign it, but refused. He also said that he knew his rights from prior experience, which he described as \u201cdo I want a lawyer or do I want to speak\u2014do I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>to speak in front of my parent.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He testified that he had, in fact, answered some questions, but only to explain what he was doing in the area. He denied telling Pettola the names of his companions, although the defendant\u2019s companions had not been apprehended at the time Pettola prepared the report giving their names and addresses. He denied that Pettola ever offered him anything to eat or drink, but never said that he had, in fact, been hungry, thirsty, tired, or fearful.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The defendant\u2019s version of events also differs from Pettola\u2019s in other respects. At the suppression hearing, the defendant testified that he had asked for a lawyer several times.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pettola, on the other hand, testified that at no time did the defendant ask to speak to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The defendant also testified, and Pettola did not dispute, that several times during the course of the interrogation the defendant asked to be allowed to telephone his mother. Precisely when he made each request is unclear, but there is no dispute that he made his requests several times throughout the interrogation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Pettola expressly stated that the defendant never said he wanted to speak to his mother in order to ask her to get him an attorney, and the defendant did not contradict this point. The defendant never explained <em>why </em>he wanted to speak to his mother. The defendant also claimed Pettola told him he could be kept forty-eight hours without being allowed to talk to anyone, and that Pettola would let him call his mother when he told him what he wanted to hear. For his part, Pettola testified at trial that as a matter of New Haven police practice, an adult arrestee is not permitted to interrupt an interview to call anyone other than an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In addition to the defendant\u2019s own requests to telephone his mother, his mother attempted to call him. She testified at the suppression hearing that she had heard his name on the evening news and began calling the police station. She first simply asked the police whether her son was there and whether she could speak with him, but permission was refused. In a subsequent call, she told the police she wanted her son to speak to an attorney, but was informed that she would have to take care of that herself. She came to the station in person, but was not allowed to see her son. Finally, at 1:30 a.m., after the defendant\u2019s interrogation was over, he was allowed to call his mother. Between that telephone call at 1:30 a.m. on Friday morning, October 14, and the next day, October 15, when the defendant was released on bail, the defendant\u2019s mother did not visit him, call him, or attempt to find an attorney for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Defendant\u2019s Request to Call his Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The defendant\u2019s argument focuses on Pettola\u2019s refusal to let him telephone his mother. We have never held that a minor in custody has the right to contact a parent, nor that contact with a parent is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>before a minor can effectively waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Indeed, we expressly rejected that suggestion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>160 Conn. 85, 94, 273 A.2d 867 (1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 946, 91 S. Ct. 1637, 29 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1971).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The legislature has, however, chosen to provide minors under the age of sixteen with certain specific protections. Our statutes prescribe, that upon the arrest of a child, the police must notify the child\u2019s parents, and that any confession or admission made by a child without the presence of his parents is inadmissible in a delinquency proceeding. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-133 (e)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 46b-137 (a).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These protections are, however, limited to a \u201cchild,\u201d defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 as any person under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>A decision to expand the scope of the exclusionary rule of \u00a7 46b-137 (a) requires the kind of interest balancing determination best left to the legislature. There are strong reasons to restrict the inadmissibility of confessions made in the absence of a parent to those of minors under sixteen, as the legislature has done in \u00a7 46b-137 (a). As we said in <em>In re Manuel R., </em>207 Conn. 725, 734, 543 A.2d 719 (1988), when we refused to adopt a per se rule that children <em>under </em>sixteen are incompetent to waive the assistance of counsel, \u201ca per se rule of nonwaivability might actually frustrate a principal goal of juvenile law of encouraging children to accept responsibility for their transgressions and take an active role in their rehabilitation.\u201d Moreover, the presence of a parent is not necessarily an unmitigated benefit, even to a child. \u201c[A]s judicial and scholarly authorities attest, parents may, for their own reasons, exert pressure on children to confess to alleged offenses and to waive the assistance of counsel. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>476 F.2d 1091, 1093 (7th Cir. 1973); <em>In re Matter of C.P.D., </em>367 A.2d 133, 134-35 (D.C. App. 1976); <em>Anglin </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 So. 2d 752 (Fla. App. 1972); T. Grisso, [Juveniles\u2019 Waiver of Rights: Legal and Psychological Competence (1981), pp. 179-80].\u201d Id., 739. We therefore decline to hold that a seventeen year old charged with murder must be afforded an opportunity to contact a parent before making a valid waiver of his rights to silence and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">A different case would be presented had the defendant asked to telephone his mother <em>to ask her to obtain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number><em>an attorney for him. </em>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has concluded that such a request should be considered an invocation of the fifth amendment right to counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zook, </em>520 Pa. 210, 216, 553 A.2d 920, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 873, 110 S. Ct. 203, 107 L.Ed. 2d 157 (1989). Upon any request for counsel, the interrogating officer must cease all questioning; <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>187 Conn. 647, 667, 448 A.2d 163 (1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 3570, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1411 (1983); and if the request is ambiguous, must clarify the suspect\u2019s washes before resuming questioning. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 737, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). We are not asked to consider such a situation here. There is no evidence in the record, and the defendant does not claim, that the defendant actually told the officer he wanted to ask his mother to find him an attorney. There is no evidence that the defendant did in fact want his mother to find him an attorney.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Absent such evidence, we cannot assume that a seventeen year old youth\u2019s request to call his mother is equivalent to a request that his mother obtain counsel for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Unless he was actually requesting the assistance of counsel, the defendant had no constitutional right to interrupt the interrogation to talk to his mother. There is no fifth amendment right to parental advice. The United States Supreme Court has concluded that even a minor\u2019s request to speak to his parole officer is not an invocation of his fifth amendment right to counsel. <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 721, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197, reh. denied, 444 U.S. 887, 100 S. Ct. 186, 62 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1979). The court\u2019s discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>is particularly appropriate here. Reasoning that \u201c[i]t is this pivotal role of legal counsel that justifies the per se rule established in <em>Miranda, </em>and that distinguishes the request for counsel from the request for a probation officer, a clergyman, or a close friend\u201d; id., 722; the court in <em>Fare </em>concluded that extending the <em>Miranda </em>requirements to requests for a parole officer would \u201c \u2018cut this Court\u2019s holding in that case completely loose from its own explicitly stated rationale.\u2019 \u201d Id., 722-23. As we have said: \u201cAt a minimum, the presence of a lay parent or guardian, with no training in law, is no guarantee that a child will be fully informed or meaningfully represented. <em>K.E.S. </em>v. <em>State, </em>134 Ga. App. 843, 847-48, 216 S.E.2d 670 (1975); <em>State ex rel. J.M. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>276 S.E.2d 199, 203 (W. Va. 1981).\u201d <em>In re Manuel R., </em>supra, 725. Other courts considering similar cases have reached the same conclusion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>150 Vt. 483, 555 A.2d 369 (1988) (nineteen year old\u2019s request to call his father was not an invocation of fifth amendment rights); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowhurst, </em>470 A.2d 1138 (R.I. 1984) (request to call wife was not invocation of fifth amendment rights to silence or counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Besides arguing that asking for his mother was equivalent to requesting an attorney, the defendant maintains that his mother\u2019s call was equivalent to an attorney\u2019s call. The defendant contends that his mother\u2019s call to the police station, during which she told the police that she wanted her son to speak to an attorney, triggers the application of <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 537 A.2d 446 (1988).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Stoddard, </em>we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>that the due process clause of the Connecticut constitution requires the police to inform a suspect of timely efforts <em>by counsel </em>to provide pertinent legal assistance. We do not read the holding in <em>Stoddard </em>to encompass \u201cattempts <em>by others </em>to warn [the defendant] to say nothing to the police or to obtain legal assistance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 179-80 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). We rejected such a broad reading, stating: \u201cThe right of <em>access to counsel </em>plays a special role in the validity of confessions. The assertion in the dissenting opinion that our judgment will open up a \u2018Pandora\u2019s Box\u2019 with respect to other kinds of conceivably helpful information therefore has no foundation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 169 n.5. Thus, <em>Stoddard </em>prohibited only \u201cpolice interference in the attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 467, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Here, there was no such relationship. The defendant\u2019s mother could have procured an attorney for her son, and police would have had to honor that attorney\u2019s attempts to reach the defendant. She did not do so. Her advice was more akin to \u201can abstract offer to call some unknown lawyer\u201d than the \u201cconcrete offer of [legal] assistance\u201d that <em>Stoddard </em>protects. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>supra, 168.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The Defendant\u2019s Waiver of His <em>Miranda </em>Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The defendant\u2019s request to telephone his mother is only one element of his larger argument that his waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>of rights was involuntary. In evaluating whether the state has met its burden of proving that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights, we may defer to the trial court\u2019s findings on subsidiary factual questions, as compared with the ultimate legal finding of voluntariness; see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 112, 106 S. Ct. 445, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1985) (subsidary factual questions, such as what police tactics were in fact used, fall within the purview of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 [d]); and we must defer to the trial court\u2019s resolution of questions of credibility, <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 37; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuskowski, </em>200 Conn. 82, 89, 510 A.2d 172 (1986). The sole issue for us to decide is whether, judging the record as a whole; <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 581, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986); the state has proved waiver by the preponderance of the evidence. <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 168, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986); <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>supra, 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The trial court expressly found that the defendant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The trial court also accepted Pettola\u2019s testimony as to what took place at the interrogation, including, presumably, Pettola\u2019s testimony that the defendant expressly stated he waived his rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The only remaining issue is whether that waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Whether a defendant has voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights is determined by an analysis of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>supra, 724-25. \u201cThis totality-of-the-circumstances approach is adequate to determine whether there has been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>waiver even where interrogation of juveniles is involved. We discern no persuasive reasons why any other approach is required where the question is whether a juvenile has waived his rights, as opposed to whether an adult has done so. The totality approach permits\u2014indeed, it mandates\u2014inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. This includes evaluation of the juvenile\u2019s age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and into whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.\u201d Id., 725; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 580-81 (criteria to be considered are: experience with the police and familiarity with warnings; intelligence, including I.Q.; age; education; vocabulary and ability to read and write in the language in which the warnings were given; intoxication; emotional state; mental disease, disorder or retardation). Where the trial court makes specific factual findings regarding these elements, those findings are entitled to deference so long as they are supported by substantial evidence, but where, as here, the trial court has made no specific findings, we must review the evidence and make our own determination of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s waiver of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The defendant testified that he knew his rights from past experience with the police, that he had been on the third floor of the same police station a couple of years before, and that he knew several of the officers involved from his prior experience. He had been arrested twice on misdemeanor charges within the previous month, (and possibly more often; see footnote 7, supra), and according to his mother\u2019s testimony, had previously been held in detention long enough to have visiting rights. He had not been drinking and did not use drugs. Pettola testified that the defendant appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>calm, and not to be suffering from any emotional or mental disturbance. Although he was a minor, he was not a \u201cchild\u201d according to the statute, but was seventeen years old. The defendant presented no evidence of mental or emotional impairment. He also failed to present any testimony that his educational achievement was less than average for his age. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, we found that an adult with a sixth or seventh grade level of intelligence had effectively waived his rights. The defendant\u2019s assertion at the hearing that he had requested a lawyer\u2014although disbelieved by the trial court\u2014indicated his familiarity with his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant presented no evidence from which the court could infer police coercion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, he attempted to discredit the police officer\u2019s version of events. He argued that his failure to sign the waiver form or furnish a written statement was evidence that he had not waived his rights, as were his refusal to answer some of the questions, the length of the interrogation (approximately three hours), and his minority. We have previously held, however, that these considerations do not necessarily indicate an involuntary waiver. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 415, 518 A.2d 35 (1986) (minority); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra, 732 (refusal to sign waiver); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 83-85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>475 A.2d 1087 (1984) (refusal to answer some questions). There may be strategic reasons for a defendant\u2019s refusal to sign anything without counsel while agreeing to speak without counsel. <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 530 n.4, 107 S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1987). \u201cWe have noted that it is \u2018 \u201ca common experience of life that in many circumstances persons are willing to convey information orally but are reluctant to put the same thing in writing.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>[185 Conn. 211, 225, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982)], quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>499 F.2d 1060, 1062 (D.C. Cir. 1974). . . . A written and signed confession is obviously a more reliable form of evidence than the uncorroborated and often disputed testimony of the interrogating officers.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra, 733. And a three hour interview, during which the interrogating officer left the room several times, is not in itself inherently coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">More troubling is the police officer\u2019s failure to obtain a witness to the defendant\u2019s oral waiver of rights and oral confession. While there may be places where a police officer has no convenient witness handy, a busy police station is not one of them. Our concern does not, however, reflect upon the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, for it relates only to the credibility of the state\u2019s witness.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Simply put, the defendant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>that the police officer\u2019s failure to have the defendant\u2019s waiver witnessed proves that the police officer was lying. This is a question of credibility, and as such, is for the trier of fact to determine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The absence of a second witness to a confession is not a ground upon which a reviewing court may overturn a trial court\u2019s determination of compliance with <em>Miranda. </em>Such a lack of corroboration, however, may result in exclusion of a confession by the trial court when other supporting evidence is also not presented. Even when the ruling admitting the confession is unassailable, the absence of testimony confirming that of a single witness to a confession may become highly significant with respect to the weight given to a confession by the arbiter of guilt. <em>\u201cA </em>defendant has been as free since <em>Jackson </em>[v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964)], as he was before to familiarize a jury with circumstances that attend the taking of his confession, including facts bearing upon its weight and voluntariness. In like measure, of course, juries have been at liberty to disregard confessions that are insufficiently corroborated or otherwise deemed unworthy of belief.\u201d <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Here, the defendant has not contested the sufficiency of the evidence against him, and the record contains other evidence that the defendant shot at the victim intentionally. In another case, having no witness to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>oral confession obtained during a custodial interrogation at a busy police station might prove fatal to the state\u2019s credibility. We cannot say, however, that the trial court\u2019s and the jury\u2019s decision to believe the testimony of the police officer was unreasonable, especially in light of the inconsistencies in the defendant\u2019s testimony and his statements to the arresting officer, including his lie about his age. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuskowski, </em>supra (trial court had the right to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s unsupported statement that he requested counsel when the state\u2019s evidence was that his rights had been read to him, he had understood them, and he had agreed to cooperate).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Given the absence of any evidence of police coercion and the trial court\u2019s finding that Pettola\u2019s testimony was credible, we conclude that the state has proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. The defendant had prior experience with the police; his faculties were unimpaired; he was an older youth, not a young child; and the interrogation took only a few, interrupted hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">In this opinion Callahan and Hull, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-15\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative DEFENSES.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, the case that the majority cites for the proposition that this is a question of credibility for the trier of fact to determine, this court was faced with a scenario similar to <em>Wilson. </em>In particular, the defendant claimed that he had not been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The trial court, however, found \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d supporting the state\u2019s assertion that the defendant had indeed been so advised. This court then upheld the trial court\u2019s finding, specifically noting that, in reaching its conclusion, the trial court referred to the testimony of <em>five </em>police officers and <em>one </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, who all testified that the defendant had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Id., 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In the present case, we have a scenario that falls in between <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Madera. </em>In looking, however, to \u201cthe totality of the circumstances of the claimed waiver\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 49; I conclude that this case is closer in nature to <em>Wilson </em>than it is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>Madera. </em>The only evidence before the trial court indicating that the youth waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights was the uncorroborated testimony of Pettola. It is my belief that, when \u201cthe particular facts and circumstances\u201d of this case are considered, the more rational interpretation of the evidence indicates that the state did not meet its burden of proving that the youth made a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">First, it can be argued that, since the youth refused to sign a written waiver or to give a written or tape-recorded statement, yet eventually was willing to give an oral statement, he clearly did not understand that his oral statement could be used against him just as any written or recorded statements could be. Moreover, additional circumstances surrounding this case cry out against this court\u2019s sanctioning of the procedure utilized by the police. A youth was brought into the police station around 8:30 p.m. During his questioning, that lasted for at least three hours, he persistently requested that he be allowed to call his mother. The police, however, not only refused his requests, but also refused his mother\u2019s requests to speak to him. Eventually, the youth allegedly orally waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and confessed to murder. Pettola alone took the youth\u2019s oral waiver and confession, notwithstanding the fact that he testified that it is usual police procedure to have another officer present to witness an oral waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights after a suspect has refused to sign a written waiver form. Moreover, other police officers could be seen from the interrogation room and were coming in and out of the interrogation room on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Because Pettola failed to, at the very least, have the youth\u2019s oral waiver and confession witnessed by another police officer, this case must be determined on the basis of Pettola\u2019a uncorroborated statement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the contradicting testimony of the youth. I am unable, under the circumstances of this case, to find \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of the youth\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights as is required by our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Moreover, I take issue with the majority\u2019s utilizing the jury\u2019s verdict in this case as further support of the trial court\u2019s ruling at the suppression hearing. The majority states: \u201cIn another case, having no witness to an oral confession obtained during a custodial interrogation at a busy police station might prove fatal to the state\u2019s credibility. We cannot say, however, that the trial court\u2019s and <em>the jury\u2019s </em>decision to believe the testimony of the police officer was unreasonable . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) While it is true that, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling at a suppression hearing, this court is not limited to the <em>evidence </em>that was before the trial court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 576; I do not, however, consider the jury\u2019s verdict to be \u201cevidence.\u201d To do so would condone the unsettling practice of using a jury\u2019s verdict as a curative force in regard to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">For the foregoing reasons I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
