J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">The sole issue in this tax appeal is the applicability of the gross earnings tax imposed by Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 12-587<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to sales in Connecticut of petroleum products that were marketed and distributed in states other than Connecticut. The department of revenue services included sales to out-of-state purchasers in its assessment of the gross earnings taxes owed by the plaintiff, Texaco, Inc., for sales made between October 1,1980, and April 30,1982.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the defendant, John G. Groppo, commissioner of revenue services, denied the plaintiffs timely protest of this assessment, the plaintiff filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-597.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tained the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 12-587 and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. We transferred to this court the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent appeal to the Appellate Court. Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The stipulated facts include the following. The plaintiff, a Delaware corporation, is authorized to do business in Connecticut and operates terminals in East Hartford and New Haven. Between October 1, 1980, and April 30, 1982, the plaintiff supplied petroleum products to five distributors whose businesses and customers were located entirely outside the state. Title to the petroleum products passed to these out-of-state purchasers in Connecticut. The purchasers took delivery of the petroleum products in this state by sending their own vehicles or a common carrier to one of the plaintiff\u2019s Connecticut terminals. The purchasers certified, however, and the record revealed, that the petroleum products they bought in. this state were all marketed and distributed in states other than Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The trial court upheld the defendant\u2019s determination of the taxability of these transactions under \u00a7 12-587, the gross earnings tax. Although the court attached no significance to the passage of title in this state, it concluded that our statute, like the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, 7A U.L.A. (1978), unambiguously determines the taxability of gross earnings by reference to the place where goods are delivered to the purchaser rather than by the place of their ultimate destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Prior to its 1982 amendments, \u00a7 12-587 provided in relevant part: \u201cAny petroleum company which is engaged primarily in the refining and distribution of petroleum products and distributes such products to wholesale and retail dealers for marketing and distribution in this state shall pay a quarterly tax at the rate</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of two per cent of gross earnings in each taxable quarter derived by such company from the sale of petroleum products in this state. . . . For purposes of sections 12-587 to 12-602, inclusive . . . \u2018gross earnings\u2019 are those earnings from the sale of petroleum products to which the sales factor is applied under subdivision (3) of section 12-218 . . . .\u201d In construing this text, we proceed from well established principles. First, because a tax appeal is not an administrative appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-186, the plaintiff is entitled to a plenary judicial review of its challenge of its tax assessment. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 588, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 421, 521 A.2d 569 (1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, because the applicability of \u00a7 12-587 to out-of-state purchases concerns the imposition of a tax rather than a claimed right to an exemption or a deduction, the issue must be resolved by strictly construing the statute against the taxing authority and in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Enthone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>211 Conn. 655, 661, 560 A.2d 971 (1989); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra; <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 420-23. Third, our construction of \u00a7 12-587 must endeavor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature primarily as expressed in the words of the statute itself, and secondarily in its legislative history and in the legislative policy that it was designed to implement. <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>214 Conn. 181, 185, 571 A.2d 89 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 199-200, 562 A.2d 481 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The plaintiff maintains that \u00a7 12-587, on its face, excludes sales to out-of-state purchasers. The statute purports to tax a petroleum company only insofar as it \u201cdistributes [petroleum] products to wholesale and retail dealers for marketing and distribution <em>in this state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The parties\u2019 stipulation of facts states that \u201call of the petroleum products sold to the Out of State Purchasers were in fact transported out of Connecticut and marketed and distributed in states <em>other than Connecticut. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision did not address the application of this part of \u00a7 12-587 to the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">A literal reading of the text of \u00a7 12-587 supports the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the legislature did not intend to tax the petroleum sales that are presently at issue. In light of our obligation to attach independent meaning to every phrase contained in a legislative enactment; <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 189, 193, 571 A.2d 93 (1990); <em>Rawling </em>v. <em>New Haven, 206 </em>Conn. 100, 112, 537 A.2d 439 (1988); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 66, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>162 Conn. 390, 405, 294 A.2d 546 (1972); we cannot simply read the clause \u201cin this state\u201d out of \u00a7 12-587.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The defendant maintains, however, that the legislature intended the words \u201cin this state\u201d as a modifier of \u201cwholesale and retail dealers\u201d and not of \u201cmarketing and distribution.\u201d In support of this contention, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>defendant suggests that the legislature added \u201cin this state\u201d in order to establish a jurisdictional nexus with Connecticut; cf. <em>Cally Curtis Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>214 Conn. 292, 297-99, 572 A.2d 302 (1990); rather than as a definition of the transactions to which the gross earnings tax applies. Because the defendant views the clause \u201cin this state\u201d as something other than a limitation on \u201cmarketing and distribution,\u201d the defendant urges us to construe. \u00a7 12-587 to determine the taxability of petroleum product sales according to the place at which the products are delivered rather than the place of their ultimate destination. According to this reasoning, the plaintiffs sales fall within \u00a7 12-587 because its petroleum products were delivered to its out-of-state customers in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 12-587 is, for two reasons, not easily reconcilable with the language of the statute itself. First and foremost, the defendant relies on a transposition of statutory language for which there is no authority. The statute plainly attaches the modifier \u201cin this state\u201d to the words \u201cmarketing and distribution\u201d rather than to the words \u201cwholesale and retail dealers.\u201d Second, in ascribing a jurisdictional function to the clause \u201cin this state\u201d when that clause follows the words \u201cmarketing and distribution,\u201d the defendant has failed to take account of the presence of the identical clause at the end of the same sentence in \u00a7 12-587. That statute measures a petroleum company\u2019s tax liability by the \u201cgross earnings . . . derived by such company from the sale of petroleum products <em>in this state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We may not treat as superfluous either of these two references to \u201cin this state\u201d in \u00a7 12-587. As the plaintiff contends, it seems likely that the legislature intended the use of \u201cin this state\u201d at the end of the sentence to incorporate the requisite jurisdictional nexus, while it intended the earlier usage to describe the range of transactions deemed tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>able. A straightforward reading of the first sentence of \u00a7 12-587 in its entirety thus appears to refute the defendant\u2019s argument for the taxability of the plaintiff\u2019s sales to out-of-state purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The defendant nonetheless insists that the fact that \u00a7 12-587 contains a cross reference to subsection (3) of General Statutes \u00a7 12-218<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires us to construe \u00a7 12-587 as measuring the taxability of the plaintiff\u2019s sales by the place of delivery to out-of-state purchasers rather than by the place of destination. According to the defendant, the cross reference to \u00a7 12-218 implies that \u00a7 12-587 must encompass at least some multistate transactions since the function of \u00a7 12-218 is to attribute an appropriate portion of a multistate corporation\u2019s income to Connecticut for tax purposes. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 594; <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 416. Further, the defendant maintains that \u00a7 12-218 adopts a delivery rather than a destination standard when it defines attributable gross receipts to include \u201creceipts from sales of tangible property if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state . . . regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale . . . .\u201d Although the trial court found this argument persuasive, we do not agree that the cross reference to \u00a7 12-218 contained in the final sentence of \u00a7 12-587 trumps the straightforward description of taxable transactions contained in the first sentence of \u00a7 12-587.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">As a general matter, the defendant\u2019s reliance on the cross reference to \u00a7 12-218 raises a possible ambiguity with respect to the intended coverage of \u00a7 12-587. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>It is not clear whether the cross reference had the broad objective of defining all aspects of the transactions that are taxable under \u00a7 12-587 or the narrower objective of determining the interstate allocation of those transactions insofar as they trigger \u00a7 12-218. Such a latent ambiguity must ordinarily be resolved in favor of the taxpayer, as we have noted above, because the issue remains the imposition of tax liability rather than entitlement to an exemption or a deduction. The plaintiff, accordingly, still prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Even if we were to explore the merits of the defendant\u2019s expansive interpolation of the \u00a7 12-218 standard into \u00a7 12-587, we would still doubt the taxability of the plaintiff\u2019s sales to out-of-state purchasers. The usage, in \u00a7 12-218, of \u201cdelivered or shipped to a purchaser <em>within this </em>state\u201d (emphasis added) is hardly an unambiguous direction to tax sales to purchasers who are <em>not </em>within this state. Indeed, the uniform holding of courts in other states interpreting essentially identical language has been that the destination of the goods, and not their delivery point, is dispositive. <em>See Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Parker Banana Co., </em>391 So. 2d 762, 763 (Fla. App. 1980); <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Patcraft Mills, Inc., </em>251 Ga. 43, 45, 302 S.E.2d 544 (1983); <em>Olympia Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>326 Minn. 642, 648, 326 N.W.2d 642 (1982); <em>Dupps Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>62 Ohio St. 2d 305, 307-308, 405 N.E.2d 716 (1980); <em>Pabst Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>130 Wis. 2d 291, 296, 387 N.W.2d 121 (1986); see also W. Pierce, \u201cThe Uniform Division of Income for State Tax Purposes,\u201d 35 Taxes (CCH) 747, 780 (1957); contra J. Hellerstein, State and Local Taxation (1983) f 9.17 [1], pp. 584-88.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Finally, the plaintiffs position that \u00a7 12-587, at the time of these transactions, did not purport to impose a gross earnings tax on sales to out-of-state purchasers, finds some support in the 1982 amendment of this provision. Public Acts 1982, No. 82-157, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. In 1982, the legislature enlarged \u00a7 12-587 to include both refiners and distributors within its ambit, but added General Statutes \u00a7 12-587a to allow a tax credit to offset the gross earnings tax upon certification that petroleum products were for resale or use outside the state of Connecticut. The legislative history does not speak directly to the import of the latter addition. There was, however, discussion of the fiscal impact of the amending package as a whole. 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6,1982 Sess., p. 1929, Pt. 12, p. 3989. If the addition of \u00a7 12-587a had been intended as anything other than a procedural implementation of a preexisting understanding of the scope of \u00a7 12-587, it is likely that the fiscal consequences of a substantive change would have surfaced. We are therefore persuaded that, for present purposes, the 1982 amendments clarified the legislature\u2019s intent about the scope of the gross earnings tax in its 1980 version. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-71, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 30. In view of the legislature\u2019s plenary authority to define the scope of tax statutes, the amended \u00a7 12-587 \u201cmust be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act.\u201d <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 246, 377 A.2d 305 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1977 Buick Automobile, </em>196 Conn. 471, 479, 493 A.2d 874 (1985); <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 540-41, 489 A.2d 363 (1985); <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 174, 180, 487 A.2d 181 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 12-587 provides: \u201ctax on GROSS earnings OF petroleum COMPANIES, rate. Any petroleum company which is engaged primarily in the refining and distribution of petroleum products and distributes such products to wholesale and retail dealers for marketing and distribution in this state shall pay a quarterly tax at the rate of two per cent of gross earnings in each taxable quarter derived by such company from the sale of petroleum products in this state. No deduction shall be made from such gross earnings for any commission, rebate or other payment, except a refund resulting from an error or overcharge. Each such company shall, on or before the last day of January, April, July and October of each year, render to the commissioner of revenue services under oath of its treasurer or the person performing the duties of treasurer or of an authorized agent or officer, a return on forms prescribed or furnished by said commissioner, including in respect to such company the amount of gross earnings from the sale of petroleum products within this state for the quarter ending with the last day of the preceding month. The tax imposed under sections 12-587 to 12-602, inclusive, shall be in addition to any other tax imposed by Connecticut with respect to which such company is liable. For purposes of sections 12-587 to 12-602, inclusive, \u2018petroleum products\u2019 includes any product which contains or is made from petroleum or a petroleum derivative and \u2018gross earnings\u2019 are those earnings from the sale of petroleum products to which the sales factor is applied under subdivision (3) of section 12-218 and those earnings from such sales made by any corporation in which any such petroleum company owns not less than twenty-five per cent of the stock of such corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> A related dispute between the parties concerned the taxability, under General Statutes \u00a7 12-587, of moneys collected by the plaintiff as a tax from its customers.
