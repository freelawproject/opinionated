They were convicted and sentenced for those crimes and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>upon, filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus challenging pending parole violation detainers lodged against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>them by the states from which they were transferred. The principal issues raised are: (1) whether the trial court has the authority to dismiss or otherwise amend an out-of-state parole violation warrant lodged against a sentenced prisoner; (2) whether the Uniform Act requires an immediate parole revocation hearing and creates the right to serve the remaining portion of an out-of-state sentence in Connecticut; (3) whether a parolee has a liberty interest in programs requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>decreased security that are affected by an o\u00fct-of-state parole violation detainer; (4) whether liberty interests are violated when a parolee is classified as a maximum security prisoner solely on the basis of a parole violation detainer; (5) whether a parole violation detainer is a true and valid detainer that must be afforded comity; and (6) whether the parole revocation hearing must await the conclusion of the prisoner\u2019s Connecticut sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In the first case, the petitioner, James L. Wheway, Jr., was convicted of robbery in Mississippi. On October 23, 1980, he was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment with execution suspended after seven years to be followed by five years probation. On April 19, 1982, Mississippi authorities granted parole and transferred Wheway\u2019s parole supervision to Connecticut pursuant to the Uniform Act and Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 47-7-71.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 5,1984, police arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Wheway in Wallingford and charged him with robbery. On October 19, 1984, Mississippi authorities lodged a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>violation of parole detainer against Wheway with the Connecticut authorities. On November 30, 1984, the trial court sentenced Wheway to twenty years imprisonment with execution suspended after twelve years for the robbery in Wallingford and five lesser, concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Because of his Mississippi parole violation detainer, Wheway is classified as a maximum security prisoner for the duration of his Connecticut sentence. Thus classified, he is ineligible by reason of the prison\u2019s rules for any early release programs, including furloughs, work release or home release. If the out-of-state parole violation detainer were not pending, Wheway would have been eligible for work release and home release in April, 1989, but as a maximum security prisoner he will not be eligible for release until April 19, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Wheway attempted to have either a parole hearing in Mississippi or a parole hearing in Connecticut, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-136.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mississippi authorities took the position that they will not act on the parole violation detainer until Wheway completes his Connecticut sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">On November 13,1987, Wheway filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Wheway alleged, inter alia, that he had a right to an immediate parole revocation hearing on the Mississippi parole violation detainer because his liberty interest in the conditions and length of his confinement would otherwise be violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>On October 3, 1988, the trial court, <em>Axelrod, J., </em>granted Wheway\u2019s petition and entered an order quashing the parole violation detainer unless, within ninety days, Mississippi authorities afforded Wheway a parole revocation hearing in Connecticut. The respondent warden thereupon appealed to the Appellate Court, and Wheway cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In the second case, the petitioner, John A. Graham, was convicted and imprisoned in Ohio. In February, 1982, Ohio authorities granted him parole and in August, 1982, transferred Graham\u2019s parole supervision to Connecticut pursuant to the Uniform Act. See footnote 1, supra. On February 14, 1983, police arrested Graham and charged him with crimes in Connecticut. On March 4, 1983, Ohio authorities declared the petitioner to be a parole violator and issued a warrant for his arrest that remains lodged against him as a detainer. On November 19, 1983, Graham was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment based upon his convictions for the Connecticut crimes. Without disposing of the alleged parole violation, he is unable to qualify for prison programs involving reduced levels of security.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On October 27, 1986, Graham filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition alleged, inter alia, the right to an immediate parole revocation hearing either in Connecticut or Ohio. On February 4,1988, the habeas court, <em>Santos, J., </em>denied Graham\u2019s petition. Graham appealed to the Appellate Court where the matter was consolidated with the Wheway appeal. We thereafter transferred both matters to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">In <em>Wheway, </em>the warden first claims that the trial court is without authority to quash, dismiss, strike or otherwise issue an order with respect to an out-of-state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>parole violation warrant lodged as a detainer against a sentenced prisoner. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">With respect to this issue, the habeas court concluded \u201cthat it has the authority to dismiss the detainer lodged if it appears that the detainer itself is subject to dismissal in Mississippi or if it violates the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d The habeas court relied upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>203 Conn. 494, 525 A.2d 502 (1987), in reaching its conclusion. <em>Remick </em>involved the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 54-186. In <em>Remick </em>we noted that the purpose of the IAD was \u201c \u2018to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and <em>all detainers </em>based on <em>untried indictments, informations or complaints </em>. . . . \u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d (Additional emphasis added.) <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The IAD also provides that failure to comply with the agreement\u2019s speedy trial provisions can nullify the effect of the detainer: \u201cIf the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the <em>indictment, information or complaint </em>on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided . . . the appropriate court of jurisdiction where the <em>indictment, information or complaint </em>has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, Art. V(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The United States Supreme Court, however, in <em>Carchman </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>473 U.S. 716, 105 S. Ct. 3401, 87 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1985), concluded that detainers based upon probation or parole violation warrants are <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>based on \u201cuntried indictments, informations or complaints\u201d; <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 500; and therefore are not subject to disposition under the IAD. \u201cAdoption of the [IAD] was motivated in part by a practice of filing detainers based on untried criminal charges that had little basis. These detainers often would be withdrawn shortly before the prisoner was released. Even though unsubstantiated, the detainers would have a detrimental effect on the prisoner\u2019s treatment. Article III enables a prisoner to require the state lodging the detainer either to drop the charge and resulting detainer or to bring the prisoner to trial. In this way, the prisoner can clear his record of unsubstantiated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u201cA probation-violation detainer, however, generally . . . will be based on the prisoner\u2019s commission of the crimes that resulted in his conviction and incarceration in the sending State. Because the convictions conclusively establish the probation-violation, see <em>Morrisey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. [471, 490, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972)] (parole revocation hearing), the probation-violation charge will not be unsubstantiated. Thus, the abuses that in part motivated the adoption of the [IAD] generally do not occur in the context of probation-violation detainers.\u201d <em>Carchman </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>supra, 730-31. We find the <em>Carchman </em>rationale persuasive and conclude, therefore, that neither <em>Remick, </em>\u2022the IAD, nor the Uniform Act serves as a basis for the habeas court\u2019s order conditionally quashing the Mississippi detainer and that it was therefore without authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Even apart from the habeas court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, the warden challenges the court\u2019s predicate conclusion that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-133 and 54-136 \u201ccreate a liberty interest in having a Mississippi parole revocation hearing held in Connecticut and serving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>remaining Mississippi parole sentence in Connecticut.\u201d We agree with the warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Section 54-136 provides: <em>\u201cAll persons confined . </em>. . <em>pursuant to the provisions of sections 54-132 to 54-138, </em>inclusive, shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner. The fact of incarceration or reincarceration in a receiving state shall not deprive any person so incarcerated or reincarcerated of any rights which such person would have had if incarcerated or reincarcerated in an appropriate institution of the sending state . . . [and] the hearing or hearings, if any, to which a parolee or probationer may be entitled, prior to incarceration or reincarceration, by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate judicial or administrative officers of the receiving state. In this event, said judicial and administrative officers shall act as agents of the sending state after consultation with appropriate officers of the sending state.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The petitioner\u2019s claim that he has a statutory right to an immediate parole revocation hearing under the foregoing statute overlooks that fact that he is not a person <em>\u201cconfined . . . pursuant to the provisions of sections 54-132 to 54-138, inclusive. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The petitioner has been convicted of a crime committed in Connecticut. He is confined under a commitment mittimus pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-97<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cconfined . .-. <em>pursuant to the provisions of sections 54-132 to 54-138, inclusive. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, the provisions of \u00a7 54-136 do not presently apply to him and cannot furnish a basis for a claim to an immediate parole violation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In response to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he is entitled to serve the balance of the Mississippi sentence in Connecticut and in further response to his claim to an immediate parole revocation hearing, we observe that \u00a7 54-133 addresses both issues. It provides: \u201c[I]f, at the time when a state shall seek to retake a probationer or parolee, there shall be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he shall be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, <em>he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-133 (a) (3). This language clearly contemplates: (1) a return to the sending state; and (2) parole revocation proceedings that shall be subsequent to any \u201cimprisonment for such offense.\u201d Thus, contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertion and the habeas court\u2019s conclusion, we find that a detained parole violator is neither entitled to an immediate parole revocation hearing while incarcerated for subsequent Connecticut convictions nor entitled to serve the balance of any out-of-state prison terms in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In his cross appeal, Wheway first argues that the habeas court erred in failing to conclude that his constitutionally protected liberty interests in his conditions of confinement were violated by his classification as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>a maximum security prisoner solely on the basis of the parole violation detainer. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The habeas court found that at the Connecticut Correctional Institution at Somers, conditions of confinement involving the granting of furloughs, work release, home release, education release, home visits, etc., are governed by the Inmate Handbook of Regulations and Programs. The granting or denial of the various types of furloughs is entirely discretionary with prison authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\"><em>In Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 97 S. Ct. 274, 50 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1976), a federal parolee who was imprisoned for federal crimes committed while he was on parole filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He claimed a violation of his constitutionally protected liberty interest by reason of his being denied a prompt hearing on his pending parole revocation. The court concluded that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment did not mandate an immediate parole revocation hearing. Id., 86. The <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett </em>rationale was thereafter extended to circumstances similar to those found here, i.e., to parole violation warrants lodged as detainers by one state with prison authorities of another state. <em>See Heath </em>v. <em>United States Parole Commission, </em>788 F.2d 85 (2d Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The <em>Moody </em>court established the further proposition that not every state action that carries adverse consequences for prison inmates automatically implicates or effectuates a due process right. Prison classification and eligibility for various rehabilitation programs, wherein prison officials have full discretion to control those conditions of confinement, do not create a statutory or constitutional entitlement sufficient to invoke due process. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>supra, 88-89 n.9; see also <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451, reh. denied, 429 U.S. 24, 97 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>191, 50 L. Ed. 2d 191 (1976). In order for Wheway\u2019s conditions of confinement to qualify as a constitutionally protected \u201cliberty,\u201d the interest must be one that is assured by either statute, judicial decree or regulation. See <em>Wolff v. McDonald, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557-59, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974). Wheway must demonstrate that the conditions of confinement in question are not matters that prison officials have full discretion to control. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>supra; <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>supra, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Because the prison authorities have full discretion to grant or deny the early release programs that would relieve Wheway from his confinement, he does not have a legitimate statutory or constitutional entitlement sufficient to invoke due process considerations. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>supra, 88 n.9. We have recently so held under similar circumstances in <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>213 Conn. 38, 48-49, 566 A.2d 663 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Wheway finally claims that his parole violation detainer is not a \u201ctrue\u201d detainer, is not entitled to comity, and therefore should be stricken from his record. Specifically, he claims that since the Mississippi authorities have neither taken custody of him nor revoked his parole, the request for comity \u201chas been totally abused by Mississippi.\u201d Wheway furnishes no authority for this unique claim nor does our research disclose any legal basis for such a claim. Accordingly, we find it to be without merit. See <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>supra, 80 n.2; see also <em>Carchman </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>supra, 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">In <em>Graham, </em>the petitioner argues on appeal that the trial court erred: (1) in following <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>supra, and holding that he had no right to a parole revocation hearing until his Connecticut sentence was con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>eluded; and (2) in concluding that it did not have the authority to strike the detainer from his record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Ohio Administrative Code \u00a7 5120:1-1-19 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(2) The hearing for a releasee who has been convicted in a state other than the State of Ohio, and is being returned as a violator, shall be held within a reasonable period of time <em>after his return to confinement </em>within the boundaries of the state of Ohio.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 54-133 (a) (3) provides that \u201cif, at the time when a state shall seek to retake a probationer or parolee, there shall be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he shall be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, <em>he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The language of Ohio\u2019s corresponding statute is virtually identical. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5149.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">It is clear that Ohio, like Mississippi and Connecticut, follows <em>Moody. </em>Ohio authorities delay the final revocation hearing until the intervening sentence is completed and the parolee is returned to Ohio. Here, the Ohio authorities, like their Mississippi counterparts in <em>Wheway, </em>have not requested the return of the parole violator before the expiration of his Connecticut sentence. Also, as in <em>Wheway, </em>Connecticut authorities have not given and do not currently plan to consent to the parole violator\u2019s return to the receiving state until his term of imprisonment in Connecticut expires. Ohio authorities, like their Mississippi counterparts in <em>Wheway, </em>ask only that the necessary arrangements be made for the transfer of the parole violator when Connecticut is willing to release him from its custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Graham also argues, as did Wheway, that the Uniform Act specifically provides that he cannot be deprived of any rights that would be reserved to him in the sending state by reason of his incarceration in Connecticut. We find Graham\u2019s claim no more persuasive then we did Wheway\u2019s. Ohio Administrative Code \u00a7 5120:1-1-19 (2) does not grant Graham any right to return to Ohio during the pendency of his Connecticut imprisonment for the purpose of a disposition of his parole violation warrant. As in <em>Wheway, </em>any dispute over when the parole violator may be entitled to a final parole revocation hearing can only be resolved when the parole violator is returned to the sending state at the conclusion of his Connecticut sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Like Wheway, Graham also argues that he has an absolute right to have his out-of-state sentence run concurrently with his Connecticut sentence. We are equally unpersuaded. Ohio Revised Code Annotated \u00a7 2967.15 provides that \u201c[a] convict who has been conditionally pardoned or a prisoner who has been paroled, who in the judgment of the adult parole authority, has violated the conditions of his pardon or parole shall be declared a violator. In such case, the time from the date of the declared violation of his pardon or parole to the date he becomes available for return to the institution <em>shall not be counted as a part of time or sentence served. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cAs has been pointed out many times, the period during which one is at large as a parole violator is not credited on one\u2019s sentence. <em>Cline </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 480, [196 N.E.2d 440,] 26 O.O. 2d 91; <em>Smouse </em>v. <em>Perini, </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. (2d) 13, [242 N.E.2d 340,] 45 O.O. (2d) 261.\u201d <em>Hignite </em>v. <em>Cardwell, </em>22 Ohio St. 2d 146, 147, 258 N.E.2d 443 (1970). \u201cA parole violator, in Ohio, does not begin to serve the continuation of his sentence until he is returned to a penal institution under order of the parole board.\u201d <em>Stepp </em>v. <em>Lutz, </em>348 F.2d 466, 467 (6th Cir. 1965). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201cUnder the law of Ohio, the time required for the petitioner to serve his sentence ... is extended by the amount of time lost on parole when he [is] not available to be returned to the Ohio authorities.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>366 F.2d 765, 766-67 (6th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Graham\u2019s last claim is that the trial court has the authority to and should strike the detainer from his record. We examined and rejected this same claim in <em>Wheway, </em>supra, and for the reasons discussed therein we again conclude that the trial court is without such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In the first case, the judgment is reversed as to the issues on the appeal and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to deny the petition; the judgment is affirmed as to the issues on the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">In the second case, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-14\"> \u201c[Connecticut General Statutes] Sec. 54-132. definitions.
