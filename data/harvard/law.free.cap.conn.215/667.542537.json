Following a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant then entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and on June 30, 1988, he was sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>The defendant appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress to the Appellate Court. On October 24, 1989, the Appellate Court held that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress because the police had arrested him without probable cause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>20 Conn. App. 168, 181-82, 565 A.2d 542 (1989). On November 29, 1989, this court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court err in concluding that the police had an insufficient basis for relying upon the information furnished by the informant and, therefore, lacked probable cause for the arrest and subsequent search of the defendant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The following facts were adduced at the suppression hearing. At approximately 8 p.m. on October 28,1987, the Tri-Town Narcotics Task Force* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> executed a search warrant at the South Windsor condominium of Brian Cowell and Lydia Cameron. Cameron was interrogated at the condominium and told the police that Cowell had been dealing drugs for about one year and that his supplier was a man named George Velez from Hartford. After being taken to the police station, Cowell told the police that he was a drug dealer and that George Velez from Hartford was his supplier. Furthermore, Cowell told the police where, in his condominium, they could find his \u201cstash\u201d of two ounces of cocaine that he claimed to have purchased from the defendant earlier that day. The police then found Cowell\u2019s \u201cstash\u201d in a locked tool box located behind a fake wall in his closet. Cowell gave the police the combination to the lock on the tool box, and they found the cocaine inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>At the request of the police, Cowell then agreed to set up a narcotics transaction with the defendant for later that night. Using a special \u201cclear line\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at the South Windsor police department, Cowell placed a call to the defendant\u2019s home telephone. Cowell told the police that the person who answered the telephone told him that the defendant was not at home, but might be at DePortivo\u2019s, a social club in Hartford. Cowell then called DePortivo\u2019s, asked for the defendant, and after a short delay asked the person to whom he was speaking if he could purchase some \u201ctickets.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The person on the phone told Cowell that he would call him back. Cowell told the police that the person with whom he had spoken was the defendant. When no return call was received, Cowell placed a second call to the defendant at the club. Following this call, Cowell told the police that the defendant would be appearing at a local 7-Eleven convenience store in approximately twenty minutes, with one ounce of cocaine to sell. Cowell also said that the defendant was having mechanical problems with his car, and therefore would probably arrive in another car. Cowell described the defendant as a forty to forty-five year old Hispanic male, who was pudgy, balding and sporting a beard. In addition, while Cowell was at the police station, the police at his condominium verified that the phone numbers that Cowell dialed were listed in his address book as those belonging to the defendant and to DePortivo\u2019s respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The police set up surveillance at the 7-Eleven store in unmarked police cars, and Cowell remained in one of the cars that was parked across the street from the store. At the designated meeting time, a blue car containing two Hispanic males drove into the parking lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>and parked in front of the store. Cowell told the officers that the blue car appeared to be that of the defendant\u2019s brother. The passenger in the blue car, who matched Cowell\u2019s description of the defendant, exited the car and walked into the store. Cowell tentatively-identified this person as the defendant. One of the police officers then left his surveillance vehicle and entered the store to observe the suspect more closely. After satisfying himself that the suspect fit the description of the defendant, the officer returned to his surveillance post, observing along the way the registration number of the blue car. Using a public telephone next to his car, the officer called police headquarters and was informed that the blue car was registered to Felix Velez, whom Cowell had previously stated was the defendant\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">After purchasing some food items, the defendant emerged from the store and got back into the blue car, which began to drive out of the lot. An unmarked police car then blocked its path, and officers wearing badges on chains around their necks and shouting \u201cpolice\u201d began to converge on the car. The car was then quickly shifted into reverse and began to back up. An officer, however, reached into the car, opened the driver\u2019s side door, took the car out of gear, and pried the driver\u2019s hand from the shifter. Both occupants were then removed from the car and searched. The driver of the car was identifed as Felix Velez and the passenger identified himself as George Velez. The search of the defendant\u2019s person produced two packages of cocaine, one containing approximately one ounce and the other one or two grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On the basis of this evidence, the trial court found that the defendant had been \u201carrested\u201d when the car was stopped and he was removed therefrom. It found further that, at the time of the arrest, the police had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>probable cause to believe that the defendant was in possession of narcotics with intent to sell, and therefore the search of the defendant\u2019s person was lawfully conducted incident to the arrest. The state now argues on appeal that the trial court correctly determined that probable cause existed at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, and therefore, the Appellate Court should not have overturned the trial court\u2019s ruling. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\u201cIt is an established rule that a properly conducted warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest is not illegal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>161 Conn. 371, 373, 288 A.2d 439 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1017, 92 S. Ct. 677, 30 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>150 Conn. 488, 492, 191 A.2d 253 (1963); 4 Wharton, Criminal Evidence \u00a7 725 (13th Ed.). In order for the search to be legal, however, the arrest itself must be valid. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>supra, 375; 4 Wharton, loe. cit. Section [54-If] of the General Statutes authorizes a police officer to arrest, without a warrant, \u2018any person who such officer has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or is committing a felony.\u2019 \u2018Reasonable grounds\u2019 is to be equated with probable cause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>supra, 376; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>153 Conn. 39, 41, 212 A.2d 75 (1965). Probable cause means more than mere suspicion. There must be facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has trustworthy information, sufficient to justify the belief of a reasonable person that an offense has been or is being committed. <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S. Ct. 223, 13 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1964); <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1949).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Penland, </em>174 Conn. 153, 155, 384 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 2237, 56 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 233, 496 A.2d 498 (1985), we concluded that article first, \u00a7 7, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Connecticut constitution \u2018affords more substantive protection to citizens than does the fourth amendment to the federal constitution in the determination of probable cause.\u2019 Accordingly, we held that the determination of probable cause under article first, \u00a7 7, is to be examined under the two-prong analysis of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, rather than under the less strict \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 analysis set out in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983). <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 235-36; see <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969); <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 228, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990). Under this test, the sufficiency of the information that is derived from an informant depends upon the existence of (1) the informant\u2019s <em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d </em>about the information provided, and (2) the underlying facts establishing his <em>\u201cveracity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 224-25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>205 Conn. 560, 566-67, 534 A.2d 1165 (1987). Furthermore, the reviewing court should pay great deference to the trial court\u2019s determination regarding the existence of probable cause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 222, 226, 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In the present case, we hold that the trial court was correct in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support both prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. The \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong \u201cexamines the information provided by the informant to determine if it \u2018relate[s] sufficient facts from which a judge reasonably could conclude that the [informant] based [his] allegations of criminal activity on sufficient underlying circumstances.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonaco, </em>[194 Conn. 331, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>339, 481 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036, 105 S. Ct. 511, 83 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 566. Cowell\u2019s information was not based upon hearsay or unsubstantiated rumor. Rather, he clearly had first-hand information concerning the identity of his source. Therefore, the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong was satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As for the \u201cveracity\u201d prong, it may be satisfied by establishing that the informant was credible or that his information was reliable. Id., 567. Two common factors used to evaluate the reliability of an untested informant\u2019s tip are: (1) declarations against penal interest by the informant-declarant; and (2) corroboration of the information by police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>185 Conn. 104, 113, 440 A.2d 841 (1981). Cowell\u2019s admission that he was a drug dealer and that he had purchased cocaine from the defendant earlier that day, as well as his statement concerning the location of his hidden \u201cstash\u201d of cocaine are all declarations against penal interest. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 368-69, 441 A.2d 98 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>supra, 114-15. \u201cCourts have generally subscribed to the view that admissions against penal interest by an informant \u2018carry their own indicia of credibility\u2014sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1971); 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3, p. 523. This principle has been applied by this court to find adequate verification of the reliability of an informant\u2019s naming of other participants in a crime where at least some significant details of his account of the crime itself have been corroborated independently . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>189 Conn. 717, 722, 458 A.2d 1147 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In the present case, the following aspects of Cowell\u2019s statement to the police were independently corroborated. The location at which Cowell claimed he had hidden the cocaine that he had allegedly purchased from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the defendant earlier in the day was accurate and verified by the police. Cameron corroborated Cowell\u2019s statement that he was a drug dealer and that his supplier was George Velez. The police discovered the name \u201cGeorge Velez\u201d and phone numbers at which to reach him in Cowell\u2019s personal pocket address book found in his condominium. The police observed Cowell dialing these phone numbers, heard him ask for George Velez and listened as he arranged a drug transaction with a person whom he claimed was the defendant. The defendant arrived at the specified time at the purchase site as a passenger in a car that was not his own, as Cowell claimed he would. Cowell tentatively identified the defendant as George Velez, and the police independently verified that the defendant fit the description that Cowell had provided earlier. Finally, the police independently verified that the car in which the defendant arrived belonged to Felix Velez, who Cowell had previously stated was the defendant\u2019s brother. In sum, although it is a close call, we conclude that there was enough corroborative evidence available to the police to satisfy the \u201cveracity prong\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 21a-278.
