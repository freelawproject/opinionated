The plaintiff protested the assessment, which protest the defendant rejected. The plaintiff thereafter sought de novo judicial review of the assessment.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case was tried to a state trial referee who rendered judgment for the defendant and dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We subsequently transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reveals the following facts. The plaintiff is a manufacturer. of printed circuit boards for the automotive and computer industries. By-products generated by the plaintiff\u2019s manufacturing activity are classified as \u201chazardous waste.\u201d These by-product wastes are transported off-site and are then either disposed of in a regulated facility or recycled and resold in their reprocessed state. Federal and state statutes and regulations require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>generators of hazardous waste, such as the plaintiff, prepare a manifest that lists all hazardous waste substances shipped from their facilities. Pursuant to \u00a7 22a-132, the defendant assessed the plaintiff for taxes on the hazardous waste products for which the plaintiff had filed a manifest for the period March, 1983, through December 31, 1984. Upon the defendant\u2019s rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s protest of the assessment, the plaintiff instituted the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The plaintiff challenged at trial the constitutionality of \u00a7 22a-132. The plaintiff first argued that the statute was violative of the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions, because it taxed some but not all hazardous substances, thereby creating classifications that bear no rational relationship to the statute\u2019s stated purpose. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that by taxing substances deemed to be \u201chazardous waste\u201d and not taxing other \u201chazardous substances,\u201d the statute creates an unconstitutionally underinclusive classification. The plaintiff claimed in the alternative that because the statute taxes all hazardous wastes, including the wastes that are recycled and reintroduced into the stream of commerce, the statute operates in an arbitrary and capricious manner and is thereby violative of the due process and equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The court concluded that \u00a7 22a-132 was not unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied to the plaintiff. The court\u2019s decision was based on the premise that, notwithstanding the express revenue raising provisions of \u00a7 22a-132, the purpose of the statute was \u201cclearly for regulation and not for revenue.\u201d The court stated that regulation pursuant to the police power \u201cis not subject to the constitutional restrictions applicable to the taxing power.\u201d The policy of the state, according to the court, is to control and manage hazardous waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>from the time of its generation until the time of its safe disposition. Accordingly, the court stated that \u201c[hazardous waste is a subject of compelling state interest in the exercise of its police power in duly safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of the people.\u201d The court gave no credence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the classification in \u00a7 22a-132 was underinclusive in its coverage, stating that there is \u201cno fundamental right to endanger the public health or safety or to pollute the environment, and that it would be repugnant to reason and justice to maintain that one party is justified in doing so because another party is doing likewise.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[a]s regards a generator of hazardous waste there is no reasonable distinction between the hazardous waste that ultimately is disposed of in a regulated land-fill, and the hazardous waste that proceeds to recycling or reclamation. The actual or potential hazard is present in both processes, and the classification is consistent and has a rational relationship to the state and legislative purpose of Chapter 445 of the general statutes in safeguarding the health and safety of the public and safety and welfare of the environment.\u201d The court then concluded that the statute created no unreasonable classification so as to deny the plaintiff its constitutional rights. The plaintiff did not move the trial court under Practice Book \u00a7 4051 to articulate its memorandum of decision concerning its conclusory statements of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">On appeal the plaintiff challenges: (1) the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 22a-132, in taxing \u201chazardous wastes\u201d but not other \u201chazardous substances,\u201d does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions; (2) the court\u2019s failure to address whether the classification established in \u00a7 22a-132 has any rational relation to the expressed revenue raising purpose of \u00a7 22a-132; and (3) the court\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u00a7 22a-132, by taxing all hazardous waste entered on a manifest, including that sent for recycling, does not violate the due process and equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. We consider the first and second claims combined to constitute only one issue and will treat them accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We turn first to the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 22a-132 establishes an unconstitutional classification in violation of the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of its claim, the plaintiff refers to the following testimony presented at trial. The plaintiff purchases various raw or virgin chemical materials from suppliers to accomplish the plating and etching operations that are part of its manufacturing process. These chemicals are classified under federal statute and regulations as \u201chazardous materials\u201d in that they exhibit one or more of the standard characteristics of such materials: corrosivity, toxicity, reactivity and ignitability. New chemical byproducts are produced by the plaintiffs manufacturing process. These by-products are classified as \u201chazardous waste\u201d under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. The plaintiff presented testimony at trial indicating that many of the characteristics of \u201chazardous waste\u201d are identical to \u201chazardous materials.\u201d The plaintiffs expert testified that in their original form, the hazardous materials supplied to the plaintiff were as dangerous or more so than the hazardous waste produced by the plaintiff. This testimony was unrefuted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>As the plaintiff correctly points out, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-132, a generator of \u201chazardous waste\u201d incurs a tax when it includes that waste on a manifest, while a producer of hazardous materials, not subject to the manifest requirement, is not assessed such a tax. The plaintiff argues that the history of \u00a7 22a-132 and its terms disclose that the purpose of the statute is to provide funds for the emergency spill response fund<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> established under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>22a-451, however, is concerned not only with hazardous waste, but with a variety of matters wholly unrelated to such waste. The plaintiff claims, therefore, that the practical effect of \u00a7 22a-132 is to assess a generator of hazardous waste for a fund that pays for the clean-up of numerous substances produced and shipped by parties who escape taxation completely. Accordingly, the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 22a-132 is violative of equal protection. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">We note at the outset that we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 22a-132 is primarily a regulatory statute. Regulation of the management and disposal of hazardous waste is controlled by an intricate web of interrelated state and federal laws and regulations. Although enforcement of the waste assessment may have an incidental regulatory fallout, we conclude that \u00a7 22a-132 is primarily a tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In order to analyze the constitutionality of this statute, we must first detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. \u201c \u2018When a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds, whether under the United States constitution or the Connecticut constitution, the reviewing court must first determine the standard by which the challenged statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined. If, in distinguishing between classes, the statute either intrudes on the exercise of a fundamental right or burdens a suspect class of persons, the court will apply a strict scrutiny standard wherein the state must demonstrate that the challenged statute is necessary to the achievement of a compelling state interest. <em>In re Griffiths, </em>413 U.S. 717, 721, 93 S.

If the statute does not touch upon either a fundamental right or a suspect class, its classification need only be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose in order to withstand an equal protection challenge. <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 767, 97 S.

For our purposes here the test is the same under both the federal and state constitutions. <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>supra, 314; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 639, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).\u2019 <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 596-99, 479 A.2d 793 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u201cMoreover, there is \u2018the established principle that those who challenge the constitutionality of a state statute bear the heavy burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the presumption of its validity has been overcome. See, e.g., <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 486, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L.

A party challenging a tax statute on the grounds of equal protection bears an even greater burden because \u201c[a]s this court emphasized in <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 487, quoting <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 88, 60 S. Ct. 406, 84 L. Ed. 590 [1940], \u2018 \u201cin taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification. Since the members of a legislature necessarily enjoy a familiarity with local conditions which [the United States Supreme] Court cannot have, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>[173 Conn. 506, 509-10, 378 A.2d 572 (1977), appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1057, 98 S. Ct. 1226, 55 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978)]. Nonetheless, even for the purposes of taxation, the legislature does not have an unlimited power to create classifications. The classifications that it selects cannot be arbitrary but \u201c \u2018must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Allied Stores </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>358 U.S. 522, 527, 79 S.

Recognizing that any plan of taxation necessarily has some discriminatory impact; <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>[supra, 41]; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 641; we have previously stated the operative test for the validity of a tax statute to be the following: \u201c \u2018As long as some <em>conceivable </em>rational basis for the difference exists, \u201ca classification is not offensive merely because it is not made with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>mathematical nicety.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) (Citations omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 640-41.\u2019 <em>Gunther </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>195 Conn. 284, 291-92, 487 A.2d 1080 (1985).\u201d <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>208 Conn. 505, 508-11, 544 A.2d 1221 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">It is undisputed that \u00a7 22a-132 provides for an assessment against a generator of hazardous waste required to file a manifest, while not extending that assessment to generators or shippers of \u201chazardous material\u201d not subject to the manifest requirement. We are thus faced with the question of whether there is any conceivable rational basis for this classification. We look first to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 22a-114 which states the policy underlying chapter 445, entitled \u201cHazardous Waste\u201d: \u201cLegislative finding; policy of the state. The general assembly finds that improper management of hazardous wastes has contaminated the water, soil and air of the state thereby threatening the health and safety of Connecticut citizens; that the economic benefits to the state from industry are jeopardized if hazardous waste disposal facilities are not available in Connecticut; that the safe management of hazardous wastes, including state involvement, is mandated by the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 USC 6901 et seq.) and implementing regulations; that the siting of hazardous waste disposal facilities is in the best interest of Connecticut\u2019s citizens and that the public should participate in siting decisions. Therefore the general assembly declares that it is the policy of the state to assure the siting of hazardous waste disposal facilities so that the health and safety of Connecticut\u2019s citizens and the environmental and economic interests of the state are protected. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process for the siting of hazardous waste facilities that will protect the health and safety of Connecticut citizens and assure responsible economic development and to have that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>siting process be at least as strict as that required by federal law.\u201d We also note that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-115 (1) states that \u201c \u2018[hjazardous waste\u2019 means any waste material, except by-product material, source material . . . which may pose a present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly disposed of, treated, stored, transported, or otherwise managed . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The finding of the general assembly as articulated in \u00a7 22a-114 forcefully attributes the contamination of the water, soil and air of the state, threatening the health and safety of Connecticut citizens, to hazardous wastes. No mention is made in this powerful statement of state policy of any such threat to our citizens from hazardous materials. It is clear that this policy <em>deliberately </em>did not extend to hazardous materials, because the definition of \u201chazardous waste\u201d contained in \u00a7 22a-115 specifically excludes from that definition \u201csource material.\u201d It is also of significance that those persons required, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-132 (a), to pay the assessment include a broad spectrum of those involved in the handling of hazardous waste: (1) a generator of hazardous waste required to file a manifest, such as the plaintiff in this case; (2) a treatment facility required to file a manifest for hazardous wastes resulting from their treatment process; and (3) a generator of hazardous waste shipping that waste to treatment or disposal facilities located in the state. The entire statutory construct concerns environmental contamination that may arise from hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We need look only to the plaintiff\u2019s brief to ascertain a very evident conceivable rational basis for the distinction between hazardous wastes and hazardous materials. The plaintiff states that \u201c[t]he underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>purpose of the manifest requirement is simply to enable state and federal regulatory bodies to track individual shipments of hazardous waste \u2018to assure that\u2019 such shipments are \u2018designated for treatment, storage or disposal in, and arrive at . . . facilities . . . for which a permit has been issued.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6922 (5). See also 45 Fed. Reg. 86969 (Dec. 31, 1980) (amending 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 262.10 and \u00a7 264.71).\u201d Additionally, the plaintiff states that \u201cthe only possible justification for singling out hazardous wastes apart from hazardous material for special regulation would be the special risk inherent in substances that are discarded: dumping into sites which lack proper permits or which otherwise lack controls to prevent or minimize long term harm to the environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The need to \u201ctrack\u201d shipments of hazardous waste to assure that they end up in a licensed treatment facility is obviously based on the economic reality that the cost of the properly regulated disposal of such'waste may encourage producers of the waste to seek illegal disposal methods with resultant environmental damage to the state and its citizens. We take judicial notice of widespread disastrous instances of such illegal disposal within this state and throughout the nation. By contrast, as the plaintiff admits, the manifest requirements do not apply to hazardous materials, not designated as \u201cwastes,\u201d since such shipments are made for commercial or industrial use. The economic pressure tempting producers of hazardous waste to \u201ccut corners\u201d in its disposal simply do not apply to shippers of materials, though hazardous, that are being shipped for commercial or industrial use. Rather, economic common sense dictates that hazardous materials be delivered to the intended users undamaged in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The legislature, in enacting \u00a7 22a-132, allocated liability for funding of the emergency spill response fund to those parties whose production of hazardous wastes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>contributes to the contamination of the water, soil and air of the state. Stephen Hitchcock, director of hazardous materials management of the Connecticut department of environmental protection, in commenting on the bill which became \u00a7 22a-132, stated that the proposed bill was a good one because \u201ccosts associated with hazardous wastes should be paid by those producing the waste.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Environment, Pt. 4,1982 Sess., p. 794. This basis for the classification contained in this statute accords entirely with the legislative finding concerning hazardous waste set forth in \u00a7 22a-114.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">As we stated previously, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he broad discretion as to classification possessed by a legislature in the field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of taxation has long been recognized. . . . [T]he passage of time has only served to underscore the wisdom of that recognition of the large area of discretion which is needed by a legislature in formulating sound tax policies. . . . \u201d <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>[supra, 87-88].\u2019 <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 40-41. . . . \u2018It is established that a distinction in legislation is not arbitrary, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, and the existence of that state of facts <em>at the time the law was enacted </em>must be assumed. <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S.

The actual or potential hazard is present in both processes, and the classification is consistent and has a rational relationship to the state and legislative purpose of Chapter 445 of the general statutes in safeguarding the health and safety of the public and safety and welfare of the environment.\u201d We conclude that the legislature could well have determined that the danger of dumping hazardous waste on the way to a legitimate recycling operation justified the imposition of the hazardous waste assessment on such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>shipments as well as wastes otherwise disposed of.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the application of the assessment to the plaintiffs reclaimed wastes is so connected to the general purposes of hazardous waste management in Connecticut that it does not violate the equal protection or due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-132 provides in pertinent part: \u201chazardous waste assessment, (a) There shall be paid to the commissioner of revenue services by (1) a generator of hazardous waste required to file a manifest pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), as from time to time amended, and regulations adopted by the department of environmental protection, (2) a treatment facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>required to file a manifest for hazardous wastes resulting from their treatment process and (3) a generator of hazardous waste shipping hazardous waste to treatment or disposal facilities located in the state, an assessment of (A) five cents per gallon of metal hydroxide sludge from wastewater treatment of electroplating or metal finishing operations and six cents per gallon of any other hazardous waste entered on a manifest in gallons, (B) one-half of one cent per pound of metal hydroxide sludge from wastewater treatment of electroplating or metal finishing operations and three-quarters of one cent per pound of any other hazardous waste entered on a manifest in pounds or (C) ten dollars per cubic yard of metal hydroxide sludge from wastewater treatment of electroplating or metal finishing operations and twelve dollars for any other hazardous waste entered on a manifest in cubic yards. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">This statute was amended, effective July 3, 1989, by No. 89-365 of the 1989 Public Acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-33 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny town or company aggrieved by the action of the commissioner [of revenue services] may, within one month from the time of such action, make application in the nature of an appeal therefrom to the superior court of the judicial district in which such applicant is located, which shall be accompanied by a citation to said commissioner to appear before said court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in part: \u201cNo state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Similarly, article first, \u00a7 20 of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law <em>. \u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-132 (d) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe revenue collected in accordance with this section shall be deposited in the emergency spill response fund established under section 22a-451\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451 (d) provides: \u201cThere is established a revolving fund to be known as the emergency spill response fund, for the purpose of providing money for (1) the containment and removal or mitigation of the discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage of filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes including the state share of payments of the costs of remedial action pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 USC 9601 et seq.), as amended;

In <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 446, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985), the court found that the application of a zoning regulation to a proposed group home for the mentally retarded violated the applicant\u2019s equal protection rights because there was not a rational basis for treating such housing differently than other care and multiple dwelling facilities. The court concluded that the regulation \u201cappears to us to rest on an irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded . . . .\u201d Id., 450. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 23, 105 S. Ct. 2465, 86 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1985), the court invalidated a Vermont automobile use tax, because it was applied arbitrarily. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>710 F. Sup. 352, 356 (D.D.C. 1989), the court found a regulation prohibiting the issuance of vending permits to bootblacks, while allowing such permits for other street vendors, unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The court, applying the rational basis test, could find no plausible connection between the uniqueness of a bootblack and the purpose of the law. Finally, <em>in Long Island Lighting Co. </em>v. <em>Cuomo, </em>666 F. Sup. 370, 422 (N.D.N.Y. 1987), appeal dismissed, 888 F.2d 230 (2d Cir. 1989), the court found that the application of a restriction to a power company\u2019s rate base that applied only to privately owned utilities which were sole owners of a nuclear power plant and not to nuclear power plants owned by more than one party, when measured against the purposes of the statute, was \u201cso under-inclusive that it must be deemed irrational\u201d and hence a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection rights. Id., 423. The present case is clearly distinguishable in that we have articulated the rational relationship between the classification challenged and the purpose of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> During the relevant tax period, approximately 53 percent of the plaintiff\u2019s manifested hazardous waste was returned to the stream of commerce after reprocessing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b328-14\"> Public Acts 1989, No. 89-365, \u00a7 4, effective July 5,1989, amended General Statutes \u00a7 22a-132 to provide that any hazardous waste that is recycled shall not be subject to assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
