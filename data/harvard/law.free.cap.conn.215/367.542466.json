We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The plaintiff, O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. (landlord), sought to take possession of apartment C-6 located at 61 Willard Street in Hartford, from the defendants, Josefa Rodriguez, Priscilla Quinones and Samuel Melendez (tenants). In the first count of the revised complaint, the landlord sought possession against Rodriguez and Melendez based on a lapse of time. The second count, directed solely against Quinones, sought possession for unauthorized occupancy. Judgment of default was entered against Melendez. The other tenants, Rodriguez and Quinones, denied the essential allegations of the revised complaint and interposed a special defense claiming that Quinones was a protected tenant under \u00a7 47a-23c.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The facts found by the trial court as reflected in its memorandum of decision are essentially undisputed. Quinones, thirty-three years of age at the time of the trial, had resided in the apartment with Rodriguez, who is her mother, for almost two and one-half years. They shared the apartment with Melendez, until December, 1988, when he moved out. Melendez and Rodriguez occupied the apartment under an oral month-to-month lease. In September, 1988, the plaintiff became the property manager of the building and acquired title to it in January, 1989. Quinones\u2019 name was on the mail box throughout this time, yet the plaintiff\u2019s vice-president and the current property manager testified that they were unaware of her presence until shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>before the notice to quit was issued in April, 1989. While Quinones contributes one half of the rent, Rodriguez purchases, makes out and signs the money orders by which the rent is paid to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The question presented by this case is whether Quinones is a \u201ctenant\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1), which mandates, in part, that a person can be evicted only upon a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d if the following criteria are met: (1) the person is a tenant; (2) the building or complex consists of five or more separate dwelling units; and (3) the tenant is elderly, blind or physically disabled. Although the parties agree that the building complex in question has five or more separate dwelling units and that Quinones is physically disabled with cerebral palsy, they disagree about Quinones\u2019 status as a \u201ctenant\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1). The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, holding that Quinones, as a tenant at sufferance, is not a \u201ctenant\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1). The defendants argue that the trial court should not have made this determination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The trial court concluded that a tenant at sufferance could not be a \u201ctenant\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1), because subsection (b) of the statute, which enumerates seven grounds for \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction, states that a landlord may evict a tenant if the tenant refuses to agree to \u201ca fair and equitable rent increase.\u201d The trial court reasoned that since \u201ca tenant at sufferance is not obligated to pay <em>rent </em>but only the reasonable rental value of the premises as use and occupancy . . . failure to pay use and occupancy could not be grounds to evict such a tenant otherwise protected by \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court reasoned further that holding to the contrary \u201cwould entitle a tenant at sufferance to greater immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>nity than is afforded all other tenants,\u201d leading to a \u201cludicrous\u201d result. We are not persuaded by the trial court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l <em>(l)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defines \u201ctenant\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Tenant\u2019 means the lessee, sublessee or person entitled under a rental agreement to occupy a dwelling unit to the exclusion of others, or as is otherwise defined by law.\u201d \u201c \u2018A tenancy at sufferance arises when a person who came into possession of land rightfully continues in possession wrongfully after his right thereto has terminated.\u2019 <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>136 Conn. 603, 608-609, 73 A.2d <em>295 (1950).\u201d Rivera v. Santiago, </em>4 Conn. App. 608, 609-10, 495 A.2d 1122 (1985). \u201cThe issuance by a landlord of a notice to quit is an unequivocal act terminating the lease agreement with the tenant. Termination of the lease does not terminate the tenancy since, upon service of a notice to quit, a tenancy at sufferance is created. <em>Bushnell Plaza Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Fazzano, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 683, 460 A.2d 1311 (1983).\u201d Id., 610. \u201cAfter a notice to quit has been served ... a tenant at sufferance no longer has a duty to pay rent. He still, however, is obliged to pay a fair rental value in the form of use and occupancy for the dwelling unit. <em>Lonergan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Food Store, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 122, 131, 357 A.2d 910 (1975).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The defendants argue that a tenant at sufferance is included within \u00a7 47a-l <em>(If </em>s definition of \u201ctenant\u201d by virtue of the language: <em>\u201cor as is otherwise defined by law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We agree. We note that no word in a statute should be treated as superfluous or insignificant; <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 194, 197, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>178 Conn. 700, 703, 425 A.2d 122 (1979); and that we strive to attach independent meaning to every phrase contained in a legislative enactment. <em>Rawling </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>206 Conn. 100, 112, 537 A.2d 439 (1988). Thus, given that \u00a7 47a-l <em>(l) </em>expressly states that a person with a rental agreement is a \u201ctenant,\u201d if we are to give any independent meaning to the language <em>\u201cor as is otherwise defined by law,\u201d </em>(emphasis added) we must conclude that certain persons classified as tenants by law who do not have rental agreements are also \u201ctenants\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Our conclusion that a tenant at sufferance is a \u201ctenant\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1) finds support in the fact that \u00a7 47a-23c is a remedial statute intended to benefit elderly, blind and physically disabled tenants. Since remedial statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit; <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 615 n.4, 440 A.2d 810 (1981); <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>164 Conn. 497, 503, 325 A.2d 228 (1973); and given the fact that the legislature did not expressly exclude tenants at sufferance, we conclude that \u00a7 47a-23e should be liberally construed to protect all elderly, blind and physically disabled tenants, including tenants at sufferance.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Moreover, if we were to hold that tenants at sufferance were not \u201ctenants\u201d under \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1), we would, in effect, be emasculating the protection afforded by the statute to the elderly, the blind and the physically handicapped. Specifically, if tenants at sufferance were not \u201ctenants\u201d for the purpose of the statute, then a landlord who wished to evict elderly, blind and disabled tenants without \u201cgood cause\u201d would merely have to wait until their leases lapsed, because they would have then become tenants at sufferance.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In addition, we are not persuaded by the trial court\u2019s concern regarding the apparent inapplicability, to tenants at sufferance, of one of the reasons for \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction. In particular, the trial court was concerned that a landlord would be deprived of his right under \u00a7 47a-23c (b) (1) (B) to evict a tenant based upon the tenant\u2019s \u201crefusal to agree to a fair and equitable rent increase.\u201d The trial court reasoned that, since a tenant at sufferance does not pay rent, but rather pays use and occupancy, this reason for eviction would not apply to a tenant at sufferance. We are not persuaded, however, that this ground for \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction is inapplicable to tenants at sufferance. In particular, we conclude that a landlord could still exercise his right to \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction against a tenant at sufferance under \u00a7 47a-23c (b) (1) (B), simply by offering the tenant at sufferance a rental agreement at a fair and equitable rent. Thereafter, if the tenant at sufferance refused to accept the rental agreement, the landlord\u2019s recourse to \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction would be appropriate. In sum, we hold that a tenant at sufferance is. a \u201ctenant\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In this opinion Peters, C.

The defendants\u2019 statement of the sole issue raised by this appeal reads: \u201cIs a <em>tenant at sufferance </em>entitled to the \u2018good cause\u2019 protections of [General Statutes \u00a7] 47a-23c?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Furthermore, even if the defendants had challenged the trial court\u2019s finding that Quinones was a tenant at sufferance, we conclude that the record adequately supports the trial court\u2019s finding. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 219-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b395-5\">Covello, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATO\">dissenting. I disagree with the majority-opinion in that it fails to address the threshold question of how Quinones\u2019 status was elevated from an occupant to a tenant at sufferance. By concluding that Quinones was a tenant at sufferance, the majority then goes on to find her a tenant within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l <em>(l). </em>Since the opinion fails to disclose how the tenancy at sufferance was created, I respectfully submit that the premise from which the opinion thereafter proceeds is fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial court found that Quinones resided with her mother at the Willard Street premises for almost two and one-half years. The trial court further found that \u201cMelendez [the building superintendent] and Rodriguez [Quinones\u2019 mother] occupied the apartment under an oral month to month lease.\u201d Finally, the trial court found that there was no rental agreement between the plaintiff and Quinones as the plaintiff was unaware that she was even on the premises until shortly before it issued the notice to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">I submit that these facts establish that Melendez was the tenant at sufferance, i.e., the \u201cperson who came into possession of land rightfully [who thereafter] continues in posession wrongfully after his right thereto has terminated.\u201d <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>136 Conn. 603, 608-609, 73 A.2d 295 (1950). The existence of possession is largely a question of fact dependent on the nature of the property and the surrounding circumstances. \u201cGenerally, the inquiry is whether the individual has exercised the dominion and control that owners of like property usually exercise. 35 Am Jur. 2d, Forcible Entry and Detainer \u00a7 15; see <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>126 Conn. 121, 123, 9 A.2d 811 (1939).\u201d <em>Communiter Break Co. </em>v. <em>Scinto, </em>196 Conn. 390, 394, 493 A.2d 182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(1985). Here, the trial court concluded that Melendez, who thereafter moved out, and Rodriguez were in possession, not Quinones. Thus, Quinones had no greater status than simply that of family member or occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">That the General Assembly specifically contemplated that there could be occupiers of property who do not have the status of tenants is found in the definition under \u00a7 47a-l (j) of \u201cRoomer,\u201d i.e., \u201ca person <em>occupying </em>a dwelling unit, which unit does not include a refrigerator, stove, kitchen sink, toilet and shower or bathtub and one or more of these facilities are used in common by other occupants in the structure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also Restatement (Second), Property \u00a7 1.2, illustrations 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">I submit that the startling conclusion reached by the majority here is that any occupant, whether family member, visitor or whatever, whose presence on the premises is derived from the person in actual possession, becomes a tenant at sufferance and therefore has available the full panoply of rights found in \u00a7 47a-1 et seq., including, e.g., the right to notice to quit possession, the right to institute legal action to enforce the landlord\u2019s responsibilities, the right to secure substitute housing in event of the failure of the landlord to provide essential services, or to recover two month\u2019s rent or double the actual damages sustained by the tenant due to the landlord\u2019s failure to provide such services, etc. I do not believe that this is the contemplation of the statute. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
