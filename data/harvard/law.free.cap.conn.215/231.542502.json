Weinberg, guilty of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>\u00f1SaS\u00e1a.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court thereupon sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal from this judgment the defendant claims that the trial court should not have: (1) denied his request for an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress; (2) found an essential state\u2019s witness competent to testify at trial; (3) admitted into evidence certain testimony of an expert witness; (4) denied his request for a mistrial; (5) refused to require the state to prove venue; (6) denied his motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>for judgment of acquittal; and (7) sentenced him without first affording him the right of allocution. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of August 3,1984, Joyce Stochmal was at her home in the town of Seymour, preparing to leave for an overnight stay at her place of employment, the Silver Hills Kennel, located in the town of Ansonia. In contemplation of working at the kennel the next morning, she packed a blue gym bag with the following items: an orange Silver Hills Kennel t-shirt, a pair of Calvin Klein cut-off jeans, a bra, underpants, socks, and a small zippered makeup bag containing an Estee Lauder eyeliner pencil and mascara. Stochmal left her home at approximately 10:30 p.m. and was last seen alive at approximately 10:45 p.m., walking along the nearby Squantuck Road in the direction of Ansonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">That same night, August 3,1984, the defendant was at the Prime Time Cafe, a bar located approximately one half mile from Squantuck Road. When he left the bar, he drove along Squantuck Road where he encountered Stochmal. The defendant, thereafter, beat Stochmal about her head and face and stabbed her repeatedly in the back, chest and neck. After inflicting these fatal wounds, he disposed of Stochmal\u2019s body in Lake Zoar and then started a fire along the banks of the Pomperaug River where he burned the contents of Stochmal\u2019s gym bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In the afternoon of the next day, August 4,1984, the defendant indicated to his girlfriend, D, who had just returned from an overnight stay in New York, that he had discovered a dirt road near his place of employment and he wanted to go see what was there. D agreed to go along, and they drove in the defendant\u2019s car to a secluded area along the Pomperaug River. The defendant indicated that he had been at that location the night before and that his car had gotten stuck. D <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>and the defendant then got out of the car, and the defendant started wading through the shallow water to cross the river. D followed him, and when they reached the opposite bank, she watched as the defendant began digging through the remains of a fire. Twenty to thirty minutes later they left.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On August 4, 1984, the defendant shaved off his beard and, from that date, stopped carrying in public a knife he had previously kept in a sheath on his belt. He also removed a large sticker from the hood of his car and painted the white wheels on his car black.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The defendant became a suspect in the murder of Joyce Stochmal following police investigation of information given to them by D. D, who has a long history of mental illness manifested in such symptoms as auditory and visual hallucinations and delusions, went to the police barracks in Southbury on August 17, 1984, to complain about the psychiatric treatment she was receiving at a particular clinic. In the course of her conversation with the police officers, she told them about the fire site to which the defendant had taken her on August 4. After describing the location of the site, its surroundings, and the details of what had occurred on the afternoon she and the defendant had gone there, she took the police to show them the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The police seized the charred remains from the fire site. The following items were found in those remains: an orange fabric that matched the weave, composition, melting point and dye of an orange Silver Hills Kennel t-shirt; a Calvin Klein button; some Calvin Klein rivets; bra hooks and eyes; a zipper fragment consistent with those found on small makeup bags; pieces of an eyeliner pencil that matched the dye and construction of the Estee Lauder eyeliner the victim was known to have used; a twisted wire containing fibers consistent with those found on a mascara brush; charred fabric that appeared to be from a sock; and a blue fiber.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The police interviewed the defendant on August 22, 1984, concerning his activities on the night of August 3, 1984. When asked if he had seen anyone walking along the road as he had left the Prime Time Cafe, the defendant volunteered that he had not driven on Squantuck Road. He explained that, due to transmission problems with his car, he had taken a route home that had fewer hills, a route police later discovered to be 6.7 miles longer than the Squantuck Road route to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">After further investigation, two warrants were issued, one for the search of the defendant\u2019s body and the other for the search of his residence and car. The police seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment a buck knife later determined to be similar in size and configuration to the murder weapon. Seized from the trunk of the defendant\u2019s car was a bloody hair fragment consistent with the unusually fine texture of the victim\u2019s hair and also a blue fiber that matched in dye and structure a fiber found in the charred remains at the fire site.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The defendant first challenges the court\u2019s refusal to conduct an evidentiary hearing concerning the truthfulness of the affidavits that served as the factual predicates for the issuance of warrants to search his body, residence and car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the defendant, as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>of a motion to suppress, requested that the court conduct a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978), to address the defendant\u2019s allegations that material facts deliberately or recklessly had been omitted from the affidavits supporting the search warrants and that, had those facts been included, probable cause for the issuance of the warrants would not have existed. The defendant claimed that the following information had been excluded from the affidavits: (1) The police had been informed that D, who provided detailed information that ultimately inculpated the defendant in the murder, suffered from mental problems, including auditory and visual hallucinations; (2) A report written by one investigating officer characterized, in less incriminatory terms than did the affidavits, the statement made by the defendant concerning the road he had taken after leaving the Prime Time Cafe on August 3, 1984; (3) The police had obtained information from a variety of sources indicating that the victim had not been abducted while walking along Squantuck Road, but rather had come in contact with her attacker sometime later and at a different location;* 12*<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (4) The police had interviewed a woman who provided them with information indicating that another person might have killed the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>concluded that although certain information might have been excluded from the affidavits, the defendant had not established that he was entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing. We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, 155-56, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, <em>and </em>if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court in <em>Franks </em>mentioned only \u201ca false statement . . . included . . . in the warrant affidavit\u201d; subsequent cases, however, have extended <em>Franks </em>to include material omissions from such an affidavit. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>737 F.2d 594, 604 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1003, 105 S. Ct. 1354, 84 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marin-Buitrago, </em>734 F.2d 889, 894-96 (2d Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>615 F.2d 318, 328 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 238, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). Although we are not convinced that the defendant made the substantial showing required by the first prong of the <em>Franks </em>test, we need not decide the issue since we hold that even had the challenged omissions been included in the affidavits, there was probable cause to support the issuance of the warrants. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 359-60, 441 A.2d 98 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201cProbable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with criminal activity or will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction . . . <em>and </em>(2) there is probable cause to believe that the items sought to be seized will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d (Emphasis in original; citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 528-29, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>205 Conn. 560, 564-65, 534 A.2d 1165 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 745-46, 508 A.2d 748 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">A review of the averments contained within the affidavits, even after the challenged omissions are added, convinces us that there was sufficient probable cause to support the issuance of the warrants to search the defendant\u2019s body, residence and car for items connected with the murder. Admittedly, the inclusion of the omitted details would have vitiated the import of the facts establishing that the defendant had encountered the victim on Squantuck Road. The critical connection between the defendant and the murder was not established by those facts, however, but, rather, by the information given to the police by D.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>D\u2019s credibility was a significant issue and certainly would have been questioned had the affiants included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>in the affidavits the information concerning her mental illness. We conclude, however, that the affidavits contained sufficient corroboration of D\u2019s statement to warrant a conclusion that D\u2019s information was credible. It is particularly significant that the location and existence of the fire site were corroborated by a number of police officers. Likewise, the change in appearance and behavior of the defendant after August 3, 1984, was corroborated by a variety of sources. \u201c \u2018The theory of corroboration is that a statement which has been shown true in some respects is reasonably likely to be true in the remaining respects.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>[162 Conn. 440, 447, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>supra, 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">A fair reading of the affidavits, including the challenged omissions, discloses the following facts: The body of Joyce Stochmal, who had last been seen alive on the night of August 3, 1984, was found in shallow water in Lake Zoar on August 7,1984. Her death was determined to have been caused by multiple stab wounds from a knife or other cutting instrument. On August 4,1984, the defendant took D to a secluded area along the banks of the Pomperaug River that was near his place of employment. He indicated that he had been there in his car earlier that day. When D and the defendant got out of the car, the defendant waded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>through shallow water to the opposite bank and then dug through the remains of a fire, throwing debris from those remains into the water. Police found at that fire site charred remains consistent with some of the items that the victim had packed in her gym bag. Also on August 4,1984, the defendant changed the appearance of both his face and his car and stopped carrying a knife that he had formerly kept in a sheath on his belt. Soon after Stochmal\u2019s body was found, a caller contacted the state police barracks announcing that he had \u201cgot\u201d or \u201ccut\u201d the \u201cgirl in Southbury.\u201d Three people independently identified the voice of the caller as that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We conclude that, even had the challenged omissions been included in the affidavits, the facts contained therein would have been sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to issue the search warrants. Accordingly, the defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the testimony of D. Prior to the admission of her testimony, the state and the defendant stipulated to the appointment of an independent psychiatrist, Walter Borden, for the purpose of evaluating D\u2019s competence to testify at trial. Borden thereafter reviewed D\u2019s voluminous psychiatric record and a transcript of the testimony D had given at the probable cause hearing and also conducted a psychiatric examination of D at his office. In both Borden\u2019s written report and his testimony at the hearing concerning this matter, he concluded that D was not competent to testify at trial. His conclusion, as he explained at the hearing, was based upon his clinical diagnosis that D suffered from \u201csevere chronic paranoid schizophre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>nia\u201d that was manifested in such symptoms as uncontrollable delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations, including hallucinations about the defendant. The trial court, however, determined that, notwithstanding Borden\u2019s clinical diagnosis, it was satisfied, having listened to D\u2019s proffered testimony and the substance of Borden\u2019s testimony, that D met the legal requirements for competency. The defendant argues that D\u2019s testimonial capacity was so impaired by her severe mental illness that her testimony should not have been admitted at trial. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">This court has stated that \u201c[i]n determining the competency of a proposed witness the trial court should consider <em>the capacity </em>of the witness to receive correct sense impressions, to comprehend the facts to be developed, to recollect and narrate facts intelligently, and to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulay, </em>189 Conn. 106, 108, 454 A.2d 724 (1983). We have never, however, specified the measure of \u201ccapacity\u201d required for a determination of competency. On this issue, we look for guidance, as did the trial court in the instant case, to the federal courts\u2019 approach to the issue of witness competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that, except where otherwise provided by the rules, \u201c[ejvery person is competent to be a witness . . . .\u201d Pursuant to this rule, the federal courts treat questions of competency as simply one aspect of the credibility of a witness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Evidence \u00a7 601[05]. Federal Rule \u00a7 601 has not been construed, however, as eliminating a court\u2019s power to prevent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>witness from testifying. To the contrary, a court maintains the obligation to ensure that a witness\u2019 testimony meets the minimum standard of credibility necessary to permit a reasonable person to put any credence in that testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As noted commentators have acknowledged: \u201cIn making this determination the court will still be deciding competency. It would, however ... be more accurate to say that the court will decide . . . minimum credibility. This requirement of minimum credibility is just one aspect of the requirement of minimum probative force\u2014i.e., relevancy. Regardless of terminology, the trial judge may exclude all or a part of the witness\u2019 testimony on the ground that no one could reasonably believe the witness could have observed, remembered, communicated or told the truth with respect to the event in question.\u201d 3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, supra, \u00a7 601[01].</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We conclude that Rule \u00a7 601, as applied by the federal courts, establishes a reasoned approach to determining the admissibility of a witness\u2019 testimony. We adopt, therefore, the rule that where the competency of a witness is challenged, the threshold question to be answered by the court is whether the testimony of that witness is minimally credible. If the testimony of a witness passes the test of minimum credibility, and is otherwise relevant, the testimony is admissible and the weight to be accorded it, in light of the witness\u2019 inca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>pacity, is a question for the trier of fact. As we have stated in the past, \u201c \u2018[t]he competency of a witness is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 115, 291 A.2d 750 (1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>187 Conn. 281, 291-92, 445 A.2d 895 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">With this rule as our framework, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the witness competent to testify at trial. Borden\u2019s conclusion that the witness was not competent to testify was, as he explained, based upon his clinical diagnosis of D\u2019s mental illness, although he acknowledged that her testimony, if independently corroborated, might be credible. The court focused not on Borden\u2019s clinical diagnosis, but rather on the substance of Borden\u2019s testimony. As the court explained, the substance of that testimony revealed that, despite D\u2019s severe mental illness, her cognitive memory was intact, her factual reports tended to be accurate, and she understood the moral duty of truthfulness. The court, noting that D\u2019s proffered testimony involved a factual account of a trip to the fire scene with the defendant for which there was corrobation, found D competent to testify. We cannot say that under these facts the court abused its discretion in determining that D possessed sufficient powers of observation, recollection, narration and truthfulness to meet the threshold requirement of minimum credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The weight to be accorded D\u2019s testimony in light of her mental illness, therefore, was for the jury to decide. Here, the jury had all the facts necessary for a reasoned credibility determination of D\u2019s testimony. The defendant cross-examined D extensively about her mental illness, her various hospitalizations, and her medications. The defendant also presented testimony from Borden concerning D\u2019s mental illness and introduced as full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>exhibits fifty-three hospital and psychiatric records of the witness. Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly admitted D\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should not have admitted into evidence the opinion of the state medical examiner, Wayne Carver, that the victim\u2019s fatal stab wounds were inflicted by the knife seized from the defendant\u2019s residence or an object similar in size and configuration to that knife. The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim is that Carver\u2019s opinion was not based upon reasonable probability and thus failed to meet the threshold requirement for admissibility. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">This court stated in <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 443, 378 A.2d 540 (1977), that \u201c[a]n expert witness is competent to express an opinion, even though he or she may be unwilling to state a conclusion with absolute certainty, so long as the expert\u2019s opinion, if not stated in terms of the certain, is at least stated in terms of the probable, and not merely the possible.\u201d In the present case, an offer of proof was made outside the presence of the jury to establish the admissibility of Carver\u2019s opinion concerning the relationship between the defendant\u2019s knife and the victim\u2019s wounds. During that offer of proof, Carver offered candid explanations concerning the limitations of scientific or medical expertise in measuring and otherwise evaluating flesh wounds. A careful reading of the record indicates, however, that Carver, in both form and substance, stated in terms of the probable his opinion that the victim\u2019s wounds were consistent with having been caused by either the defendant\u2019s knife or an object of similar size and configuration. This testimony thus met the threshold requirement of admissibility established in <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The jury was thereafter convened and Carver was again asked to give his opinion concerning the relationship between the defendant\u2019s knife and the victim\u2019s wounds. A careful review of the record again reveals that Carver stated his opinion, both in form and substance, in terms of the probable. He repeated with respect to each of the wounds individually that within reasonable medical or scientific probability it was his opinion that the \u201cwound was caused by either this object [the defendant\u2019s knife] or an object similar in size and configuration.\u201d This testimony also met the threshold requirement of admissibility established in <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The opinion expressed by Carver before the jury was inconsistent with some of his expressed views, during the offer of proof, concerning the limited capacity of scientific or medical expertise to determine, with the requisite certainty, a causal relationship between a particular flesh wound and a particular weapon. The defendant, however, did not contest the admissibility of the opinion on those grounds, but rather limited his challenge, as he does on appeal, to the admissibility of the opinion under <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra. The defendant attacked arguable inconsistencies in Carver\u2019s testimony through cross-examination. Our review of evidentiary rulings made by the trial court is limited to the specific legal ground raised in the objection. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 579, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 262, 487 A.2d 545 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 684-85, 469 A.2d 760 (1983). Under the facts here presented, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Carver\u2019s opinion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Biller, </em>190 Conn. 594, 617, 462 A.2d 987 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The defendant next challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for a mistrial. The gravamen of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>defendant\u2019s claim is that certain courtroom events were so inherently prejudicial that a mistrial was necessary in order to protect his federal and state constitutional rights to a trial before an impartial jury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In order to address this claim, it is necessary first to narrate in some detail the relevant events that occurred in the courtroom. During the final moments of the defendant\u2019s closing argument, some members of the courtroom audience made gestures and facial expressions, indicating disapproval of the defendant and his counsel. The victim\u2019s mother then stood with her hands over her head and directed mock applause toward defense counsel. In response to this conduct, the defendant, in the absence of the jury, moved for a mistrial, claiming that the jury could not remain impartial given the \u201clynch-mob atmosphere\u201d of the courtroom. Reserving decision on the defendant\u2019s motion, the court stated that it would give the jury a cautionary instruction concerning the events that had transpired and would permit the defendant, as an exception to the rules, to make a second closing argument after the state\u2019s final summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The court thereafter convened the jury and addressed them as follows: \u201cI want to speak to you now about what I thought was some inappropriate action by people in the audience. When [defense counsel] was finishing his summation, people in the audience were shaking their heads and doing things that I thought were totally and absolutely inappropriate. I want you to disregard anything you may have seen and not let it influence you one iota.\u201d The court continued its remarks, admonishing the jurors to focus only on the evidence presented during the trial and repeating several times its instruction that the jury disregard the \u201creprehensive\u201d audience conduct. The court then concluded by explaining to the jury that, because the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>entitled to the presumption of innocence and to fair treatment, he would be given an opportunity to address the jury a second time following the state\u2019s summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The court subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, stating: \u201cI as the Constitutional officer have the obligation to have a fair trial. I have watched this jury. They have been attentive. They are intelligent. I have explained at length, told them how upset I was and that they are to disregard it and I believe they have a power to listen to me. . . . I think the case is one that can fairly go to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Following the court\u2019s final instructions to the jury, including a general charge concerning the jury\u2019s duty to reach a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial, the defendant renewed his request for a mistrial. In reconsidering the motion, the court noted that the inappropriate spectator conduct had occurred in the last sixty to ninety seconds of the defendant\u2019s first closing argument. Given the court\u2019s instructions to the jury and the fact that the defendant was given a second opportunity to address the jury, the court determined that the trial had been a fair one and that a mistrial was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that despite the court\u2019s efforts to mitigate the prejudice resulting from the courtroom events, the \u201c[disruption of trial by a mob demanding revenge and ridiculing the defense is the kind of assault upon our judicial system which simply cannot be cured by a mere cautionary instruction or rerun of a trial segment.\u201d He maintains, therefore, that the trial court should not have denied his request for a mistrial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">It is without question that due process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial jury. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>art. I, \u00a7 8;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 324-25, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 542, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). The United States Supreme Court has noted, however, that \u201cthe Constitution \u2018does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation . . . [because] it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 118, 104 S. Ct. 453, 78 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1983), reh. denied, 465 U.S. 1055, 104 S. Ct. 1336, 79 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1984), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982). In the vast majority of cases, therefore, the determination of whether the defendant has been deprived of his right to an impartial jury will depend upon how the jury interprets and expectedly will react to the communication made. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>822 F.2d 1174, 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The trial court, which has a first-hand impression of that jury, \u201cis generally in the best position to evaluate the critical question of whether the juror\u2019s or jurors\u2019 exposure to improper matter has prejudiced a defendant. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>846 F.2d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>[193 Conn. 695, 736, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985)]. . . . Where, as here, the impartiality of the jury was challenged by a motion for mistrial, the trial court\u2019s determination will be reversed only where it can fairly be said that it abused its discretion in denying the mistrial. See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>supra, 158; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra, 543-44. In noting that a trial court has wide discretion in passing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>motions for mistrial, we have said that \u2018 \u201c[t]he general principle is that a mistrial should be granted only as.' a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra, 543; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavros, </em>196 Conn. 519, 526, 494 A.2d 550, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 904, 106 S. Ct. 233, 88 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 436, 489 A.2d 350 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 326-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In the instant case, we cannot say that the conduct at issue, after the countermeasures administered by the court, so jeopardized the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial. The trial court clearly considered the conduct exhibited by members of the courtroom audience to be potentially prejudicial to the defendant. The court, therefore, took prompt and careful steps to defuse that risk of prejudice. First, the court repeatedly cautioned the jury to disregard the spectator misconduct and to decide the case only on the evidence presented at the trial. Second, the court, as an exception to the rules, gave the defendant a second opportunity to address the jury, one that was not disturbed by a courtroom demonstration. After having taken these actions, the court explained that.it had carefully observed the jury, both before and after the ninety second, nonverbal demonstration conducted by members of the courtroom audience, and it was satisfied that the jury had the \u201cpower\u201d to follow the instructions it had given.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since \u201c \u2018[t]he trial judge is uniquely qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to appraise the probable effect of information on the jury, the materiality of the extraneous material, and its prejudicial nature\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>785 F.2d 743, 746 (9th Cir. 1986), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagnariol, </em>665 F.2d 877, 885 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 962, 102 S. Ct. 2040, 72 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1982); we accord considerable deference to that conclusion. We, therefore, cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not impaired and in denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The substitute information, filed prior to trial, alleged, inter alia, that the defendant had murdered the victim \u201cat or near the town of Southbury.\u201d The defendant asserts that the location of the death was therefore an essential element of the crime with which he was charged. Accordingly, he challenges the court\u2019s refusal to require the state to meet its burden of proof on that element.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree that the location of the death was an essential element of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Our discussion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 551-53, 498 A.2d 76 (1985), is dispositive of this issue. \u201c When the state\u2019s pleadings have \u201cinformed the defendant of the charge against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, and were definite enough to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense, they have performed their constitutional duty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 168, 422 A.2d 299 (1979).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Vin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cent, 194 Conn. 198, 205, 479 A.2d 237 (1984). The inclusion in the state\u2019s pleading of additional details concerning the offense does not make such allegations essential elements of the crime . . . .\u201d Id., 551. We discussed in <em>Morrill </em>the well established rule in this state that, in a criminal prosecution, it is not essential that the crime be proved to have been committed on the precise date alleged; ordinarily it is sufficient that the prosecution prove the commission of the crime charged at any time prior to the date of the complaint and within the period fixed by the statute of limitations. Id., 552; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>187 Conn. 264, 274, 445 A.2d 887, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 861, 103 S. Ct. 136, 74 L.

By analogy, we concluded that \u201c \u2018the fact that the place of death is unknown or that there may be a variance in the proof thereof will not be fatal unless it is made to affirmatively appear that the accused was mislead [sic] or prejudiced thereby. No person should escape punishment for murder because he is so clever as to conceal . . . the place where the victim was killed or died.\u2019 See generally annot., 59 A.L.R.2d 901 \u00a7 10.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>235 Ind. 456, 463-64, 134 N.E.2d 688 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We conclude that the location of the victim\u2019s death was not an essential element of the crime with which the defendant was charged. Moreover, in the instant case, we are unable to discern how the defendant could have been misled or prejudiced by the fact that the precise location of the death was unknown.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ingly, the trial court properly refused to require the state to prove that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The defendant next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, at the close of all the evidence, and again after the verdict, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. Each of the motions was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the defendant renews his claim that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict on the charge of murder. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cIn accordance with well established principles, appellate analysis of a claim of insufficiency of the evidence requires us to undertake a twofold task. \u2018We first review the evidence presented at the trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. We then determine whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .... In this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 576, 500 A.2d 539 (1985), and cases there cited.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>203 Conn. 641, 665-66, 526 A.2d 1283 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The elements of intentional murder with which the defendant was charged under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a are (1) intent, (2) causation and (3) death by killing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>opposed to death by accident or suicide. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 460, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980), aff'd, 188 Conn. 626, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983). The disputed elements in the instant case were \u201cintent\u201d and \u201ccausation\u201d upon which the state presented the following evidence. The victim was last seen alive on August 3, 1984, at approximately 10:45 p.m., walking along Squantuck Road. On that same night, the defendant was at a bar located one half mile from Squantuck Road. He left the bar sometime after 10 p.m. and did not arrive at his home until sometime after 1:20 a.m. on August 4. When later asked by the police whether he had seen anyone walking along the road as he had left the bar, the defendant <em>volunteered </em>that he had not driven on Squantuck Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In the afternoon of August 4, the defendant took D to a secluded area along the banks of the Pomperaug River, located approximately one quarter mile from his place of employment. He explained to D that he had been there the night before. The defendant and D then waded across the river where the defendant stirred the ashes from a fire. In those ashes were the charred remains of some of the victim\u2019s possessions. Also on August 4, 1984, the defendant shaved his beard and stopped carrying a knife that he had previously kept in a sheath on his belt. Soon thereafter the defendant painted the white wheels on his car black and removed a large identifying sticker from his car. Finally, pursuant to a search warrant, the police seized from the trunk of the defendant\u2019s car evidence linking the defendant to the fire site and to the victim, and from the defendant\u2019s residence a knife that was similar in size and configuration to the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we cannot say as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>law that the jury as the trier of fact could not reasonably have concluded that the defendant murdered Joyce Stochmal. \u201c \u2018It is within the province of the trier of fact to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven, but it may not resort to speculation and conjecture. <em>State </em>v. Kish, 186 Conn. 757, 768, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>181 Conn. 406, 418, 435 A.2d 986 (1980). Any inferences drawn must be rational and founded upon the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>168 Conn. 395, 401, 363 A.2d 33, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 855, 96 S. Ct. 104, 46 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1975). The jury may base an inference on facts it finds as the result of other inferences. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>[192 Conn. 405, 425, 473 A.2d 300 (1984)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McGinnis, </em>158 Conn. 124, 130, 256 A.2d 241 (1969) . . . . \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 355, 521 A.2d 150 (1987), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 673, 485 A.2d 913 (1984). The jury could fairly have inferred the following. The defendant encountered the victim on Squantuck Road and thereafter inflicted the fatal stab wounds upon her. He disposed of the body, but failed to dispose at the same time of her personal effects that were in his possession. He, therefore, went to a secluded area near his place of employment, waded across the river to the opposite shore and burned the items. The following day he returned to the fire site to make sure, in the light of day, that no evidence of the victim\u2019s possessions remained. Thereafter, he engaged in verbal and nonverbal conduct, such as changing both his personal appearance and his car\u2019s appearance and offering unsolicited details to the police, that can fairly be inferred to have been influenced by the criminal act. As we have stated, \u201c \u2018[t]he state of mind which is characterized as \u201cguilty consciousness\u201d or \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d is strong evidence that the person is indeed guilty; 2 Wigmore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 273 ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 655, 480 A.2d 463 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">We conclude that the cumulative effect of the evidence presented and the permissible inferences drawn therefrom were sufficient to justify the jury in finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of murder. The trial court, therefore, properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We consider finally the defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied his right of allocution. At the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, his counsel spoke at length on his behalf and included as part of the presentation to the court a reading of letters from the defendant\u2019s friends, employer and priest. The defendant argues that although his counsel was afforded the opportunity to address the court at the sentencing hearing, the mandates of our rules of practice were not satisfied. Practice Book \u00a7 919 provides in pertinent part: \u201cBefore imposing a sentence . . . the judicial authority shall . . . conduct a sentencing hearing as follows ... (3) The judicial authority shall allow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to make a personal statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of the sentence. ...\u201d The defendant claims that \u00a7 919 requires a trial court, prior to sentencing, to address a defendant <em>personally </em>to ascertain whether he desires to make a statement in his own behalf. Accordingly, argues the defendant, because the court in the instant case did not make such an inquiry, his sentence must be reversed. We decline to consider the requirements and limitations of the opportunity afforded by \u00a7 919, because the defendant\u2019s claim was not raised below. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>During the sentencing hearing, neither the defendant nor his counsel requested that he be given the opportunity to make a personal statement and took no exception to the particular procedures followed by the court during the hearing. Moreover, a review of the record reveals that all the information communicated to the court indicated that the defendant and his counsel had discussed fully the hearing and any rights or consequences emanating therefrom and had carefully charted the course to be followed during the hearing. On appeal, the defendant does not maintain that his claim is reviewable as an exceptional circumstance within the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 238-42, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), or under the plain error rule of Practice Book \u00a7 4185.

In a written statement, [D] indicated that she is presently living at . . . with her boyfriend, David J. Weinberg, age 26.

[D] had had an argument with Weinberg, and went to NY expecting to move there. On Saturday 8/4/84 she rented a U-Haul truck and drove to her mother\u2019s home in Oxford for some belongings. David Weinberg came to the house at approximately 1530 hours and asked her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to go for some ice cream at a shop in Woodbury, CT. Enroute, Weinberg told her of a place he had found near the print shop where he works, and said he wanted to show her.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u201cWeinberg further stated that he had been there earlier that day, and had gotten his car stuck. He explained to [D] that he had been at the Prime Time Cafe until approximately 2230 hours on 8/3/84, and then was \u2018up all night worrying about her,\u2019 but did not elaborate as to how he had found the place or at what time. Weinberg drove her to a dirt road off of South Pomperaug Road Woodbury, CT directly across from Weinberg\u2019s place of employment, the Village Print Shop. They proceeded down the road to the Pomperaug River, and Weinberg got out of the car and forded the stream with his shoes on. Weinberg went to a camp fire scene on the opposite river bank and began digging through the remains, throwing debris into the water. [D] joined Weinberg and asked him what he was doing, and he replied he wanted to make sure the fire was out. [D] told Weinberg she did not like the place, and they left. Weinberg then drove through Newtown, CT to a steel bridge over Lake Zoar. Weinberg stopped the car, and walked onto the bridge. He and [D] watched two young men jump into the lake from the bridge. Weinberg stated that he too wanted to jump into the water but [D] told him he would hurt his back so they then left. As they proceeded down River Rd. in Southbury towards Interstate 84, there were two State Police cruisers stopped on the road. Weinberg asked a Trooper what was wrong and was directed to continue on. Weinberg drove down the road, turned around and parked. He got out of the car, spoke with some bystanders, and came back to the car telling [D] that a body had been pulled from the lake.
