Monroe, commenced this action in the Superior Court for the judicial district of New London by filing a \u201cComplaint/Presentment\u201d against the defendant, Daniel B. Horwitch, who is the statewide bar counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the presentment por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tion of the plaintiffs action, she sought to present the defendant to the court for discipline. In her complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had denied grievance complainants \u201cdue process and equal protection of the law\u201d by failing to enforce time limits for the processing of grievance complaints. In addition, she alleged that the defendant had unconstitutionally exercised \u201cjudicial powers of a judge\u201d by dismissing complaints, issuing reprimands to lawyers and deciding which complaints should be acted upon by the court. The remaining portion of the plaintiffs complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the dismissal of complaints and the issuing of reprimands by the defendant and/or the statewide grievance committee was an unconstitutional exercise of judicial discretion and power. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-90 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The defendant moved to dismiss the \u201cComplaint/Presentmenf \u2019 claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction regarding the presentment portion of the complaint because the plaintiff could not directly request the court to discipline an attorney, and because the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the presentment. With respect to the declaratory judgment portion of the plaintiff\u2019s action, the defendant also argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>tion because the plaintiff had failed to meet the requirements imposed by Practice Book \u00a7 390.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On October 30,1989, after oral argument, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiff did not have standing and had failed to follow the grievance procedure as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 51-90e.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff has now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>appealed that ruling to this court, arguing: (1) that the trial court, by dismissing her pro se complaint/presentment on the ground that a private party cannot file a grievance against an attorney in the Superior Court, denied her due process of law and equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the United States and Connecticut constitutions; (2) that the trial court should not have ruled that she needed standing to file a complaint/presentment in the Superior Court; (3) that the judiciary has the inherent and exclusive jurisdiction to regulate and to discipline attorneys; and (4) that the trial court should have ruled that the statutes establishing the grievance procedure in this state are unconstitutional. Because we agree with the trial court that the plaintiff cannot directly request the court to discipline an attorney, and that she lacks standing to bring the allegations in her \u201cComplaint/Presentment,\u201d we hold that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The plaintiff is a private citizen who is attempting to act as a representative of persons who she claims are dissatisfied with the statewide grievance committee\u2019s handling of their complaints. The plaintiff herself has not filed a grievance complaint against an attorney since 1985. While we laud the plaintiff\u2019s concern for assuring that all attorneys in Connecticut conduct themselves in accordance with applicable ethical standards, she has not, under our long established doctrine of standing, presented a justiciable controversy before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201cStanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>stantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962); <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>165 Conn. 190, 192, 332 A.2d 78 (1973). These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a \u2018personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\u2019; <em>Shaskan </em>v. <em>Waltham Industries Corporation, </em>168 Conn. 43, 49, 357 A.2d 472 (1975); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 204; provides the requisite assurance of \u2018concrete adverseness\u2019 and diligent advocacy.\u201d <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 320-21, 439 A.2d 349 (1981). \u201cWhere a party is found to lack standing, the court is consequently without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. See <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Local 1161, </em>1 Conn. App. 154, 157, 468 A.2d 1251, cert. denied, 192 Conn. 802, 471 A.2d 244 (1984).\u201d <em>Christ-Janer </em>v. <em>A. F. Conte &amp; Co., </em>8 Conn. App. 83, 90, 511 A.2d 1017 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We conclude that the plaintiff has not established a colorable claim of <em>direct </em>injury. She is simply a member of the general public who has not demonstrated how she was harmed in a unique fashion by the present structure and functioning of the statewide grievance process. We therefore hold that the trial court correctly concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cComplaint/Presentment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Furthermore, we hold that the trial court correctly ruled that the plaintiff could not directly present an attorney to the Superior Court for discipline, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was required to follow the grievance procedure as set forth in \u00a7 51-90e. The plaintiff argues, however, that \u00a7 51-90e confers upon her the right to file a presentment against an attorney directly in the Superior Court because it provides in part: \u201cAny person may file a written complaint alleging attorney misconduct.\u201d The plaintiff, however, ignores the remaining portion of \u00a7 51-90e that states: \u201cA complaint against an attorney <em>shall </em>be filed with the state-wide bar counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d connotes that the requirement is mandatory rather than permissive. <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). The statute is clear and unambiguous, and therefore is not subject to modification by means of construction. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57-58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that the plaintiff could not directly present an attorney to the Superior Court for discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-18\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 51-90c. state-wide bar counsel, (a) The judges of the superior court shall appoint an attorney to act as state-wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>bar counsel, who shall serve full-time, and such number of attorneys to act as assistant bar counsel as are necessary, for a term of one year commencing July first.
