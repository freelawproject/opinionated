The defendant now claims on appeal: (1) that \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), prohibiting kidnapping in the first degree, is, under the circumstances of this case, unconstitutionally vague, and thus violates his right to due process; (2) that the evidence submitted in this case was insufficient to sustain a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>viction of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree; (3) that the state\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>refusal to sign his transcribed statement violated his constitutional rights; and (4) that the trial court erred in admitting a portion of his statement that was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At approximately 10 a.m. on July 19, 1987, the victim was jogging through Edgewood Park in New Haven. In particular, she was running down the center of a two car-widths wide paved road that runs through the park. While she was running on a portion of the road that passed through a heavily wooded area, she noticed the defendant walking toward her on the road. As they approached each other, the victim adjusted her position to pass the defendant on the left, attempting to leave \u201cplenty of space\u201d between the two of them as she passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">As the defendant and the victim were about to pass each other, however, the defendant suddenly blocked the victim\u2019s path. He grabbed her by the shoulders and said: \u201cCome here, I want to show you something.\u201d The victim started screaming, hoping that someone in the park would hear her, but no one was in the immediate area. The defendant then began dragging the victim off to the right side of the road. Once they were off the road, the defendant threw the victim down to the ground in a grassy area. The defendant pinned her down with one hand, and attempted to stuff a white cloth into her mouth with the other hand. His hand was locked around her jaw in such a manner that she \u201cthought he was trying to rip [her] jaw off,\u201d and she \u201cfelt as if [she] was being smothered because [the cloth] was being pressed right on [her] nose and mouth.\u201d The victim began twisting her head back and forth \u201ctrying to struggle out of his grasp,\u201d and, at some point, the defendant raised his hand as if he were about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>strike her. As the defendant was leaning over her body, however, the victim, who was on her back, coiled her legs up to her chest and kicked him in his stomach. As a result, the defendant lost hold of her. The victim was able to roll out from under the defendant and she began to run away. After running approximately thirty feet, the victim turned and saw that the defendant was not giving chase. She ran out to Edgewood Avenue, where she reported the incident to Sergeant Edward Saccavino of the New Haven police department, who happened to be parked nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Saccavino immediately broadcast the victim\u2019s description of her assailant over the radio. Detective Ralph Dinello, who was patrolling the Edgewood Avenue area, heard the broadcast, and a few minutes later spotted the defendant, who matched the description, walking in the vicinity of the park. Dinello approached the defendant and asked him where he lived and from where he was coming. The defendant replied that he lived at 249 Whalley Avenue, and was coming from a friend\u2019s house. Dinello was then informed by another officer, who had arrived on the scene, that there was no residence at 249 Whalley Avenue. The defendant then asked why he was being stopped, and Dinello told him that there was an incident in Edgewood Park and that he fit the description of the assailant. The defendant stated that he \u201cwas not at Edgewood Park or anywhere near Edgewood Avenue Park\u201d and that he was coming from Whalley Avenue. By this time, Saccavino had arrived with the victim, who stated that she was at least 60 percent sure that the defendant was her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The defendant was then placed under arrest, given his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings and taken to the New Haven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>police station. At the station, the defendant was again given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to being interrogated by Dinello. In response to Dinello\u2019s questions, the defendant again stated that he knew absolutely nothing about the incident and that he was not in the park. When Dinello stopped interviewing the defendant in order to speak with the victim, Sergeant Melvin Wearing asked Dinello if he could speak with the defendant for a few minutes. After speaking with Wearing, the defendant agreed to give a statement to Dinello concerning the incident. In his statement, which was tape recorded, the defendant admitted that he had encountered the victim in Edgewood Park. He claimed, however, that he had merely \u201cstaggered\u201d into the victim and that he was attempting to say \u201cexcuse me\u201d when she began screaming. He denied having grabbed the victim at all, and claimed that he first denied being anywhere near Edgewood Park because he \u201cwas afraid of what that lady may [have] thought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">As a result of the attack, the victim immediately noticed a number of scrapes and bruises. The morning after, she felt pain in her jaw, neck and back. In addition, she discovered bruises on her face, shoulders and chest. The victim then went to be examined by a physician\u2019s assistant, Kelly Ann Martens, who testified<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at trial regarding numerous injuries that the victim had sustained, including an abrasion on her elbow, muscle tenderness in many parts of her body, and an abnormal \u201cclick\u201d in her jaw. Martens then referred the victim to a physician concerning her particular injuries, and provided the victim with a cervical collar to wear after leaving the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The defendant first claims that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) is, under the circumstances of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>case, unconstitutionally vague. We disagree. In particular,- \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when ... he restrains the person abducted with intent to . . . inflict physical injury upon him . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (l)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defines \u201crestrain\u201d in part as follows: \u201c \u2018Restrain\u2019 means to restrict a person\u2019s movements intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty by moving him from one place to another, or by confining him either in the place where the restriction commences or in a place to which he has been moved . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In charging the jury, the trial court limited its definition of \u201crestrain\u201d to moving \u201cfrom one place to another.\u201d The defendant now claims that, in using the phrase \u201cfrom one place to another,\u201d the legislature \u201chas provided an impermissibly vague standard which allows an offense involving any movement at all to be prosecuted as a kidnapping and elevated to the level of [a class] A felony.\u201d The defendant asserts further that the lack of precision in this phrase allows a \u201cgross distortion of lesser crimes\u201d into much more serious crimes \u201cby excess of prosecutorial zeal,\u201d thus permitting the \u201cabsurd and unconscionable\u201d result reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>First, before reaching the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we must consider the threshold question of reviewability. The state maintains that the defendant\u2019s vagueness claim is not reviewable because it was not distinctly raised at trial. We conclude that, despite this procedural default, the defendant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional vagueness falls within the parameters of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and therefore warrants appellate scrutiny. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 459, 542 A.2d 686 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge: \u201cThe constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572-73, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 142-43, 363 A.2d 68 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 459-60. \u201cIn order to surmount a vagueness challenge, \u2018a statute [must] afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited.\u2019 <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>176 Conn. 613, 618, 410 A.2d 453 (1979). The constitutional requirement of definiteness applies more strictly to penal laws than to statutes that exact civil penalties. <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>33 U.S. 507, 515, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840 (1948).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Furthermore, it is well established that, as a general rule, \u201cthe constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 92, 96 S. Ct. 316, 46 L. Ed. 2d 228 [1975]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mazurie, </em>419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>U.S. 544, 550, 95 S. Ct. 710, 42 L. Ed. 2d 706 [1975]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Dairy Products Corporation, </em>372 U.S. 29, 32-33, 83 S. Ct. 594, 9 L. Ed. 2d 561 [1963]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S. Ct. 519, 4 L. Ed. 2d 524 [1960].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 57, 428 A.2d 322 (1980). \u201cFor statutes that do not implicate the especially sensitive concerns embodied in the first amendment, we determine the constitutionality of a statute under attack for vagueness by considering its applicability to the particular facts at issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>203 Conn. 682, 696, 526 A.2d 1297 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Thus, we must examine the defendant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional vagueness within the parameters of the facts of this case. Although we can conceive of factual situations in which charging a defendant with kidnapping based upon the most minuscule movement would result in an \u201cabsurd and unconscionable\u201d result; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mich. 222, 232, 205 N.W.2d 415 (1973); we conclude that the facts of this case do not present such a situation. Specifically, we conclude that this defendant clearly moved his victim \u201cfrom one place to another\u201d pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 53a-91 (1) and 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). The victim was jogging down the center of the road through the park. Upon seeing the defendant, she moved to the left of the road. The defendant then grabbed her and dragged her to the right until she was completely off the road. Photographs of the road where the victim was attacked indicate that it was two car-widths wide and surrounded on both sides by a heavily wooded area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, we conclude that the victim was clearly moved \u201cfrom one place to another,\u201d and therefore \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) is not unconstitutionally vague under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Next, the defendant argues that the evidence submitted in this case was insufficient to sustain a conviction of kidnapping in the first degree. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state failed to prove that he moved the victim from one place to another, and failed to prove that the victim was abducted with the intent to inflict physical injury upon her as required under \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u201cWhen a verdict is challenged because of insufficient evidence, the issue is whether \u2018 \u201c \u2018the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 691, 495 A.2d 273 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). Appellate analysis of a claim of insufficiency of the evidence requires us to undertake a twofold task: We must first review the evidence construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 468, 534 A.2d 230 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>194 Conn. 198, 206, 479 A.2d 237 (1984); <em>State v. D'Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 421, 441 A.2d 846 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>182 Conn. 603, 606, 438 A.2d 1149 (1981). \u2018 \u201c \u2018We then determine whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . . . \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 458, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>203 Conn. 641, 665-66, 526 A.2d 1283 (1987), and cases cited therein.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>308-309, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">As noted in part I of this opinion, the jury could reasonably have concluded that, by dragging the victim across the road and onto a grassy patch off the road, the defendant moved the victim from one place to another. Furthermore, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the defendant intended to inflict physical injury upon the victim. Specifically, \u201c \u2018[ijntent may be, and usually is, inferred from conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>174 Conn. 22, 26, 381 A.2d 539 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 164, 319 A.2d 381 (1972). In this case, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the defendant intended to inflict physical injury upon the victim by: (1) dragging her off the road; (2) throwing her down to the ground; (3) pinning her down with one hand while locking his hand around her jaw in such a way that she \u201cthought he was trying to rip [her] jaw off\u201d; (4) pressing a cloth up against her nose and mouth in such a way that she \u201cfelt as if [she] was being smothered\u201d; and (5) raising his hand as if he were about to strike her.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In sum, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the evidence presented in this case established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The defendant also argues that the state\u2019s use of his <em>post-Miranda </em>refusal to sign his transcribed statement violated his constitution\u00e1l rights. Despite the defendant\u2019s failure to voice an objection at trial, this claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 486, 556 A.2d 154 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 462. In particular, the defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his failure to sign his statement constituted a violation of his right to remain silent and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>right to due process as guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Specifically, on the day of his arrest, the defendant gave a tape recorded statement to Dinello in which he claimed that he did not attack the victim, but rather, accidently \u201cstaggered\u201d into her. The statement was transcribed overnight, and the next day Dinello again met with the defendant. Dinello advised the defendant of his rights and the defendant signed \u201can acknowledgement of his rights.\u201d At this point, however, the defendant refused to sign his transcribed statement. During closing argument, the prosecutor twice made reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to sign his statement. Specifically, in an attempt to impeach the defendant\u2019s statement, the prosecutor, after denigrating the statement in its particulars, stated: \u201c[A]nd when [the statement] is ultimately transcribed, he won\u2019t sign it.\u201d Later, while contrasting the credibility of the victim with that of the defendant, the prosecutor stated: \u201cI think it\u2019s also interesting to note that you have two versions, one on tape and one on a written statement, or a transcribed statement by [the victim], and it\u2019s a signed statement as the truth. The defendant was not willing to sign his version as the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-18, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), \u201cthe United States Supreme Court held that the impeachment of a defendant through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process. The court based its holding in two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important, it observed that \u2018while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 465-66; see <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 290-92, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In the present case, the defendant had been arrested and had received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings when he chose not to sign his statement. He thus clearly manifested his exercise of his right to remain silent. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valencia, </em>773 F.2d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir. 1985) (declining to sign a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form is equivalent to an assertion of the right to silence); <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>878 F.2d 1562, 1564-65 (1st Cir. 1989) (invocation of right to remain silent must be given liberal construction); <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 422, 426, 76 S. Ct. 497, 100 L. Ed. 511 (1956) (right to remain silent must \u201cnot be interpreted in a hostile or niggardly spirit\u201d). Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s silence to impeach his statement was \u201cfundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process . . . .\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 618; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Having concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s failure to sign his statement was error, we must next consider whether such error was harmful. When error is of constitutional dimension, the state has the burden of proving it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24-26, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>207 Conn. 1, 9, 540 A.2d 659 (1988). \u201cThe test for harmfulness is whether \u2018there is a reasonable possibility that the improperly admitted evidence contributed to the conviction . . . . \u2019 <em>Schneble </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S. Ct. 1056, 31 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Hoeplinger, </em>206 Conn. 278, 294, 537 A.2d 1010 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 751-52, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). \u2018 \u201cThe harmlessness of an error depends upon its impact on the trier and the result, not upon whether the particular evidence involved was legally essential to support the finding.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>supra, 295 . . . . \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018A Doyle </em>violation may, in a particular case, be so insignificant that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible question or comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence following a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Under such circumstances, the state\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence does not constitute reversible error.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 781, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987). \u2018 \u201cThe [error] has similarly been [found to be harmless] where a prosecutor does not focus upon or highlight the defendant\u2019s silence in his cross-examination and closing remarks and where the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not strike at the \u2018jugular\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s story.\u201d \u2019 Id.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>546 F.2d 583, 594 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 906, 97 S. Ct. 1701, 52 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellegrino, </em>194 Conn. 279, 292, 480 A.2d 537 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>177 Conn. 545, 555, 418 A.2d 917 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Our examination of the record in the present case persuades us that the prosecutor did not \u201cfocus upon\u201d or \u201chighlight\u201d the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence. Furthermore, we conclude that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible comments by the prosecutor during his closing argument. In particular, the prosecutor only made two references to the defendant\u2019s failure to sign his transcribed statement. Clearly, these references were not the centerpiece of the state\u2019s case. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>defendant failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his failure to sign his statement. The failure of an attorney to object or to move for a mistrial indicates that he did not consider the prosecutor\u2019s comments to have substantially prejudiced his client. <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra, 782; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">On the present record, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks could not have played a significant role in the defendant\u2019s conviction. Prior to the state\u2019s closing argument, the jury had already been made aware of the fact that the defendant had not signed his statement. In particular, Dinello, in testifying as to the sequence of events surrounding the taking of the defendant\u2019s statement, stated that the defendant had refused to sign his statement. We have held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence that is not used to impeach, but rather is presented to show the investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded, is not inadmissible under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>supra. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 183, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>177 Conn. 487, 499, 418 A.2d 870, vacated and remanded on other grounds, 444 U.S. 893, 100 S. Ct. 199, 62 L. Ed. 2d 129, on remand, 179 Conn. 761, 409 A.2d 149 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant\u2019s statement had already been significantly impeached by the fact that, prior to making his statement, the defendant had given a contradictory version to the police of the nature of his involvement in the incident. Thus, given that the prosecutor did not \u201chighlight\u201d the defendant\u2019s refusal to sign his statement, that the defendant\u2019s statement had already been significantly impeached, that the jury already knew of the defendant\u2019s failure to sign his statement, and that the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s references to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>refusal to sign his statement, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting a portion of his statement that was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. In particular, he complains that the trial court should not have permitted the jury to hear the tape recording of his statement in its entirety. Prior to its admission, the defendant moved to redact portions of the statement wherein he referred to his use of drugs and alcohol. Specifically, the defendant objected to the admission of the following portions of his statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201cQ. Have you been in this park previous to this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">\u201cA. I was there\u2014I was there about a month ago and this\u2014there was one other time that I was there just sitting right on the bench. I went down there with my cousin, one of my cousins one day, and we just sat there and got high, but we used to like go out there and get high because like, you know, the Police don\u2019t be messing with you out there if you like, ya know, just sitting out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">\u201cQ. Are you in the customary habit of using either alcohol or drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">\u201cQ. Which, both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-14\">\u201cQ. What type of drugs do you use, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-15\">\u201cA. Urn,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-16\">\u201cQ. Do you consider you an addict at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cQ. How much drugs do you use on a daily average?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201cA. It goes oh all day and all night. Far as how much I use, I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t really, I don\u2019t really know. I just use enough to keep me\u2014I just function off it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The defendant argued that these portions of his statement were irrelevant and prejudical, and moved for their redaction. The trial court, however, denied his motion, noting that his statements were voluntary and relevant to show the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the area was not patrolled by the police. The defendant then duly noted his exception to the court\u2019s ruling. We were not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s disagreement with the trial court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe court has a wide discretion in its rulings on the relevancy of evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Saia, </em>167 Conn. 286, 291, 355 A.2d 88 [1974]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carnegie, </em>158 Conn. 264, 273, 259 A.2d 628, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 992, 90 S. Ct. 488, 24 L. Ed. 2d 455 [1969]; and in determining whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial tendency. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>[167 Conn. 408, 417, 356 A.2d 147 (1974)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 597, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 [1973]. \u2018In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. <em>DiPalma </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>163 Conn. 293, 298, 303 A.2d 709 [1972]. Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>159 Conn. 477, 480, 271 A.2d 62 [1970] . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 458, 464, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the challenged portions of the defendant\u2019s statement, as these portions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>indeed probative of the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the area was not patrolled by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-92. kidnapping in the first degree.
