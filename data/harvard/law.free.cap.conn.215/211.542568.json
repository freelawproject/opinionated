The plaintiff, Katherine M. Mulrooney, brought an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident involving the defendant, Christie Wambolt. During the discovery procedures, the defendant failed to disclose in her answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories that she intended to call Franklin Robinson, a neurologist, as an expert witness. It was not until jury selection, when the defendant\u2019s counsel announced his intent to call Robinson as a witness, that the plaintiff was notified that Robinson would be called as an expert. On the first day of testimony, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine to preclude the defendant from calling Robinson as an expert, which the trial court granted. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The following facts are undisputed. On January 11, 1983, the plaintiff was proceeding in a northerly direction on South Grove Street in Meriden when she collided with the defendant\u2019s automobile traveling in an easterly direction on West Main Street. The accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant in the operation of her motor vehicle. In the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, filed July 20,1989, she alleged that she had suffered and would continue to suffer injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of her chest, cervical spine, shoulder region and shock to her nervous system. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that, as a result of these injuries, she had incurred and would incur medical and hospital expenses and would be unable to perform household and occupational duties as she did prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In November, 1985, the defendant requested, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 229, that the plaintiff submit to an independent medical examination on January 21, 1986, to be conducted by Robinson. On January 22, 1986, Robinson forwarded a detailed report to the defendant. The case was claimed to the trial list on February 4, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The plaintiff served her first set of interrogatories and requests for production on the defendant on March 27, 1987. On April 24, 1987, the defendant filed her objections to this disclosure request and filed a motion to extend the time to answer. The record does not disclose that any action was taken on the defendant\u2019s objections to the plaintiff\u2019s first set of interrogatories<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, therefore, we assume that the plaintiff withdrew the first set.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The plaintiff filed notice that she had served the defendant with a second set of interrogatories and requests for production on May 14, 1987. On July 15, 1987, the plaintiff filed a motion for \u201cRule 231 orders\u201d to compel the defendant to answer the plaintiff\u2019s second set of interrogatories and requests for production. The trial court, <em>Burns, J., </em>on August 31, 1987, ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>a default to be entered if the defendant did not answer by September 14, 1987. On September 21, 1987, the trial court, <em>Flanagan, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for an extension of time to October 14, 1987, to answer the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories and requests for production. Following a pretrial conference, the plaintiff filed a second motion for \u201cRule 231 orders\u201d on January 11, 1988, at which time the trial court, <em>Burns, J., </em>ordered the defendant to answer the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories within two weeks from January 11, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On February 9,1988, the defendant filed her answers to the plaintiff\u2019s second set of interrogatories and requests for production. Interrogatory No. 2 requested the defendant to give the name of any expert the defendant expected to call as a witness, state the subject matter of his testimony, and summarize each of his opinions. The defendant responded: \u201cNo expert contemplated at this time.\u201d In response to a request to produce any medical reports of experts concerning the plaintiff, the defendant furnished a copy of Robinson\u2019s medical report.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On May 3,1988, the defendant filed a request to have the plaintiff submit to an independent medical examination to be conducted by another physician, Alan H. Goodman, and the plaintiff filed an objection on the ground that she had already been examined by an independent medical examiner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> selected by the defendant. On May 23, 1988, the trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">During jury selection, on June 29,1989, the defendant\u2019s counsel for the first time announced his intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to call Robinson as an expert witness. On the day testimony began, July 17, 1989, the plaintiff made a motion in limine to preclude the defendant from calling Robinson to testify as an expert. The trial court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion on the basis of Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case proceeded to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>on the issue of damages and the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $191,926.53 for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court (1) erred in applying Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D), and (2) abused its discretion in precluding the defendant from calling Robinson to testify as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We must first address the threshold question of whether the trial court erred in applying Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D). Section 220 (D) became effective eight months after the case was claimed to the trial list. The defendant asserts that, although procedural amendments to the Practice Book apply to pending cases, an amendment should not apply if considerations of \u201cgood sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied.\u201d The defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s application of \u00a7 220 (D) infringed upon her ability to defend the claim against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">It is generally presumed that legislation is intended to operate prospectively \u201c[ejxcept as to amending statutes that are procedural in their impact . . . <em>\"Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 571, 440 A.2d 220 (1981); <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 467, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). Procedural statutes and rules of practice ordinarily apply \u201cretroactively to all actions whether pending or not at the time the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>[or rule] became effective, in the absence of any expressed intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 196, 286 A.2d 308 (1971); <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 509, 525, 562 A.2d 1100 (1989); <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra; <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hartford, Corporation, </em>180 Conn. 545, 556-57, 429 A.2d 796 (1980). We have noted, however, that a procedural statute will not be applied \u201c \u2018 \u201cretroactively if considerations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied.\u201d. . . <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel Co., </em>157 Conn. 92, 96, 249 A.2d 58 [1968].\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>[174 Conn. 219, 223, 384 A.2d 378 (1978)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 741, 517 A.2d 610 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 350, 456 A.2d 305 (1983). Rules of statutory construction pertaining to the application of statutory enactments and amendments apply with equal force to Practice Book rules. See <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Trantolo, </em>192 Conn. 15, 22, 470 A.2d 228 (1984); <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hartford Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Section 220 was enacted in 1978 following the repeal of General Statutes \u00a7 52-159 (a) in 1976 which had provided that a plaintiff could not be compelled to disclose the names and reports of his expert witness. 1 W. Moller, Connecticut Practice \u00a7 220 (D). Paragraph (D) was added eight years later over \u201cvociferous\u201d bar opposition and became effective October 1, 1986. Id. Paragraph (D) is a procedural rule that sets out a time limitation for each party in a civil action to disclose the name of an expert witness he intends to use, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. A plaintiff must disclose this information within sixty days from the date the case is claimed to a trial list and a defendant must do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>within 120 days from such date. If a party fails to disclose the name of any expert expected to testify at trial, \u201csuch expert shall not testify except in the discretion of the court for good cause shown.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Since the case was claimed to a trial list on February 4, 1986, eight months prior to the effective date of the rule, the defendant could not have satisfied the time constraints in \u00a7 220 (D). The defendant does not, however, offer any reason why she did not comply with the rule within the two years and nine months that elapsed between October 1, 1986, the effective date of the rule, and June 29,1989, when the defendant\u2019s counsel during jury selection first announced his intent to call Robinson as a witness. Although the defendant\u2019s counsel has characterized in his brief his failure to disclose as an \u201cinadvertent omission,\u201d the defendant\u2019s counsel, during oral argument before this court, stated that it was a policy of his firm not to disclose independent medical examinations and it was a practice he had seen with other firms. Such an admission is equivalent to a wilful disregard of the rules of practice. If a party to an action chooses to disregard the rules of practice any claimed \u201cinjustice\u201d that has occurred through the imposition of a sanction is the result of the party\u2019s own failure to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Furthermore, the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s retroactive application of Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D). Section 220 (D) provides a sanction similar to that provided in Practice Book \u00a7 231, which has been in effect since 1931. Section 231 provides in part that \u201c[i]f any party has failed to answer interrogatories or to answer them fairly, or has intentionally answered them falsely or in a manner calculated to mislead . . . or has failed to comply with the provisions of Sec. 232 . . . the court may, on motion . . . [enter] an order prohibiting the party who has failed to comply from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>introducing designated matters in evidence.\u201d In the plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine she argued that the defendant should be precluded from calling Robinson as an expert witness on the basis of \u00a7\u00a7 220 (D) and 231. In particular, the plaintiff argued under \u00a7 231 that the defendant\u2019s disclosure, i.e., \u201c[n]o expert contemplated at this time,\u201d was misleading and unfair. Although the trial court entered its order precluding the defendant from calling Robinson as an expert witness under \u00a7 220 (D), it could have imposed a similiar sanction under \u00a7 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The trial court was undoubtedly persuaded by \u201csome indicia present of a misleading character to the disclosures that were filed\u201d in response to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories. The trial court found that it \u201cappear[s] that the plaintiff [was] . . . lulled into thinking that the defendant had not intended to use\u201d Robinson as an expert. Prior to entering its order the trial court further found that \u201cgiven the statement that there was 'no expert contemplated\u2019 rather than that 'this would be determined at some other time\u2019 ... it is appropriate to apply . . . section 220.\u201d The trial court was also authorized by \u00a7 231 to preclude the defendant from calling Robinson as an expert witness for failure to answer the interrogatories fairly or for answering the interrogatories in a manner calculated to mislead. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>7 Conn. App. 514, 509 A.2d 552 (1986); <em>Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>2 Conn. App. 103, 476 A.2d 1074 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In addition, although the trial court did not explicitly mention Practice Book \u00a7 232,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>1975 and was therefore effective at the time the plaintiff filed her action, it could have found that the defendant had failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 232 and, therefore, could have precluded the defendant\u2019s expert witness from testifying by imposing the sanction available under \u00a7 231.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 232 required the defendant to supplement and correct her answer to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories, in particular, interrogatory Nos. 2, 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c), pertaining to the name, subject matter and substance of any opinion of any expert that the defendant expected to call at trial. This rule plainly applied to her answer to those interrogatories, \u201c[n]o expert contemplated at this time.\u201d The defendant\u2019s failure to correct and supplement her answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories authorized the trial court to impose any of the sanctions provided in \u00a7 231, which include \u201can order prohibiting the party who has failed to comply from introducing designated matters in evidence.\u201d The defendant was not prejudiced, therefore, by the trial court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 220 (D), even if it were not intended to be applied retroactively, to preclude the defendant from calling Robinson to testify as an expert when a similar sanction was available to the trial court under rules in effect at the time the plaintiff brought her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant has failed to offer any reasonable explanation for not complying with the disclosure requirements of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 220 (D), 231 and 232. The trial court, therefore, was authorized to impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>sanctions prescribed by those rules, which include prohibiting the introduction of certain evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The defendant next contends that the trial court abused its discretion in using such a severe sanction as barring Robinson from testifying as an expert witness. The defendant asserts that the trial court could not reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff would have been prejudiced or that she had been misled by the defendant\u2019s failure to disclose Robinson as an expert witness because she was aware of the substance of his report and failed to depose him after she became aware that he was to be called as an expert witness during the two weeks that elapsed between jury selection and the commencement of testimony. She contends that the plaintiff was adequately prepared to cross-examine Robinson on the matters covered in his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s decision on whether to impose the sanction of excluding the testimony of a party\u2019s expert witness rests within the court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>209 Conn. 536, 541, 551 A.2d 1254 (1989); <em>Rullo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>208 Conn. 74, 78, 543 A.2d 279 (1988); <em>Filisko </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>176 Conn. 33, 39-40, 404 A.2d 889 (1978). In reviewing a claim that the court has abused this discretion, \u201c \u2018great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness . . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Rokus </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>191 Conn. 62, 72, 463 A.2d 252 (1983); <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra; <em>Rullo </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>supra, 74-75. The determinative question for an appellate court is not whether it would have imposed a similar sanction but whether the trial court could reasonably conclude as it did given the facts presented. \u201cNever will the case on appeal look as it does to a [trial court] . . . faced with the need to impose reasonable bounds and order on discovery.\u201d <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Eaton Corporation, </em>825 F.2d 448, 452 (D.C. Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The trial court did find, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions, that the plaintiff was prejudiced by the late disclosure in that she was \u201clulled into thinking that the defendant had not intended to use\u201d Robinson as an expert witness. The court did not rely primarily upon prejudice, however, but upon its express finding of a \u201cmisleading character to the disclosures\u201d made by the defendant. The court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the failure to disclose was not inadvertent but deliberate was confirmed by the statement of the defendant\u2019s counsel, mentioned previously, that it had been his firm\u2019s policy not to disclose \u201cindependent medical examinations.\u201d It is also supported by the absence of any claim during argument of the motion in limine that the failure to respond fully concerning the defendant\u2019s intention to use an expert witness had been inadvertent. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the defendant intentionally failed to disclose Robinson as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>expert witness and, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by imposing the sanction of precluding him from testifying.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Trial court \u201cjudges face great difficulties in controlling discovery procedures which all too often are abused by one side or the other\u201d and this court should \u201csupport the trial judges\u2019 reasonable use of sanctions to control discovery.\u201d <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Eaton </em>Corporation, supra, 452. The United States Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthe most severe in the spectrum of sanctions provided by statute or rule must be available to the [trial] court ... to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, [and] to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\u201d <em>National Hockey League </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 639, 643, 96 S. Ct. 2778, 49 L. Ed. 2d 747, reh. denied, 429 U.S. 874, 97 S. Ct. 196, 50 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1976); <em>Pavlinko </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 138, 145, 470 A.2d 246 (1984). The sanctions provided in our rules of practice are there for several reasons, including deterrence of those who intentionally flout them.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-11\"> The plaintiff\u2019s first set of interrogatories and requests for production concerning expert and medical reports involved interrogatory Nos. 8 and 12 to which the defendant objected on the ground that they required disclosure of an attorney\u2019s work product. Interrogatory Nos. 21, 22 and 23 requested the defendant to state the name, subject matter, and substance of the testimony of any expert witness the defendant expected to call at trial, to which the defendant did not file an objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> The term \u201cindependent medical examiner\u201d has been used by the parties in their briefs to refer to a physician employed by one of the parties to examine a personal injury claimant for the purpose of testifying at trial concerning the extent of his injuries and not simply for the purpose of treating the claimant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> During oral argument before this court the plaintiff maintained that the trial court had based its decision on Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 220 (D) and 231. Nowhere in the trial court\u2019s oral decision does the court explicitly mention \u00a7 231, although in argument before the trial court the plaintiff did claim that both \u00a7\u00a7231 and 220 (D) authorized the court to grant her motion. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant filed a motion for articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision. In any event, this court may rely upon different grounds from those relied upon by the trial court for the purpose of affirming the judgment. <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>204 Conn. 224, 232, 527 A.2d 1184 (1987); <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 292, 524 A.2d 629 (1987); <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>New Britain Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>175 Conn. 8, 14, 392 A.2d 481 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D) provides: \u201cIn addition to and notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section, any plaintiff expecting to call an expert witness at trial shall disclose the name of that expert, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion, to all other parties within 60 days from the date the case is claimed to a trial list.

During oral argument before this court, the defendant referred to <em>Welhelm </em>v. <em>Czuczka, </em>19 Conn. App. 36, 561 A.2d 146 (1989), <em>Voight v. Selman, </em>14 Conn. App. 198, 540 A.2d 104 (1988), and <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>12 Conn. App. 632, 533 A.2d 884 (1987), for the proposition that treating physicians are not the type of \u201cexpert\u201d contemplated under \u00a7 220 (D) and, because an independent examining physician\u2019s testimony is similar to a \u201ctreating physician\u2019s\u201d testimony, he should similarly not be considered an \u201cexpert\u201d under the rule. Thus, he contends, because Robinson is an independent medical examiner, he was not required to disclose his intent to call him as an expert witness under \u00a7 220 (D). A careful review of those cases cited by the defendant clearly indicates that they do not support the defendant\u2019s argument. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>7 Conn. App. 514, 518, 509 A.2d 552 (1986). Because we conclude that this issue lacks merit and neither party has briefed the issue on appeal, we need not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\"> The defendant further contends that the plaintiff was not prejudiced or surprised by the defendant\u2019s late disclosure of Robinson as an expert witness because the plaintiff herself disclosed in her answers to the defendant\u2019s interrogatories that she intended to call Robinson as an expert witness and, therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in precluding Robinson from testifying. In the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental answers to the defendant\u2019s interrogatories filed April 9, 1987, she stated: \u201cThe plaintiff expects to call as expert witnesses all her medical doctors whose bills and reports are included and any medical doctors employed by the defense, depending upon their availability at the time of trial.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s disclosure was required under Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D) if the plaintiff intended to call any of the expert witnesses employed by the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s disclosure does not relieve the defendant from complying with \u00a7 220 (D). Section 220 (D) requires <em>both </em>parties in an action to disclose the name of any expert witness they expect to call at trial. The defendant cannot rely on the plaintiff\u2019s proper disclosure for her failure to comply with \u00a7 220 (D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
