On appeal, he argues that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because his prior convictions under section 893.18(1) of the Florida Statutes were not \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d within the meaning of the career offender provision, as the Florida statute lacks the mens rea element of the generic offense. We reject Tracy\u2019s argument and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). A defendant is a career offender if, among other things, he has at least two prior felony convictions for a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-26\">means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Florida law punishes the sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, of cocaine as a second-degree felony. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Doing the same within 1000 feet of a church or convenience store is a first-degree felony. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(e)(l). Selling, manufacturing, delivering, or possessing with the intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, marijuana is a third-degree felony. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2). First-degree felonies are punishable by up to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(b)(l); second-degree felonies are punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(d); and third-degree felonies are punishable by up to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">We have previously determined in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267-68 (2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2827, \u2014- L.Ed.2d (2015), that a conviction under section 893.13(1) is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b). A prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting en banc. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Tracy\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court properly sentenced him as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-10\">. Tracy cited to <em>Smith </em>in his brief, adopting the argument set forth in the Petition for Rehearing En Banc from that case. In addition to the Supreme Court denying certiorari in <em>Smith, </em>this Court denied Rehearing En Banc on February 18, 2015.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
