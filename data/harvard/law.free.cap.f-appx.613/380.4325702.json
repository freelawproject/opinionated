Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 458, 458-62 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 185 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). In <em>Teran-Salas, </em>we determined that the appellant was not entitled to relief based merely on the existence of a theoretical possibility that a defendant could be convicted under Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(a) for conduct that would not qualify as a federal drug trafficking offense. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 458. Acosta-Juarez has not demonstrated \u201ca realistic probability that Texas would prosecute under an \u2018administering\u2019 theory in a way that does not also constitute either \u2018dispensing5 or \u2018distributing\u2019 under the federal sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Acosta-Juarez also raises an argument that is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 19, 2015) (No. 14-10355). In <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d at 204-05, we held that an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for a prior conviction of a drug trafficking offense is warranted regardless whether the conviction for the prior offense required proof of remuneration or commercial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
