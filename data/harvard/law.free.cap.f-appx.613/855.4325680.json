Ciccotto did not appeal, and his conviction therefore became final on October 7, 2010. Ciccotto accordingly had until October 7, 2011 \u2014 one year after his conviction became final \u2014 to move the District Court for relief from his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1253 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">On September 12, 2011, Ciccotto, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence on four separate grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the first, he noted that he \u201cwas never given direct access\u201d to his attorney and that the jailhouse meetings he had with that attorney \u201cseemed scripted\u201d and made Ciccotto uncomfortable. Ciccotto noted that he was only able to voice concerns to his counsel in the days leading up to his sentencing hearing, and even then, he had to do so through a third party. In ground two, Ciccotto stated that his sentence \u201cwas much too harsh with no chance of rehabilitation or restitution\u201d given that Ciccotto had no prior arrests, had fully cooperated with law enforcement, and had possessed \u201cdoctors [sic] evaluations in my favor.\u201d In ground three, Ciccotto stated that his attorney repeatedly told him that a plea bargain \u201cwould be my best chance at a more lenient sentence\u201d because any trial would invite a media circus and that \u201cgoing to trial would be the same as child abuse.\u201d Finally, in ground four, Ciccotto protested the Government\u2019s challenge to the qualifications of the doctor whose evaluation Cic-cotto relied upon during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">On February 16, 2012, Ciccotto, through counsel, amended his motion. Ciccotto moved to strike \u201cGrounds One, Three, Four and Two [of the September 12, 2011, motion] in their entirety.\u201d In their stead, he presented eleven claims,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nine based upon the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel and two based upon the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Of particular import here are claims 1, 10, and 11. Claim 1 asserted that trial counsel was ineffective because he \u201cfail[ed] to request a competency evaluation.\u201d Claim 10 argued that the trial court erred by not ordering a competency evaluation. Finally, claim 11 asserted that the trial court additionally erred \u201cby not fully considering [Ciccotto\u2019s] mental health, background, ability, to benefit from therapy, comparable sentences, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>[Ciccotto\u2019s] family support during the sentencing hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The amended motion was untimely. In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B), the District Court declined to consider the merits of claims 1, 10, and 11 of the amended motion after concluding that they did not relate back to the claims asserted in Ciccotto\u2019s September 12, 2011, motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In declining to consider these claims, the District Court noted that Ciccotto\u2019s original motion \u201cneither raise[d] his competency as an issue ..., nor ... assert[ed] that the trial court erred by failing to order a competency evaluation or by failing to consider mental health evidence during the sentencing proceedings.\u201d The District Court additionally declined to consider claims 3 through 9 on the basis of Ciccotto\u2019s valid appeal waiver. Finally, the District Court denied claim 2 on the merits. In addition to denying Ciccotto\u2019s motion in its entirety, the District Court also denied Ciccotto a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Ciccotto appealed, and we granted a COA with respect to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that claims 1, 10, and 11 should not be considered because they did not relate back to Ciccotto\u2019s original, timely motion. Specifically, we granted a COA to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-6\">Whether the \u2018relation back\u2019 doctrine applies to Mr. Ciccotto\u2019s claims in his amended \u00a7 2255 motion that (1) trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to demand a competency evaluation; (2) the trial court violated his Fifth Amendment rights by failing to order a competency evaluation; and (3) the trial court violated his Fifth Amendment rights by failing to consider the [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the flaws in the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">We review applications of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) to \u00a7 2255 motions for abuse of discretion. <em>Davenport v. United States, </em>217 F.3d 1341, 1343 n. 4 (11th Cir.2000). A district court abuses it discretion when its decision rests on an erroneous application of the law or is based on facts that are clearly erroneous. <em>Rodriguez v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Cor)., </em>748 F.3d 1073, 1075 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an amended pleading relates back to the timing of an earlier pleading when \u201cthe amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(B). In the habeas context, it is not enough for the later pleading to concern the same legal proceeding as the original motion. <em>Mayle v. Felix, </em>545 U.S. 644, 662-64, 125 S.Ct. 2562, 2573-74, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>162 L.Ed.2d 582 (2005). Rather, to relate back, the original and amended pleadings must \u201cstate claims that are tied to a common core of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 125 S.Ct. at 2574. \u201cWhen the nature of the amended claim supports specifically the original claim, the facts there alleged implicate the original claim, even if the original claim contained insufficient facts to support it.\u201d <em>Dean v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 1218, 1222 (11th Cir.2002). That is, one may amend a claim to \u201cfill in facts missing from the original claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">We agree that claims 1 and 10 \u2014 the competency-related claims in Ciccotto\u2019s amended motion \u2014 do not relate back to Ciccotto\u2019s initial motion. Nowhere in any of the four grounds is there any suggestion that Ciccotto was actually incompetent to stand trial or sufficiently close to incompetence such that an evaluation would be necessary. Here, there was no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We do not agree, however, that claim 11 does not relate back to the original motion. In \u201cground two\u201d of the original motion, Ciccotto wrote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMgZ\">[i]t is also my opinion that in my case, no prior arrests, full cooperation with law enforcement and doctors [sic] evaluations in my favor that this sentence was much to [sic] harsh with no chance of rehabilitation or restitution give to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">In claim 11 of the amended motion, Ciccot-to argued that \u201c[t]he court erred at sentencing in not fully considering petitioner\u2019s background, mental health, ability to benefit from therapy, comparable sentences, family support in what was essentially a summary sentence hearing.\u201d Like the original claim, claim 11 asserts that Ciccot-to\u2019s sentence was unduly harsh given the existence of various mitigating circumstances; that is, \u201cthe nature of the amended claim supports specifically the original claim.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Dean, </em>278 F.3d at 1222. That Ciccotto provided additional factual support in claim 11 to buttress his argument is of no moment. <em>See id. </em>at 1222. The District Court\u2019s conclusion that claim 11 of the amended motion did not relate back to the original motion was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this case to the District Court to determine whether Ciccotto\u2019s claim 11 is otherwise procedurally barred,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and if it is not, to evaluate claim ll\u2019s merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-12\">. Ciccotto had previously faced an indictment charging him with three counts of enticing children for the purpose of producing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) (Count One); distributing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(B) and (b)(1) (Count Two); and possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2) (Count Three). He pleaded guilty to the information pursuant to a plea agreement in which the Government agreed to dismiss the indictment and to refrain from prosecuting him for other crimes related to the charged criminal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Ciccotto appears to have filed this motion using an old version of AO 243, a form for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions currently available on-uscourts.gov. <em>See </em>Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, AO 243: Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct a Sentence By a Person in Federal Custody (rev. Jan.2015), <em>available at </em>http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/ Forms/A0243.pdf. The form Ciccotto used directed him to provide \u201c[s]upporting facts\u201d and to refrain from \u201dargu[ing] or cit[ing] law.\u201d The most current form bears the same admonition: \"Do not argue or cite law. Just state the specific facts that support your claim.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>AO 243, at 5.-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-11\">. Ciccotto's amended motion organized his claims into two groups based upon the relevant constitutional right. The District Court further subdivided these groups and ultimately identified eleven separate claims. Although we modified the District Court\u2019s numbering in our Certificate of Appealability (\"COA\u201d), the COA\u2019s claims 1, 10, and 11 \u2014 the only claims relevant to this appeal \u2014 are substantively identical to the District Court\u2019s claims 1, 10, and 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. The District Court also found that claims 10 and 11 would be procedurally barred even if they did relate back to the original motion. This is because Ciccotto did not advance those claims on direct appeal of his conviction and could demonstrate neither cause and prejudice for his failure to raise those claims on direct appeal, nor that a constitutional violation resulted in Ciccotto's conviction despite his actual innocence. <em>See Mills v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1052, 1055 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\">. To avoid any confusion, we stress that the COA concerns a factual question: whether claims 1, 10, and 11 \"arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(B). The COA <em>does not </em>ask whether claims 1, 10, and 11 are cognizable <em>regardless </em>of whether they arose out of the original pleading, i.e., whether they relate back. Our justification for granting the COA makes this manifest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALnC\">Because reasonable jurists could disagree about whether Claims 1, 10, and 11 in the amended \u00a7 2255 motion (1) state valid claims of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) relate back to the original <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Ciccotto is hereby granted a COA....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. It is true that Ciccotto only cited to the Due Process Clause in his amended motion. We decline to fault him, however, for failing to specify a legal rationale for why his \u201csentence was much to [sic] harsh\u201d when the form the Administrative Office provided to him forbid as much. <em>See supra, </em>note 2. The form envisions that judges will divine claims arising from factual recitations. It does not seem unreasonable to us that a sentence might be too harsh if Ciccotto\u2019s due process rights were violated during a sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b887-12\">. We are limited to discussing those issues raised in the COA, and, having found that claims 1 and 10 do not relate back to the original motion while claim 11 does relate back to that motion, our task is complete. We do, however, note that the District Court found that, even if claim 11 <em>did </em>relate back to the original motion, it would be procedurally barred. This alternative holding may be of some significance on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
