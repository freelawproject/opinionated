Because the district court dismissed the motion without reaching the merits, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-21\">Gage brought suit under the False Claims Act against Davis S.R. Aviation, L.L.C.; Challenger Repair Group, L.L.C.; Orion Air Group, L.L.C.; Bombardier, Inc.; Northrop Grumman Corp. and related entities; and Steve Davis (collectively, the defendants).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the case with prejudice for Gage\u2019s failure to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and this court affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal was pending before the prior panel, Gage filed a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from final judgment claiming the discovery of new evidence and requesting the district court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>inspection of particular documents. While the appeal was still pending, the district court dismissed the Rule 60 motion \u201cas this case is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which has jurisdiction therein.\u201d Gage now appeals the dismissal of his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-22\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">We generally review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of-the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Gage argues that the district court was required to consider the merits of his motion and that its failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion. The defendants concede that the pendency of an appeal is not, by itself, a basis for dismissal but contend that there are alternative grounds to support the dismissal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">When a notice of appeal is filed, jurisdiction is transferred to the court of appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As this court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">[w]hen a Rule 60(b) motion is filed while an appeal is pending, this circuit, along with other circuits and the commentators, has expressly recognized the power of the district court to consider on the merits and deny a 60(b) motion filed after a notice of appeal, because the district court\u2019s action is in furtherance of the appeal. When the district court is inclined to grant the 60(b) motion, however, then it is necessary to obtain the leave of the court of appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">The district court \u201cdoes not have the option simply to deny the motion, without considering it on its merits.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">This court has previously reversed (or vacated) the denial of a 60(b) motion and remanded to the district court when the district court erroneously denied the motion without reaching the merits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the district court need not seek leave to consider a Rule 60(b) motion even after appellate review is finished.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND to the district court for consideration of Gage\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
