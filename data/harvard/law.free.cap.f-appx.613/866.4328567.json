Howard\u2019s complaint stemmed from an incident in a municipal building that led to her arrest and conviction for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Hudson and against Howard\u2019s claims of false arrest and a denial of due process. But the district court denied Hudson qualified immunity from Howard\u2019s claim of excessive force and statutory immunity from Howard\u2019s claim of assault and battery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Hudson met with Howard, her brother, and her son, Brandon Robinson, to resolve a complaint against Robinson. The situation became tense when Howard\u2019s brother suggested that Hudson was engaging in partisan politics, and Howard\u2019s brother terminated the meeting by leaying Hudson\u2019s office. Hudson ordered officers to arrest Robinson and, after Howard condemned Hudson\u2019s decision, he arrested Howard for disorderly conduct. Later, Howard was convicted of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Hudson and Howard presented conflicting accounts of what transpired. Howard portrayed Hudson as an aggressor. Howard averred that she was \u201cshovefd]\u201d twice by Hudson in his office when she stepped between her brother and Hudson, and after she \u201ccriticizfed]\u201d Hudson for arresting Robinson, Hudson grabbed and twisted Howard\u2019s arm. Howard asked to be released, but Hudson threatened to taser her. Without explanation, Hudson \u201cdrug\u201d Howard through the police station and \u201cpushed [her] into a desk,\u201d which caused her to hit her head on a computer monitor. Hudson and Howard \u201cstrugglefd],\u201d and she struck her head on a second desk and fell to the floor with Hudson. After Hudson told Howard that she was \u201cgoing to jail,\u201d she \u201csurrendered\u201d to a deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">Hudson and several eyewitnesses submitted affidavits establishing that Howard was combative and that Hudson used minimal force to control Howard. According to Hudson, he did not make physical contact with Howard during the meeting in his office; he attempted to follow Howard\u2019s brother out the door of his office, but Howard obstructed his path; and he touched Howard only as required to circumnavigate her. When Hudson instructed officers to arrest Robinson, Howard accosted Hudson, and Hudson ordered Howard to sit in his office and to calm down, but she refused to comply. Hudson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>arrested Howard for disorderly conduct. Because Hudson did not have handcuffs, he clutched Howard\u2019s arm to steer her from his office through the City Clerk\u2019s office en route to the jail. Howard resisted violently, messed up desks in the Clerk\u2019s office, and fell to the floor with Hudson, all the while screaming obscenities. In the meantime, Hudson remained composed and held Howard\u2019s arm firmly to prevent her from fleeing until another officer arrived to relieve him of Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The district court ruled that genuine disputes of material fact barred summary judgment against Howard\u2019s claims of excessive force and assault and battery. The district court denied Howard qualified immunity on the claim of excessive force because of the \u201cvigorous dispute as to <em>the amount </em>and <em>level/seventy of force </em>used by Chief Hudson and even whether he was making an arrest when the physical contact began.\u201d The district court also denied Hudson statutory immunity on Howard\u2019s claim of assault and battery based on the conflicting evidence about whether \u201cHudson acted willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>See Surrency v. Harbison, </em>489 So.2d 1097, 1104 (Ala.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity. <em>Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, </em>707 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence establishes that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the mov-ant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>To make that determination, we construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Hudson contests the denial of qualified immunity with respect to Howard\u2019s claim of excessive force. Hudson argues that his use of force was not excessive in the light of Howard\u2019s convictions and her admission that she \u201cstruggled\u201d after Hudson grabbed her arm. Hudson also argues that the district court should have evaluated Howard\u2019s claim of excessive force as a violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The district court did not err by denying Hudson qualified immunity. The record contains material issues of fact about when Hudson seized Howard and whether Hudson used excessive force to detain Howard. <em>See Feliciano, </em>707 F.3d at 1253. Hudson submitted evidence that he responded to Howard\u2019s troublemaking by trying to quieten her, she refused to comply and he arrested her, and he responded to her violent resistance by maintaining a hold on her arm. But Howard provided a firsthand account that Hudson became irate, twisted Howard\u2019s arm, and \u201cdrug\u201d her through the office, causing her to collide with office equipment and to tumble to the floor <em>before </em>telling her that she was under arrest. Summary judgment was inappropriate because of the direct contradictions in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The district court correctly evaluated Howard\u2019s claim of excessive force under the reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment applies to \u201cseizures,\u201d and the Supreme Court has explained that a \u201cseizure occurs when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 381, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1776, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (internal alterations, quotation marks, and citation omitted). Howard was seized in Hudson\u2019s office when, according to Howard, Hudson grabbed her arm. Hudson contends that, the district court \u201caccepted [Howard\u2019s] po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>sition ... that all the forceful actions ... occurred before [she] was' arrested,\u201d but the district court credited Howard\u2019s story that she had not yet been \u201ctold she was under arrest (... [and] could not have been actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest),\u201d and used that version of events, as it was required to do, <em>see Feliciano, </em>707 F.3d at 1253, to determine whether the force Hudson used was excessive. <em>See Fils v. City of Aventura, </em>647 F.3d 1272, 1288 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Under Howard\u2019s version of events, Hudson was not entitled to' qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is not appropriate if an officer violates a plaintiffs constitutional rights, and a use of force is excessive under the Fourth Amendment if it was <em>\u201c </em>\u2018objectively [unreasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting\u201d the officer, <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Viewed in the light most favorable to Howard, the evidence established that Hudson responded to her verbal abuse with brutality unnecessary to seize Howard or to steer her to the jail. <em>See Fils, </em>647 F.3d at 1289. Hudson did not have to contort Howard\u2019s arm or drag her around roughly to detain her for a minor offense, to prevent harm to himself or others, or to prevent her from fleeing. <em>See id. </em>at 1288-89. Although Howard subsequently \u201cstruggled\u201d with Hudson, she did so arguably to avoid the unlawful force unleashed on her. A reasonable jury could find that Hudson\u2019s use of force was excessive and violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">We AFFIRM the denial of qualified immunity to Hudson on Howard\u2019s claim of excessive force.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
