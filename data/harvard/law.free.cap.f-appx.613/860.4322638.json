The district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief, concluding that Cook had not shown that he was prejudiced by any deficient performance because he was unwilling to accept the government\u2019s conditions for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>potential plea agreement. Alternatively, the court determined that counsel\u2019s performance was a reasonable tactical response to a challenging attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following question: \u201cwhether Mr. Cook was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel due to his counsel\u2019s alleged failure to adequately advise him of the Government\u2019s position on a plea in his case.\u201d After careful review, we answer this question in the negative, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Cook\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Cook was the Birmingham, Alabama, area coordinator for a multi-state counterfeit-check conspiracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The conspiracy defrauded businesses and banks of over $1 million by creating counterfeit checks that appeared to draw from a legitimate account at a genuine bank and that were made payable to members of the conspiracy. Cook recruited others to the conspiracy and served as a liaison between the conspirators who counterfeited and forged checks and those who cashed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">For his part in the conspiracy, Cook initially was indicted on two counts of possessing counterfeit checks and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. In November 2007, the government filed an eighteen-count superseding indictment against Cook and ten co-defendants. In the superseding indictment, Cook was charged with six counts of bank fraud and nine counts of aggravated identity theft, in addition to the original three counts. Cook\u2019s co-defendants all pled guilty. Cook, however, proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">At trial, the government\u2019s evidence consisted primarily of testimony from cooperating co-defendants and two confessions Cook made while in police custody. Before trial, Cook unsuccessfully had moved to suppress the confessions, alleging that they were substantially forged. The jury found Cook guilty of all eighteen counts. The district court sentenced Cook to a total term of 156 months of imprisonment, and we affirmed Cook\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>336 Fed.Appx. 875 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Cook timely filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion alleging, among other things, that his trial counsel, Hube Dodd, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him about the status of plea negotiations. The district court held an evidentiary hearing at which Cook was represented by counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">At the evidentiary hearing, Cook testified that he consistently told Dodd that he was willing to accept responsibility and to plead guilty to the charges against him, even after the superseding indictment was filed. But Dodd, according to Cook, never communicated a plea offer from the government, did not inform Cook of the government\u2019s position regarding the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>a potential plea deal, and told Cook that he had to go to trial despite a very low chance of success. Cook stated that Dodd became \u201cirritable\u201d and frustrated with him whenever he brought up the possibility of a plea deal, even though Cook believed that one was possible because his co-defendants had received plea deals. On cross-examination, Cook maintained that he was innocent of most of the conduct charged in the superseding indictment \u2014 admitting only that he was a driver for two instances of check fraud \u2014 and that the confessions attributed to him were substantially forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Dodd testified that plea negotiations' with the government did not advance because Cook was unwilling to accept responsibility for the \u201cvast majority,\u201d or the \u201clion\u2019s share,\u201d of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment, as the government insisted. In other words, Cook would have had to admit to conduct establishing him as the \u201cringleader\u201d of the conspiracy in Birmingham, which, Dodd explained, Cook was unwilling to do. Dodd said that there was no chance of a plea deal before the superseding indictment because it was clear that the government intended to seek additional charges and because the government had rejected Cook\u2019s initial offer to plead guilty to the original indictment. Once Cook moved to suppress the confessions, the government additionally required as part of any plea deal that Cook recant his allegations that his signed confessions were forged and that the government agents were liars.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Dodd further testified that he communicated the government\u2019s terms to Cook \u201cnumerous times,\u201d but Cook\u2019s response was that he was not guilty of the vast majority of the conduct and that he wished to file a motion to suppress and to proceed to trial. Dodd stated that he told Cook that he would have difficulty winning at trial based on the government\u2019s evidence against him. At some point, Cook expressed frustration that Dodd did not believe Cook was innocent. From that point forward, Dodd explained, although he continued to pursue a potential plea deal with the government, in order \u201cto continue a positive relationship,\u201d he \u201cwas not very direct in suggesting to [Cook] repeatedly that he had to plead guilty or that he should plead guilty.\u201d He elaborated on cross-examination that he began to \u201ctread[ ] very lightly\u201d with Cook in November or December 2012, telling Cook the steps that would be required to plead guilty rather than directly advising him to plead guilty. For example, he told Cook that he would have to admit to certain facts by pleading guilty, but Cook \u201cnever wavered in his insistence that he did not do the vast majority of the conduct that was described and attributed to him.\u201d Nonetheless, Dodd stated that he kept in contact with the government about a possible deal until two to four weeks before trial, but the government\u2019s essential terms did not change. Dodd testified that no formal plea offer was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">After hearing the evidence, the district court denied Cook\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion in open court. The court first concluded that Cook had not shown that he was prejudiced by any alleged deficiency in Dodd\u2019s performance. From the very beginning, the court found, the government was not willing to enter into any plea agreement unless Cook admitted responsibility for a substantial amount of criminal activity and, once Cook filed a suppression motion, recanted his allegations of forgery. The court determined that Cook was never willing to accept substantial responsibility for the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment, and, even in his sworn testimony at the \u00a7 2255 evidentiary hearing, he still did not wish to take such responsibility. As a result, the court concluded that no prejudice occurred because Cook was not willing to do what the government insisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>upon, and the government was not willing to do what Cook wished to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">In the alternative, the district court found that Dodd\u2019s performance was not deficient. The court characterized Dodd\u2019s conduct as a reasonable tactical choice in response to a challenging attorney-client relationship. The court found that Dodd was well aware that Cook wanted to plead to some small amount of conduct, but not all the conduct the government was going to insist upon. This disparity, according to the court, created frustration in the attorney-client relationship and hamstrung Dodd\u2019s ability to negotiate a plea. The court further determined that Dodd communicated to Cook the government\u2019s two essential conditions for any plea deal, which did not change at any time. Due to the strain in the relationship, the court stated, Dodd \u201cdid not keep his thumb down every time they discussed the case on the \u2018offer\u2019 that had previously been made,\u201d but he \u201ccarefully and respectfully\u201d tried to \u201chonor[] his client\u2019s position.\u201d The court discredited Cook\u2019s testimony that Dodd had insisted that he go to trial. Accordingly, the court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, entered judgment, and granted a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">On appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Osley v. United States, </em>751 F.3d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir.2014). We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Ud. </em>A district court\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>Jeffries v. United States, </em>748 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 241, 190 L.Ed.2d 181 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The benchmark for judging a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is whether counsel\u2019s performance \u201cso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To make such a showing, a prisoner must prove two things: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cA habeas petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must carry his burden on both <em>Strickland </em>prongs, and a court need not address both prongs if the defendant has made an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and with it the <em>Strickland </em>analysis, \u201cextends to the plea-bargaining process.\u201d <em>Lafler v. Cooper, </em>566 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1384, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012); <em>see Missouri v. Frye, </em>566 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1405, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012); <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 373, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1486, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010); <em>Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222. The right to effective counsel \u201cextends specifically to \u2018the negotiation and consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222 (quoting <em>In re Perez, </em>682 F.3d 930, 932 (11th Cir.2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">The Supreme Court has not elaborated in detail on the \u201cduty and responsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain process.\u201d <em>Frye, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1408; <em>see Lafler, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1384 (finding it unnecessary to explore performance because all parties agreed that defense counsel was deficient). In <em>Frye, </em>counsel allowed a time-limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>plea offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it. <em>Frye, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1408. The Court found that this was deficient performance, holding that, \u201cas a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with <em>Frye, </em>we have stated, in the context of plea negotiations, that \u201c[c]ounsel has an obligation to consult with his client on important decisions and to keep him informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 834 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The inquiry into prejudice, however, is more defined in the plea-bargaining context: \u201c[A] defendant must show the outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice.\u201d <em>Lafler, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1384. In order to establish prejudice in the context of a rejected or failed plea bargain,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">a defendant must show a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness: (1) \u201cthe plea offer would have been presented to the court (ie., that the defendant would have accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening circumstances)\u201d; (2) \u201cthe court would have accepted its terms\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer\u2019s terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-6\"><em>Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222 (quoting <em>Lafler, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1385).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Cook contends that Dodd\u2019s performance was deficient because he \u201cdid not continuously communicate the Government\u2019s position on a potential plea bargain to Mr. Cook.\u201d He asserts that Dodd admitted to \u201ctreading lightly\u201d at some point and ceasing to directly communicate with Cook about a potential plea bargain and that this was contrary to the reasoning of Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Frye </em>and <em>Lafler </em>and to the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Frye, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1408 (noting that codified standards of professional practice \u201ccan be important guides\u201d in assessing counsel\u2019s performance). Cook urges this Court to interpret <em>Frye </em>to apply not only to formal offers, but also to the process that produces them.</p>\n<p id=\"ASA\">It is unnecessary to determine the scope of defense counsel\u2019s responsibilities in this context \u2014 concerning preliminary plea negotiations and, at best, a nascent, oral plea offer \u2014 or to decide whether Dodd\u2019s performance was deficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that Cook\u2019s inability to establish prejudice is dispositive of his ineffective-assistance claim. <em>See Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222. We turn to the question of prejudice now.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Cook argues that he suffered prejudice because, had trial counsel kept him consistently informed about plea negotiations, a reasonable probability existed that he would have pled guilty and that he would have received a benefit from the government by doing so. The government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>agrees that there is a reasonable probability of a less severe conviction and sentence had a plea deal been reached. Thus, the question is whether there was a reasonable probability of a plea agreement that would have been accepted by Cook, the government, and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Cook contends that the government would have agreed to a plea deal if Cook had agreed to the government\u2019s terms.True enough, but Cook rejected the government\u2019s terms from the time they were first proposed to him. And, explicitly or implicitly, he continued to reject these terms through the evidentiary hearing on his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The government insisted as part of any plea deal that Cook accept responsibility for the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of criminal conduct alleged in the superseding indictment, including that he was, essentially, a manager of the check-cashing scheme in Birmingham. The government also wanted Cook to recant his allegations that his confessions were forged. The confessions were consistent with Cook\u2019s broader role in' the scheme. These two requirements did not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Cook knew the government\u2019s position on a potential plea deal because Dodd communicated these essential terms to Cook on numerous occasions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Cook was interested in pleading guilty, and although he testified at the hearing that he was willing to accept whatever plea deal was offered by the government in order to avoid trial, \u201c[gjiven [Cook\u2019s] awareness of. the [nascent] plea offer, his after the fact testimony concerning his desire to plead, without more, is insufficient to establish that but for counsel\u2019s alleged advice or inaction, he would have accepted the plea offer.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 835. The record is clear that Cook, both at the time of plea negotiations and at the \u00a7 2255 evidentiary hearing, refused to accept more than limited responsibility and maintained that the confessions were forged. In short, Cook wanted a plea deal that the government simply was not willing to offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Cook asserts that he would have pled guilty if Dodd had more thoroughly explained the legal ramifications of co-conspirator liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In essence, he contends that he would have accepted the government\u2019s terms, had he understood that the government\u2019s plea position was based on the fact that the evidence was sufficient to prove him guilty at trial of the charges in the superseding indictment. This contention is belied by the fact that both attorney and client testified that Dodd told Cook he was probably going to lose if he went to trial. Dodd specifically advised Cook that the jury was likely to believe the government agent on the validity of the confessions. The confessions, which Cook continues to dispute, were consistent with the government\u2019s position on Cook\u2019s broader level of culpability. Given the adamance and consistency with which Cook held his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>beliefs about his culpability in the conspiracy, Cook\u2019s current assertion that, with better advice he would have pled guilty to a greater role in the conspiracy, is wholly speculative and unsupported by the record and the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">While not dispositive, Cook\u2019s insistence on his innocence of the conduct to which the government insisted he admit, both before and after trial, is a \u201crelevant consideration\u201d that \u201cmakes it more difficult to accept his claim\u201d that he would have agreed to any plea deal the'government would have offered him. <em>See Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1224-25. So too is the fact that plea negotiations never advanced to any level of specificity. <em>See id. </em>at 1225 (\u201cThe lack of definition in a plea offer makes it substantially harder to determine it likely that a plea acceptable to the defendant would have been entered without the prosecution canceling it or the trial court refusing to accept it.\u201d (brackets and emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Merzbacher v. Shearin, </em>706 F.3d 356, 370 (4th Cir.2013))).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Assuming that \u201cthere may be cases in which a petitioner can show <em>Strickland </em>prejudice despite the incipience of the plea offer he did not accept due to his counsel\u2019s lack of communication or inadequate advice,\u201d <em>Merzbacher, </em>706 F.3d at 369-70, this is not such a case. Given the parties\u2019 entrenched and widely divergent positions on a potential plea deal, Cook has not shown a reasonable probability that a plea deal could have been reached and then accepted by the court. <em>See Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Because Cook has failed to show that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in advising him about the government\u2019s position in plea negotiations, we AFFIRM the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">. These facts are taken from the presentence investigation report based on evidence presented at Cook's jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">. Initially, the district court denied Cook's \u00a7 2255 motion after holding an evidentiary hearing at which Cook was denied appointed counsel. Recognizing that this was error, <em>see </em>Rule 8(c), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings (\"If an evidentiary hearing is warranted, the judge must appoint an attorney to represent a moving party who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A.\u201d), the district court appointed counsel and held another evidentiary hearing. This appeal concerns the second evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">. Nonetheless, we find the district court\u2019s explanation of why Dodd\u2019s performance was not deficient to be persuasive. <em>(See </em>D.E. 56 at 151-56). Nor does the evidence show that Dodd failed to \"consult with his client on important decisions and [ ] keep him informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 834. The government's position did not change, so no \"important development\u201d existed to communicate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">. While Cook may dispute this fact, the district court credited Dodd\u2019s testimony on this point, and Cook has offered no reason why we should not defer to the court\u2019s finding. <em>See Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222; <em>Jeffries, </em>748 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">. The government suggests that we should not address this argument because it is outside the scope of the certificate of appealability. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that, on appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, \"appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d). While we agree that Cook cannot proceed independently on a claim that counsel inadequately advised him of the charges he faced, we construe the certificate of appealability as including these issues as they relate to \"counsel\u2019s alleged failure to adequately advise [Cook] of the Government\u2019s position on a plea in his case,\" given that similar points were raised below and discussed by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
