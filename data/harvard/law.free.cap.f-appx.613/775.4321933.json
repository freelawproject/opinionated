Rosenwald, Donald Mark Papy, City Attorney\u2019s Office of Miami Beach Miami Beach, FL, Joshua Michael Entin, Entin <em>&amp; </em>Della Fera, PA, Fort Lauderdale, FL, for Defendanb-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b803-20\">Before MARTIN, ANDERSON, and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b803-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b803-22\">In this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil action, Carla Hilger, appeals from (1) the final judgments entered by the district court in favor of Defendants Jenny Velazquez, Melissa Flynn, and City of Miami Beach following a jury trial; and (2) the district court\u2019s denial of Hilger\u2019s motion for a new trial based on defense counsel\u2019s comments during closing argument. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>This case arose out of Hilger\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence, resisting arrest with and without violence, and for eluding a police officer. Hilger filed this civil action against Defendants, asserting claims for excessive force in violation of section 1983 and for battery under Florida law. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Defendants on all counts; and the district court entered final judgment against Hilger.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">At trial, the district court overruled Hil-ger\u2019s objections to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument and denied Hilger\u2019s motion for a mistrial. After final judgment was entered, Hilger moved for a new trial, contending that she was denied a fair and impartial trial based on improper comments, made during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. The district court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We review for abuse of discretion both the denial of a motion for a mistrial and the denial of a motion for a new trial. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>767 F.3d 1264, 1281 (11th Cir.2014); <em>Lanham v. Whitfield, </em>805 F.2d 970, 971-72 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">District courts have considerable discretion to control the scope and tone of counsels\u2019 closing arguments. <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1282 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. James, </em>845 F.2d 315, 318 (11th Cir.1988). Generally speaking, we are reluctant to set aside a jury verdict based on comments made in closing argument. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co., </em>845 F.2d at 318. Thus, \u201cabsent an abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial court, which has had the opportunity to hear the offensive remarks within the context of the argument and to view their effect on the jury, should not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether to set aside a jury verdict, we \u201clook to the entire [closing] argument, the context of the remarks, the objection raised, and the curative instruction to determine whether the remarks were \u2018such as to impair gravely the calm and dispassionate consideration of the case by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not reverse a judgment unless the challenged closing argument was \u201cplainly unwarranted and clearly injurious.\u201d <em>Goldsmith, </em>513 F.3d at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Hilger objects to several comments made during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, including comments (1) that Hil-ger was \u201ccoached\u201d by her lawyer and followed a \u201cscript;\u201d (2) that Hilger was an alcoholic and drug addict; (3) that, on the day of her arrest,- Hilger had acted irresponsibly and had endangered the lives of citizens of Miami-Dade County; and (4) that Defendant officers had children.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Viewing the record as a whole, defense counsel\u2019s closing argument constituted no \u201cplainly unwarranted and clearly injurious\u201d error. First, defense counsel\u2019s comments were both supported by evidence in the record and (except for the comment about Defendants\u2019 children) were pertinent to establishing Hilger\u2019s lack of credibility. <em>See BankAtlantic v. Blythe Eastman Paine Webber, Inc., </em>955 F.2d 1467, 1474 (11th Cir.1992) (affirming denial of a new trial in part because the offending remarks were based on record evidence that was relevant to the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Extensive evidence was presented at trial about Hilger\u2019s history of alcoholism and drug abuse, about Hilger\u2019s continuing denial of her substance-abuse issues, and about Hilger\u2019s unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation. The record also established clearly that, on the day of Hilger\u2019s arrest, Hilger\u2019s blood-alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit, and that she was driving erratically, nearly hit at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>one officer, and refused repeated instructions to pull over. Hilger also changed dramatically her version of the facts: first reporting that her bruises resulted from her \u201cresisting arrest,\u201d but later reporting that Defendants \u2014 without reason\u2014 grabbed her, banged her head against the wall five times, and kicked her while she was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Moreover, the district court judge instructed the jury, both before closing arguments and during the jury charge, that statements by lawyers are not evidence. The district court also instructed the jury to base its decision only on the evidence presented and to be uninfluenced by feelings of sympathy for either party. We presume that jurors follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 829 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">On this record \u2014 particularly where defense counsel\u2019s comments were based on evidence in the record and where the district court issued curative instructions\u2014 and given our reluctance to set aside jury verdicts based on comments made in closing argument, we conclude that the district court abused no discretion in denying Hil-ger\u2019s motion for a mistrial. For the same reasons (and given that Hilger\u2019s lawyer vigorously opposed by counter-argument defense counsel\u2019s alleged improper comments and characterization of the case), Hilger has also failed to show that defense counsel\u2019s comments \u201cimpaired gravely the calm and dispassionate consideration of the case by the jury.\u201d No new trial was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> Both Defendant officers testified, without objection, that they had children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
