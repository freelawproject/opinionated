He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-20\">We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Jabalera-Chavira\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). The district court, which was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d was presented with Jabalera-Chavira\u2019s mitigating arguments but concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range was reasonable. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. We have held that \u201cthe staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable and does not destroy the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to such sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011). We have also rejected substantive reasonableness challenges based on the alleged lack of seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). As Jabalera-Chavira concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>basis is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
