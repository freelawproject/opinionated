We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">Morgan filed numerous claims founded in an altercation he had with a local policeman, which ended in his being handcuffed for resisting arrest and an injury to his finger. Morgan sued the Denison Police Department, Officer Douglas, Mayor Johnson and apparently the City pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 under various constitutional provisions and Texas law. The district court clearly wrote why summary judgment was required for the appellees on all his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">On appeal, Morgan\u2019s rambling brief does not squarely address the district court\u2019s ruling or raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding any of his original causes of action. The court\u2019s essential determination, underlying and disposing of all the rest of Morgan\u2019s case, is that Officer Douglas did not use excessive force under the circumstances. Morgan has offered no admissible evidence to controvert this finding. To the extent Morgan raises new constitutional and state law claims in this court that he did not plead in the trial court, these claims are waived. <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
