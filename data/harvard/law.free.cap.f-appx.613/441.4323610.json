The BIA and the immigration judge found Carrillo failed to demonstrate his removal would result in the requisite exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-22\">Carrillo contends the BIA\u2019s denial of relief could result in his separation from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>his children and, thus, violate his right to due process by affecting his fundamental liberty interest \u201cin the parent-child relationship\u201d under the First and Fifth Amendments. According to Carrillo, this matter should be remanded to the BIA for reconsideration because it failed to \u201caccount at all for evidence indicating removal would separate the children from their father\u201d. He also asserts the BIA\u2019s decision violates the due process and First Amendment rights of the children and their mother. Finally, Carrillo states the BIA\u2019s standard to determine whether to grant cancellation of removal is constitutionally inadequate because it applies uniformly regardless of whether the qualifying relative is the petitioner\u2019s spouse, parent, or child.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Cancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief. <em>E.g., Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 214-15 (5th Cir.2003). To be eligible, an alien must establish, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201cremoval would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The determination of whether an alien satisfies this requirement is discretionary and not subject to judicial review, \u201cunless the [challenge] involves constitutional questions or questions of law\u201d. <em>Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2014); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The denial of cancellation of removal does not implicate any protected liberty or property interests under the Due Process Clause. <em>See Sattani, </em>749 F.3d at 372; <em>Mireles-Valdez, </em>349 F.3d at 219. Nor does Carrillo\u2019s removal violate any protected liberty interest he has in the parent-child relationship with his children. <em>See Malagan de Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 505 (5th Cir.2006). As in <em>Malagon de Fuentes, </em>Carrillo\u2019s children are free to return to Mexico with him. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, he testified that they would return with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
