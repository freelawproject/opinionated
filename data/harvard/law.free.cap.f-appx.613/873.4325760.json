In his interlocutory appeal, he argues that the district court erroneously found manifest necessity existed for a new trial where the district court determined that the trial could not be rescheduled due to the jurors\u2019 scheduling conflicts. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>708 F.3d 1216, 1221 (11th Cir.2013). However, if the district court\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial was not based on manifest necessity, then the court abused its discretion by not dismissing the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. <em>Id. </em>We review whether there was manifest necessity for a mistrial by reviewing the entire record in the case without limiting the review to the actual findings of the trial court. <em>United States v. Therve, </em>764 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir.2014). The deference given \u201cto the district court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial varies according to the circumstances, which include the basis for the order of mistrial and the trial judge\u2019s exercise of sound discretion in making the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause protects a criminal defendant from being subjected to multiple prosecutions for the same offense. U.S. Const, amend. V. Jeopardy attaches when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>jury is empaneled and sworn, and, \u201c[o]nce jeopardy attaches, a defendant has a constitutional right to have his case decided by that jury, except under limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Therve, </em>764 F.3d at 1298. However, \u201ca defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). The Double Jeopardy Clause is not violated by re-trial following a mistrial so long as the grant of mistrial is due to \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>See Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 323-24, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984). Under the doctrine of manifest necessity, \u201cdistrict courts are permitted to declare a mistrial and discharge a jury only where, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d <em>Therve, </em>764 F.3d at 1298 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">\u201c[Wjhile \u2018manifest necessity describes the magnitude of the government\u2019s burden, it is not a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge, and the key word \u2018necessity\u2019 cannot be interpreted literally.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>708 F.3d at 1221 (quotations and ellipsis omitted); <em>see also United States v. Chica, </em>14 F.3d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cWhether manifest necessity exists is a fact-intensive inquiry, and is not susceptible to a mechanical formulation.\u201d (quotations and citation omitted)). In <em>Davis, </em>we held that manifest necessity existed for a mistrial based on the combined effect of a district court properly dismissing a juror who could not sufficiently comprehend English and the defendant\u2019s refusal to proceed with a jury of less than 12 members. 708 F.3d at 1224. The strictest scrutiny of a mistrial is appropriate where \u201cmistrial is declared because of the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence or when the prosecution seeks to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused.\u201d <em>Therve, </em>764 F.3d at 1298 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Although a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity is required before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate, <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 506-07, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), a district court does not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial simply because other alternatives might have been permissible, <em>see United States v. Dominguez, </em>226 F.3d 1235, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2000). The district court \u201cshould consider whether any alternatives to a mistrial are available, but the failure to adopt or consider a particular alternative is not constitutional error.\u201d <em>Venson v. Georgia, </em>74 F.3d 1140, 1145 (11th Cir.1996). Manifest necessity for a mistrial can exist alongside other alternatives, so long as the record shows that the district court considered alternatives before declaring a mistrial. <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>905 F.2d 1482, 1488 (11th Cir.1990). An important consideration in such an appeal \u201cis whether the trial court carefully considered the alternatives and exercised sound discretion and did not act in an abrupt, precipitous[,] or erratic manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether or not the district court consulted with the parties before declaring a mistrial is a factor that we consider in deciding whether the district court acted within its discretion, though the failure to consult is not by itself fatal to the declaration of mistrial. <em>Abdi v. Georgia, </em>744 F.2d 1500, 1504 &amp; n. 6 (11th Cir.1984). A district court is not required to make a specific finding of manifest necessity or \u201carticulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of [its] discretion\u201d so long as the record as a whole provides sufficient justification for the ruling. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 517, 98 S.Ct. 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>We have thus relied on four indicators m determining whether the district court abused its discretion in granting a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgC\">Has the trial judge (1) heard the opinions of the parties about the propriety of the mistrial, (2) considered the alternatives to a mistrial and chosen the alternative least harmful to the defendant\u2019s rights, (8) acted deliberately instead of abruptly, and (4) properly determined that the defendant would benefit from the declaration of mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><em>United States v. Berroa, </em>374 F.3d 1053, 1058 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted); Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.3. We have observed that, in situations \u201cwhere the required number of jurors needed to render a verdict is reduced by unforeseen circumstances, the trial court should discharge the jury and direct a retrial.\u201d <em>United States v. Isom, </em>88 F.3d 920, 923 (11th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949)); <em>see United States v. Spence, </em>163 F.3d 1280, 1283-84 (11th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s discretion will not be disturbed unless its decision is without factual support or was made for a legally irrelevant reason. <em>United States v. De La Vega, </em>913 F.2d 861, 869 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Scott\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment following a mistrial. As the record shows, Scott\u2019s original trial was twice delayed by medical issues after the jury was empaneled but before anything substantive occurred \u2014 first, his own high blood pressure, and then the high-risk pregnancy of the government\u2019s toxicology witness. Although the unavailability of the government\u2019s toxicology' expert requires the strictest scrutiny, the record supports the district court\u2019s determination of manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">For starters, the parties do not dispute that the toxicologist was present and prepared to testify on the original trial date. Further, her subsequent medical unavailability \u2014 caused by a high risk pregnancy\u2014 was not the result of a serious lack of preparedness or an effort to purposefully derail the trial on the government\u2019s behalf. Rather, the government was prepared to have another toxicologist test the substances so that a trial could continue with or without the original jury. Moreover, when the district court contacted jurors to set a new date \u2014 presumably using the government\u2019s subsequent toxicologist \u2014 it was juror unavailability that frustrated the possibility of continuing with the original jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">On this record, the district court concluded that it would either give Scott the option of proceeding with a jury of 11 or it would grant the government\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The district court considered the reasonable alternatives to declaring a mistrial by initially securing the jurors\u2019 consent to reset the trial for May 27, and by subsequently attempting to reschedule the trial to accommodate the jurors\u2019 schedules and the government\u2019s toxicologist issue. In exercising its discretion, the district court was not bound to pursue the alternatives until it was absolutely infeasible to exercise one. The district court spent multiple days considering the options, such as rescheduling or proceeding with 11 jurors, it discussed its thoughts with the parties, and it gave Scott a chance to reflect upon the options and to consult with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">As this record shows, the district court\u2019s action in declaring a mistrial was deliberate, rather than abrupt or erratic. Although the district court did not explicitly state that Scott would benefit from the declaration of a mistrial, it also does not appear that the district court\u2019s grant of a mistrial either unduly benefited the prosecution, or exuded judicial interference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Indeed, when the court initially adjourned on day one for Scott\u2019s health concerns, nothing substantive had occurred. In addition, the mistrial arguably occurred when each side had received the benefit of a continuance \u2014 one for Scott\u2019s health and one for the government\u2019s witness\u2019s health. Thus, although the mistrial ultimately came in response to the government\u2019s request, there is no indication that a benefit inured to either party. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that a manifest necessity existed, granting the government\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and denying Scott\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
