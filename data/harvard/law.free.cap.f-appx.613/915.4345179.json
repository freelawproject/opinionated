In the court below, Miley alleged that Thornburg Mortgage Home Loans and other parties (collectively, creditors) violated a bankruptcy court stay when they foreclosed on her house. On appeal, she argues that, because she could request a stay within 30 days of filing, there was a temporary 30-day stay in effect after she filed her third bankruptcy petition despite her status as a multiple repeat filer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Dimanche v. Brown, </em>783 F.3d 1204, 1214 (11th Cir.2015). When a litigant seeks to file a case <em>in forma pau-peris, </em>the district, court must dismiss the case if at any time it determines that the action fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay applicable to creditors seeking to foreclose on a debtor\u2019s property. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). No automatic stay goes into effect, however, if, when the debtor files a petition, she has had two or more bankruptcy cases that were pending in the previous year but were dismissed. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 362(c)(4)(A)(i). Within 30 days of filing the latest case, upon request of a party, the court may order a stay if the party demonstrates that the case was filed in good faith. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 362(c)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The statute upon which Miley relies expressly states that an automatic stay does not issue upon filing of a successive bankruptcy petition under the circumstances of this case. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 362(c)(4)(A)\u00ae. As she now acknowledges, no automatic stay was in effect under \u00a7 362(a) because she had two bankruptcy cases pending in the previous year that were ultimately dismissed, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 362(c)(4)(A)\u00ae, and neither the record nor her brief support her current legal contention that a temporary stay was in effect. Specifically, \u00a7 362(c)(4)(B) gives a party 30 days to request- a stay and allows the court to grant that request, but it does not prohibit her creditors from taking action during that time period. Miley did not allege that she requested a stay from the court or that the court exercised its discretion to grant a stay. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Miley had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) (2)(B) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of Miley\u2019s arguments, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Miley\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">. Miley does not challenge on appeal the district court's dismissal of her other federal claims, or its refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims, and so has abandoned any argument in this respect. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Also, we will not consider her arguments that the property was part of the bankruptcy estate or that her creditors were required to seek a court order confirming no stay was in effect, because she raises them for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1335 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
