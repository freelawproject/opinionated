Dale argues that the district court impermissi-bly delegated the task of setting a repayment schedule to the Bureau of Prisons and abused its discretion by denying her motions to modify her restitution based on changed economic circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Dale\u2019s first argument \u2014 that the district court improperly delegated the task of setting a repayment schedule to the BOP \u2014 is contradicted by the record. The judgment in her case shows that that the district court set a specific payment schedule requiring Dale to make an immediate lump sum payment of $494,624, with any remaining balance to be paid at a rate not less than $100 per month during her supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Neither do we find any abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Dale\u2019s motions to modify her restitution order. Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, a district court may modify a final order of restitution upon a showing of a material change in the defendant\u2019s circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k). However, modification under this provision requires a <em>\u201cbona fide </em>change in the defendant\u2019s financial condition.\u201d <em>Cani v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.2003). Dale has made no showing of any such change. Thus, on this record, her \u201cpresent financial status is no different from that contemplated by the district court when it imposed the restitution order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-9\">.
