Over a year after the district court granted summary judgment in its favor, BankUnited filed a motion to enter a final judgment determining damages and a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court granted both motions, and the Wanes now appeal, arguing that the motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs was untimely. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">On August 10, 2011, the Wanes filed their amended complaint to quiet title against The Loan Corporation, BankUnited, and the FDIC in state court. The FDIC removed the action to federal court and reached a settlement with the Wanes. The FDIC was then dismissed from the action. The Wanes filed a second amended complaint naming only BankUnited and The Loan Corporation as defendants. On May 11, 2012, BankUnited filed counterclaims against the Wanes for breach of a note and money lent. Subsequently, the parties filed summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">On February 28, 2013, the district court entered an order granting BankUnited\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the Wanes\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In its order, the district court explained that it had resolved all claims, except those brought against The Loan Corporation, a now defunct company which had failed to appear in the action. The district court permitted the Wanes to file a motion for default judgment against The Loan Corporation, but ultimately, on April 1, 2013, denied that motion. Mr. Wane then appealed the district court\u2019s summary judgment order, which we affirmed in January of 2014. <em>See Wane v. Loan Corp., </em>552 Fed.Appx. 908 (11th Cir.2014). Before resolving Mr. Wane\u2019s appeal on the merits, we denied BankUnited\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, ruling that the April 1, 2013, order was final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">On July 11, 2014, following remand, the district Court entered a final judgment in BankUnited\u2019s favor for the balance of the defaulted loan, interest, and other fees, which totaled $591,084.23. On July 24, 2014, BankUnited filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which the district court granted in the amount of approximately $92,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">The Wanes filed the instant appeal and raised several issues. BankUnited filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, which we granted in part for lack of jurisdiction. The only issue left for us to resolve is whether BankUnited timely filed its motion to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">\u201cThis Court reviews an award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion; nevertheless, that standard of review still allows us to closely scrutinize questions of law decided by the district court in reaching a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>fee award.\u201d <em>Villano v. City of Boynton Beach, </em>254 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)(B), a motion for attorney\u2019s fees must be filed \u201cno later than 14 days after the entry of a judgment,\u201d unless a statute or a court order provides otherwise. The Federal Rules define \u201cjudgment\u201d as \u201ca decree or any order from which an appeal lies.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a). The district court\u2019s applicable local rule closely mirrors Rule 54 in substance, adding only that \u201cthe pendency of an appeal from the judgment shall not postpone the filing of a timely application pursuant to th[e] rule.\u201d <em>See </em>M.D. Fla. R. 4.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The Wanes argue that the motion for fees and costs was untimely because Ban-kUnited had 14 days from February 23, 2013 \u2014 the date that the district court entered its order granting BankUnited\u2019s summary judgment \u2014 to move for fees and costs. BankUnited responds that the district court\u2019s summary judgment order \u201cwas not a \u2018judgment\u2019 but rather an \u2018order,\u2019 \u201d because it \u201cdid not contain such conclusive language, or any language to indicate that the [order] was a \u2018final judgment.\u2019\u201d BankUnited\u2019s Br. at 8-9. We agree with BankUnited that its motion was timely. This is so because the July 11, 2014, order awarding damages was qualitatively different from the order we reviewed in the first appeal, and as such, started the clock to file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We acknowledge that in Mr. Wane\u2019s pri- or appeal, we ruled that the district court\u2019s April 1, 2013, order was final and appeal-able. Following our affirmance of the grant of summary judgment, however, BankUnited moved for the district court to determine the amount of damages and enter a final judgment, something the district court had not yet done. The Wanes objected to BankUnited\u2019s request, arguing that, in its motion for final judgment, BankUnited sought an amount that was greater than the principal balance requested in its counterclaim. The district court ruled in favor of BankUnited and entered a final judgment awarding damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">There is no doubt that the July 11, 2014, order constituted a new judgment and restarted the clock for purposes of Rule 54, as it was a new appealable order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a) (a judgment is \u201cany order from which an appeal lies.\u201d). Indeed, had the Wanes believed that the district court erroneously calculated BankUnited\u2019s damages they could have appealed. <em>See Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., </em>344 U.S. 206, 211-12, 73 S.Ct. 245, 97 L.Ed. 245 (1952) (ruling that the period to file an appeal begins anew when a trial court enters a new judgment that \u201cchanges matters of substance, or resolves a genuine ambiguity, in a previously rendered judgment[,]\u201d and stating that the appropriate test is \u201cwhether the lower court, in its second order, has disturbed or revised legal rights and obligations which, by its prior judgment, had been plainly and properly settled with finality\u201d). Having filed its motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on July 24, 2014, just 13 days after the district court entered the final judgment, BankUnited satisfied the timing requirements of Rule 54(d)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order awarding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
