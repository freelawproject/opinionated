He challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support of his argument, he asserts that his illegal reentry offense is essentially an international trespass and that the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is problematic because it is not empirically based and results in the double counting of his criminal history. He also asserts that the sentence is greater than necessary to promote respect for the law, to provide adequate deterrence, and to protect the public, and that it fails to adequately account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-22\">A sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Villanueva-Turcius contends the presumption should not be applied but concedes the issue is foreclosed and raises it only for further- possible review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-23\">This court has rejected challenges to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence based on the same international-trespass and double-counting arguments raised in \u2022this appeal. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the record does not reflect that the sentence fails to \u201caccount for a factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or ... represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. Villa-nueva-Turcius\u2019s dissatisfaction with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
