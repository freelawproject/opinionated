The District Court denied Ferrari\u2019s motion to stay action and for arbitration on the ground that Ferrari had \u201cwaived his right to arbitration through his conduct.\u201d We agree and therefore affirm the February 20, 2015, order. The District Court denied Ferrari\u2019s motion for reconsideration because the two arguments he presented in his motion \u2014 that D.R. Horton, Inc. had \u201cfailed to give him a copy of the arbitration agreement when he was first hired\u201d and refused to provide him with a copy of the agreement despite his requests for copies of all ... employment agreements relating to this employment,\u201d and that D.R. Horton, Inc. \u201cshould be unable to argue that it was prejudiced by Ferrari pursuing litigation in federal court when it could have moved to compel arbitration at any point during either the state or federal proceeding\u201d \u2014 were meritless. We agree for the reasons the court stated in its March 16, 2015 order, and therefore affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
