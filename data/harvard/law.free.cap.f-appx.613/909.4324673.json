The district court denied her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 782 did not change her career-offender sentence under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1. On appeal, Howard argues that following <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), the district court should have granted her motion because, despite being labeled a career offender, her sentence originated with the drug Guideline in USSG \u00a7 2D1.1. Howard also argues for the first time that, contrary to USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), the district court had the discretion to reduce her sentence below the minimum of the amended Guideline range that would have been applicable if Amendment 782 had been in effect at the time she was sentenced. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where she is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). When considering a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court must engage in a two-step process. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range using the amended Guidelines provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 780. Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>the court must determine, in its discretion, whether to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended Guidelines or to retain the original sentence, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 781. A resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not constitute a de novo resentenc-ing,\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The district court properly rejected Howard\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Amendment 782 revised the Guidelines applicable to most drug offenses by reducing the base offense levels found in the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). USSG app. C, Amend. 782. However, the offense level of a career offender \u2014 like Howard \u2014 is determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1. In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), we addressed whether Amendment 706, which reduced the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses, authorized a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been sentenced under the career-offender Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. We said no, explaining that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes reductions only to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 1327 (quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt..n. 1(A) (noting that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction where an amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant but ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). Applying that binding precedent here, because Howard\u2019s sentence was based on the career-offender Guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 782 had no effect on her sentence. The district court therefore did not have the authority to reduce Howard\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Howard argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>should alter our analysis. However, in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>this Court held that Moore remains binding precedent in this Circuit even after Freeman. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. We explained that Freeman did not \u201caddress[ ] defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So to the extent that Howard relies on Freeman to say she was entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we already have held in <em>Lawson </em>that <em>Freeman </em>does not authorize relief for defendants sentenced as career offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Finally, Howard argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce her sentence below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range that would have been applicable if Amendment 782 had been in effect at the time she was sentenced because \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) is unconstitutional. However, because a resen-tencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the district court did not have the authority to consider Howard\u2019s sentencing arguments outside of the effect of the retroactive amendment on her Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
