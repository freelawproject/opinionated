He was sentenced within the applicable advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Garcia challenges the district court\u2019s applying an eight-level enhancement for his 2002 Illinois conviction for possession of cocaine, with intent to deliver, which the court characterized as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). He also asserts: the Illinois offense is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); and, therefore, the court erred in entering judgment against him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-senteneing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">As Garcia concedes, however, he did pot raise these issues in district court; accordingly, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir.2012). Under that standard, Garcia must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">In his first point of error, Garcia asserts the Illinois offense does not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), because the Illinois statute criminalizes the giving away of drugs without remuneration and, therefore, defines \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d more broadly than the Guideline. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(23 June 2015) (No. 14-10355), however, forecloses this contention. As a result, Garcia has not demonstrated the court plainly erred in applying the Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) enhancement based on his prior Illinois conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">Regarding Garcia\u2019s second contention (the court erred in sentencing him-under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) (being previously removed following a conviction for an aggravated felony)), it is not necessary to decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>under the plain-error standard, whether the Illinois offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Instead, Garcia\u2019s sentence may be affirmed because, prior to his removal, he was convicted of the Illinois offense of unlawful use of a firearm by a felon, which qualifies as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii). <em>See Nieto Hernandez v. Holder, </em>592 F.3d 681, 685-86 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 602 n. 12 (5th Cir.2002) (stating judgment may be affirmed on any basis appearing in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
