Construed liberally, Cook seems to be challenging the propriety of his conviction and sentence as well as the parole board\u2019s retroactive application of a policy allegedly requiring Cook to serve ninety percent of his punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the district court shall review, as soon as possible, a prisoner\u2019s complaint in a civil action against a government entity to identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b). Because \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) both require the district court to review a prisoner\u2019s civil complaint and dismiss the case if it finds the claims frivolous, it stands to reason that the standard of review is the same under both provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, because we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint, brought <em>informa pauperis, </em>as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), we will also review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1112, 124 S.Ct. 1038, 157 L.Ed.2d 901 (2004). Moreover, an action is considered frivolous if it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">A state prisoner seeking to challenge his conviction or confinement files a \u201cpetition for writ of habeas corpus\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2254. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Claims challenging the fact of conviction or duration of the sentence \u201cfall within the \u2018core\u2019 of habeas corpus,\u201d while claims challenging the conditions of confinement may be brought in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Nelson v. Campbell, </em>541 U.S. 637, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 2122, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004); <em>see also Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1841, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (holding that \u201cwhen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus\u201d). Thus, a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983 is the appropriate relief when a state prisoner constitutionally challenges the conditions of his confinement, but not the fact or length of his incarceration. <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 499, 93 S.Ct. at 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>An action under \u00a7 2254 may be filed in either \u201cthe district court for the district wherein such person is in custody or in the district court for the district within which the State court was held which convicted and sentenced him.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d); <em>see also Dobard v. Johnson, </em>749 F.2d 1503, 1504 (11th Cir.1985) (noting that a state prisoner may file a petition for habeas corpus in the federal judicial district in which he is in custody or in the district in which the court that convicted and sentenced him was located).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The district court properly dismissed Cook\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A because Cook\u2019s exclusive remedy for his claim is to file a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 since his claim challenges the propriety of his conviction and sentence, as well as the execution of his sentence, rather than the conditions of his confinement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">For the above stated reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cook\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\">. The difference between the two statutes is that \u00a7 1915A applies to all civil complaints filed by prisoners, whereas \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) is applicable only if the prisoner has been granted leave to proceed IFF. <em>Compare </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) and \u00a7 1915(a), (e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">.
