Matlock, a federal prisoner (# 90897-012), appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, which was purportedly filed pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He attacked his 1991 sentence for distribution of cocaine base, arguing pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that the facts underlying his \u201ccareer offender\u201d enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, were neither submitted to a jury nor admitted, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">Now relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Matlock contends that his <em>Booker </em>claim falls within the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. To proceed under the savings clause, the applicant must make the following three-part showing: (1) that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the Supreme Court case \u201cestablishes that he was \u2018actually innocent\u2019 of the charges against him because the decision decriminalized the conduct for which he was convicted\u201d; and (3) precedent foreclosed this claim at the time of the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.) (citing <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001)), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1085, 124 S.Ct. 950, 157 L.Ed.2d 763 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">Even assuming arguendo that the savings clause applies, Matlock has not stated a cognizable <em>Booker </em>claim. Determinations supporting a career-offender enhancement are questions of law, not fact, and do not implicate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cCareer offender status is not a \u2018sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a fact other than a prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 747 n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
