On appeal, Alfaro-Ramirez\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, concluding that there were no meritorious issues for appeal but addressing whether the district court correctly found that Alfaro-Ramirez was not entitled to the safety valve exception. AlfaroRamirez further addressed this issue in a pro se supplemental brief. At this court\u2019s request, counsel filed a supplemental <em>Anders </em>brief, opining that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was inapplicable to Alfaro-Ramirez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">Under the \u201csafety valve\u201d exception to statutory minimum sentences, a defendant convicted of a drug crime may be given a more lenient sentence within the otherwise applicable guidelines range if, among other things, the defendant \u201cprovided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>(2000); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 501.2(a)(5) (2003). To satisfy \u00a7 3553(f)(5), Alfaro-Ramirez was required to disclose all the information he possessed about his involvement in the crime and his chain of distribution, including the identities and participation of others. <em>See United States v. Romo, </em>81 F.3d 84, 85 (8th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s finding that Alfaro-Ramirez did not satisfy the statutory requirements is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">It is undisputed that Alfaro-Ramirez failed to describe the whole story of the conspiracy and refused to detail the roles and identities of others involved. The fact that he was willing to describe his own role was insufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Next, citing <em>Booker, </em>Alfaro-Ramirez argues in his pro se supplemental brief that he was entitled to a jury determination of whether he satisfied the safety valve exception. His attorney raises the issue of whether Alfaro-Ramirez\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. Because Alfaro-Ramirez did not raise either issue in the district court, these claims are reviewed for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">To meet this plain error standard: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If the three elements of the plain error standard are met, the Court may exercise its discretion to notice error only \u201cwhen failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750. Thus, the district court erred in sentencing Alfaro-Ramirez under the mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-17 (4th Cir.2005). That error was plain because <em>Booker </em>abrogated previous law of this Circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 217. However, to affect substantial rights, the sentence imposed must have been longer than what could have been imposed based solely on the jury\u2019s findings. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 548. Here, Alfaro-Ramirez was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum. Thus, the mandatory guideline calculation had no effect on his actual sentence, and his substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">In addition, neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Hughes </em>holds that sentencing guidelines determinations must be made by a jury. Instead, courts are required to calculate the appropriate guidelines range, in accordance with current practice and under a preponderance of the evidence standard, and then consider that range along with other relevant factors before imposing a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. Thus, there is no merit to the argument that the safety valve issue must be decided by a jury. The decision of whether a defendant has satisfied the statutory requirements of the safety valve exception is properly made by a judge both pre- and <em>post-Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>peal. We therefore affirm Alfaro-Ramirez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-13\"><em> Anders v.
