Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court alone and not by the jury violated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s imperative that \u201cany fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756 (citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)). The Court severed and excised two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000), requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the guideline range, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2000), setting forth standards of review on appeal. The Court held the remainder of the guidelines remain as advisory, requiring a sentencing court to consider applicable guidelines ranges, but allowing the court to \u201ctailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">Section 3C1.1 directs a sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense lev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>el by two levels if the defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded ... the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and the obstructive conduct related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 268 (4th Cir.2001) (citing USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 (subdividing letters and numbers omitted)). The Application Notes for \u00a7 3C1.1 explain that \u201cwillfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding\u201d amounts to the type of conduct for which the enhancement applies. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(e)). We conclude that because Ryans admitted at sentencing that she intentionally ignored the district court\u2019s correspondence notifying her about her sentencing hearing, her Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We also conclude that Ryans has failed to establish that her sentence under a mandatory sentencing scheme constituted plain error affecting her substantial rights. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that defendants must demonstrate actual prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Ryans\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
