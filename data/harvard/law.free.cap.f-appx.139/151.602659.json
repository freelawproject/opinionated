Because Coleman failed to object to the introduction of the transcript, we review its presence before the jury only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">We may vacate a conviction for plain error if (1) an error occurred, (2) that was plain, (3) affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732-36, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-79. Coleman points us to no rule of law that specifically precludes the admission into evidence of a transcript prefaced by an arguably prejudicial government-prepared synopsis. In his brief, Coleman cites no precedent indicating that the introduction of the transcript into evidence constituted error. It follows, then, that the introduction constituted plain error. Finally, Coleman fails to show us how this evidence affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\">. In his reply brief, Coleman challenges his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He did raise the <em>Blakely </em>issue in a <em>pro se </em>filing, which, in effect, supplemented his attorney's initial brief. This court\u2019s Clerk's Office, however, refused to accept Coleman\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental filing because he was represented by counsel. In sum, Coleman failed to present his <em>Blakely </em>challenge in his initial brief, and it has been abandoned. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that appellant abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim on appeal by not raising a timely constitutional challenge to his sentence in his initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
