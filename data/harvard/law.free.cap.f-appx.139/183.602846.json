Carter, M.D., P.A., and Arnold Carter, M.D. (collectively SFPA), appeal from a final judgment and order on cross motions for directed verdict entered in favor of Elayne Friedman. SFPA claims the district court erred in: (1) denying SFPA\u2019s Motion for Directed Verdict and granting Friedman\u2019s Motion for Directed Verdict under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), (2) deciding SFPA did not act in good faith with respect to Friedman\u2019s claim for overtime wages under the FLSA, and (3) ' awarding Friedman $85,822.75 in attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Friedman was hired by SFPA in 1997 as a data entry clerk. She was promoted to office manager in 1998, and stayed in this position until her employment was terminated on July 31, 2002. As office manager she received $1,080 every two weeks. Friedman was never paid extra for overtime, nor was her paycheck docked for absences until July 8, 2002, and July 12, 2002, when Friedman\u2019s pay was docked for partial days\u2019 absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Friedman filed an action against SFPA alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that SFPA failed to pay her overtime compensation in violation of the FLSA. This case was tried before a jury, and the district judge entered directed verdict in favor of Friedman as to SFPA\u2019s failure to pay her overtime. The jury deliberated on the issue of damages only, and returned a verdict in Friedman\u2019s favor of $12,922.00. The district court also awarded Friedman 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) liquidated damages in an amount equal to Friedman\u2019s backpay award. The district court later awarded Friedman $85,822.75 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $589.25 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">A. <em>Motions for Directed Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">\u201cMotions for directed verdict ... are subject to de novo review. Accordingly, we apply the same standard the district court must apply in determining whether to grant the motion.\u201d <em>Univ. of Fla. v. KPB, Inc., </em>89 F.3d 773, 774 (11th Cir. 1996). We review all evidence in the light most favorable to, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">SFPA claims Friedman was exempt from overtime under the FLSA because she fell under the administrative employee exemption, and thus SFPA\u2019s motion for directed verdict should have been granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and Friedman\u2019s motion for directed verdict, which claimed she was entitled to overtime, should have been denied. The FLSA requires employers to pay overtime compensation to employees who work more than 40 hours per regular workweek. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a). The FLSA exempts employees working in an administrative capacity from this requirement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 213(a)(1). \u201cThe employer bears the burden of proving the ... exemption. We construe overtime exemptions narrowly, against the employer.\u201d <em>Avery v. City of Talladega, Ala., </em>24 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.1994). One of the requirements for exempt status is that the employee be paid on a salary basis, which requires the employee\u2019s compensation not be \u201csubject to reduction because of variations in the quality or <em>quantity </em>of the work performed.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a) (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">Deductions from pay may be made, consistent with salaried status, only: when the employee is absent \u201cfrom work for a day or more for personal reasons other than sickness or accident,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 541.118(a)(2); when the employee is absent for a day or more due to sickness or disability, \u201cif the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide [sick leave] plan,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 541.118(a)(3); or when the employee is penalized \u201cin good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 541.118(a)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\"><em>Avery, </em>24 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The evidence that Friedman\u2019s pay was docked for partial days\u2019 absences was undisputed. The docking of pay for partial days\u2019 absences subjects the employee\u2019s compensation to reduction because of a variation in the quantity of work performed. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a) (2002). A deduction for a partial day\u2019s absence is not one of the allowable deductions. <em>See Avery, </em>24 F.3d at 1340. Thus, the salary basis of pay was violated, and Friedman was rendered a non-exempt employee and was entitled to overtime. <em>See id. </em>The district court did not err in granting Friedman\u2019s motion <em>for </em>directed verdict, or in denying SFPA\u2019s motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">B. <em>Good Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u2018What constitutes good faith on the part of an employer and whether the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that its act or omission was not a violation of the Act are mixed questions of fact and law.... We review such questions de novo to the extent they involve application of legal principles to established facts, and for clear error to the extent they involve an inquiry that is essentially factual.\u201d <em>Dybach v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>942 F.2d 1562, 1566 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotations, citations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\u201cAny employer who violates [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207] shall be liable to the employee ... in the amount of ... [her] unpaid overtime compensation ... and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b). The court may, however, award no liquidated damages \u201cif the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260. The determination of whether an employer acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for believing its act or omission was not a violation of the FLSA has both a subjective and objective component. <em>Dybach, </em>942 F.2d at 1566. Subjective good faith means the employer has an honest intention to ascertain what the FLSA requires and to act in accordance with it. <em>Id. </em>Objective good faith means the employer had reasonable grounds for believing its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>duct comported with the FLSA. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[G]ood faith requires some duty to investigate potential liability under FLSA.\u201d <em>Barcellona v. Tiffany English Pub, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 464, 469 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Carter testified he read materials on exemptions to the FLSA 20 years ago, and it was his understanding that his office manager was exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA. Even if Carter had an intention to ascertain the FLSA requirements and act in accordance with them, he looked into the issue 20 years ago, and did not look into it again before docking Friedman\u2019s pay. Reading information 20 years ago regarding the FLSA does not provide an objectively reasonable basis for believing one\u2019s conduct comports with the FLSA. Thus, the district court did not err in finding SFPA did not act in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">C. <em>Attorneys\u2019Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We review a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ass\u2019n for Disabled Americans, Inc. v. Integra Resort Mgmt., Inc., </em>387 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cGeneralized statements that the time spent was reasonable or unreasonable ... are not particularly helpful and not entitled to much weight. As the district court must be reasonably precise in excluding hours thought to be unreasonable or unnecessary, so should be the objections and proof from fee opponents.\u201d <em>Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1301 (11th Cir. 1988) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">SFPA merely makes generalized statements that the time spent on the case was unreasonable, but does not point to any specific time entries to support its argument. In reviewing the district court\u2019s order, we note the judge did not rubber stamp the fees submitted by Friedman\u2019s counsel; rather, he went through the time entries and reduced hourly rates charged for the work of a paralegal and law clerk, and reduced the hours spent on duplicative work. There was no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">The district court did not err in: (1) denying SFPA\u2019s Motion for Directed Verdict and granting Friedman\u2019s Motion for Directed Verdict under the FLSA, (2) deciding SFPA did not act in good faith with respect to Friedman\u2019s claim for overtime wages under the FLSA, and (3) awarding Friedman $85,822.75 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">. As to SFPA's argument that a provision in the retainer agreement between Friedman and her counsel was an ethical violation impairing Friedman\u2019s ability to settle, we take no position because that argument does not affect the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion in the award of attorneys' fees. If needed, Friedman and the Florida Bar can make a determination on that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
