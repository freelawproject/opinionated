We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Higassi, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 462 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, Appellant did not raise any <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>issue to this court in his initial brief. He did attempt to raise such an issue in a supplemental brief, but we denied him permission to do so. Appellant\u2019s failure to raise the issue in his initial brief bars him from doing so now, and the instructions in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order do not compel a different conclusion. <em>See United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1241 (11th Cir.2005); <em>accord United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence after our consideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
