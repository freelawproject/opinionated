We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely filed. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). Fye also claims that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen her proceedings. Other federal appellate courts have found they lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte power. <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir. 2004); <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir. 2003); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999). Even were we to assume jurisdiction, however, we would find no reversible error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
