Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Duarte-Benitez\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Duarte-Benitez, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 269 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated our opinion and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. Duarte-Benitez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1360, 161 L.Ed.2d 98 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-22\">On direct appeal, Duarte-Benitez did not assert error on the basis of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle in his initial brief or during the time allowed to file a reply brief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">In <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), we addressed a similar situation: a remand from the Supreme Court with instructions to consider our opinion in light of <em>Booker </em>in an appeal in which the appellant did not timely raise either a constitutional or <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1262. We applied \u201cour well-established rule that issues ... not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned,\u201d reinstated our previous opinion, and affirmed Dockery\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam)). Such is the procedure we will follow in this case because Duarte-Benitez failed to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence in his initial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>We reinstate our previous opinion and, upon reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s remand, affirm Duarte-Benitez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-24\">. On 30 June 2004, Duarte-Benitez filed a supplemental authority, arguing that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his aggravating role was not determined beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury and citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We granted the government's motion to strike because the supplemental authority raised an issue not previously raised in Duarte-Benitez's initial brief. <em>See Duarte-Benitez, </em>slip at 10-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
