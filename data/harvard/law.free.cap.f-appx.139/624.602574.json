We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Texas law, original defendant Edmundo Guevara was acting within the scope of his employment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation when he made the allegedly defamatory remarks that are the basis of this lawsuit. <em>See Minyard Food Stores, Inc. v. Goodman, </em>80 S.W.3d 573, 577-79 (Tex.2002).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">2. Because Guevara was acting within the scope of his federal employment in making the remarks, the United States was properly substituted as a party in place of federal employee Guevara pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability and Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(1) \u2014 (2). Pursuant to the Westfall Act, upon substitution, the case fell under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">3. The claimed defamatory conduct of federal employee Guevara falls within the \u201clibel and slander\u201d exception to the FTCA divesting the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">4. We note Appellants\u2019 complaint of the district court\u2019s conversion of the Government\u2019s 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. Because we find that the district court did not err in weighing the evidence related to the scope-of-employment issue under either standard, we do not reach this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
