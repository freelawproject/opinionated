Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant Walton\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 846 and 851, and 235-month sentence. <em>See United States v. Touchstone, </em>97 Fed.Appx. 904 (11th Cir.2004) (Table). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">In his initial brief, Walton argued that: (1) the district court constructively amended the indictment by its response to a jury question; (2) the district court\u2019s calculation of drug quantity, for purposes of determining his sentencing guideline, was based on hearsay evidence; and (3) the evidence did not support the district court\u2019s sentencing him as a leader or manager of the conspiracy. Notably, Walton raised no constitutional sentencing challenge, nor did he otherwise assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADU\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi </em>] indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief.\u201d). We recently extended the foregoing rule to preclude untimely challenges based on <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005). In his initial brief in this case, Walton asserted no such <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Walton\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
