Wilson appeal their convictions and sentences after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute Oxycodone in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 846 (2000). In light of the valid appellate waiver provisions in their plea agreements, we dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-21\">Brady and Wilson made a knowing and voluntary decision to forego their right to appeal in their plea agreements, <em>see United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995), and the district court properly reviewed the waiver provisions with them at their plea hearing. <em>See United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Wiggins, 905 F.2d </em>51, 53-54 (4th Cir.1990). Under these circumstances, we find Brady and Wilson have waived their right to appeal their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not alter our decision. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 169-70 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not render an otherwise valid appellate waiver unknowing or involuntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
