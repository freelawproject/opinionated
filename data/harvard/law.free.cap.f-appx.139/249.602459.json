Styles urges that the district court committed three separate errors under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005):(i) applying the sentencing guidelines in a mandatory fashion; (ii) sentencing Styles under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) where the indictment did not include Styles\u2019 prior felony convictions; (iii) finding that Styles\u2019 prior convictions qualified as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b), where that characterization was not charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Apart from <em>Booker, </em>Styles also urges that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked the authority to depart downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11 and in concluding that Styles\u2019 prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon qualified as a violent felony for ACCA purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">We conclude that while the district court committed no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>in sentencing Styles, it did commit statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing under the mandatory guidelines scheme. Because the government has failed to meet its burden of showing that this error was harmless, we vacate Styles\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing. Because the guidelines range will remain an essential consideration in the district court\u2019s discretionary sentencing, we also clarify that the district court did possess authority to depart downward, pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Styles was indicted for one count of firearm possession by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Following trial, a jury returned a guilty verdict. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) concluded that styles was subject to the ACCA enhancement, and set his base offense level at 33, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). With a criminal history category of V, the resulting sentencing range was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Styles filed several objections to the PSI, arguing in relevant part that the rule in <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applied to the federal sentencing guidelines. The district court repeatedly commented that it would \u201clike to give [Styles] a break such as you\u2019ve indicated, but I really don\u2019t think I have any choice.\u201d The district court then told Styles that it was bound to give him a sentence which was \u201cmore than I wish\u201d and sentenced Styles to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the applicable guideline range. Styles timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Because Morgan raised his constitutional objection to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines at sentencing, we review the issue <em>de novo, </em>and reverse \u201conly if any error was harmful.\u201d <em>United States v. Paz, 405 F.Sd </em>946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Constitutional <em>Booker </em>errors are harmless only where the government can show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>For a non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error to be harmless, the government shoulders the somewhat lower burden of proving that when the proceedings are viewed in their entirety, the error did not affect the sentence, or had \u201cbut very slight effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">ACCA CLASSIFICATION AND VIOLENT FELONY FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">The Supreme Court has held that the government need not allege in the indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to use those convictions to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The <em>Booker </em>decision itself confirms that the rule set forth in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior conviction) </em>which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also, United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that following <em>Booker </em>and <em>Shepard, \u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that [it] is not binding precedent.\u201d). In light of this binding precedent, we reject Styles\u2019 argument that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated when neither the indictment nor the jury verdict included findings on the three predicate felonies that resulted in his AGCA classification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249,1257 (11th Cir.2004) (rejecting an argument that the district court erred under <em>Blakely </em>when it enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, based on his four prior convictions for violent and drug-related felonies that were not alleged in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We likewise find no merit in Styles\u2019 argument that following <em>Booker, </em>a district court may not find that a defendant\u2019s predicate convictions qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The question of whether prior felonies qualify as \u201cviolent\u201d remains a matter of law to be determined by the court \u2014 not a question of fact to be found by the jury. This is made clear by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>Shepard </em>confirms that \u201ca <em>court </em>sentencing under [\u00a7 924(e) ] could look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction\u201d qualified as a violent felony. <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257 (emphasis added). While <em>Shepard </em>thus limits the types of material a court may consider in making its \u201cviolent felony\u201d determination, it in no way called into question a court\u2019s power to pass on this matter of law. <em>Accord United States v. Schlifer, </em>403 F.3d 849, 852-53 (7th Cir.2005) (refusing to \u201cparse out the recidivism inquiry\u201d where appellant argued that judge\u2019s findings as to whether prior convictions were for crimes of violence violated Sixth Amendment); <em>United States v. Marcussen, </em>403 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Shepard </em>\u201clends further support to the rule that <em>the sentencing court, </em>not a jury, must determine whether prior convictions qualify as violent felonies\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">STATUTORY BOOKER ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">While the district court thus committed no constitutional error, as a result of <em>Booker\u2019 </em>s remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>statutory error exists when the district court misapplies the sentencing guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). There can be no dispute that the district court here committed statutory error. Moreover, in light of the district court\u2019s express statement that it would impose a lower sentence if it had the discretion to do so, the government concedes that the ease should be remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u00a7 5K2.11 DOWNWARD DEPARTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">While appellate review of a district court\u2019s decisions on downward departures is limited, we may determine <em>de novo </em>whether a district court erred in concluding that it lacked authority to depart downward. <em>United States v. Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d 917, 919 (11th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1373 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Here, the district court determined that it lacked the authority to depart under \u00a7 5K2.11. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">Sometimes, a defendant may commit a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm. In such instances, a reduced sentence may be appropriate, provided that the circumstances significantly diminish society\u2019s interest in punishing the conduct, for example, in the case of a <em>mercy </em>killing. Where the interest in punishment or deterrence is not reduced, a reduction in sentence is not warranted. For example, providing defense secrets to a hostile power should receive no lesser punishment simply because the defendant believed that the government\u2019s policies were misdirected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">In other instances, conduct may not cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law proscribing the offense at issue. For example, where a war veteran possessed a machine gun or grenade as a trophy, or a school teacher possessed controlled substances for display in a drug education program, a reduced sentence might be warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11. In <em>Hadaway, </em>the defendant argued that he was entitled to a \u00a7 5K2.11 downward departure because his case was outside the heartland in that he did not possess the intent to use the gun for an unlawful purpose. <em>Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d at 919-20. Though the district court believed that it lacked the authority to depart downward, we held that it \u201chad the authority to depart downward if it were persuaded that Hadaway\u2019s case truly was \u2018atypical ... where conduct significantly differs from the norm,\u2019 or that Hadaway\u2019s conduct threatened lesser harms.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 920 (internal citations omitted). Under <em>Hadaway, </em>the district court here did have the authority to depart downward if it were persuaded by Styles\u2019s argument that his case was truly atypical or that his conduct threatened lesser harms than the conduct that Congress sought to address. <em>See Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Moreover, <em>Booker </em>recognizes that after judges calculate and consider the applicable guidelines range, they have discretion to depart from that range and impose a more lenient or more severe sentence, so long as the resulting sentence is reasonable. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767; <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). As such, because Styles\u2019 preserved Booker statutory error argument requires that we remand the case for resentencing under the guidelines scheme that <em>Booker </em>has rendered advisory, the district court will be obligated to recalculate the guidelines range, which remains an essential consideration in sentencing. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1332 n. 9. In making this guideline calculation, the district court may thus consider whether Styles\u2019 case merits a discretionary downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">. Similarly, the district court properly held that Styles\u2019 prior Florida conviction for carrying a concealed weapon qualified as a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b). A prior panel of this Court has already answered this question in the affirmative. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 402 (11th Cir.1996). As the district court was bound by this decision, so are we.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
