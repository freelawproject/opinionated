See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Mickey Rattler appeals the 63-month sentence imposed after his conviction for an assault inflicting serious injury within the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Reservation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 113(a)(6) &amp; 1153 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Rattler contends that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated because he was sentenced on facts found by the court and not by the jury. Rattler did not object to his sentence in the district court based on <em>Blakely, </em>or <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); therefore, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Because Rattler received a higher sentence than would have been permissible based only on the jury\u2019s findings, we vacate and remand Rattler\u2019s sentence for resentencing under an advisory guidelines system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-49, 555-56 (finding that Hughes satisfied all three prongs of the plain error test set forth in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), when he received a sentence substantially longer than the sentence permitted based purely on the facts found by a jury, and that the court should exercise its discretion to recognize the error).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Although the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. Sentencing courts should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>should consider the Guideline range, along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guideline range, the court should explain its reasons for departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West Supp. 2005). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Rattler also argues that the restitution imposed by the district court is erroneous in light of <em>Blakely. </em>He argues that the court made factual findings by identifying the victims of the offense and the amount owed to each, and that after <em>Blakely </em>these findings must be made by a jury. We conclude that Rattler\u2019s restitution argument fails. Because there is no statutory maximum for restitution, the Sixth Amendment and <em>Booker </em>do not apply to restitution ordered by the sentencing court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Flaschberger, </em>408 F.3d 941, 943 (7th Cir.2005). <em>See also United States v. Wooten, </em>377 F.3d 1134, 1144 &amp; n. 1 (10th Cir.) (holding that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely </em>do not apply to restitution orders) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 510, 160 L.Ed.2d 381 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Rattler\u2019s conviction and the sentence as to the restitution order, vacate the remainder of the sentence, and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-14\">.
