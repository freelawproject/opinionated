The district court sentenced him under the federal Sentencing Guidelines to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment. This sentence was based, in part, on the district court\u2019s attributing certain drug quantities to Hooper that were not alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-17\">In his initial brief, Hooper challenged the district court\u2019s inclusion of three drug sales conducted by Douglas E. Jackson as relevant conduct in determining Hooper\u2019s sentence, arguing that it was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Hooper filed a supplemental brief, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), asserting for the first time on appeal that his sentence is unconstitutional. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the federal Sentencing Guidelines, under which courts were required to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence, violated the Sixth Amendment because of their mandatory nature. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the Guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court); <em>id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-20\">Although Hooper did not raise this Sixth Amendment challenge at sentencing, this court has held that a mandatory enhancement based on judicial fact-finding supported by a preponderance of evidence constitutes plain error warranting correction. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). In light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>we find that the district court plainly erred in sentencing Hooper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Hooper does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>challenge the validity of his conviction, we affirm his conviction, vacate his sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Hughes.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Id. </em>at 546 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-15\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>cedure in effect at the time\u201d of Hooper\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-17\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
