He asks us to review the final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>(\u201cBIA\u201d), which affirmed an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision to deny his motion to reopen his removal proceedings and allow him to adjust his status. Sukhera contends, first, that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen on the basis that he was statutorily ineligible to adjust his status. He maintains that he should have been considered \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the United States because he is the beneficiary of a labor certification application that was filed before April 30, 2001, and was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d Second, Sukhera contends that we should continue his removal proceedings until his pending immigration petition for alien worker is processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Because petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), as amended by IIRIRA. <em>See Antipova v. U.S. Attorney Gen, </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1264 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Before we can proceed to the merits of Sukhera\u2019s petition, we \u201cmust first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition at all.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). The permanent rules provide that, with certain exceptions, \u201c[j]udicial review of a final order of removal ... is governed only by\u201d the Hobbs Act\u2019s procedures for appellate review of agency decisions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 311, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2285, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">According to the immigration statutes, a nonimmigrant can adjust his status to legal permanent resident status, if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">(1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">INA \u00a7 245(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255 of this title, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General the authority for which is specified under this sub-chapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]hat section precludes appellate review of discretionary decisions, but does not preclude review of non-discretionary legal decisions that pertain to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza, </em>321 F.3d at 1332. When our review is limited by one of \u00a7 1252\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provisions, our \u201cjurisdiction to entertain an attack on that order mounted through filing of a motion to reopen\u201d also is curtailed. <em>Patel v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">Although we have not yet addressed the scope of our jurisdiction over the denial of a motion to reopen to adjust status under IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules, other circuits have. Both the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have held that they retained jurisdiction over a petition for review of the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for discretionary relief because the IJ never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ruled on the discretionary relief sought during the underlying removal hearing. <em>See Guerra-Soto v. Ashcroft, </em>897 F.3d 637, 639-40 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201c[s]ection 1252(a) (2) (B) (i) would have prohibited our review only if the case had been reopened, and discretionary relief had actually been denied. This case never got that far, and thus we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion\u201d); <em>Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 520, 526-27 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the court retained jurisdiction over the petition for review because the alien abandoned his original request for adjustment of status and accepted voluntary departure, the IJ never ruled on the petition for adjustment of status, and therefore, the petitioner was challenging the denial of the motion to reopen, not the denial of an adjustment of status application). Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that it lacked jurisdiction over a petition for review of the denial of the petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen, pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), because the BIA, in its final order of removal, denied the discretionary relief sought, and the Court would have lacked jurisdiction over a direct petition from the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474-75 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Because Sukhera is petitioning for review of the denial of his motion to reopen rather than a denial of his request to adjust his status and the BIA denied the motion on the non-discretionary basis of statutory ineligibility, the jurisdiction-stripping provision of INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), is not implicated. We turn, then, to the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We review the denial of such motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cWhere the denial rests on a conclusion that the alien is statutorily ineligible for the relief he seeks, however, the BIA\u2019s decision is also subject to review for errors of law.\u201d <em>Liu v. INS, </em>645 F.2d 279, 283 (5th Cir. May 15, 1981) (pre-IIRIRA). Judicial review of a denial of a motion to reopen in deportation proceedings is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted). The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), an IJ can reopen \u201cany case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested\u201d with the BIA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQa\">[Tjhere are at least three independent grounds upon which the [BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\"><em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">An eligible alien can apply to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>and be considered \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the United States, if he is the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of an application for labor certification that was properly filed by April 30, 2001, and was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(i)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 12550(1); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(1)(i)(B). \u201cApprovable when filed means that, as of the date of the filing,\u201d the application for labor certification was \u201cproperly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous.... \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(3). \u201cA labor certification involving a specific job offer is valid only for the particular job opportunity....\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 656.30(c)(2). Once the Attorney General receives the application for adjustment of status and the appropriate fee, he \u201cmay\u201d adjust the status if the alien \u201cis eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible,\u201d and \u201can immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 2450(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2). An immigrant visa cannot be issued to the alien until the labor certification is approved. INA \u00a7 203(b)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(3)(C); INA \u00a7 212(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(5); <em>In re H-A, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 728, 741 (BIA 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion or commit errors of law in denying Sukhera\u2019s motion to reopen because his application for labor certification had not been approved at the time he filed his motion, and therefore, an immigrant visa was not immediately available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The final point Sukhera\u2019s petition for review presents is that his removal proceedings should have been continued until his pending immigration petition for alien worker is processed. \u201c[N]o court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order [of removal] unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(f)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(f)(2); <em>Dorelien v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>317 F.3d 1314, 1316-17 (11th Cir. 2003). Sukhera has conceded his removability and is ineligible to adjust his status. Hence, he cannot demonstrate that his removal order was \u201cprohibited as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
