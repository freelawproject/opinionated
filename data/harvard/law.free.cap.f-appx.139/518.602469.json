On appeal, Dobbin contends the evidence was insufficient to support the firearms convictions. Dobbin further contends the sentence violated the rules announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">When reviewing a sufficieney-of-the-evidence claim, the verdict will be sustained \u201cif there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>(1942). \u201c[S]ubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). Under \u00a7 924(c), any person is prohibited from possessing a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. With respect to \u00a7 924(c), a firearm is \u201c(A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) (2000). The Government need not present expert testimony to support a \u00a7 924(c) conviction. In <em>United States v. Redd, </em>161 F.3d 793, 797 (4th Cir.1998), this Court stated that \u201ceyewitness testimony is sufficient to prove that a person used a firearm.\u201d We find there was sufficient evidence to support the firearm convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">At sentencing, the district court imposed a sentence treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. The court also imposed an alternate sentence, as instructed by this Court\u2019s order in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004), <em>opinion issued by, United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). The mandatory sentence and the alternate sentence were identical. Because the district court specifically imposed an alternate sentence \u201cpursuant to 18 United States Code Section 3553(a), as directed by the Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>\u201d (J.A. at 758-59), we find there was no error. The burden is on Dobbin to establish prejudice, <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005), which he has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
