On appeal, Goodall argues that, at a minimum, the district court was required \u201cto consider\u201d and \u201cto follow\u201d the recommended sentencing guidelines outlined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, which indicate a sentence of 8 to 14 months for a Grade B violation. Goodall also argues that her particular violations of supervised release did not support what she calls the court\u2019s upward departure. Goodall acknowledges that \u201cChapter 7 sentencing guidelines are [not] binding on the district courts,\u201d and that they \u201ccan vary from the requisite guidelines so long as the guidelines are genuinely considered.\u201d Goodall argues, however, that the district court \u201cfailed to genuinely consider the Chapter 7 guidelines.\u201d Goodall also argues that, although previously a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the sentencing guidelines under \u00a7 7B1.4 was reviewed for an abuse of discretion, the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act (the \u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Sta. 650 (2003), changed the standard of review to <em>de novo. </em>Finally, Goodall argues that the district court erred by sentencing her to' supervised release when both she and the government had recommended otherwise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">\u2018We review a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the chapter seven guidelines\u2019 recommended sentencing range for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). We have held that the Chapter Seven policy statements, which provide ranges of imprisonment that a court may follow when revoking supervised release based upon certain \u201cgrades\u201d of violations, are merely advisory, not binding. <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 360 (11th Cir.1996). We have indicated that a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter Seven sentencing range does not constitute a \u201cdeparture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. Because the policy statements are not binding and the decision not to follow them is not a departure, the PROTECT Act does not cover this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>sentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martin, </em>371 F.3d 446, 449 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The grades of offenses are outlined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1, and the suggested sentences are contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. We have held that \u201cit is enough that there is some indication the district court was aware of [the guidelines] and considered them.\u201d <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u201cA court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and impose a prison sentence when it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his or her supervised release.\u201d <em>Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d at 363 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3)). \u201cUpon revocation of a term of supervised release, the court may require a defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute without credit for time served on post-release supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3)). \u201cThe court may not, however, impose a sentence upon revocation of greater than ... three years where it was a class B felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An offense is classified as a Class B felony if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 25 years or more. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The record makes clear that the district court was aware of and considered the Chapter Seven ranges. The parties mentioned the ranges several times during their arguments at the sentencing hearing, and it is apparent from the district court\u2019s statements about needing to craft a longer sentence to help Goodall that it considered and found ineffective the recommended ranges. Because the guideline ranges set forth in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory and the record indicates that the district court considered the recommended range, it did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Goodall to a term of imprisonment in excess of the suggested range. Accordingly, we affirm her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\">. Goodall only makes a passing reference to this claim, and, consequently, she has waived it. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 n. 10 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that where appellant made only a passing reference to the district court\u2019s dismissal of a particular claim and made no arguments on the merits as to that issue, the issue was deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
