Fitzgerald had moved in the district court for issuance of a nunc pro tunc order to correct the sentence that he received under the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">As federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, Fitzgerald must have statutory authority for the filing of his motion. <em>Veldhoen v. United States Coast Guard, </em>35 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1994). Section 2255 of Title 28 is the means by which a federal prisoner may challenge the validity of his sentence. <em>United States v. Cates, </em>952 F.2d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, Fitzgerald\u2019s motion should have been construed as a motion arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Such a recharacterization of Fitzgerald\u2019s motion has important consequences of which Fitzgerald should be apprised. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">Because Fitzgerald\u2019s motion was in the nature of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, this court lacks jurisdiction over Fitzgerald\u2019s appeal absent a certificate of appealability ruling in the district court. <em>Muniz v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 43, 45 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114-15 (5th Cir.1997). The judgment of the district court is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
