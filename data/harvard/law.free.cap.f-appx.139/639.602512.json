She argues that the IJ erred in denying her request for a continuance and that the denial of the continuance violated her due process rights. Because Gonzalez did not raise this issue in her appeal to the BIA, we do not have jurisdiction to review her challenge of the denial of her request for a continuance. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Further, because the error was one that was correctable by the BIA, Gonzalez\u2019s due process claim is subject to the exhaustion requirement and, therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review her due process claim. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389-90 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Gonzalez also argues that the IJ erred in denying her application for cancellation of removal based on an erroneous legal interpretation of <em>Faddah v. INS, </em>553 F.2d 491 (5th Cir.1977). Because the IJ\u2019s decision ultimately involved the exercise of discretion, we do not have jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">PETITION DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
