Cain, </em>No. 04-30458, (5th Cir. Nov. 9, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">Thomas argues that the district court should have granted him habeas relief because the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), was unreasonable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). He challenges the Louisiana Second Circuit Court\u2019s finding of fact as a wrongful substitution of its judgment and credibility determination for that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">The district court determined that Thomas\u2019s challenge to the finding of the Second Circuit rejecting the trial court\u2019s factual finding was a matter of state procedural law and therefore not subject to federal habeas review. <em>See Rudd v. Johnson, </em>256 F.3d 317, 320 (5th Cir.2001). The district court also stated that Thomas failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the Second Circuit Court erred when it did not defer to the factual findings of the trial court. The district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous because the state court\u2019s decision did not involve an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-21\">With regard to Thomas\u2019s assertion that the evidence was insufficient in light of the new alibi testimony, he is not entitled to relief because <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), requires the court to evaluate the \u201crecord evidence\u201d to determine whether a finding of guilt could be supported. 443 U.S. at 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781. The testimony of Charles Cummings was not presented at trial and therefore cannot be considered in an insufficiency argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-22\">The state court reviewed the testimony and evidence presented at trial and concluded that a rational trier of fact could find Thomas guilty of attempted manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt. The state court\u2019s decision was not in violation of clearly established federal law and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>not involve an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Therefore, Thomas is not entitled to federal habeas relief. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
