Petitions for review of a final order of the Board must be filed no later than thirty days after the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). The Board\u2019s order is dated October 20, 2004. Thus Miller\u2019s petition for review was due to be filed by November 19, 2004. As Miller filed the petition for review on November 22, 2004, we find that her petition is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-22\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
