Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Butler was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of cocaine. The lengthy history of this case is recited in previous opinions of this court. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>67 Fed. Appx. 798, 799 (4th Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Butler, </em>172 F.3d 45, - (4th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">Prior to Butler\u2019s latest resentencing, the Supreme Court decided <em>Booker, </em>overruling our circuit precedent and holding that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a district court, acting pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act (Act) and the federal sentencing guidelines, imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Because the Act as written effectively gave the guidelines the force of law, the Court recognized that applying the Act and the guidelines as written would result in Sixth Amendment violations under certain circumstances. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750-51. To remedy this problem, the Court severed and excised the provision in the Act mandating sentencing in conformance with the guidelines, <em>see id. </em>at 764 (severing and excising 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp. 2005)), thereby rendering the guidelines \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 757.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">In light of this change in the law, the district court concluded that it was not bound to follow the mandate from our previous decision, which required imposition of a 20-year guideline sentence. Rather, the district court sentenced Butler de novo, treating the guidelines as advisory and imposing a prison term of 14 years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-19\">The Government contends that the district court erred in sentencing Butler to less than the 20 years required by the mandate of our last opinion because no exception to the \u201cmandate rule\u201d applied. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">The mandate rule requires lower courts to \u201ccarry the mandate of the upper court into execution and ... not consider the questions which the mandate laid at rest.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the trial court does retain discretion to reopen matters laid to rest in certain \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d namely, upon a showing \u201c(1) ... that controlling legal authority has changed dramatically; (2) that significant new evidence, not earlier obtainable in the exercise of due diligence, has come to light; or (3) that a blatant error in the prior decision will, if uncorrected, result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>in a serious injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67 (internal quotation marks &amp; alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">While it is true that our mandate required imposition of a 20-year sentence, the district court correctly ruled that an exception to the mandate rule applied because there had been a dramatic change in controlling sentencing law since we issued our decision. After <em>Booker, </em>district courts are no longer required to treat the guidelines as mandatory, but instead must treat them as advisory only. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 217 (4th Cir.2005). This rule directly affected Butler in that the 20-year sentence ordered by our prior mandate was required only under the mandatory, not the advisory, regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Government maintains that <em>Booker </em>did not apply to Butler\u2019s case, which the Government contends was still on collateral review when he was last sentenced. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 147-48 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201cNew rules of constitutional criminal procedure are generally not applied retroactively on collateral review.\u201d). The Government\u2019s argument fails, however, because collateral relief had been obtained by Butler years earlier when he obtained a vacatur of his original illegal sentence. Once the case was remanded to the district court, Butler\u2019s collateral review was over; there was nothing left to review collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">It could certainly be said that Butler was fortunate that the district court twice sentenced him incorrectly, thus continuing his case long enough for <em>Booker </em>to be decided before the latest sentence was imposed. But, it is not unusual for temporal happenstance to control whether a criminal defendant receives the benefit of a Supreme Court decision. And, Butler is no less \u201cdeserving\u201d of benefitting from <em>Booker </em>than are any of the other defendants who happened to have been sentenced after <em>Booker </em>was decided. The fact is that when Butler was sentenced, <em>Booker </em>had already been decided, and that is all that matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In sum, we affirm Butler\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-14\">. The Court also severed 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), which mandated appellate review in conformance with the guidelines. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-21\"><em>. </em>The Government represents that, having completed his prison sentence, Butler is subject to deportation any time upon the completion of the process for deportation conducted by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b540-11\">LUTTIG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AU-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">I dissent. I believe, contrary to the majority, that this case remains on collateral review and, as a consequence, Butler is not entitled to the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
