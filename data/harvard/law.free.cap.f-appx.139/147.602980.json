(\u201cFirm\u201d). Rl-1 at 1-2. Sehafler alleged that she owned, and annually placed on the rental market, a condominium in Boynton Beach, Florida, that was part of the Fairway Park development, which ISMA managed. Sehafler alleged that ISMA (1) wrongfully spent association fees that it received from its members, (2) failed to provide its members with annual financial statements, as required by law, and (3) harassed Sehafler when she attempted to obtain these records. She further contended that ISMA harassed her by blocking access to her apartment with construction. Next, she alleged that, for the past several years, ISMA\u2019s periodic association meetings had been a \u201c \u2018trashing orgy, ... during which [she] was discussed and ridiculed, insulted, trashed, intending to defame, slander, and present [her] in a false light.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5. Sehafler also alleged that ISMA: (1) embezzled and wrongly converted her association fees; (2) falsely claimed that she had not paid her fees and then \u201cgave themselves permission to trespass to and occupy [her] real property;\u201d and (3) kept track of her presence on the property. <em>Id. </em>at 5-7. Sehafler further alleged that FPCA (1) violated Florida law by failing to provide her with financial statements, (2) converted or embezzled her funds, (3) falsely alleged that she had failed to pay her association fees, and (4) trespassed on her property. She next contended that the Firm was a \u201cpaid enabler[],\u201d and aided and abetted FPCA and ISMA in their wrongdoings. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. Finally, she claimed that all three defendants (1) were involved in a civil conspiracy, (2) made false allegations against her, and (3) intentionally caused her to suffer emotional distress. Sehafler sought, <em>inter alia, </em>damages exceeding $5,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">FPCA filed a motion to dismiss, in which it argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that, because Sehafler had filed actions arising from the same factual situations on a yearly basis against the same defendants, her complaint was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>According to FPCA (1) Sehafler had filed at least two prior lawsuits seeking the same or similar relief against the same defendants, (2) the lawsuits arose out of the same set of facts, and <em>res judicata </em>also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>precludes consideration of issues that could have been raised, but were not, in the previous lawsuits, and (3) the parties were identical. The Firm and ISMA filed substantially similar motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The defendants attached copies of Schafler\u2019s previous lawsuits to their motions to dismiss. These materials show that Schafler previously filed a lawsuit in state court against ISMA, which was dismissed without prejudice for lack of prosecution on 26 February 2003. <em>See </em>Rl-8 at exhibit A. They also show that Schafler filed a diversity lawsuit, <em>pro se, </em>on 12 February 2002, in the Southern District of Florida against FPCA, ISMA, the associations\u2019 individual board members, the Firm, and its counsel. This lawsuit concerned Schafler\u2019s ownership of a condominium, in the Fairway Park complex, and her central allegation was that the defendants interfered with her business relationship with her tenants. There, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, finding that (1) Schafler\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim of tortious interference with a business relationship, civil conspiracy, trespass to chattel, extortion, defamation, or legal malpractice, and (2) no facts would support a jury award of punitive damages sufficient to meet the threshold for diversity jurisdiction. We affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at exhibit C.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In the instant case, Schafler filed two amended complaints that did not substantially differ from her original complaint. R1-11, 16. She also filed a reply to the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendants\u2019 contention that her claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>was erroneous, since the Supreme Court, in <em>Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 598-99, 68 S.Ct. 715, 719-20, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948), held that collateral estoppel has no bearing on a situation where the legal matters determined in a previous case differ even slightly from those raised in the second case. She also argued that, under <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), the defendants\u2019 reliance on state and local law was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The district court dismissed Schafler\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice pursuant to the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Rl-23 at 3-4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taking judicial notice of the orders issued in Schafler\u2019s previous lawsuits, the court found that all four of Florida\u2019s requirements of <em>res judicata </em>were met because Schafler had filed two or more prior lawsuits, arising out of the same set of facts, with some complaints repeated verbatim, that sought the same or similar relief against the same defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The court warned Schafler that her behavior bordered on being \u201cvexatious\u201d and cautioned her against reasserting her claims against these defendants. Schafler filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that the district court\u2019s decision was based on \u201cfalsehoods and deceit,\u201d and bias, which the district court denied. Rl-24, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">On appeal, Schafler concedes that she brought a \u201csimilar\u201d claim in February 2002 against these defendants, but argues that the district court erred by not applying the doctrine of \u201crepeated offense and offender.\u201d Appellant Brief at 2, 24-25. She argues that, since the defendants prevented her from renting her property during December 2001, which provided the basis for her 2002 lawsuit, they have continued to prevent her from renting her property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and such subsequent harms are not barred from adjudication by <em>res judicata. </em>Additionally, she argues that her prior lawsuit was not a final judgment on the merits, since it was dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and therefore one of the requirements for <em>res judicata </em>remains unmet. She also contends that the district court, under <em>Erie, </em>should not have applied Florida law. She further argues that the district court\u2019s decision violated due process and equal protection by denying her the right to an unbiased court. Schafler also argues the merits of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">As a preliminary matter, \u201c[w]hen a prior action is brought in diversity in federal court, the federal law of <em>res judicata </em>governs in a second suit brought in diversity.\u201d <em>Commercial Box &amp; Lumber Co. v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>623 F.2d 371, 373 (5th Cir.1980). Therefore, to the extent that the district court applied Florida law to determine whether Schafler\u2019s prior federal litigation barred the instant claim, it erred. Nonetheless, the error appears harmless because Schafler\u2019s complaint would also be barred by <em>res judicata </em>under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Res judicata </em>is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo. Jang v. United Technologies Corp., </em>206 F.3d 1147, 1149 (11th Cir.2000). <em>\u201cRes judicata </em>bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). An action is barred by prior litigation if all of \u201cthe following elements are present: (1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is well-settled that a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \u201cis not an adjudication on the merits that would give rise to a viable res judicata defense.\u201d <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1188 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1016, 124 S.Ct. 568, 157 L.Ed.2d 430 (2003). We have observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">[that w]e do not believe that the res judicata preclusion of claims that \u201ccould have been brought\u201d in earlier litigation includes claims which arise after the original pleading is filed in the earlier litigation. Instead, [this Court] believe[s] that, for res judicata purposes, claims that \u201ccould have been brought\u201d are claims in <em>existence at the time the original complaint is filed </em>or claims actually asserted ... in the earlier action ... The underlying core of facts must be the same in both proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\"><em>In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1298-1301 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Because all of the federal requirements for <em>res judicata </em>are met, the district court correctly found that Schafler\u2019s February 2002 lawsuit barred the instant complaint. First, the district court\u2019s 2002 order was effectively a final judgment on the merits. In that case, the district court fully analyzed the merits of Schafler\u2019s case and found that it failed to state a claim for relief. <em>See </em>R1-8 at exh. B. The court then noted that, because Schafler failed to allege any facts that would entitle her to relief, no reasonable jury could determine that she was entitled to damages that would meet the jurisdictional amount, and dismissed the claim as also lacking subject-matter jurisdiction. In <em>Davila, </em>where the district court reached the merits of the case and then found that subject-matter jurisdiction was lacking, we held that the decision was on the merits, noting that \u201cif the district court truly had dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction it could not legitimately have reached the merits of [the plaintiffs] contentions.\u201d <em>Davila, </em>326 F.3d at 1188-89. Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>here, the district court\u2019s determination that Schafler\u2019s claims lacked merit was the basis for its discussion of subject-matter jurisdiction. Therefore, Schafler\u2019s February 2002 lawsuit was a final judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Next, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida was a court of competent jurisdiction over this case, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, assuming that the jurisdictional amount was met. Additionally, it is clear that the parties in the suits were identical, so the third requirement is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The final requirement for <em>res judicata </em>was also met in this case. Although the specific claims in each case differed somewhat, both suits involved tort claims for damages against these three defendants regarding Schafler\u2019s ownership of a particular condominium. <em>See </em>R1-1, 8 at Exh. B, C. A careful reading of Schafler\u2019s complaint shows that all of her instant claims could have been raised in her February 2002 lawsuit. <em>See Davila, </em>326 F.3d at 1187. The instant suit involved two main complaints: (1) mismanagement of association fees; and (2) harassment and mistreatment of Schafler. <em>See </em>R1-1. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that these claims were not in existence at the time of her original action. <em>See In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d at 1299. Regarding the defendants\u2019 management of association fees, Schafler\u2019s complaint contained no dates and referred to \u201cannual audited financial statement[s]\u201d that were not delivered, suggesting that she allegedly had not been receiving her statements for some time. <em>See </em>Rl-1 at 3-4. Regarding the harassment claims, her complaint referred to \u201ctrashing\u201d that had occurred for several years during ISMA\u2019s periodic association meetings, and otherwise failed to orient temporally any of the other alleged harassment. <em>See id. </em>at 1-10. Both Schafler\u2019s complaint and briefs on appeal contain extremely general allegations that fail to aver that these claims arose after her previous lawsuit or to clarify exactly when they arose. Therefore, because it appears that Schafler\u2019s claims were in existence at the time of her previous lawsuit, and she fails to show otherwise, the fourth requirement for <em>res judicata </em>was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">II. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Schafler\u2019s arguments on appeal are without merit. She offers no legal support for her contention that continuing conduct is not barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Additionally, there is no evidence in the record to support her allegations of bias, and the record shows that she did not file a motion for recusal. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that the instant complaint was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Because we affirm the district court\u2019s order on <em>res judicata </em>grounds, we need not consider the defendants\u2019 contention that Schafler\u2019s brief violated the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. The court noted that, although it was dismissing Schafler\u2019s complaint on the basis of res judicata, upon a cursory review of the merits, it felt that failure to state a claim would probably \"be an alternative method to dismissal.\u201d R1-23 at 4 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
