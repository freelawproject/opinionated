After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the parties entered into a valid settlement that included paragraph 4 of the Memorandum Of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-27\">The question of whether the parties intended to enter into a valid settlement agreement is a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>See Lee v. Hunt, </em>631 F.2d 1171, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>1177 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question of whether an attorney had the requisite authority to bind his client to a settlement agreement is also a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Gymco Constr. Co. v. Architectural Glass and Windows, Inc., </em>884 F.2d 1362, 1364 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. Sunderland Marine Mut. Ins. Co. v. Weeks Marine Const. Co., </em>338 F.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly found that the parties entered into a valid settlement containing paragraph 4 of the MOU. Moreover, the district court correctly found that defendants\u2019 counsel had the authority to bind defendants to the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">SouthTrust Bank has filed a cross-appeal contending that it is entitled to contractual attorneys\u2019 fees and collection costs incurred as a result of the defendants\u2019 appeal. We do not read the district court\u2019s order requiring SouthTrust \u201cto convey all of the bank\u2019s rights, title and interest in and to the notes and loan documents evidencing all of defendants\u2019 indebtedness to the bank\u201d as precluding SouthTrust from requesting contractual attorneys\u2019 fees and collection costs following resolution of this appeal. We agree with the defendants that SouthTrust\u2019s requests for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is premature. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
