A jury decided that her employer, Murphy Oil USA, Inc., did not have to pay her overtime because as a manager she fit within the FLSA\u2019s executive exception. The district court correctly refused to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-25\">Murphy Oil, along with its petroleum refining and processing business, operates a number of stores across the southwest United States where it sells its petroleum products. Wagner was employed as a site manager with Murphy Oil from November 2000 through January 2003 working first at a store in Brunswick, Georgia and later in Madison, Alabama. Her duties as site manager included overseeing and training store employees, preparing paperwork, and controlling inventory. Wagner typically supervised at least two employees. Her duties as site manager often overlapped with those of the hourly employees. For instance, she might operate a cash register or clean the store restrooms. She initially received a monthly salary of approximately $2,100 which was ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>increased to $2,600 per month. She regularly worked over forty hours a week and never received overtime pay from Murphy Oil because Murphy Oil claimed she was exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA as an executive employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The FLSA requires employers to pay covered employees 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for each hour worked in excess of forty per week. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Workers employed in a \u201cbona fide executive capacity\u201d are exempt from the overtime pay requirement. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). The Department of Labor regulations set forth two alternatives that can be used to determine whether an employee is \u201cemployed in a bona fide executive capacity.\u201d The first is set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1 subsections (a) through the first part of subsection (f). The latter part of subsection (f) provides the \u201cshort test.\u201d <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1; <em>Brock v. Norman\u2019s Country Mkt, Inc., </em>835 F.2d 823, 826 (11th Cir.1988). The \u201cshort test\u201d is used when the employee is (1) paid on a salary basis (2) of not less than $250 per week (3) for primary duty of managing a recognized department or subdivision and (4) regularly directs two or more employees. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(f). The regulations put substance before form. They specifically require an examination beyond an employee\u2019s title to the specific duties performed by the employee to determine whether the employee\u2019s primary duty is management. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.103 (defining primary duty); 29 C.F.R \u00a7 541.102 (defining management). The burden of proving that an employee fits within the executive exception falls on the defendant. <em>Brock, </em>835 F.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It is undisputed that Wagner received a salary above the $250 per week threshold. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a) (defining salary as regular payments on a weekly or less frequent basis which are not subject to reduction due to poor performance). The only real issue was whether she was paid primarily for managerial responsibilities and supervised at least two employees. The jury heard testimony that Wagner\u2019s position with Murphy Oil met these two requirements. After the district court instructed the jury on Murphy Oil's burden to show that Wagner fit within the executive exception the jury found that Murphy was not entitled to overtime pay. The trial court refused Wagner\u2019s motion to set aside the jury\u2019s finding. Wagner argues on appeal that her performance of non-executive employee jobs such as stocking shelves and cleaning toilets precluded the jury\u2019s finding that she was not entitled to overtime. She challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her partial motion for summary judgment, the jury instruction on Murphy\u2019s Oil\u2019s burden of proving the executive exception for overtime pay, and the district court\u2019s refusal to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Wagner\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s refusal to grant her motion for partial summary judgment is a non-starter. We \u201cwill not review the pretrial denial of a motion for summary judgment after a full trial and judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Lind v. United Parcel Serv., </em>254 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2001). We also find no error in either the jury instruction or the district court\u2019s refusal to set aside the jury\u2019s determination that Wagner fit within the executive exception and was not entitled to overtime wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
