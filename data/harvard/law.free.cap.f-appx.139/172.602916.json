Because the amounts of methamphetamine not challenged by Melqu\u00edades were sufficient to support his base offense level, we find his argument regarding the district court\u2019s calculation of the methamphetamine weight attributed to him moot. Because Melqu\u00edades failed to show that a connection between the sold pistols and the offense was clearly improbable, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement for possession of a weapon. Because Melqu\u00edades denied, rather than clarified, his post-arrest statements to police, the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement for obstruction of justice. Because Melqu\u00edades cannot show that the <em>Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights, the district court did not err in enhancing his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Melquiades\u2019s sentence is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Melqu\u00edades and two co-defendants, including Zeferino Carlos, were indicted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine and three counts of distributing 50 grams or more of methamphetamine. He pled not guilty and, following a jury trial, was convicted of all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The facts, as set forth in the presentence investigation report (PSI), revealed that a confidential informant (Cl) provided information to authorities that Carlos was selling methamphetamine at his business, Su-Tienda Guadalupana Restaurant. The Cl subsequently received .86 gram of methamphetamine from Carlos and returned to purchase 114.8 and 235.1 grams of methamphetamine from him. During one of the purchase transactions, the Cl introduced Carlos to an undercover police officer (UC) who asked Carlos about purchasing handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">On 8 October 2002, the UC met Carlos and Melqu\u00edades at Carlos\u2019s restaurant to negotiate the sale of two handguns and methamphetamine. Melqu\u00edades and the UC went to an adjacent business, where Melqu\u00edades sold the UC two pistols. After Melqu\u00edades told the UC that he was Carlos\u2019s methamphetamine supplier, the UC advised Melqu\u00edades that he would contact him regarding the possible purchase of one-quarter to one-half pound of methamphetamine. The UC later met with Melqu\u00edades and purchased 109.8 grams of methamphetamine. At another meeting, the UC purchased 227 grams from Melqu\u00edades, who indicated that he would obtain two fully-automatic machineguns for the UC. Melqu\u00edades also stated that the methamphetamine was being stored in detergent boxes in Carlos\u2019s restaurant. The UC conducted another purchase from Melqu\u00edades of 441.8 grams of methamphetamine. The UC later went to Carlos\u2019s restaurant and observed Carlos, who had a handgun wrapped in a cloth next to him, talking to an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Carlos was arrested, and several firearms were found in his residence. A search of Melquiades\u2019s residence yielded 428.4 grams of methamphetamine as well as drug paraphernalia. In a search of Carlos\u2019s restaurant and the adjacent grocery store, police seized 248.9 grams of methamphetamine hidden in a box. Melqu\u00edades admitted that he had transported methamphetamine on three occasions for an individual who was one of Carlos\u2019s suppliers. He further stated that he transported unknown amounts of methamphetamine on the first and third trips, and five pounds of methamphetamine on the second trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The probation officer calculated that Melqu\u00edades was accountable for four of the five pounds (1.8 kilograms) involved in the second trip, plus an additional 1.8 kilograms, which was the amount of drugs distributed to the UC plus the amount of drugs seized from Melquiades\u2019s residence and Carlos\u2019s restaurant. Based on the amount of drugs involved, the PSI calculated Melquiades\u2019s base offense level as 34, and added a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The PSI added 2 levels for obstruction of justice, in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, because Melqu\u00edades denied his post-arrest statement, for a total offense level of 38. The PSI determined that Melquiades\u2019s criminal history category was I, which yielded a guidelines range of 235 to 293 months in prison. Melqu\u00edades objected to the amount of methamphetamine attributed to him, denying that he admitted post-arrest to the weight of the transported methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Melqu\u00edades argued that he should be held accountable for no more than 1.4 kilograms of methamphetamine, because (1) he was not involved in Carlos\u2019s other sales; (2) the drugs found at Carlos\u2019s residence and restaurant should not be attributed to him; and (3) the weight of the drugs involved in Melquiades\u2019s trips was unknown. The district court overruled this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In addition, Melqu\u00edades objected to the two-level increase in offense level for possession of a firearm, arguing that there was no testimony that he had been seen with a gun, other than those that he sold. The district court found that Melqu\u00edades could not bear the burden of establishing clear improbability that the gun was not connected with the underlying offense and overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Melqu\u00edades also objected to the obstruction of justice enhancement and the denial of acceptance of responsibility. Although he argued that he never told the officers the weight of the transported drugs, he later conceded that he \u201cbelieve[d] that he did tell the [officers] that he believed it was five pounds\u201d but later filed an objection to the PSI stating that \u201che did not know the weight\u201d of the drugs. RIO at 46; Rll at 18, 21. The district court overruled both objections. Melqu\u00edades was then sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 235 months on Counts One and Three through Five, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Melqu\u00edades raises four issues on appeal. First, he argues that the district court erred in applying a sentence enhancement based on the weight of the methamphetamine found at Carlos\u2019s restaurant because Carlos had numerous suppliers. Second, he contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on the determination that he possessed a weapon during the offense of conviction or related relevant conduct, because the only incident involving weapons was when he delivered two pistols to the UC, with whom Melqu\u00edades had no previous dealings. Third, Melqu\u00edades asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice because the government did not prove that (1) he was acting with malice to intentionally obstruct justice, and (2) his false statement actually hindered investigation. Fourth, he argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by imposing a harsher sentence than the jury verdict allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and their application of the Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1312 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">A. <em>Drug Quantity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Melqu\u00edades argues that he should not have been held responsible for the weight of the drugs seized at Carlos\u2019s restaurant because Carlos had a number of suppliers and the source of the seized drugs was uncertain. Melqu\u00edades also contends that he should have been held responsible for only the drugs he sold to the UC and the drugs found at his residence but admits that he transported five pounds of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>We may \u201cdecline to consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>83 F.3d 371, 377 n. 6 (11th Cir.1996). A defendant \u201cseeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate\u201d such that the claims are \u201cunambiguously demarcated.\u201d <em>United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOtherwise the issue \u2014 even if properly preserved at trial \u2014 will be considered abandoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under Section 2D1.1(a)(3) of the Sentencing Guidelines, the base offense level for more than 1.5 kilograms but less than 5 kilograms of methamphetamine is 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Other than stating that only the amounts found in his residence and sold by him to the agent should have been attributed to him, Melqu\u00edades failed to raise arguments in his appellate or reply brief regarding the 1.8 kilograms attributed to him from the drug shipment. Consequently, he has failed to properly challenge this amount on appeal. Since the amount transported by Melqu\u00edades \u2014 1.8 kilograms \u2014 is sufficient to support the district court\u2019s application of a base offense level of 34, Melquiades\u2019s arguments on this issue are moot. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">B. <em>Possession of a Weapon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Melqu\u00edades argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on the possession of a weapon during the offense because no weapons were found on him or at his residence. He also contends that there was no connection between the firearms and the drugs as he neither possessed a weapon during his discussions regarding methamphetamine nor discussed methamphetamine while he was in possession of the firearms. Melqu\u00edades maintains that he should not be held accountable for Carlos\u2019s possession of a firearm during a drug transaction because he knew only that they were in the business of selling guns but did not know that Carlos possessed one.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a two-level enhancement to a base offense level for an offense involving drugs is appropriate if the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The government must show \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the weapon was present at the site of the charged conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citation omitted). In <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>we explained that \u201c \u2018site of the charged conduct\u2019 includes conduct relevant to the offense of conviction, that is, acts \u2018that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u2019 \u201d 172 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). Once the government has met its burden, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a \u201cconnection between the firearm[] and the offense is \u2018clearly improbable.\u201d\u2019 <em>Diaz, </em>190 F.3d at 1256 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Melqu\u00edades sold the two pistols to the UC in the business adjacent to Carlos\u2019s restaurant. At another meeting, Melqu\u00edades said that the methamphetamine in the conspiracy was being stored in Carlos\u2019s restaurant, where the UC later observed Carlos with a handgun next to him. Additionally, a search of the restaurant and adjacent business yielded 248.9 grams of methamphetamine. Consequently, the government showed by a preponderance of the evidence that weapons were possessed at the site of the charged conduct \u2014 a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Melqu\u00edades failed to demonstrate that a connection between the weapons and the offense is clearly improbable, because he and Carlos both sold weapons and methamphetamine to the UC, and negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for the sale of both occurred at the same time. Further, Melquiades\u2019s contention that Carlos\u2019s possession of a weapon was not foreseeable is meritless, since he admits that he and Carlos were in the business of selling weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">C. <em>Obstruction of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9E\">Melqu\u00edades argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice because the government failed to show that he acted with malice and because his statements were made as a result of confusion regarding the exact amount of transported methamphetamine. He also contends that his false statement at sentencing did not hinder the government\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level increase in offense level if the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ald\">willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Both in his written objections and at the sentencing hearing, Melqu\u00edades denied that he had made post-arrest statements to police officers regarding the weight of the drug shipment, which was relevant conduct included in the calculation of his base offense level. With such a denial, he attempted to obstruct or impede his sentencing by denying the quantity of drugs to which he had previously admitted and which had been taken into account in his base offense level. Melquaides\u2019s argument that he could not impede the investigation of the offense because the investigation was complete is without merit, because Section 3C1.1 includes attempts to obstruct or impede sentencing of the offense of conviction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">D. <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">On appeal, for the first time, Melquiades argues that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred by imposing a harsher sentence based on the enhancements for the drug quantity, weapon, and obstruction, than the jury verdict allowed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He maintains that, pursuant to, his sentence should be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">Because Melqu\u00edades did not object on this basis in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). Under the plain error analysis, we can not correct the error unless there is: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). Because Melquiades\u2019s sentence was enhanced under a mandatory guidelines system based on findings made by the judge that went beyond facts found by a jury, the first prong of the plain error test is satisfied. <em>See id. </em>The second prong of the plain error test is also satisfied because such an error is plain during appellate consideration. <em>See id. </em>at 1299. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>satisfy the third prong of the plain-error test, a defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">must establish a reasonable probability that if the district court had considered the guidelines range it arrived at using extra-verdict enhancements as merely advisory, instead of mandatory, and had taken into account any otherwise unconsidered [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553 factors, the court would have imposed a lesser sentence than it did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1302. If these three conditions are satisfied, we may then exercise our discretion as to the forfeited error \u201conly if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298 (quotations and internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In <em>Booker, </em>the court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756. We have found that there is no Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker </em>where the defendant admits to the facts that were used to enhance his sentence. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we held that the \u201cconstitutional error\u201d in <em>Booker </em>was the use of extra-verdict enhancements under a mandatory system, not the use of extra-verdict enhancements to increase a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 1300, 1301. We rejected the defendant\u2019s <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim because the defendant had failed to meet his burden of showing that the imposed sentence would have been different if the district court had applied the guidelines in an advisory, rather than mandatory, manner. <em>Id. </em>In order to show that an imposed sentence would have been different with the advisory use of the guidelines, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory manner. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">1. <em>Sentencing Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">a. <em>Drug Quantity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">In the indictment, Melqu\u00edades was alleged to have conspired to possess 500 grams of methamphetamine between 1 May 2002 and 13 January 2003 (Count One), 50 grams of methamphetamine on 10 October 2002 (Count Three), 50 grams of methamphetamine on 23 October 2002 (Count Four), and 50 grams of methamphetamine on 22 November 2002 (Count Five). The jury convicted Melqu\u00edades of all counts, and by special verdict, of the quantity of drugs alleged in the indictment. The base offense level for that quantity of drugs, 650 grams of methamphetamine, is Level 32. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4). Melqu\u00edades, however, admitted to transporting 1.8 kilograms of methamphetamine, a quantity covered by Level 34, the level attributed to Melquiades by the probation officer. Where a defendant is sentenced based on facts to which he admitted, there is no Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330. Melquiades is thus unable to satisfy the first prong of the plain error analysis as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">b. <em>Weapon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">The indictment did not charge Melqu\u00edades with conduct involving a weapon. The probation officer\u2019s initial recommendation for an enhancement was based on Carlos\u2019s possession of a firearm on 10 December 2002, but was later expanded to incorporate Melquiades\u2019s 8 October 2002 meeting with the UC at the restaurant where firearms and drugs were stored, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>discussion with the UC regarding the sale of firearms and methamphetamine, and his display of several firearms to the UC, and his subsequent discussions with the UC regarding the sale of firearms. Melquiades\u2019s attorney argued that, even though Melqu\u00edades was present when the UC picked up the weapon, drug transactions were not discussed at that time. Melqu\u00edades never admitted his possession of nor presence near any firearms. The district court\u2019s factual finding was based on the evidence presented at trial. Because Melquiades\u2019s sentence was enhanced for possession of a firearm as a result of findings made by the judge that went beyond the facts admitted by Melqu\u00edades or found by the jury, the first prong of the plain error test is satisfied. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Because Melquiades\u2019s appeal was pending when <em>Booker </em>was issued, the error is plain and the second prong of the plain error test is also satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The third prong of the test requires that Melquiades show that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and, specifically, that there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence if it had considered the guidelines\u2019 range as advisory instead of mandatory as to the extra-verdict enhancement. Absent the weapons enhancement, Melquiades\u2019 guideline range would have been based on an adjusted offense level 36, or 188 to <em>235 </em>months instead of 235 to 293 months. The statutory mandatory minimum for Melquiades\u2019 four counts was twenty-five years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii) and 841 (b)(1)(B)(viii), or 300 months. Because the weapons enhancement would have made no difference in Melquiades\u2019s resulting sentence, he cannot show that there is a reasonable probability that a lesser sentence would have been imposed if the district court had considered the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">c. <em>Obstruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The district court\u2019s enhancement of Melqu\u00edades\u2019 sentence for obstruction of justice was not based on facts tried to the jury or admitted by Melqu\u00edades but was based on the district court\u2019s finding that Melqu\u00edades had admitted the quantity of drugs in his post-arrest statement which he later contested. It thus satisfies the first prong and second prongs of the plain error test. The obstruction of justice enhancement raised Melqu\u00edades\u2019 base offense level from a level 36 to a level 38, or from a range of 188-235 months to 235-293 months. Since Melquiades\u2019s minimum mandatory sentence was 25 years, Melquiades\u2019s resulting sentence would not differed without the obstruction enhancement or if the district court had applied the guidelines in an advisory instead of mandatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The district court did not err in calculating the drugs attributed to Melqu\u00edades, enhancing his sentence for possession of a weapon, or in applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice. Nothing in the record establishes a reasonable probability that if the district court had considered the guidelines range it arrived at using these enhancement as merely advisory, instead of mandatory, and had taken into account any otherwise unconsidered \u00a7 3553 factors, the court would have imposed a lesser sentence than it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\">.
