The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The BIA\u2019s order dismissing Yadegar\u2019s appeal expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Yadegar was not a credible witness. Although our review ordinarily is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, when the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, this court may review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s credibility finding without stating additional reasons, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">The IJ must determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). This court does not substitute its judgment for that of the IJ or BIA with respect to witness credibility and the ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78. When a finding regarding credibility is based on \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence,\u201d it will be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 79. \u201c[A] credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">In addition to arguing the merits of his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT, Yadegar challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that he was not a credible witness. The IJ\u2019s credibility finding is amply supported by the record. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. The record thus does not compel a credibility determination contrary to that of the IJ. <em>See Lopez De Jesus, </em>312 F.3d at 161. Because the credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, Yadegar\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b655-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
