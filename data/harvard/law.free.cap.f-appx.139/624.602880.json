The magistrate judge explained fully why the finding of the administrative law judge has to be upheld. Claimant now points to notes on the Dallas VA Medical Center assessment saying that he suffered from depression and post traumatic stress disorder, and he says that he is entitled to a further review to take that under consideration. This is said not to be a new development, and the mere notes would not warrant a decision that there is a reasonable possibility that the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration would determine the claimant\u2019s disability differently. See <em>Johnson v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
