See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b602-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">Gerard Compaore, a native and citizen of Burkina Faso, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s order denying his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture and an order of the Board denying his motion for reconsideration. We deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-24\">We note that Compaore\u2019s challenges to the underlying decision of the immigration judge, as affirmed by the Board without opinion, are not properly before the court because he did not file a timely petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. I.N.S., </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (noting the time limit is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d). Compaore\u2019s petition is timely only as to the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-25\">This court reviews the Board\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2005). A motion for reconsideration asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision and requires the movant to specify the error of fact or law in the prior Board decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (2005); <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>(noting that a motion to reconsider questions a decision for alleged errors in appraising the facts and the law). The burden is on the movant to establish that reconsideration is warranted. <em>INS v. Abudja, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). \u201cTo be within a mile of being granted, a motion for reconsideration has to give the tribunal to which it is addressed a reason for changing its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004). Motions that simply repeat contentions that have already been rejected are insufficient to convince the Board to reconsider a previous decision. <em>Id. </em>We find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Compaore\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Accordingly, we deny Compaore\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
