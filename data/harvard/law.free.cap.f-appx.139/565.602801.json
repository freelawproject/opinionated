The maximum penalty for that offense is ten years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000). Gilliard was sentenced to seventy months in prison, to be served consecutively to a state sentence that he was then serving. Gilliard now appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-21\">Gilliard\u2019s presentence report assigned him a base offense level of 24 because he had two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2003). Gilliard contended in the district court and argues on appeal that whether he had the two prior convictions was a factual determination that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), was required to be charged in the indictment and either proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted in his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-22\">In both <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that the fact of a prior conviction need not be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536 (quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)); <em>accord Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Here, the record is clear on its face, and Gilliard does not dispute, that he had the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>qualifying felony convictions. Thus, there was no error under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
