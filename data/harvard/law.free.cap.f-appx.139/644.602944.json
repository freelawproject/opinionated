INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We will uphold the finding that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the IJ\u2019s decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-19\">At his hearing before the IJ, Fattu asserted that several years after he left Pakistan, political opponents of his father threw stones at the family home and business several times, forcing his parents to leave the country as well. The IJ determined that these alleged actions were a \u201cfar cry\u201d from \u201cpersecution.\u201d After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the record evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197. Fattu\u2019s allegations do not even rise to the level of other types of mistreatment that we have held not to qualify as persecution. <em>See, e.g., Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-20\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
