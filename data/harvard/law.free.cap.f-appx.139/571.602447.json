Fullard petitions for writ of mandamus, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. More specifically, Fullard alleges in the first page of his mandamus petition that \u201cthe District Court didn\u2019t rule on the merits of the case\u201d and attaches the court\u2019s October 9, 2003, order directing the Government to show cause why Fullard\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition should not be granted. We find that there has been no undue delay in the district court because it denied Fullard\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Fullard v. Peguese, </em>No. CA-03-2731-CCB (D. Md. filed Mar. 31, 2004 &amp; entered Apr. 1, 2004). Accordingly, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
