On appeal, Rodriguez argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), requires resentencing. After review, we vacate Rodriguez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">Rodriguez pled guilty without a written plea agreement to illegal reentry by a deported alien. During the plea colloquy, the government set forth the following facts, which Rodriguez admitted as true. Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico. Rodriguez was convicted in Georgia superior court of aggravated assault, and because of the conviction, Rodriguez was deported. Rodriguez then reentered the United States without the permission of either the Attorney General of the United States or the Department of Homeland Security. At the conclusion of the plea colloquy, the district court adjudged Rodriguez guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-19\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The PSI also recommended a 16-level enhancement because Rodriguez\u2019s previous deportation was the result of a crime of violence, namely the aggravated assault conviction in Georgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the PSI recommended a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III, Rodriguez\u2019s Guidelines range was 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither party raised any objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-21\">During the sentencing hearing, Rodriguez objected to the district court\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the Guidelines in computing his sentence. Rodriguez\u2019s objection was based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court overruled Rodriguez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir. 2004), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1089, 160 L.Ed.2d 1058 (2005). In <em>Reese, </em>this Court had held that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1312. The district court adopted the factual statements in the PSI and sentenced Rodriguez to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Rodriguez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On appeal, Rodriguez argues that, under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred by applying the 16-level crime-of-violence enhancement based on facts that were not charged in the indictment and that he did not admit. Alternatively, Rodriguez argues that even if there is no Sixth Amendment violation, the district court erred by imposing his sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). Under <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthere are two types of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">In this case, we conclude that there is no Sixth Amendment violation. First, during the plea colloquy, Rodriguez admitted to the facts supporting the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(n) crime-of-violence enhancement. The facts at the plea colloquy established that Rodriguez is a citizen of Mexico and that Rodriguez was convicted in a Georgia superior court of aggravated assault. After the aggravated assault conviction, Rodriguez was deported. Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), the district court should apply a 16-level enhancement if the alien was deported after a crime of violence. The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) specifically includes aggravated assault in the definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Rodriguez admitted that he was convicted of a crime of violence and was deported thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">Alternatively, we note that the 16-level crime-of-violence enhancement was based on a prior conviction, and even post-Roofc<em>er, </em>\u201cthere is no Sixth Amendment violation when a district court enhances a sentence based on prior convictions, including those specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.2005). Further, the Sixth Amendment does not require a jury to find that the prior conviction is within the category of offenses described in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Although there is no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, there is still <em>Booker </em>statutory error. Rodriguez properly preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim in the district court by objecting during sentencing based on <em>Blakely. See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242,1245 (11th Cir.2005). When there is a timely objection in the district court, we review the defendant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim <em>de novo </em>and determine whether the error is harmless. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). A \u201cnon-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u2018with fair assurance that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal citations and punctuation omitted) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 762, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1246, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe burden is on the government to show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276; <em>see also United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In this case, the government must show that the use of the mandatory Guidelines did not affect Rodriguez\u2019s substantial rights. However, in the record in this case, there is no evidence indicating what effect, if any, changing from a mandatory to an advisory approach would have had on the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the government has failed to carry its burden. <em>See id. </em>at 1271-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Accordingly, we vacate Rodriguez\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing. We note that the district court correctly calculated Rodriguez\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Thus, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Rodriguez under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\">. Section 2L1.2 is the Guidelines provision for \"Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States.\u201d Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) provides for a <em>16-level </em>enhancement if <em>the </em>deportation resulted from a crime of violence, as follows: \"If the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after\u2014(A) a conviction for a felony that is ... (ii) a crime of violence ... increase by 16 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-15\">. The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) defines \"crime of violence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-18\">\"Crime of violence\u201d means any of the following: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-24\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n. B(iii)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">. Because this is a <em>Booker </em>statutory error case, we will apply the non-constitutional harmless error standard, instead of the heightened \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test, which applies to constitutional error. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (\"When the error is of the constitutional variety, a higher standard is applied and it must be clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-16\">. We do not mean to imply that on remand the district court must impose a lesser sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tence. Rather, we merely hold that the government has failed to meet its burden to show that the <em>Booker </em>statutory error of sentencing under a mandatory Guidelines regime was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">We also will not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence below or above the Guidelines range might be reasonable in this case. If there is an appeal of the actual post-remand sentence raising that issue, we can decide it then.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
