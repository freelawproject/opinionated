Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Jean has filed pro se supplemental briefs raising additional issues. We affirm Jean\u2019s convictions, but vacate the sentence imposed by the district court, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Counsel raises as a potential issue that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>See United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). When, as here, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, the relevant question is whether, taking the view most favorable to the Government, there is substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This Court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). This Court \u201cmust consider, circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir. 1982). With these standards in mind, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support Jean\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Jean challenges whether various testimony presented at trial was erroneously admitted. Because Jean did not raise these objections at trial, we review for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find no plain error as to the various evidentiary issues Jean asserts in his pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">Jean further questions whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the evidence admitted at trial that Jean assigns as error. Claims of ineffective assistance generally are not cognizable on direct appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>but should be asserted on collateral review. Only if ineffective assistance is conclusively established on the face of the record should such claims be entertained on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Because ineffective assistance is not conclusively shown on the face of the record, we decline to consider this claim on direct appeal. Jean may assert this claim on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Finally, Jean argues that he should be resentenced in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because his sentence was enhanced on judicially found facts. Specifically, Jean objects to the application of a three-level enhancement for having a supervisory or managerial role in the offense, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(b) (2002). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker, </em>this Court held, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), that a sentence that is impermissibly enhanced based on facts found by the court constitutes plain error that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing under <em>Booker. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56 (citing <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770). Because Jean\u2019s enhancement occurred under the mandatory guidelines scheme and affected his substantial rights, as it resulted in a higher guidelines range, we find the district court committed plain error in sentencing him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56. We therefore vacate Jean\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case and found no other error. Accordingly, we affirm Jean\u2019s convictions, vacate the sentence imposed by the district court, and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>we offer no criticism of the district court, who followed the law and procedure in effect when Jean was sentenced. <em>See generally Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \u201cplain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
