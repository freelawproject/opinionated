We granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue: \u2018Whether appellant\u2019s waiver of her right to appeal her sentence directly or collaterally also precluded her claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">On appeal, Cowart argues that her claims that concerned the validity of her guilty plea or her appeal waiver, and not her sentence, were not precluded by her sentence-appeal waiver. She acknowledges that we, in <em>Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir.2005), held that a valid sentence-appeal waiver precludes a defendant from attempting to attack his sentence through a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing. However, she points out that, in <em>Williams, </em>we stated that there may be a distinction where the \u00a7 2255 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relates to the validity of the plea or waiver, and not the sentence. She argues that three of her claims, namely that counsel failed to: (1) adequately advise her concerning her guilty plea; (2) negotiate a guilty plea to Count 2 instead of Count 1; and (3) raise the issue of her postpartum depression when she pled guilty; are still viable because they do not relate to sentencing but go directly to the validity of the waiver or plea itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>320 F.3d 1230, 1231-1232 (11th Cir.2003). Sentence-appeal waivers are valid if they are made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1341 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Williams, </em>we held that a valid sentence-appeal waiver precludes \u00a7 2255 claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1342. However, we specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">Of course, there may be a distinction between a \u00a7 2255 claim of ineffective assistance in entering or negotiating the plea versus a claim of ineffectiveness at sentencing or a claim challenging the validity of the plea or agreement ... Because Williams\u2019s claims assert ineffectiveness at sentencing and do not concern representation relating to the validity of the plea or waiver, we need not, and do not, reach the other situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1342 n. 2 (internal citations omitted). Additionally, in <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1105 (11th Cir.2004), in the context of a direct appeal, we held that the defendant\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver waived only his right to appeal sentencing issues, and thus considered the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that the government breached the plea agreement. 381 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>1105. There, we found the language of the defendant\u2019s appeal waiver, which specifically applied only to the sentence imposed, controlling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">I. Plea Claims<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In this case the district court erred by finding that Cowart\u2019s claims that her counsel was ineffective for failing to: (1) negotiate a guilty plea to Count 2, instead of Count 1; and (2) raise an issue regarding Cowart\u2019s postpartum depression; were precluded by Cowart\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver. As in <em>Copeland, </em>the language of Cowart\u2019s sentence appeal waiver provided that she waived her right \u201cto collaterally attack her sentence,\u201d and did not mention a waiver of the right to attack her plea or the plea agreement itself. <em>See Copeland, </em>381 F.3d at 1105. Therefore, Cowart\u2019s valid sentence-appeal waiver does not preclude these issues, which relate to the validity of the plea or waiver itself. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision as to these claims is vacated, and we remand to the district court for it to conduct a merits review of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>II. Sentencing Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">As to the sentencing issues that Cowart raises in her \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court correctly found that they were precluded by Cowart\u2019s valid sentence-appeal waiver under <em>Williams. </em>The record supports the conclusion that Co-wart knowingly and intelligently waived her right to appeal her sentence, since: (1) her appeal waiver was specifically read into the record; (2) Cowart stated that she understood the appeal waiver; and (3) she assured the court that she wished to waive her right to appeal. Therefore, she is precluded from raising those claims that relate to her sentencing. <em>See Williams, </em>396 F.3d at 1342. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of her \u00a7 2255 motion as to those four claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">. The district court found that one of the plea issues was not precluded by Cowart\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver: her claim that her counsel was ineffective in advising her about her plea agreement. Any challenge to the district court\u2019s merits determination of this issue is outside the scope of the COA, which only contemplates review of the issues that the district court deemed precluded. Therefore, because our review is limited to the issue specified in the COA, and Cowart has not requested that the COA be expanded to include a challenge to the district court's merits determinations, we do not address this issue. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also Jones v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1251, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2000) (noting that, unless defendant successfully expands the COA to include a claim, we need not address it).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
