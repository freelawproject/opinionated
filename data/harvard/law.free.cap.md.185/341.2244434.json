He contends (or means to contend) that he is deprived of liberty without due process of law, and is denied the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">In substance, his petition aims to allege that: The deceased was shot and killed while committing the \u201cfelony\u201d <em>(cf. Bowser v. State, </em>136 Md. 342, 344, 110 A. 854) of \u201cdaylight burglary\u201d (Code, 1939, Art. 27, Sec. 34), having broken and entered appellant\u2019s outhouse and taken a \u201cboat pole\u201d therefrom. He \u201cadvanced toward appellant in an aggressive manner,\u201d apparently \u201creaching for a weapon.\u201d Appellant \u201cin taking a backward step stumbled\u201d and \u201cthereby fired\u201d his rifle. He was \u201cseized without a warrant,\u201d and \u201chis rifle was seized at the same time and was introduced as evidence against him at the trial.\u201d He pleaded not guilty, was tried before a jury, and had the assistance of counsel for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>defense. \u201cThe State exceeded its jurisdiction in jury challenges.\u201d While on the witness stand he was \u201cinstructed by the State\u2019s Attorney to demonstrate the position in which he was at the moment the shot was fired.\u201d There was no \u201ccompelling force\u201d at the time of the demonstration, and ho objection by his counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As grounds for discharge from imprisonment, appellant sets up (1) the maxim that \u201cevery man\u2019s house is his castle\u201d and the right of self-defense and protection of his property and (2) the privileges against unreasonable searches and seizures and self-incrimination under Articles 26 and 22 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">These grounds are all without merit. \u201cThe writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>cannot be made, unless it be by express statute, to perform the functions of a writ of error, in bringing under review a judgment or sentence of a competent tribunal, simply for errors or irregularities in the proceedings, or in the rendition of the judgment or sentence; that must be done by some more direct' and appropriate proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. Glenn, </em>54 Md. 572, 608. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 465, 82 L. Ed. 1461. Still less can <em>habeas corpus </em>be used to review the verdict of a jury on disputed facts. \u201cAn imprisonment, under a sentence by a Court or magistrate of competent jurisdiction, is not unlawful, unless the sentence, for some cause to be made apparent, be not merely erroneous but an absolute nullity; though if it be shown to be such nullity, the party is entitled to his immediate discharge.\u201d <em>State v. Glenn, supra; Cf. Price v. Clawns, </em>180 Md. 532, 534-537, 25 A. 2d 672. Recent Supreme Court cases hold that through violation of certain constitutional rights in criminal procedure a trial court may lose its jurisdiction \u201cin the course of the proceedings\u201d and its judgment may therefore be void. John<em>son v. Zerbst, supra, </em>304 U. S. 468, 82 L. Ed. 1461; <em>Smith v. O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U. S. 329, 334, 85 L. Ed. 859; <em>Betts v. Brady, </em>316 U. S. 455, 86 L. Ed. 1595; <em>Williams v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Kaiser, </em>323 U. S. 471, 65 S. Ct. 363 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Such violations of constitutional rights do not include mere error as to the number of peremptory challenges of jurors or any of the grounds for discharge set up in the instant case. <em>Cf. Ex parte Hull, </em>312 U. S. 546, 550-551, 85 L. Ed. 1034. Arrest of a murderer and seizure of the weapon with which the murder was committed is not an unreasonable search or seizure. <em>Lawrence v. State, </em>103 Md. 17, 37, 63 A. 96. Appellant\u2019s contention as to self-incrimination is \u201can extravagant extension\u201d of the constitutional privilege. <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U. S. 245, 252, 54 L. Ed. 1021, and of our decision in <em>Allen v. State, </em>183 Md. 603, 39, A. 2d 820. There is no question as to identification of appellant. The demonstration with the rifle (to which he did not object) merely gave him an opportunity to explain and reconcile his defenses of accident and self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In short, it appears from the petition itself that, if the writ were granted, appellant would not be entitled to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u201cThe writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is a high prerogative writ, given by the common law, and made effective and enforced by statute, the great object of which is the liberation of parties who may be imprisoned or detained without sufficient cause.\u201d <em>State v. Glenn, supra, </em>54 Md. 607. \u201cIt is perhaps the most important writ known to the constitutional law of England, affording as it does a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or confinement. It is of immemorial antiquity, an instance of its use occurring in the thirty-third year of Edward I.\u201d <em>Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O\u2019Brien </em>[1923] A. C. 603, 609. The principal statute by which it might be enforced, \u201cthe famous <em>habeas corpus </em>act, 31 Car. II. c. 2,\u201d was \u201cfrequently considered as an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>other <em>magna carta </em>of the kingdom.\u201d <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, III, </em>p. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Chancellor Kilty reported (in 1810) that the statute of 31 Car. II was applicable to local circumstances, but was not proper to be incorporated into the statute law of Maryland for the reason that it had already been substantially re-enacted, with some changes, in the Maryland Act of 1809, Chapter 125. <em>Cf. Ex parte Walsh, </em>5 Md. 607, 609. One of the changes was omission of a requirement of prepayment of the charges of bringing the prisoner. Between 1809 and 1939, a number of acts were passed relating to <em>habeas corpus. </em>In 1939 the statute law still included provisions corresponding, with more or less change, to six of the seven sections of the Act of 1809 and to the corresponding provisions of the statute of 31 Car. II, Code of 1939, Art. 42, Secs. 3, 4, 8-10, 12-15. The Constitution of 1867 (Art. 3, Sec. 55) prohibits passage of any law \u201csuspending the privilege of the Writ of <em>Habeas Corpus.\u201d </em>This is not a prohibition of further legislation reasonably regulating the issuance of the writ. <em>State v. Glenn, supra, </em>54 Md. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is a writ of right; it did not, however, at common law or under the statute of 31 Car. II, issue as of course, but on probable cause for it being shown. <em>Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O\u2019Brien, supra </em>[1923] A. C. 618. Opinion on the Writ of <em>Habeas Corpus, </em>Wilm. 77, 81-94. \u201c* * * if it issued of mere course, without showing to the Court or judge some reasonable ground for awarding it, a traitor or felon under sentence of death, a soldier or a mariner in the king\u2019s service,' a wife, a child, a relation or a domestic, confined for insanity or other prudential reasons, might obtain a temporary enlargement by suing out an <em>habeas corpus, </em>though sure to be remanded as soon as brought up to the Court.\u201d <em>Blackstone, </em>III, p. 132. In <em>Ex parte Walsh, </em>1854, 5 Md. 607, 611,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a case of alleged insanity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>this Court, in an opinion by Chief Judge LeGrand, refused to issue the writ, saying \u201cno case is made in the petition,\u201d and mentioning the danger of issuing the writ without good cause in such a case. In <em>Norwood v. Martin, </em>1810, 3 Har. &amp; J., 199, this Court, instead of issuing the writ, issued an order to show cause, and, after showing of cause and hearing, refused the writ. Such has long been the practice in the Supreme Court and in most of the lower federal courts, under the judiciary act of 1789 and under the more specific provisions that originated in the Act of 1867. 14 Stat. 385. If upon the face of the petition it appears that the prisoner is not entitled to the writ, the Court may refuse to issue it. If the allegations of the petition are inconclusive, an order to show cause may be issued. In this way useless grant of the writ with consequent production of the prisoner may be avoided where from undisputed or incontrovertible facts it appears that no cause for granting the writ exists. <em>Walker v. Johnston, </em>312 U. S. 275, 284, 85 L. Ed. 830; <em>Ex parte Watkins, </em>3 Pet. 193, 201, 7 L. Ed. 650. <em>Cf. Ex parte Quirin, </em>317 U. S. 1, 24, 87 L. Ed. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Nevertheless, for many years before 1941 it was common practice in Maryland to issue the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>as a matter of course. This practice led to growing abuse. Eventually, for some years, the writ was habitually perverted from its great object, and became a device whereby a convicted prisoner could obtain intermission of imprisonment through excursions to distant counties at public expense. The practice became a recognized evil. The legislature by the Act of 1941, Chapter 484 and the Act of 1945, Chapter 702 undertook to remedy the evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Whether, by the general language of Sections 3 and 14 of Article 42 of the Code of 1939 and the corresponding sections of the Code of 1860 and intervening legislation, judges were required to issue the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>as of course, is a question which it is not necessary to consider. If they were, any such requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>has been removed, and the practice in this respect under the more restricted language of the statute of 31 Car. II and the Act of 1809 has been restored, by amendment of Section 3 and repeal of Section 14<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the Act of 1941 and enactment of Section 3B by the Act of 1945. Section 3 provides that the courts or judges to whom complaint is made \u201cshall, <em>unless it appears from, the complaint itself or the documents annexed that the petitioner would not be entitled to any relief, </em>forthwith grant the writ of <em>habeas corpus\u201d </em>(italics supplied, to indicate the 1941 amendment), <em>Cf. </em>28 U. S. C. Sec. 455, 28 U. S. C. A. Sec. 455, R. S. Sec. 755; <em>Walker v. Johnston, </em>312 U. S. 275, 283-284, 85 L. Ed. 830. Section 3B provides that the judge \u201cmay, at his discretion, dismiss the petition or require it to be amended or otherwise amplified unless the application alleges facts sufficient, if true, to probably show that the applicant is illegally detained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Since it appears from the petition itself that appellant is legally detained and would not be entitled to any relief, the petition was properly dismissed and the order must be affirmed. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the lower court\u2019s findings as to previous applications and hearings before Judge Grason and Judge Cobourn. In his brief in this Court appellant says that there was no previous hearing before Judge Grason and that some of the grounds for present application were not presented to Judge Cobourn.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Appellant asked \u201cto be allowed to prosecute his appeal in <em>forma pauperis.\u201d </em>He also asked that counsel be appointed for him or, in the alternative, that he be permitted to argue his appeal orally. Section 3C of Article 42 provides that on appeal this Court \u201cmay permit a hearing on the original papers\u201d and that \u201cthe appeal may be prosecuted without payment of costs if the trial judge so orders, or if permitted by the Court of Appeals on application.\u201d We have already permitted this appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>to be prosecuted on the original papers, without any prepayment of costs. The application for permission \u201cto prosecute his appeal in <em>forma pauperis\u201d </em>is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">From careful examination of the papers (including petitioner\u2019s brief in the lower court) and from appellant\u2019s brief in this Court, we found no need for appointment of counsel. Appellant\u2019s application for appointment of counsel was therefore denied. <em>Cf. Howell v. Amrine, </em>155 Kan. 185, 123 P. 2d 954. His application for permission to argue his appeal in person was also denied. Assuming that we have power to order his removal for this purpose, we see no adequate reason for exercising such power. An application for <em>habeas corpus </em>is not a criminal proceeding. <em>Ex parte Tom </em>Tong, 108 U. S. 556, 559-560, 27 L. Ed. 826; <em>Riddle v. Dyche, </em>262 U. S. 333, 335-336, 67 L.

Even in a criminal prosecution for felony the right of the accused to be present throughout the trial, <em>Duffy v. State, </em>151 Md. 456, 472-477, 135 A. 189, is not applicable to proceedings in an appellate court. <em>Schwab v. Berggren, </em>143 U. S. 442, 447, 36 L. Ed. 218. \u201cWe know of no precedent for taking a prisoner from the penitentiary that he might be present to argue in person his appeal from an adverse judgment on <em>habeas corpus.\u201d Goldsmith v.
