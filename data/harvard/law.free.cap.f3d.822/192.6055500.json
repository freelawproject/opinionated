California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Jeffries did not file a timely response. We granted the motion to withdraw and dismissed the case as frivolous. <em>United States v. Jeffries, </em>616 Fed.Appx. 763 (5th Cir.2015), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 1492, 194 L.Ed.2d 582 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">Proceeding pro se, Jeffries filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which we have reviewed together with his (late-filed) briefing in our court. In his petition for certiorari, Jef-fries alleged that he was sentenced pursuant to the residual clause of the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2. The Solicitor General advised that his position was that such arguments about <em>Johnson </em>should be returned to the circuit court for ruling in the first instance. The Court granted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded for \u201cfurther consideration in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015).\u201d <em>Jeffries, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1492. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court examined the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) and concluded that it was unconstitutional, leaving the remainder of the enhancement sections of the ACCA undisturbed. <em>Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2556, 2563. <em>Johnson </em>addressed the underlying crime of \u201cpossession of a short-barreled shotgun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2556.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">Examining the presentence investigation r\u00e9port (PSR), to which Jeffries did not object on any relevant ground, we determine that he was sentenced as a career offender under the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-18\">(a) A defendant is a career offender if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-19\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-20\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-21\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The effect of this designation is to raise the offense level used to calculate the relevant guidelines sentence (rather than setting a mandatory minimum as is the case with the ACCA). The guidelines define the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in the same way that the ACCA defines the term \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, <em>with </em>18 U.S.C.' \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b). However, Application Note 1 to \u00a7 4B1.2 specifically enumerates aggravated assault as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-23\">Jeffries does not contest that his present conviction and one prior conviction were controlled substance offenses under \u00a7 4B1.2. The other prior crime used to designate Jeffries as a career offender was the crime of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under Texas Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u00a7 22.02, which is a specifically enumerated crime of violence under Application Note 1. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 200-01 (5th Cir.2007) (addressing Application Notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)). Accordingly, Jeffries was not sentenced under the ACCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor was he sentenced under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2. Therefore, he has no arguable claim of relief under <em>Johnson, </em>even assuming arguendo that <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>analysis applies to career offender determinations under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-14\">. The PSR attaches the charging instrument and judgment describing his crime as \"aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d The charging instrument states that he \"intentionally and knowingly use[d] a deadly weapon\u201d causing bodily injury to the victim. Jeffries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>states that his conviction was pursuant to Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-15\">. We previously examined a <em>Johnson </em>challenge to an ACCA enhancement based upon a violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 and concluded that the defendant there could not prevail under plain error review. <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>797 F.3d 346, 348 (5th Cir.2015) (rejecting the defendant's <em>Johnson </em>challenge because it is not plain that Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 is not a violent felony under the force clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 851, 193 L.Ed.2d 751 (2016). Here, too, Jeffries's arguments would face plain error review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
