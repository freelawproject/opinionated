Those persons then apply in the estate of A for distribution to them of the share to which they are entitled as successors in interest of B. The last estate should be distributed first; otherwise the court cannot, without a decree of distribution in the estate of B, know who are the successors in interest of B. This was the rule declared and adopted in the Estate of Cronin, Myr. Pro. Rep. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">One exception to this rule was in the estate of Dr. Levi C. Lane, founder of the Lane Hospital. He left a will by which he gave all his estate to Pauline C. Lane, his wife, and appointed her and Dr. Taylor executrix and executor. She died pending the administration, leaving a will in which she appointed Thomas I. Bergin and R. H. Lloyd executors. These gentlemen claimed that the distribution of the estate should be to them as executors of the last will and testament of Pauline C. Lane, in trust for the persons beneficially entitled thereto, and this was agreed to by the court, department 9: Estate of Levi Cooper Lane, No. 26,571.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The Cronin case was decided December 31, 1879. John Cronin died testate April 1, 1872, seised of real estate. A portion of the estate was devised to his wife, Johanna Cronin, who subsequently died testate, and administration of her estate was also pending. Both estates were ready for distribution. The direction of the court was asked as to the proper mode of distribution; that is whether the interest of the estate of Johanna Cronin in the estate of John Cronin, acquired by her through the will of her husband, should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>distributed, in the distribution of the estate of John Cronin, to the executor of the will of Johanna Cronin, or to the devisees named in the will of Johanna Cronin.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">On these facts Judge Myriek rendered the following opinion: \u201cIt is not the province of an executor or administrator to take title on distribution; he administers upon the title of the testate or intestate, and the object of his administration is to pay the debts and ascertain who is entitled to the surplus. The proper course to pursue in these cases is, to close the estate of Johanna Cronin, by having distribution of her estate, including her interest in the estate of John Cronin, to her devisees, and then let those devisees go with the decree of distribution to the estate of John Cronin, and apply to have the interest of Johanna Cronin in the estate of John Cronin distributed to them as successors in interest of Johanna Cronin as found in the decree of distribution of her estate. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">This course was pursued, and thus both estates were disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The same principles would apply, as well to the estates of intestates as of testates.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The judge who decided the Cronin case, in an opinion written by him while he was on the supreme bench, suggested that it was impracticable to carry out the course he indicated in the Cronin case.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The practice now pursued in the probate department was adopted after discussion in the Estate of Celedonio Ortiz (old number 6270), the question arising on the death of heir pending settlement of father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\n<em>Must the share be distributed to heir\u2019s estate, or await final distribution in the heir\u2019s estate, that the latter\u2019s heirs at lato may be first ascertained?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The probate department held in accord with the argument of the late Edward J. Pringle, subsequently supreme court commissioner, that partial distribution might be made to the personal representatives of the decedent in the junior estate to be held pending its administration for the persons ascertained therein to be entitled to succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The same view was adopted in the Estate of McLaughlin, wherein the Hon. A. L. Rhodes, former chief justice of the supreme court, subsequently judge of the superior court of Santa Clara county, and now practicing therein, contended that the Cronin case enunciated an incorrect, as well as an inconvenient, if not impracticable, principle, and that the true rule was that applied in the Ortiz case. The points and authorities and opinion in these eases were published in the old \u201cLaw Journal\u201d of September 28, 1890, and republished September 29, 1891, and the decree of partial distribution in the Estate of Ortiz to the heirs at law of a daughter dying pending the settlement of the father\u2019s estate, prepared by Mr. Pringle, October 1, 1888, was published in \u201cThe Recorder\u201d December 16, 1903, as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">\n<em>Decree of Partial Distribution to the Heirs at Law of Virginia Ortiz Turner.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Daniel Turner,

legatee of. the said decedent under said last will and testament, and was under the said will entitled to one-eighth (%) of the estate of the said Celedonio Ortiz, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">And it appearing that a bond in the penal sum of $2,500 is sufficient to protect creditors of the said estate of Celedonio Ortiz, deceased, from any injury that may arise from the distribution of the
