The district court denied defendants\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss regarding Champagne\u2019s claim that he was knowingly worked beyond his capacities in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Denials of motions to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment or qualified immunity grounds are appealable collateral orders when based on issues of law. <em>E.g., Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (qualified immunity); <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 147, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (Eleventh Amendment). Of course, we review issues of law <em>de novo. Western Alliance Ins. Co. v. Northern Ins. Co. of New York, </em>176 F.3d 825, 827 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">The Eleventh Amendment bars citizens\u2019 suits in federal court against States and their alter egos. <em>E.g., Voisin\u2019s Oyster House v. Guidry, </em>799 F.2d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1986). Whether an entity is covered by a State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity turns on the entity\u2019s (1) status under state statutes and case law, (2) funding, (3) local autonomy, (4) concern with local or statewide problems, (5) ability to sue in its own name, and (6) right to hold and use property. <em>E.g., Hudson v. City of New Orleans, </em>174 F.3d 677, 681 (5th Cir.1999). Funding is most important. <em>Id. </em>at 681-82. These factors suggest that all Louisiana executive departments have Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Barlak v. Bobear, </em>814 F.2d 1055, 1060 n. 5 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">All but the last two factors favor Eleventh Amendment immunity for LDPSC. Louisiana statutes and cases place the LDPSC within the executive branch, La.Rev.Stat. 36:4(A)(8); <em>Hryhorchuk v. Smith, </em>390 So.2d 497, 502 (La.1980); the LDPSC is state funded, <em>Wilson v. State of Louisiana Through Dept. of Public Safety and Corrections, </em>576 So.2d 490, 492 (La.1991)(state liable for judgments against LDPSC); the head of the LDPSC is appointed by the Governor and serves at his pleasure, La.Rev.Stat. 36:403; and the agency is charged with state-wide law enforcement and rehabilitation, La. Rev.Stat. 36:401(B), which are described as \u201cfunctions of the state\u201d, La.Rev.Stat. 36:408. That LDPSC may sue and be sued, La.Rev.Stat. 36:401(A), and hold property, La.Rev.Stat. 36:406(B), is outweighed by other factors, particularly State liability for LDPSC judgments. \u201c[B]ecause an important goal of the elev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>enth amendment is the protection of states\u2019 treasuries, the most significant factor in assessing an entity\u2019s status is whether a judgment against it will be paid with state funds.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Board of Miss. Levee Comm\u2019rs, </em>832 F.2d 901, 907 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"AYU\">Section 1983 does not abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 345, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979); and Louisiana has not waived it, La.Rev.Stat. 13:5106(A). Accordingly, the action against LDPSC is barred. We REVERSE and REMAND with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Voisin\u2019s Oyster House, </em>799 F.2d at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"AkgY\">Governor Foster is entitled to qualified immunity because Champagne\u2019s complaint alleges no personal involvement by the Governor; and, of course, subordinates\u2019 acts trigger no individual \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>E.g., Alton v. Texas A &amp; M Univ., </em>168 F.3d 196, 200 (5th Cir.1999). We REVERSE the denial of Governor Foster\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion and DISMISS the claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"AHR\">Champagne\u2019s motion to compel evidence and request subpoena service is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"A43-\">REVERSED AND REMANDED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
