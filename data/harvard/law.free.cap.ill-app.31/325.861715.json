Murray, Van Hoorebeke &amp; Ford, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-3\" pgmap=\"322\">The proper location of everything except the standpipe is expressly admitted. The ordinance requires that a majority of the aldermen approve of the location, and two witnesses swear they did so approve, and though all the aldermen were sworn and testify, there are none who gainsay the statement. The mayor says it was not approved by the council in open session, which is not a requirement of the ordinance. That the location is no way objectionable is shown by \"the fact that no complaint has been made, and the city council ordered the test of the works without objection, and this observation , applies with equal force to the objection attempted to be raised as to the boilers.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-4\" pgmap=\"322\">The evidence abundantly proves that within the time specified in the ordinance, or at least within the further time allowed by defendant, the contracting company and plaintiff, as its assignee, erected, at the places designated in the ordinance, a complete system of waterworks, of sufficient capacity to furnish at all times all the water necessary or demanded for the use of the defendant and of its inhabitants in accordance with the ordinance contract, and that afterward, and upon the 16th day of September, 1887, the plaintiff, by test through such system, did throw simultaneously through 100 feet of 2^-inch rubber hose and 1-inch ring nozzle, four streams of water at least 60 feet high by standpipe pressure, and at least 80 feet high by direct pressure of its pump, from four of its hydrants theretofore selected by the defendant\u2019s city council in open session, for the express purpose of making the test provided by the 9th section of the ordinance, and that thereafter plaintiff has kept said system in complete running order, and has supplied the defendant and its inhabitants with all the water required by the ordinance, and in-all things kept and fulfilled every act and thing required of the plaintiff by the ordinance, and that the water is pure and wholesome.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\" pgmap=\"322(58) 323(126)\">Granting that we have proved all things, the test included, as set forth in the declaration, it will be argued, as was held by the trial court, that the defendant had the right to demand a reasonable number of the hydrants be tested, and was entitled of right by the terms of this contract to require plaintiff to make the test on the Franklin street man on the 17th day of September, being the next day after the successful test from the hydrants actually designated by the council in ojien meeting, and that jilaintiff, the second day, failed to make the test successfully, and that the making of a successful testirom these four hydrants, all situate on a main whose west end is dead, was a condition precedent to the right of plaintiff to recover. We deny this. The main extends from east to west on Franklin street, and it is not claimed that it is fed at its west end. It has but two ends\u2014an east end and a west end; its east end is fed, its -west end is not fed.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-4\" pgmap=\"323\">As a prime condition of any test the ordinance (latter clause section 9) provides that at least two of the hydrants to be tested shall be located on a main fed from both ends. The four hydrants here are all on a main the west end of which_ is not fed, but is dead, and therefore it was not in the power of the city to designate these hydrants for test.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\" pgmap=\"323\">Again, the language is that the test shall be made from any four hydrants designated by the city council, two of which shall be on a main fed from both ends; and this designation was made by said council on the 14tli day of September, 1887, to be tested on the 16th, and the designated hydrants were then and there on the said 16th so tested, and the test tilled the requirements; so testifies the mayor, so testifies every alderman and all other witnesses who speak to the point, and so the city council entered upon its records. We insist the city council, having made its selection on the 14th, and made the test on the 16th, jiursuant to such designation, the plaintiff succeeding in this test, and having in.all other respects fulfilled its contract, nothing remained for the defendant but to \u2022 accept forty-three hydrants and to jiay for their use as it agreed to do.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\" pgmap=\"323\">This must have been the view taken by the city authorities, for the next day (the 17tli of September) they filed the ordinance, levying a tax expressly to pay for the use of tliesQ works with the county clerk, and have caused the tax to be extended on the tax books. It has been paid, every dollar, and is now in the city treasury.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-3\" pgmap=\"324\">There is no warrant -in this ordinance for more than one designation of hydrants, nor for test of' any. hydrants othbr than those once designated. The power to designate the hydrants from which the test should he made was exhausted the instant it was exercised-.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqF\" pgmap=\"324\">Messrs. E. B. Green and G. J. McGaffigan, for appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\" pgmap=\"324\">From section 42 of the chapter on practice, for the submission of written propositions of law to be held, refused or modified within such time as the court may require, it ft obvious that the time to be lixed by the court, within which they shall be presented or submitted is some time before the decision of the questions involved and the rendition of the judgment. If the court is to instruct itself upon the law of the case it is all-important that such instructions should be given before the court passes upon the questions and renders a verdict. In this case the propositions of law were submitted, three days after the rendition of the judgment, and counsel had not asked the court to tix a time within which to submit their propositions of law. The record'shows that appellee\u2019s propositions of law were submitted and passed upon by the court on the trial of the case, and some were held by the court and some were refused.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\" pgmap=\"324\">An examination of the propositions of law submitted by appellant\u2019s counsel will disclose the fact that appellant has all advantage in this court of the questions of law raised by those propositions, that he could have, had all these propositions submitted been refused. It is said they are the antitheses of the propositions of law submitted by appellee and held by the court; if so, the same questions are embraced in appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, and can be considered by . this court on this appeal. In any view that can be taken of the action of the court in refusing to consider appellant\u2019s propositions of law, no such error was committed as has \u00bfdeprived appellant of any right, and the judgment should not be reversed for that reason.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-7\" pgmap=\"324(24) 325(77)\">The submission of propositions of law is unlike a motion for a new trial in this, that motion for a new trial may be made at any time during the term, for the statute so expressly provides; but .there is no such provision as to the submission of propositions of law; and when, as in this case, counsel failed, or neglected, on the trial, to submit their propositions of law, or to ask the court to fix a time within which they could do so, they have-no reason to complain of the action of the court in refusing to consider them.</p> <opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b325-4\" pgmap=\"325\">Phillips, J.</author> <p id=\"Ag7\" pgmap=\"325\">The city of Carlyle, in the latter part of 1886, desiring to provide a system of water-works, entered into a contract with the Water, Light and Power Company of St. Louis, Mo., for the construction of the same, which contract was by ordinance of the city of Carlyle duly enacted, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b325-5\" pgmap=\"325\">Ordinance LTo. 8.</p> <p id=\"b325-6\" pgmap=\"325\">Entitled, an ordinance to provide for a supply of water for , fire protection and for use of the inhabitants of the city of Carlyle, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b325-7\" pgmap=\"325\">Section 1.

Starting from these works the said company, its successors or assigns, shall lay down and maintain a complete system of cast iron water mains, of standard weight, so arranged as to provide best for a full and regular supply in all parts of the city, as well for domestic as public use, and attach to said water mains, without cost to the city, forty-three double discharge fire hydrants of best and latest construction, at such points and places as the proper authorities shall designate, and to connect with such system of pipes or any addition or extensions thereto, as many additional fire hydrants as may be required by such authorities, provided that no extension of more than five hundred feet shall be made for each additional hydrant. Any of such hydrants shall be moved- or changed at any time, by direction of said city, by said company, the costs of which shall be borne by the city.</p> <p id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">Seo. 6.

The city of Carlyle, by its city council, for and in consideration of the obligations imposed upon said company, its successors and assigns, by the foregoing sections, hereby agree to and contract with said company, its successors or assigns, to accept the forty-three hydrants stipulated in section five of this ordinance, for the use of said city, as soon as the same are erected, connected with the water main1? and supplied with water, and otherwise conform to this ordinance.

Appellant proceeded to the completion of the works, and on August 8, 1887, the city council of the city of Carlyle passed a resolution extending the time for the completion of the contract thirty days. After the completion of the works by appellant the city council of the city of Carlyle, at a regular meeting of the council, entered an order as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b330-15\" pgmap=\"330\">September 14, 1887.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b330-16\" pgmap=\"330(42) 331(30)\">\" Ordered that the test of the Carlyle water-works take place on Friday, Sept. 16, 1887, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m. The test to be made from four hydrants, to wit: From the hydrants on 16th and Franklin streets, 12th and Livingston streets, 10th and Washington streets, 8th and Fairfax streets ; also from 10th and Franklin streets and 7th and Franklin streets. Adjourned to Saturday, September 17, 1887, at 1 o\u2019clock.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b331-4\" pgmap=\"331\">Darius Kingsbury, Mayor.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b331-5\" pgmap=\"331\">C. R. Berner, Clerk.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b331-6\" pgmap=\"331\">This action of the city council was in accordance with the proviso of section 9 of the. ordinance above cited. On September 16th the test was made, and at a meeting of the city council on the 17th of September, 1887, the following proceedings were entered of record :</p> <p id=\"b331-7\" pgmap=\"331\">\u201cAdjourned meeting of the Carlyle city council, held September 17, 1887, mayor and all members present. Proceedings of last regular meeting read and approved.</p> <p id=\"b331-8\" pgmap=\"331\">\u201c The council, as a committee, report that the test of the Carlyle water-works was made on the 16th instant from one hydrant on 8th and Fairfax; from one hydrant at 10th and Washington; from one hydrant at 16th and Franklin, and from one hydrant at 12th and Livingston streets.</p> <p id=\"b331-9\" pgmap=\"331\">\u201cThe above test reported to have filled the requirements of Water-works Ordinance, No. 8.</p> <p id=\"b331-10\" pgmap=\"331\">\u201c A second test was ordered for September 17th, at 11 o\u2019clock A. h.; from one hydrant at 11th, one at 12tli, one at 13th and one at 16th and Franklin streets. Test resulted in deficiency, and a new test from the same hydrants was ordered to take place at 3 o\u2019clock of the same day from the same hydrants, with standpipe pressure only, the test resulting as follows: Hydrant at 16th and Franklin estimated at 46 feet; on 13th and Franklin, 53 feet; on 12th and Franklin, 45 to 48 feet, and on 11th and Franklin, 60 feet.</p> <p id=\"b331-11\" pgmap=\"331(85) 332(30)\">\u201c The test made on the 16tli and 17th inst. was made in the presence and by the approval of N. W. Perkins, secretary of the Water, Light and Power Co., he being the only representative of said company present at any of said tests. Therefore, in consideration of the premises the following resolution was unanimously passed by the council, to wit: Resolved, that the test made on the 16th and 17th instant, of the Carlyle water-works, not having come up to the requirements of Ordinance Ho. 8, entitled, Water-works,'it is therefore ordered that the said works be not accepted until said works come to the test required by said ordinance. Adjourned.</p> <p id=\"b332-5\" pgmap=\"332\">\u201c Darius Kingsbury, Mayor. Attest: \u201cC. R. Berner, Clerk.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b332-6\" pgmap=\"332\">On the trial, by agreement, the ordinance first above quoted is regarded as the contract in the case. The appellant instituted his action of assumpsit to recover, in accordance with the contract, filing a declaration with special and common counts. The defendant pleaded the general issue and certain special pleas, to which special pleas demurrers were interposed and sustained. Trial was had before the judge, a jury being waived, and a verdict and judgment thereon entered for defendant.</p> <p id=\"b332-7\" pgmap=\"332\">The proper location of watertower, fountains, waterpipes and of everything else, except standpipe, was admitted by defendant. By -the proviso of section 2 of the .ordinance the company was to \u201c establish the best and most suitable place within or near the eastern boundaries of this city for the source of water supply, which shall be submitted to and approved by the city council.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b332-8\" pgmap=\"332\">This is the only provision as to the selection and location of any part of the works, and as everything is admitted to be properly located except the standpipe, the question presentid is simply as to its proper location.</p> <p id=\"b332-9\" pgmap=\"332\">The only reservation by the city council as to its approval of location is as to \u201cthe source of water supply;\u201d and there is such a difference between the meanings of the terms, \u201csource of water supply\u201d and \u201cstandpipe,\u201d that one can not be held to include the other. The one is the point from which the water is supplied; the other the place from which it is distributed. The reservation of the right to approve the location of the water supply is not a reservation of the right to approve location of the standpipe.</p> <p id=\"b332-10\" pgmap=\"332(46) 333(89)\">It appears that no objection was made during its erection by officers of the city who had knowledge of the place where it was erected and of the fact of its erection there. Under \u2022the contract. the city did not reserve the right to approve the location of the standpipe, and can not now be heard to complain of the point at which it was erected. From the records of the city council in evidence it appears that, on completion of the water-works, a test was to be made; and on the 14th of September, 1887, the city council, in accordance with the proviso of section 9 of the ordinance, selected four hydrants, designating them, and also selected two additional ones. The . test was ordered to be made on the 16tli of September.</p> <p id=\"b333-4\" pgmap=\"333\">As appears by the record of the city council of September 17th, the test from the four designated hydrants was satisfactory and in accordance with the requirements of the ordinance. And it does not appear from this evidence that the city council ever designated any other four hydrants than by its order of September 14th. It is true the mayor states that on the 16th, after the test had been made, there was an informal meeting of the board at the hotel corner, and Perkins, who was making the tests for appellant, was there, and .said they could select any four hydrants they wanted and make a further test. He also states that there was no meeting of the city council on the 16th. The record of the city council of the 14th shows that an adjournment to the 17th, at one o\u2019clock, was had. How, by the proviso of section 9 of the ordinance, the hydrants from which the test was to be made must be selected by the city council, and that part of the pretended record of the city council of the meeting of the 17t'a which recites that a test was ordered for the 17th, at eleven o\u2019clock a. m.. could not refer to a test ordered by the city council. Mor does th% evidence in the case show that it was. Yet no test could have been ordered except by the city council.</p> <p id=\"b333-5\" pgmap=\"333\">But had the appellee the right, under the contract, to require a test made from more than four hydrants? As wo construe the contract, the only test the appellee had a right to call upon the appellant to make, was from any four hydrants the appellee might select. Yet it is apparent the trial court held that the appellee had the right to require more than one test and from more than four hydrants. In this there was error. . .</p> <p id=\"b334-3\" pgmap=\"334\">Certain propositions of law wore submitted by appellee to be held, refused or modified by the court. The first was, that appellant, must be required to make out its case by a preponderance of the evidence, which the court properly held. The second was, that \u201c the defendant was not required to accept forty-three fire hydrants, as in said section provided for? until they had been tested in the manner therein provided fur testing them, and it was ascertained by such test that they would do the work therein provided for them to do,\u201d etc. This proposition is, that the whole forty-three hydrants were first to be tested, but such was not the contract. Tet the court held this proposition as law. In this there was error.</p> <p id=\"b334-4\" pgmap=\"334\">A further error assigned by appellant was, that after verdict, and three days after, although before a motion for a new trial, seven propositions of law to be held, refused or modified, were presented to the court by appellant, which the court declined to consider. A verdict is defined as \u201c the opinion of a jury, or a judge sitting as a jury, on a question of fact.\u201d B. &amp; L. Law Diet. Sec. 42 of the practice act says: \u201cIn all cases in any court of record of this State,if both shall agree, both matters of law and fact may be tried by the court, and upon such trial either party may, within such time as the court may require, submit to the court written propositions to be held as law in the decision of the case, upon which the court shall write \u2018held\u2019 or \u2018refused\u2019 as he shall be of opinion is the law, or modify the same, to which either party may except as to the opinions of the court.\u201d After a case is decided propositions can not be\"held or refused in the decision of the case. The aid the court might have from the submission of the propositions in proper time, has been lost. And if, three days after verdict, propositions might be presented, final disposition of a ease might be indefinitely postponed. \"We therefore hold that the propositions of law to be held or refused by a court sitting as a jury must be presented before verdict. So that there was no error in refusing to consider the propositions of law so presented by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b334-5\" pgmap=\"334\">Appellee assigns cross-errors, as follows: Sustaining demurrers to third and fourth special pleas and refusing appellee\u2019s fourth proposition.</p> <p id=\"b335-3\" pgmap=\"335\">The fourth proposition presented by appellee is that the contract sued on is ultra vires, for the reason that it extends through a period of twenty-one years and deprives subsequent city councils of legislative control over the matter embraced in the contract. This identical question was passed on by the Supreme Court of this State in City of East St. Louis v. E. St. L. G. L. &amp; C. Co., 98 Ill. 415, where it was held: \u201c It does not appear in the case nor is it claimed, that the city has exercised its power by ordinance or otherwise, or manifested a wish to provide differently than as by the contract. So far as the contract has been executed it has been as one for the furnishing of the light during the pleasure of the city. Courts should not destroy the contracts made by parties further than some good reason requires. Such an objection as is made to this contract, that it interferes with the exercise of the legislative or governmental power of the city over the subject, does not require that the contract should beheld void, but only voidable, so far as it is executory.\u201d To the same effect is Decatur Gas Light &amp; Coke Co. v. City of Decatur, 24 Ill. App. 544.</p> <p id=\"b335-4\" pgmap=\"335\">There was, no error in refusing to hold appellee\u2019s fourth proposition, and sustaining the demurrer to appellee\u2019s fourth plea was proper. That plea is that the defendant, the city, was indebted in the sum of $1,000 other than by this contract, and that the entire taxable property within the corporate limits was only $256,740; that the indebtedness created by this contract was $44,100, and exceeds five per centum of the value of all the taxable property of the city. This amount of indebtedness is reached by assuming that the forty-three hydrants, at $48.83 per hydrant, for twenty-one years, is an immediate, present indebtedness, which is not correct. E. St. L. v. E. St. L. G. L. &amp; C. Co., supra.</p> <p id=\"b335-5\" pgmap=\"335(64) 336(245)\">The third special plea, to which the demurrer was sustained, was, that previous to the contract no appropriation was made by the defendant. The contract was for furnishing an article of daily consumption during a period of twenty-one years, fixing the price per hydrant. It was within the power of the city to contract to have the water. It did not, by the contract, provide for any indebtedness except for water furnished. When the works are kept in such a condition as to keep up a supply of water, then, and only then, does the indebtedness accrue, at the contract rate; but to keep the standpipe and entire system in such a condition as to supply water to tiie city, as required, involves labor and expense to the appellant, in the payment of employes, the wear and tear of machinery and the consumption of fuel, besides the cost of repairs; such \u25a0is the burden upon appellant to keep itself in a condition to furnish water under the contract before being entitled to pay. There was no indebtedness by the contract at the time the contract was made. Nor was there any indebtedness at the time the city found that the works contracted for were completed in accordance with the contract. When the works were completed arid the water kept to the required height in the standpipe, with engine fires kept banked and ready, and mains and hydrants in good repair and ready for service during a period stipulated in the contract, then, and only then, a liability to pay under the contract was incurred by the city, if incurred at all, and then only for such term as had already expired. This being so, then no appropriation was necessary at the time or before entering into the contract. The demurrer to the third plea, therefore, was properly sustained.</p> <p id=\"b336-5\" pgmap=\"336\">For the errors indicated, however, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b336-6\" pgmap=\"336\">Reversed amd remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
