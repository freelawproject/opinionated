Lawrence, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\">There is an implied covenant in every lease that the tenant shall not injure the premises, and a reciprocal covenant that the landlord shall not do anything to injure the rights of the tenant. United States v. Bostwick, 4 Otto, 66.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\" pgmap=\"145\">Notwithstanding the covenant in this lease upon the part of the lessees that premises were in good condition at beginning of term, yet if they were defective through fault of lessor, and were not noticeable to lessees, and unknown to them, the lessor is liable for the damage resulting from the defective condition of the premises. U. B. Mfg, Co. v. Lindsey, 10.Ill. App. 586.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-8\" pgmap=\"145\">If the landlord undertakes to repair, and does it in a careless manner, to the injury of tenant, he is liable to damages. 1 Washburn Real Prop. 461; Grill v. Middleton, 105 Mass. 235; Plummer v. Harper, 14 Am. Dec. 343. And he may recoup the damages in an action for the rent. Wright v. Lattin, 38 Ill. 283. And this rule applies when he employs others to do the work which causes the injury. 1 Wash. Real Prop: 540; Robbins v. Chicago, 4 Wall. 657.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-9\" pgmap=\"145\">In Glick v. Maurer, 75 Ill. 289, the tenant was in control of the first story of the building and the landlord of the second story, and the landlord undertook to repair the roof, whereby the tenant was injured; the landlord was held liable for the damages.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-10\" pgmap=\"145(102) 146(56)\">It was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether or not the damage claimed by appellant was caused by the appellee in fixing the roof. It was open to argument as to when and how the down pipe became stopped, which is conceded to have caused the damage. And this being a proper question for the jury, the court erred in withdrawing this portion of the case from it. If the stoppage of the pipe was caused by the negligence of the plaintiff, and was not known by the defendant when lie moved into the building, then, we think, there can be no doubt that the law is on our side. This was a matter of fact, and the law could not be applied until it should be determined. C., R. I. &amp; P. R. R. Co. v. Lewis, 109 Ill. 120; Crowley v. Crowley, 80 Ill. 469; Smith v. Smith, 50 Ill. 291.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AhO\" pgmap=\"146\">Messrs.
