A judgment for the sum of $544 had been recovered against Edmond Menard in his lifetime by F. W. Brickey, who assigned the same to appellant, who had execution issued, and levied on three several tracts of land, one containing ninety acres, another one hundred and twenty acres, and the third ninety-one and eleven one-hundredths acres. These lands were sold February 24, 1887, to appellant by the sheriff of Randolph county, under the execution issued and levied as stated, for the sum of $742.67. These lands were first offered separately, and there being no bid, were offered and sold en masse, without the sheriff offering two tracts. Among other claims presented and allowed against the estate of Edmond Menard, on the day of adjustment, were two claims presented by this appellant, and allowed severally as two separate and distinct claims\u2014one for $685.77, the other for $528.89. On the 25th of February, 1888, Cohen caused an execution to be issued out of the County Court of Randolph County, and that execution recited that W. L. Cohen was a judgment creditor of the estate of E. Menard by virtue of a judgment obtained in the County Court of said county, sitting for the transaction of probate business, for the sum of $1,214.66, entered upon a claim filed against said estate, and under such execution sought to redeem from the sale made to himself under the Brickey judgment, and to sell under such execution on such redemption. The executors and a creditor with claim allowed sue out an injunction to enjoin the sale under such execution, and over that a decree to sell these lands to pay debts has been entered: that the original safe was made en masse, without offering two of the tracts together\u2014the tracts being widely separated; that no bidders were present at the sale on execution except the plaintiff in execution, who purchased at a grossly inadequate juice; that the uniting of two claims in one execution and reciting it as a single judgment was without authority of law, and would create a cloud on the title of the land, and jxrevent the executors and creditors from realizing on sale made under decree to sell land to jDay debts; and denying the right of aj)pellant to redeem from his own sale, and asking for relief.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-3\" pgmap=\"501\">The Circuit Court entered a decree ordering the payment by the executors to appellant of the sum of $742.67, with interest at eight per cent., and setting aside the execution sale, and enjoining a sale under the redemption on the execution from the County Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-4\" pgmap=\"501\">Messrs.

The judgment creditor may, under Sec. 27, Chap. 77, Starr &amp; C. Ill. Stat., for purpose of redemption and sale, have execution. The execution must follow the judgment, and to include two separate and distinct claims as two several judgments in one execution as one judgmont for amount of both claims, renders the execution fatally defective for variance from the judgment. The sale of three parcels of land, aggregating more than three hundred acres, where one of these parcels was widely separated from the other two, en masse, after first offering them as separate tracts and no bid, but without offering two of the tracts, must be held sufficient to authorize this decree to set aside this sale. It was the duty of the sheriff, after offering the tracts separately, if there was no bid, to offer two of the tracts, for which he might obtain a bid, without resorting to the extremity of a sale in gross.

Loomis et al., 22 Ill. 82.</p> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">The evidence shows the land was sold for much less than it was worth, and the manner of the attempted redemption and sale would have created a cloud on complainant\u2019s title. The decree gave the appellant all he was entitled to, and is sustained by the evidence, and is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
