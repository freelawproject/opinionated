He received a 16-level enhancement at sentencing, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), due to his 2004 Kansas state conviction for aggravated indecent liberties with a child. On appeal, he argues, first, that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>court committed procedural error by failing at sentencing to either discuss the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or to articulate on the record its reasons for rejecting his argument challenging the inequity of the 16-level enhancement. Next, he contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, as evidenced by the disproportionate results of the enhancement and the disparity between his 46-month sentence and a one-day sentence imposed later on the same day by the same court on a comparator defendant for the same crime. After careful review, we affirm Mendez-Domingo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We generally review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse of discretion standard, a sentence will be affirmed unless we find \u201cthat the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). In other words, we \u201cwill not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of <em>all </em>the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010). The party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>However, where a defendant fails to object to an alleged sentencing error before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In reviewing whether a sentence is reasonable, we must ensure, first, that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. At sentencing, the district court is required to set forth the reasons for its sentence in sufficient detail so as to permit \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although the court is required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making its sentencing decision, it need not discuss each one in detail; \u201c[r]ather, an acknowledgment by the district judge that he or she has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[N]othing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.2006)). Ultimately, the court must show \u201cthat [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis\u201d for its decision. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we must next examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Wayerski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1353 (11th Cir.2010). This includes the \u201cneed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). \u201cCongress enacted the Sentencing Guidelines in large part to eliminate disparities in the sentences meted out to similarly situated defendants.\u201d <em>United States v. Chotas, </em>968 F.2d 1193, 1197 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cA well-founded claim of disparity, however, assumes that apples are being compared to apples.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009). Reasonableness is expected of a sentence falling within the guideline range, and it may be further evinced by a sentence well below the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a 16-level enhancement is warranted \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159 (11th Cir.1992), we upheld the enhancements under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) against claims of inequity because: (1) they rationally promoted the policy of deterring aliens who were also convicted felons from reentering the United States; and (2) they did not result in improper double counting because the Sentencing Commission \u201cclearly intended pri- or felonies to count against defendants under both the criminal history section and \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1160-61. Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this Court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Mendez-Domingo\u2019s 46-month sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. Procedurally, the district court properly calculated the guideline range, acknowledged the range as \u201cadvisory,\u201d stated that it had considered the \u00a7y3553(a) factors, and expressly addressed his arguments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A fuller discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was not, as Mendez-Domingo argues, required. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832. Moreover, the court heard his arguments regarding the enhancement at the sentencing hearing and acknowledged that it had read his sentencing memorandum, which elaborated on his main points. The court even expressed sympathy for Mendez-Domingo\u2019s situation; yet, deferring to the policy and intent underlying \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) \u2014 to deter aliens who have been convicted of a felony from reentering the United States \u2014 the court elected not to vary from the guideline range. Thus, no procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Substantively, Mendez-Domingo\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His appeal turns on two bases: the purported inequity of the 16-level enhancement, and the disparity between his sentence and that imposed on a single comparator defendant sentenced by the same court. First, our decision in <em>Adeleke </em>forecloses his inequity argument, a point he conceded at sentencing, absent an intervening change in the law. <em>See Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d at 1236. Turning to his disparity argument, it is worth noting, as the government points out, that the comparator defendant was sentenced <em>after </em>Mendez-Domingo; therefore, the district court could not have considered the comparator\u2019s sentence when imposing sentence in this case. In any event, a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>discrepancies disprove the requisite similarity of situation \u2014 for instance, Mendez-Domingo and the comparator differ with respect to length of residence in the United States, family ties to this country, and criminal history. Moreover, Mendez-Domingo\u2019s 46-month prison term was the lowest provided by the applicable guideline range, and was also well below the 20-year statutory maximum. The district court\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable, and we affirm Mendez-Domingo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">. The enhancement was applied in this case because Mendez-Domingo\u2019s deportation followed his 2004 conviction for aggravated indecent liberties with a child, and \"crime of violence\u201d is defined under \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(B)(iii)) to include \"sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. On appeal, the government argues that Mendez-Domingo failed to adequately preserve his procedural unreasonableness claim at trial, and accordingly we should review the procedural reasonableness of his sentence for plain error. <em>See Castro, </em>455 F.3d at 1251. Because Mendez-Domingo\u2019s procedural claim fails under either an abuse of discretion or a plain error standard, we need not resolve this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
