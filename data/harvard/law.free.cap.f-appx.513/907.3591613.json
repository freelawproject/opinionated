On appeal, Hamilton argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion without considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors or his post-sentencing conduct. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-27\">In November 2007, Hamilton was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>cocaine and \u201c3, 4-methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine\u201d (\u201cecstasy\u201d) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) (Count One), possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Two), and use and carry of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count Three). The pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Hamilton a base offense level of 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) because his offense involved the equivalent of between 100 and 400 kilograms of marijuana. Specifically, because more than one controlled substance was involved, the PSI converted the crack cocaine and ecstasy quantities for which Hamilton was responsible to the equivalent amount of marijuana, and it noted that Hamilton was responsible for a total of 108.7 kilograms of marijuana. Based on a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of III, Hamilton\u2019s guideline range was 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. Additionally, he faced a mandatory consecutive 5-year (60-month) sentence as to Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">In determining Hamilton\u2019s sentence, the court noted its experience presiding over his trial and its review of the PSI and the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Ultimately, the court imposed a 157-month total sentence, consisting of concurrent 97-month sentences as to Counts One and Two and a 60-month consecutive sentence as to Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">In August 2011, Hamilton filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on the Sentencing Commission\u2019s \u201c[cjrack [cjocaine reduction\u201d in June 2011. Specifically, Hamilton asserted that he was entitled to \u201c[immediate relief\u2019 from federal custody, and he requested that the district court grant him \u201cconditional release in accordance with [ ]\u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the factors listed in [ ] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In response, the government filed a motion to stay the district court\u2019s ruling on Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, arguing that the district court lacked the authority to grant the motion until November 1, 2011, when Amendment 750 would become retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">On August 16, 2011, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to stay Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582 proceeding. Subsequently, on November 1, 2011, without requiring any further response from the government regarding the merits of Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court denied Hamilton\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. The court\u2019s order noted that Hamilton\u2019s original guideline range was 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment (plus the mandatory 60 months), and his amended guideline range was 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment (plus the mandatory 60 months). Further, the order stated, \u201cIn denying this motion, the [cjourt has specifically considered all of the factors set forth in []\u00a7 3553(a) and determined that the original sentence imposed in the case, 157 months[\u2019] confinement, is the proper sentence.\u201d The same judge who had presided over Hamilton\u2019s original sentencing, District Judge B. Avant Edenfield, signed the order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>de novo. United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIf \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 984 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">A court may only modify a term of imprisonment in limited circumstances, including where a defendant \u201chas been sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable on November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, makes permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Before granting a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the prisoner\u2019s guideline range by substituting the retroactive guideline amendment for the provision that it replaced. <em>See id. </em>Second, the court must determine whether, in its discretion, it should impose a new sentence in accordance with the amended guideline range, or whether the original sentence should be retained. <em>See id. </em>at 781. This decision is to be made after considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>However, a district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). While the two-step analysis is required, the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence is discretionary. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Further, in evaluating whether a sentence reduction is warranted, the district court <em>\u201cmay </em>consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1256 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B) (requiring a district court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and permitting it to consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in evaluating whether and to what extent to reduce a sentence). We must vacate and remand \u201c[i]f it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">In the context of an earlier amendment to the crack-cocaine guidelines, we have held that a district court\u2019s failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors constituted reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. In <em>Douglas, </em>the district court completed a standard form order that did not mention \u00a7 3553(a) or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1218. Although the form provided a space for \u201cadditional comments,\u201d the court did not provide any comments or otherwise explain its decision. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we vacated and remanded the \u00a7 3582 order after finding insufficient evidence that the district court had considered the sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. In reaching that disposition, we noted that: (1) the prisoner\u2019s motion briefly referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, but did not analyze them; (2) the government did not respond to the prisoner\u2019s motion; (3) no hearing was held; and (4) the district court\u2019s form order merely indicated that the court had \u201cconsidered [the defendant\u2019s] motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">By contrast, in another case, we affirmed a \u00a7 3582 decision where: (1) the prisoner\u2019s motion presented arguments as to why the sentencing factors supported imposing a more lenient sentence; (2) the government responded to those arguments; (3) a hearing was held; and (4) the district court\u2019s order referenced the prisoner\u2019s motion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928-29 (11th Cir.2009). Similarly, in <em>Eggersdorf, </em>we found sufficient the district court\u2019s order stating that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>reviewed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the government\u2019s response in opposition, and was \u201cotherwise duly advised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. We noted that the district court judge who decided the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was the same judge who had originally sentenced the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As an initial matter, the district court properly recognized its authority to reduce Hamilton\u2019s sentence and it recalculated his amended guideline range under Amendment 750, indicating that his amended range as to the drug counts was 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, the relevant inquiry is limited to whether the record sufficiently demonstrates that, before exercising its discretion to deny Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court sufficiently considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Although there are some factual similarities between <em>Douglas </em>and the instant case, a review of the record, here, suggests that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Admittedly, as in <em>Douglas, </em>Hamilton\u2019s motion cited \u00a7 3553(a) in support of his request for a lower sentence but did not set forth the sentencing factors or present any argument as to why the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported relief. <em>See Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1220. Additionally, the government\u2019s response did not discuss the factors, but instead focused solely on the fact that Amendment 750 had not yet gone into effect. Thus, as in <em>Douglas, </em>the district court never heard the parties\u2019 positions regarding the sentencing factors, and the court also did not independently analyze or discuss the application of those factors. <em>Id. </em>As a result, if the district court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief had referenced only Hamilton\u2019s motion and omitted any reference to \u00a7 3553(a), it would not be possible to determine whether the court had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In this case, however, unlike in <em>Douglas, </em>the district court explicitly stated that, in denying Hamilton\u2019s motion, it had \u201cspecifically considered all of the factors set forth in [ ]\u00a7 3553(a)[,]\u201d and it found that Hamilton\u2019s original sentence was the proper sentence. In <em>Douglas, </em>the district court\u2019s standard order noted only that the court had considered the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1218. Significantly, unlike the instant case, the district court in <em>Douglas </em>made no reference to \u00a7 3553(a) or its sentencing factors, and the court provided no additional comments to explain its decision. <em>See id. </em>Further, the district court judge who declined to resentence Hamilton was the same judge who had presided over his trial, reviewed his PSI, and imposed his original sentence. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1323. Thus, the court was familiar with Hamilton and the facts and circumstances surrounding his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">On appeal, Hamilton argues that the district court should have considered his post-sentencing conduct, but he concedes that the district court was not required to do so. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256. Moreover, Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not present any post-sentencing information to the district court. In sum, because the district court explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the court was not required to specifically explain the applicability of each factor, the district court\u2019s order was sufficient to establish that it had considered the sentencing factors. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; <em>Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
