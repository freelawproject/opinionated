Spellissy argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his petition for writ of error coram nobis, because Spellissy showed that a fundamental error of fact and law relating to his date of retirement from the U.S. Army resulted in the issuance of the search warrant of his residence, the admission at trial of evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, and ultimately, Spellissy\u2019s conviction for conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>ing to defraud the United States and to commit bribery and wire fraud. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of error coram nobis for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002). A district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures, or relies on findings of fact that are clearly erroneous. <em>Peer v. Lewis, </em>606 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), gives federal courts the authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2000). A writ of error coram nobis is a remedy to vacate a conviction, and is available, unlike relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, when the petitioner has served his sentence and is no longer in custody. <em>Peter, </em>310 F.3d at 712. The bar for coram nobis is high, and a petitioner may only obtain such relief where: (1) \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief\u2019 and (2) \u201cwhen the error involves a matter of fact of the most fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and which renders the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u201d <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). The \u201cwrit of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy of last resort available only in compelling circumstances where necessary to achieve justice.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>221 F.3d at 1203. Thus, where other avenues of relief are available, a district court may consider coram nobis petitions only when a petitioner presents sound reasons for failing to seek relief earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 1204 (holding that coram nobis is an improper vehicle for allegations concerning newly-discovered evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Here, Spellissy has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying his coram nobis petition. First, Spellissy has not shown that \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief,\u201d <em>Alikhani, </em>200 F.3d at 734, since his claim regarding the government\u2019s misrepresentation of his actual retirement date \u2014 and, for that matter, any of his arguments regarding his not being barred from representing the Nordic Ammunition Company to the government regarding 70mm warheads \u2014 could have been raised at virtually any point in the proceedings. Indeed, the question of Spellissy\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d dates of retirement appears to have been thoroughly discussed in earlier proceedings, as reflected in <em>United States v. Spellissy, </em>346 Fed.Appx. 446, 447-49 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished). For this reason alone, his claims are facially not cognizable on coram nobis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Moreover, Spellissy\u2019s contention that the jury would not have convicted him as to Count One unless it had been misled about his retirement date is too speculative to satisfy the bar for obtaining coram nobis relief. This is especially true given that Spellissy\u2019s retirement date was essentially irrelevant to any element of his conviction for conspiracy to defraud the United States. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
