The presen-tence investigation report initially concluded that Major was responsible for 2.7 kilograms of crack cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D.l.l(c) (Nov. 1997). A handwritten amendment to the PSI reduced that amount from 2.7 kilograms to between 1 and 1.5 kilograms, resulting in a base offense level of 36. <em>See id. </em>The PSI also concluded that Major was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. At sentencing, the district court concluded that Major was responsible for 1 to 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, which would have made his base offense level 36. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c). But because Major was a career offender, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 applied, resulting in a base offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. The result was a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The court sentenced Major to 364 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Major filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 to the guidelines reduced his guidelines range. The district court denied that motion, concluding that Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Major\u2019s guidelines range because he was sentenced as a career offender. This is Major\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). \u2018Where a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the [career offender] sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. While Amendment 750 reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, it did not alter the sentencing range upon which Major\u2019s sentence was based because he was sentenced under the career offender guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. For that reason, <em>Moore </em>controls. <em>See also United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012) <em>(\u201cMoore </em>remains binding precedent because it has not been overruled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Major also argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), was wrongly decided because it allows the Sentencing Commission to strip the district court of its discretion to lower his sentence based on the particular facts of his case. Right or wrong, we are bound to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of federal law in <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691, which recognized the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority to decide in what circumstances and by what amount a prisoner\u2019s sentence may be reduced in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See McGinley v. Houston, </em>361 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
