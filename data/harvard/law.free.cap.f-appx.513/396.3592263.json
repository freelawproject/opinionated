We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Lewis\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to \u2022withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Lewis\u2019s motion to relieve counsel and appoint substitute counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
