After review, we vacate and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-22\">In 2005, a jury in Broward County, Florida convicted Bradberry of sexual battery, lewd or lascivious molestation, child abuse, and attempt to contribute to the delinquency of a child. Bradberry is serving a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-23\">In 2011, Bradberry filed this <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition raising numerous claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>for relief, including three claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection. Bradberry\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition designated these jury-selection claims as Claims 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c). Claim 7(a) alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the state struck six prospective female jurors. Claim 7(b) focused on trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve an objection to the state\u2019s motion to strike one particular juror, and Claim 7(c) focused on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to comments by the trial court during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The magistrate judge\u2019s report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommended that Bradberry\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition be denied. With respect to Bradber-ry\u2019s jury-selection claims, however, the R &amp; R addressed only Claims 7(b) and 7(c), and omitted any discussion of Claim 7(a). Although Bradberry\u2019s objection to the R <em>&amp; </em>R asserted that the magistrate judge had failed to address Claim 7(a), the district court summarily adopted the R &amp; R and denied Bradberry\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">This Court granted a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah5\">Whether the district court failed to address claim 7(a) in Bradberry\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the state\u2019s removal of prospective female jurors, in violation of <em>Clisby.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In <em>Clisby, </em>this Court instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a habeas petition prior to granting or denying relief. <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc). If the district court does not address all claims prior to issuing judgment, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Bradberry argues, and the state concedes, that the district court did not address Bradberry\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim in Claim 7(a). We agree. This failure to consider all of the claims set forth in Bradberry\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition violates <em>Clisby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">We reject the state\u2019s invitation to address the merits of Claim 7(a). Under <em>Clisby, </em>our role is to vacate the judgment \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and remand to the district court for consideration of the unaddressed claim in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the merits of Bradberry\u2019s Claim 7(a) exceed the scope of our review, which is limited to the <em>Clisby </em>issue specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir.1998). For these reasons, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand the case to the district court to consider Bradberry\u2019s Claim 7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. In reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>da novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Stewart v. Sec'y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>476 F.3d 1193, 1208 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
