In the amended complaint, Plaintiff Frantz brings claims under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 et seq. and Florida common law against Defendants Rosa Walled, Gregory Delatour, First Coast Service Options, Inc. (\u201cFirst Coast\u201d), and Suntrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Bank (\u201cSuntrust\u201d). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2y\">A. The Criminal Case</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In this civil appeal, Frantz\u2019s claims involve conduct for which he was prosecuted and convicted along with other defendants. We thus discuss Frantz\u2019s criminal case first.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In 2006, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida indicted Plaintiff Frantz, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349 and seven counts of health care fraud and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1347 and 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The grand jury alleged that Frantz, a licensed physician, joined a conspiracy with Walled and Delatour, to fraudulently obtain federal Medicare funds. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Walled and Delat-our (not physicians) established two medical clinics in Miami, Florida.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Walled and Delatour hired Frantz to provide treatment at the clinics. The indictment alleged that Frantz worked at one clinic from January 2005 to April 2005 and at the other clinic from April 2005 to July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">According to the indictment, the conspirators recruited to the clinic Medicare recipients who were not infected with HIV. There, the Medicare recipients provided blood samples, which the conspirators biologically altered so that the samples looked like they came from individuals infected with HIV. Frantz then prescribed unnecessary medications to these Medicare recipients. Thereafter, the medical clinics sought and obtained Medicare reimbursements exceeding two million dollars for these unnecessary treatments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">In 2006, Frantz was arrested. In 2007, a jury found Frantz guilty of conspiring to commit health care fraud, and guilty as to five of the seven health care fraud counts. The district court sentenced Frantz to a total of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. This Court affirmed Frantz\u2019s convictions and sentence. See <em>United States v. Achille, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 875 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">B. The Original Civil Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">Subsequently in 2010, Frantz, <em>pro se, </em>filed his original civil complaint in this case against: (1) Walled and Delatour, his criminal co-conspirators described above; (2) First Coast, which processed the Medicare payments; and (3) Suntrust, where the clinic, Walled, and Delatour had bank accounts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">Each defendant filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Before the district court ruled, Frantz moved for leave to file an amended complaint which he attached. The district court agreed with Defendants about the inadequacy of the original complaint and, on July 27, 2011, dismissed it without prejudice. At the same time, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>district court deemed Frantz\u2019s amended complaint filed and ordered Defendants to respond to the amended complaint within 20 days of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">C. The Amended Civil Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Plaintiff Frantz\u2019s amended complaint attempted to assert, <em>inter alia, </em>federal civil RICO claims and various state common law claims. Each defendant filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on multiple grounds. On February 21, 2012, a magistrate judge\u2019s report recommended granting the motions to dismiss. The magistrate judge concluded that Frantz\u2019s amended complaint, construed liberally, invoked federal subject matter jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the magistrate judge advised that the district court should dismiss the amended complaint because it: (1) failed to comply with pleading requirements in Rule 8(a); and (2) contained claims that were facially time-barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. Because Frantz had already received one opportunity to correct his complaint\u2019s deficiencies, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Frantz objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. The district court overruled the objections, adopted the report, and dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. Frantz then filed a motion for reconsideration which the district court denied. Frantz timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">As the magistrate judge\u2019s report noted, Frantz asserted claims under RICO and invoked federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 13S1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant First Coast, however, argues that: (1) it acted as the government\u2019s agent when it took the alleged actions referenced in Frantz\u2019s amended complaint; (2) that as a government agent, First Coast is entitled to sovereign immunity; and (3) thus the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Frantz\u2019s claims against First Coast.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">When the alleged events occurred, First Coast was operating under a contract with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicare program, \u201ca federally subsidized, voluntary enrollment health insurance program.\u201d <em>Gulfcoast Med. Supply, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>468 F.3d 1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">In doing so, CMS enters into agreements with \u201cmedicare administrative contractors\u201d (\u201cMACs\u201d) like First Coast. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(a). First Coast, as a MAC, performs a variety of functions, including: (1) receiving Medicare funds and disbursing them to health care providers for services rendered to eligible individuals; (2) determining the amounts owed to such health care providers; and (3) audit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>ing claims for Medicare reimbursement. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 421.200, 421.214.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">MACs, like First Coast, are typically entitled to sovereign immunity. <em>See Peterson v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Tex., </em>508 F.2d 55, 57-58 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is because, when fulfilling obligations to CMS, a MAC functions as the government\u2019s agent. <em>See id. </em>The government is obligated to indemnify the MAC for any adverse judgment rendered against it. <em>See id.; see also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 421.5(b) (\u201c[MACs] act on behalf of CMS- Accordingly, their agreements and contracts contain clauses providing for indemnification with respect to actions taken on behalf of CMS and CMS is the real party of interest in any litigation involving the administration of the program.\u201d). However, when the government is not obligated to indemnify a MAC, such as when the MAC is liable for criminal or fraudulent conduct, the MAC is not entitled to sovereign immunity. <em>See Anderson v. Occidental Life Ins. of Calif., </em>727 F.2d 855, 856-57 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Here, Frantz alleges that First Coast engaged in criminal and fraudulent conduct, and that such conduct gives rise to liability under RICO. Thus, the government would not be required to indemnify First Coast for any recovery against it, eliminating the basis for sovereign immunity. The district court, therefore, properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over Frantz\u2019s claims against First Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">B. Motions to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we are mindful that Rule 8(a) \u201crequire[s] only that the complaint contain \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to reliefi.]\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Baxter Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>345 F.3d 866, 880 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)). This is because Rule 8(a)\u2019s purpose is to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, \u201ca complaint\u2019s factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 974 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">Construing the amended complaint liberally in light of Frantz\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, we nevertheless conclude that the district court properly dismissed the amended complaint as a \u201cshotgun\u201d pleading. A shotgun pleading \u201cincorporate^] every antecedent allegation by reference into each subsequent claim for relief or affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2006). This Court has repeatedly condemned shotgun pleadings. <em>See Davis, </em>516 F.3d at 979. This is because, from a shotgun pleading, \u201cit is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Frantz\u2019s amended complaint contains 25 counts, each without any legal or factual support. These 25 counts are followed by 109 paragraphs of factual allegations and sporadic, unexplained legal citations. There is no logical connection between the conclusory statements of legal violations and the factual allegations. The amended complaint\u2019s failure to link factual allegations to specific counts makes it a quintessential shotgun pleading. As such, it does not comply with Rule 8(a), and the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Alternatively, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Frantz\u2019s amended complaint satisfied Rule 8(a), we still affirm the dismissal because Frantz\u2019s claims, to the extent that we can decipher them, are time-barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Civil RICO claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations. <em>Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>483 U.S. 143, 156, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 2767, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987). A civil RICO claim accrues and the four-year limitations period begins to run \u201cwhen the injury was or should have been discovered, regardless of whether or when the injury is discovered to be part of a pattern of racketeering.\u201d <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>253 F.3d 641, 676 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Rotella v. Wood, </em>528 U.S. 549, 555, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 1080, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Frantz alleges that he was injured by actions that he identifies as occurring primarily between March 2005 and August 2005; however, construed liberally, Frantz\u2019s amended complaint also mentions in places conduct in 2006. On August 11, 2006, Frantz was arrested for participating in the Medicare fraud scheme. On that date, Frantz knew, or should have known, of Defendants\u2019 wrongdoing and his resulting injury. Therefore, his civil RICO claims accrued at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Because Frantz\u2019s civil RICO claims accrued, at the latest, on August 11, 2006, he needed to bring such claims by August 11, 2010 for them to be considered timely. Frantz did not file his original complaint until September 15, 2010. Frantz\u2019s civil RICO claims were, therefore, untimely. Frantz\u2019s state law claims were also subject to a four-year statute of limitations. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(j). Therefore, they too were untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">We recognize that Frantz alleges, and we accept as true, that he suffered additional injuries after his August 11, 2006 arrest for Medicare fraud, including: being convicted of federal offenses, being incarcerated, and losing his medical license. If a single RICO violation gives rise to multiple \u201cnew and independent injuries]\u201d, a new civil RICO claim may accrue with each injury, regardless of when the original acts occurred. See <em>Bivens Gardens Office Bldg., Inc. v. Barnett Bank of Fla., Inc., </em>906 F.2d 1546, 1552 (11th Cir.1990), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rotella, </em>528 U.S. at 555, 120 S.Ct. at 1080. However, when a subsequent injury is not \u201cnew and independent\u201d of the original injury, the plaintiff must bring his claim alleging the subsequent injury within four years of when he knew or should have known of his original injury. <em>Pilkington v. United Airlines, </em>112 F.3d 1532, 1537-38 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Frantz\u2019s additional injuries \u2014 health care fraud conviction, incarceration, and medical license loss \u2014 were not \u201cnew and independent\u201d of his being arrested for committing health care fraud, but were directly related to that fraud. See <em>Pilkington, </em>112 F.3d at 1537-38. Consequently, no new civil RICO claims accrued based on these subsequent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">To the extent that Frantz argues that he was eligible for equitable tolling, this argument fails. \u201cEquitable tolling is defeated ... when it is shown that indisputably the plaintiff[ ] had notice sufficient to prompt [him] to investigate and that, had [he] done so diligently, [he] would have discovered the basis for [his] claims.\u201d Pac. <em>Harbor Capital, Inc. v. Barnett Bank, N.A., </em>252 <em>F.3d </em>1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">C. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration. <em>Corwin v. Walt Disney Co., </em>475 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2007). A motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) should be granted only on the basis of newly discovered evidence or a manifest error of law or fact. <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007). Rule 59(e) is not an appropriate vehicle to \u201crelit-igate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, Fla., </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Frantz based his motion for reconsideration on purported newly discovered evidence pertaining to a criminal conviction of a former First Coast employee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[W]here a party attempts to introduce previously unsubmitted evidence on a motion to reconsider, the court should not grant the motion absent some showing that the evidence was not available during the pen-dency of the motion.\u201d <em>Mays v. U.S. Postal Serv., 122 F.3d 43, </em>46 (11th Cir.1997). A Rule 59(e) motion based on newly discovered evidence should not be granted unless the movant demonstrates the materiality of the new evidence. <em>See, e.g., Briscoe v. Cnty. of St. Louis, Mo., </em>690 F.3d 1004, 1015 (8th Cir.2012); <em>DiMarco-Zappa v. Cabanillas, </em>238 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir.2001); <em>see also Waddell v. Hendry Cnty. Sheriff's Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2003) (setting forth the materiality requirement for a Rule 60(b) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">Frantz\u2019s proffered evidence did not meet these criteria. Frantz admits he actually received the evidence on February 27, 2012, before the district court dismissed his amended complaint on March 15, 2012. In any event, the proffered evidence is immaterial. There is nothing in Frantz\u2019s motion for reconsideration showing that this former First Coast employee was at all involved with the conspiracy at issue here, much less how that employee\u2019s conduct is connected to the claims in his shotgun complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders dismissing Frantz\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice and denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\">.
