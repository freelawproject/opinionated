We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b859-19\">The claimant, Dean J. Danos, was hired by Two \u201cR\u201d in 1975 as a roughneck. In a pre-employment medical exam, Two \u201cR\u201d discovered that Danos had two developmental diseases of the spine, juvenile epi-physistis <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Schmorl\u2019s modules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Two \u201cR\u201d hired Danos. Danos worked in a variety of unskilled positions, eventually becoming a mechanic\u2019s helper. It was while working in this capacity that Danos sustained an injury to his back on March 19, 1982. He worked on light duty for 10 months following the accident, noticing increased pain. In January 1983 a ruptured disc was diagnosed and Danos underwent back surgery by Dr. Pete Rhymes, an orthopedic surgeon. When his lower back pain failed to abate, he sought treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>from Dr. H.R. Soboloff in March 1984. Dr. Soboloff treated Danos throughout 1984 and 1985, finally reaching the conclusion on April 8,1985, that Danos had reached maximum improvement and was permanently totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Two \u201cR\u201d and Wausau sought relief under \u00a7 8(f) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f), which allows an employer who hires a person with a permanent partial disability who is injured on the job to recover from a special fund under certain circumstances. The AU denied relief and the Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">To be entitled to compensation under LHWCA \u00a7 8(f), 33 U.S.C. 908(f), when the employee is permanently <em>totally </em>disabled the employer must establish that the employee seeking compensation had: (1) an \u201cexisting permanent partial disability\u201d before the employment injury; (2) that the permanent partial disability was \u201cmanifest\u201d to the employer; and (3) that the current disability is not due solely to the employment injury. <em>Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, </em>851 F.2d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Bechtel Associates, P.C. v. Sweeney, </em>834 F.2d 1029, 1036 (D.C.Cir.1987); <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor v. Campbell Industries, Inc., </em>678 F.2d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1982). When an employee is permanently <em>partially </em>disabled and not totally disabled, the employer must make not only the three showings listed above, but must also show that the current permanent partial disability \u201cis materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Danos is totally disabled. Two \u201cR\u201d and Wausau argue that the AU improperly applied the heavier burden for an employee with a permanent partial disability. But we need not rest on the standard applied because we conclude as a matter of law that Two \u201cR\u201d and Wausau did not meet its burden of showing that the current disability is not due solely to the employment injury since they put no medical evidence before the AU which suggests that Danos\u2019 pre-existing disability in any way contributed to his current total disability. Two \u201cR\u201d and Wausau argue that we should apply a \u201ccommon-sense test\u201d which presumes that when a claimant who had a history of back problems previous to his employment suffers a work-related injury to his back, the current disability is not due solely to the employment injury. This argument reads the third element of proof out of the law by collapsing the first and third elements. We decline to do so. <em>See Jacksonville Shipyards, </em>851 F.2d at 1316; <em>Bechtel Associates, </em>834 F.2d at 1036-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-9\">.
