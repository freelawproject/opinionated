Invoking the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1976), the district court dismissed the case. We find that, although it recites a federal statute, the complaint does not present a claim that \u201carises under\u201d federal law. On this ground, as well as on the Tax Injunction Act, we affirm the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-27\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the district court alleged that a tax levied under the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 58:10-23.11 <em>et seq. </em>(West 1982), is \u201cunconstitutional and preempted\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>by a similar federal statute, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (\u201cSuperfund Act\u201d), Pub.L.No.96-510, 94 Stat. 2767 (1980) (to be codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601\u2014 57). In addition, plaintiffs sought a refund of taxes collected by the state under the Spill Act after the federal statute went into effect. The district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because of the bar imposed by the Tax Injunction Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">New Jersey enacted the Spill Act in 1976 to control the handling of hazardous substances within the state, require prompt cleanup, and provide compensation for associated costs and damages. N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 58:10-23.11a. To carry out these purposes, a Spill Compensation Fund within the state treasury is financed by a barrel tax levied upon each owner or operator of a major facility for hazardous substances. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 58:10-23.11g, -23.11h, -23.11\u00cd.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, Congress also dealt with the problems caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. The federal Act creates a Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund (Superfund), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9631, which is subsidized in part by taxes levied on crude oil, imported petroleum products, and certain chemicals. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4611, 4661. Section 114(c) of the Superfund Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9614(c), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201cExcept as provided in this Act, no person may be required to contribute to any fund, the purpose of which is to pay compensation for claims for any costs of response or damages or claims which may be compensated under this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">Contending that \u00a7 114(c) excuses them from paying taxes into the New Jersey Spill Fund, Exxon and the other plaintiffs sought a declaration in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Jurisdiction was asserted under the federal question statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and \u00a7 113(b) of the Superfund Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(b), which provides that \u201cthe United States district courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all controversies arising under this Act... . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">New Jersey moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the basis of the Tax Injunction Act: \u201cThe district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d The district judge found that New Jersey law does provide an adequate remedy and granted the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He reasoned that the more specific Tax Injunction Act prevailed over the Superfund Act on the question of jurisdiction and concluded that the state courts can entertain plaintiffs\u2019 preemption claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the district court misconstrued the relationship between \u00a7 113(b) of the Superfund Act and the Tax Injunction Act. Since \u00a7 113(b) vests the district courts with exclusive orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>inal jurisdiction over cases arising under the Superfund Act, plaintiffs contend that the state courts are unable to grant any remedy. In their view, then, the Tax Injunction Act is no bar because one of the prerequisites for its application is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Supreme Court has said of the Tax Injunction Act that \u201cthis legislation .. . reflects] the fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments that is essential to \u2018Our Federalism,\u2019 particularly in the' area of state taxation.\u201d <em>Fair Assessment In Real Estate Assn. v. McNary, </em>454 U.S. at 103, 102 S.Ct. at 179. When a plaintiff requests a district court to grant injunctive relief against a state tax, and the state courts provide an adequate remedy, the complaint must be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. This is because \u201c[t]he Tax Injunction Act embodied Congress\u2019 decision to transfer jurisdiction over a class of substantive federal claims from the federal district courts to the state courts. . . . \u201d <em>Rosewell v. LaSalle Natl. Bank, </em>450 U.S. 503, 515 n.19, 101 S.Ct. 1221, 1230 n.19, 67 L.Ed.2d 464 (1981). Although the Court once reserved the question, it is settled now that the Act prohibits declaratory as well as injunctive relief. <em>California v. Grace Brethren </em>Church, - U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 2506-2509, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">At the outset, it is essential to recognize that plaintiffs\u2019 attack is directed against a state tax imposed by a state statute. Plaintiffs do not challenge the Superfund Act, but rely on it as a defense against the state tax. The district judge did not quarrel with plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that this case presents a federal question and that it \u201carises under\u201d the Superfund Act. We take a different view of the matter, however, and since it goes to jurisdiction we are bound to make our own determination. <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>- U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 2104, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">We begin with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d An action arises under federal law when \u201cthe complaint ... requires the construction of a federal statute or a distinctive policy of a federal statute requires the application of federal legal principles for its disposition.\u201d <em>Lindy v. Lynn, </em>501 F.2d 1367, 1369 (3d Cir. 1974). The federal question must appear on \u201cthe face of the complaint,\u201d which means that \u201cthe complaint itself will not avail as a basis of jurisdiction in so far as it goes beyond a statement of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and anticipates or replies to a probable defense.\u201d <em>Gully v. First National Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112-113, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936). <em>See also, Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 43, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908); <em>Westmoreland Hospital Assn. v. Blue Cross, </em>605 F.2d 119, 123 (3d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1077, 100 S.Ct. 1025, 62 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">In <em>Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct. 876, 878, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950), the Supreme Court observed that the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, enlarged the range of remedies available in the federal courts but did not extend their jurisdiction. As a result, the Court cautioned against entertaining a declaratory complaint that did not really present a federal question on its face:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">\u201cTo sanction suits for declaratory relief as within the jurisdiction of the District Courts merely because ... artful pleading anticipates a defense based on federal law would contravene the whole trend of jurisdictional legislation by Congress, disregard the effective functioning of the federal judicial system and distort the limited procedural purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 673-74, 70 S.Ct. at 879-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">In <em>Public Service Commission v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952), the Court went a step further. Plaintiff there sought a declaratory judgment that it was engaged in interstate commerce. It wanted this declaration \u201cto hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>in readiness for use\u201d should the defendant, a state agency, attempt to enforce the state\u2019s regulatory scheme against it. Id. at 245, 73 S.Ct. at 241. The Court directed the suit to be dismissed, in language directly applicable to the case at hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cIn this case, as in many actions for declaratory judgment, the realistic position of the parties is reversed. The plaintiff is seeking to establish a defense against a cause of action which the declaratory defendant may assert in the [state] courts.... Where the complaint in an action for declaratory judgment seeks in essence to assert a defense to an impending or threatened state court action, it is the character of the threatened action, and not of the defense, which will determine whether there is federal-question jurisdiction in the District Court.... Federal courts will not seize litigations from state courts merely because one, normally a defendant, goes to federal court to begin his federal-law defense before the state court begins the case under state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 248, 73 S.Ct. at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The criteria espoused by <em>Skelly </em>and <em>Wycoff </em>have been criticized, but \u201cit seems clear that this is the law today ...\u201d 10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2767 at 849 (1969).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, </em>465 F.2d 237, 241 (3d Cir. 1972), we followed <em>Wycoff </em>and held that a complaint seeking a declaration that federal law preempted state regulations did not raise a federal question. Accord, <em>Lawrence County v. South Dakota, </em>668 F.2d 27 (8th Cir. 1982); <em>Madsen v. Prudential Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>635 F.2d 797 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Insurance Dept. of Iowa, </em>571 F.2d 423 (8th Cir. 1978). <em>But see, First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Greenwald, </em>591 F.2d 417 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Rath Packing Co. v. Becker, </em>530 F.2d 1295 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977) (no discussion of jurisdictional issue). <em>See </em>Comment, Federal Jurisdiction Over Declaratory Suits Challenging State Action, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 983 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">In summary, a declaratory judgment complaint does not state a cause of action arising under federal law when the federal issue is in the nature of a defense to a state law claim. Yet that is precisely the situation in this case. Exxon and the other plaintiffs seek a declaration that \u00a7 114(c) of the Superfund Act excuses them from paying the tax imposed by the New Jersey Spill Act. In other words, they wish to establish what is in effect a federal defense to a purely state law enforcement action. <em>Skelly </em>and <em>Wycoff </em>teach us that under these circumstances federal question jurisdiction is lacking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Moreover, the Tax Injunction Act also imposes a jurisdictional bar. <em>California v. Grace Brethren Church, supra. </em>Exxon contends, however, that the exclusive federal jurisdiction provision of the Superfund Act removes from the state courts the power to adjudicate matters which have any connection with the federal statute, including its ban against dual taxation. Without an adequate state remedy, the Tax Injunction Act would not bar this suit. If the district court also lacks jurisdiction, Exxon argues, there is no forum open to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">We find no merit to this contention. The Superfund Act\u2019s grant of \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d is limited to controversies \u201carising under\u201d the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(b). Thus, exclusive jurisdiction is only conferred over those cases which actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ally present a Superfund question on the face of the complaint, not every suit in which the provisions of the Act are relevant. It does not include suits like this which challenge a state tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><em>Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>366 U.S. 656, 81 S.Ct. 1303, 6 L.Ed.2d 584 (1961), is instructive on this point. There, the Supreme Court was confronted with a challenge to a state court\u2019s jurisdiction over a suit brought to recover overcharges in the sale of natural gas. The state court defendants argued that the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717 <em>et seq., </em>grants exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts over any suit involving a rate filed with the Federal Power Commission. The Supreme Court noted, however, that \u201cquestions of exclusive federal jurisdiction and ouster of jurisdiction of state courts are, under existing jurisdictional legislation, not determined by ultimate substantive issues of federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 81 S.Ct. at 1307. Since the plaintiff\u2019s claim was founded on state contract law, there was no federal jurisdiction. As to the \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction conferred by the Natural Gas Act, the Court said, \u201c[ejxclusiveness is a consequence of having jurisdiction, not the generator of jurisdiction because of which state courts are excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 81 S.Ct. at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We repeat that this suit is an attack on a state tax and nothing in the Superfund Act deprives the state courts of power to adjudicate this type of dispute. In light of the firmly established legislative policy expressed in the Tax Injunction Act, Exxon\u2019s contention that Congress impliedly removed state court authority to decide controversies over the tax imposed by the New Jersey Spill Act is simply not persuasive. <em>See Penn Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Control Commission, </em>318 U.S. 261, 275, 63 S.Ct. 617, 623, 87 L.Ed. 748 (1943). It is questionable whether Congress has the power to deprive a state court of jurisdiction over a non-federal party in such a state law action. <em>See, e.g., Healy v. Ratta, </em>292 U.S. 263, 270, 54 S.Ct. 700, 703, 78 L.Ed. 1248 (1933); 1 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 0.6[3] at 234 n.18 (1982). In any event, in light of the strong interest in federalism in circumstances like these, a displacement of state jurisdiction would not be expected in the absence of clear and explicit statutory language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Exxon also argues that the need for uniform interpretation of the Superfund Act is an important consideration in favor of exclusive federal jurisdiction. Although that reasoning may have influenced Congress in its decision to restrict jurisdiction over the many substantive controversies that may arise under the Superfund Act, it does not justify supplanting state jurisdiction over state laws. Indeed, the Supreme Court rejected this very argument in <em>Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>366 U.S. at 665, 81 S.Ct. at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">We conclude that the New Jersey courts retain jurisdiction to pass on the validity of the taxes imposed by the state\u2019s Spill Act, and that New Jersey law provides an adequate remedy. Since the district court did not have jurisdiction, dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was proper and accordingly, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\">. The New Jersey Spill Act, N.J.Stat.Ann. 58:10 23.1 1h(h), provides that the tax imposed shall be governed by the State Tax Uniform Procedure Law. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 54:48-1 <em>et seq. </em>Taxpayers seeking reimbursement for alleged over-payments may file claims for refunds. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 54:49 14. Taxpayers may also protest any finding or assessment of the Director of the Division of Taxation, request an administrative hearing from the Director, and then appeal the Director\u2019s determination to the Tax Court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 54:49-18; \u00a7 54:2 34; \u00a7 2A:3A-4.1. The Tax Court offers taxpayers a <em>de novo </em>hearing on all issues of fact and law and is authorized to \u201cgrant legal and equitable relief so that all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2A:3A 4. An appeal from Tax Court determinations may be had as of right to the Appellate division of the Superior Court of New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2A:3A~4.1(c); \u00a7 2A:3A-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-17\">. New Jersey did not raise the eleventh amendment as a defense to the refund count in the district court or in its brief in this court. <em>See, Ford Motor Co. v. Dept. of Treasury of Indiana, </em>323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945). In view of our disposition of the case, we need not discuss that issue. However, we note that the Supreme Court has held that the principle of comity bars federal courts from granting a refund of local taxes in the form of damages. <em>Fair Assessment In Real Estate Assn. v. McNary, </em>454 U.S. 100, 102 S.Ct. 177, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\">. Legislative adoption of a broader test, one that simply looks to the wording of the declaratory complaint for a federal question, has been recommended by the American Law Institute. A.L.I., Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, \u00a7 1311 (1969). \u201cBut in view of the limited purpose that was claimed for the Declaratory Judgment Act when it was adopted, it would be a perversion of the statute if it were held to have extended federal question jurisdiction.\u201d 10 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 2767 at 849 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-15\">.

It is a matter of record that after the district court dismissed the complaint, plaintiffs filed suit in the Tax Court of New Jersey. No question of the jurisdiction of that Court has been raised by the parties or the court itself. The parties filed and argued cross-motions for summary judgment.
