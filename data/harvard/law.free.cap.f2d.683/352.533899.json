The application of Rule 403 was intended by its drafters to be discretionary with the trial court. 1 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, 403[01] [1981 ed.]. The trial court\u2019s determination should not be overturned on appeal unless \u201cthe trial judge has clearly abused his discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>666 F.2d 1385 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>585 F.2d 119, 125 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Wright v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>580 F.2d 809, 810 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">A Government informant was testifying about the defendant\u2019s activity at the motel parking lot where an undercover operation was taking place. He had testified that he had been shown a quantity of money by the alleged conspirators. Then he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">Q What happened after you had seen the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">A I said that is fine, that is all I needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">Q What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">A I then walked across the parking lot, or asked Mr. Pomerantz for the keys to his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">Q Did he say anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">A Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">Q What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">A Well, first of all, he wanted to get his weapon out of the automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">Q What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">A \u201cI want my gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-16\">Q What did you say in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-17\">A I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this tomfoolery you know, that \u201cI need to get going.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-18\">Q What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-19\">A At that time I walked quickly to the car, you know, and then got in and Mr. Pomerantz followed me and then I drove off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-20\">Q Where did you go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-21\">A To the DEA headquarters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-22\">Q When you got to the DEA headquarters did you do anything with respect to any weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-23\">A Yes I did. I unloaded it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-24\">Q What kind of weapon was this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-25\">A A 9 millimeter automatic type of weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-26\">Q A pistol, or rifle, or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-27\">A Pistol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-28\">Q What did you do with the bullets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-29\">A I hid them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-30\">Q Where did you put the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-31\">A I left it in the trunk of the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-32\">A motion in limine to exclude the testimony about the gun had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-33\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the possession of a gun during negotiations for the purchase of large quantities of marijuana is not irrelevant to the facts which support the crime of conspiracy. The facts testified to were all part of the scenario at the time of the commission of the crime and were not so prejudicial, as balanced against their probative value, to require exclusion of the evidence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-34\">The argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge of conspiracy because the alleged conspirators did not reach an agreement to actually buy the marijuana being offered by the Government at the undercover operation is without any merit and subject to our Local Rule 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-35\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
