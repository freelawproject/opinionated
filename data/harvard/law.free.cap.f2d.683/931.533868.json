WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">Appellee and cross-appellant Holiday Inns, Inc. supervises a chain of over 1700 hotels. Many of these hotels operate under a franchise agreement by which the owner is entitled to display the familiar \u201cHoliday Inn\u201d sign (referred to as the \u201cGreat Sign\u201d) and other distinctive emblems of the chain. In 1956, Holiday Inn signed a license agreement with Tex-Mex Inn Operating Co. (Tex-Mex) that permitted Tex-Mex to operate a 200-room hotel located at 7800 Lemmon Avenue in Dallas, Texas, as a Holiday Inn. The agreement provided for termination of the license, however, if Tex-Mex did not meet Holiday Inns\u2019 standards. On February 28,1975, Holiday Inns wrote Tex-Mex a letter terminating the agreement and requesting that Tex-Mex remove all Holiday Inn service marks from the property. Despite this and subsequent demands for removal of the trademarks, the hotel continued to display the Great Sign<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a small sign bearing the mark \u201cHoliday Inn\u201d in distinctive script.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-21\">Holiday Inns brought this action in May, 1976, alleging trademark infringement under state and federal law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and seeking a permanent injunction, treble damages, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees. Although the original complaint named C. H. Alberding as owner and operator of the hotel, which by that time was operating as the \u201cHoliday Hotel\u201d, Alberding\u2019s answer revealed that Tex-Mex was the actual operator of the facility and that appellant/cross-appellee Airport Holiday Corp. (Airport) was the owner. An amended complaint joined Tex-Mex and Airport as defendants; Alberding, who served as president and director of both defendant corporations, eventually was dismissed from the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Holiday Inns moved for partial summary judgment on liability in July, 1977. Two affidavits, photographs of the offending signs, and a memorandum of law accompanied the motion. Tex-Mex and Airport, after filing separate counterclaims for harassment, responded in August of 1978 with a joint memorandum and affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The district court heard argument on the motion on December 4, 1978. On December 19, the court granted partial summary judgment against Tex-Mex and Airport on the issue of liability. It found that the defendants had presented no issue of material fact and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-5\">[t]he \u201cGreat Sign\u201d being used by defendants at the time of the hearing is essentially identical to the registered marks of the Plaintiff. This sign is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception with Plaintiff\u2019s registered service marks. The minor changes made by the Defendants are cosmetic in nature and inconsequential. Surely such inconsequential changes will not avoid a finding of infringement and unfair competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The judgment enjoined Tex-Mex and Airport from any further use of the Great Sign or other Holiday Inn service marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The parties proceeded to a bench trial on damages in October, 1979. In a judgment entered on October 19, 1981, the court found Tex-Mex and Airport jointly and severally liable for $96,795.00, plus interest, in profits and damages, and $35,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">Airport has appealed from this judgment on the issues of liability and damages; Holiday Inns has cross-appealed, submitting that the damage award is insufficient. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">I. Airport\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Airport presents two questions on appeal. First, it argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against Airport on liability because the record contains no evidence that Airport \u2014 as opposed to Tex-Mex \u2014 ever \u201cused\u201d the trademarks in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As stated by Airport, \u201cthe legal issue is whether mere ownership of real estate upon which an infringement of a trademark takes place is sufficient to assess liability on the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">The district court must render summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The defendants\u2019 joint response to Holiday Inns\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment raised no genuine issue as to any material fact. As Airport admits, the question presented on appeal is purely a legal one. However, we decline to consider even this issue of law because we conclude that Airport did not properly present it in the court below. We realize that our rule against considering issues raised for the first time on appeal can give way when a pure question of law is involved and the refusal to consider it will result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Martinez v. Matthews, </em>544 F.2d 1233, 1237 (5th Cir. 1976). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>we perceive no possibility of such a miscarriage here.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The only legal argument pressed by Airport individually in the joint responsive motion of defendants below was that Airport had purchased the Great Sign \u201cwith the knowledge of and acquiescence of Plaintiff and without any restriction being placed thereon by Plaintiff against Airport Holiday Corporation, and the Plaintiff has waived or is estopped to claim any trademark violation against Airport Holiday Corporation.\u201d This brief \u201cwaiver and estoppel\u201d argument, apparently predicated upon a theory that Holiday Inns had a duty expressly to forbid Airport from using its trademarks, did not deter the district court from holding Airport liable, as undisputed owner of the Great Sign and the rest of the Holiday Hotel property, for the infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Airport now seeks to obtain a reversal of the court\u2019s judgment by suggesting that a mere owner of real estate is not chargeable with trademark infringements or other torts committed by another party \u201coperating\u201d on the owner\u2019s property. As sole support for this allegation of error, Airport cites <em>Kinnear-Weed Corp. v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>324 F.Supp. 1371, 1381 (S.D. Tex.1969), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>441 F.2d 631 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 941, 92 S.Ct. 285, 30 L.Ed.2d 255 (1971), in which the court held that \u201ca \u2018non-operator,\u2019 as simply the owner of an interest in realty (the leasehold estate)\u201d in a drilling venture was not responsible for the drilling contractor\u2019s infringement of the patent on a drilling bit.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Apart from obvious dissimilarities between the facts of <em>Kinnear-Weed </em>and those of the case before us,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> our rejection of this appeal stands upon Airport\u2019s failure to present this authority or any legal argument derived from it to the court below. Although the defendants took over a year to reply to the motion for summary judgment, neither in that response nor at any other time did Airport attempt to forestall an adverse decision by providing the district judge with authority or argument in the vein now sought to be explored. Our discretion to entertain a legal argument presented for the first time on appeal \u201cis a right to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice apparent from the record, and not a right to afford a defeated litigant another day in court because he thinks that if he were given the opportunity to try his case again upon a different theory he might prevail.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Avirom, </em>384 F.2d 319, 323 (D.C.Cir.1967) (quoting <em>Helvering v. Rubinstein, </em>124 F.2d 969, 972 (8th Cir. 1942)). That Airport\u2019s appeal lies from a summary judgment does not diminish the importance of this insistence upon thorough presentation of issues in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Similarly, Airport\u2019s second point of error falls victim to Airport\u2019s want of caution in the proceedings below. The court\u2019s award of $96,795.00 against Airport and Tex-Mex, jointly and severally, included $11,464.50 in profits obtained from the infringement. The court derived this figure by computing thirty percent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of $38,215.00, the amount to which the parties stipulated as \u201cprofit of the Defendants\u201d during the period of the infringement. Airport now claims on appeal that Holiday Inns is not entitled to recover profits from Airport because it never proved that Airport actually received these profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Yet the record clearly shows that Airport, acting with Tex-Mex through a single attorney, signed a pretrial stipulation on October 9, 1979, conceding that \u201c[djuring the period of March 1, 1975 to January 1, 1979, the profits <em>of the Defendants </em>were $38,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>215.00.\u201d In fact, although Airport complains of the trial court\u2019s \u201cconfusion\u201d in treating Airport and Tex-Mex identically instead of as separate parties, the entire stipulation refers to \u201cthe Defendants\u201d as one party. It even describes the steps taken by \u201cthe Defendants\u201d to modify the Great Sign. At no time before or during the trial on damages, so far as the record shows, did Airport claim that it had not received profits earned by the hotel that it admittedly owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">As Holiday Inn points out, Section 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, provides that \u201c[i]n assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant\u2019s sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed.\u201d In any event, Airport stipulated its profits as \u201ca defendant\u201d and is bound by that agreement. <em>E.g. Morelock v. NCR Corp., </em>586 F.2d 1096, 1107 (6th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 906, 99 S.Ct. 1995, 60 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979); <em>A. Duda &amp; Sons Cooperative Association </em>v. <em>United States, </em>504 F.2d 970, 975 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">II. Holiday Inns\u2019 Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Holiday Inns contends that the district court erred in limiting recovery to thirty percent of defendants\u2019 profits and damages for a total of $32,265.00, an amount later trebled pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117. Having reviewed the trial judge\u2019s reasoning, however, we conclude that he acted well within the bounds of his discretion. The court could properly accept the evidence offered by the defendants, which was to the effect that only thirty percent of the hotels\u2019 business during the period of infringement was attributable to the improper use of plaintiff\u2019s service marks. The court acted reasonably, therefore, in reducing the damage figure to that percentage of the total profits and loss royalties. The court used its discretion in plaintiff\u2019s favor, after all, by trebling the thirty percent figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">\u201cGreat latitude is given the trial judge in awarding damages, and his judgment will not be set aside unless the award is clearly inadequate.\u201d <em>Drake v. E. I. DuPont deNemours &amp; Co., </em>432 F.2d 276, 279 (5th Cir. 1970). This is especially true of an award fashioned pursuant to the Lanham Act, which expressly confers upon district judges wide discretion in determining a just amount of recovery for trademark infringement. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The judgment below is AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-13\">. The Great Sign was displayed in unaltered form until June 5, 1975. At that time, Tex-Mex paid for removal of certain distinctive features from the sign, including the words \u201cHoliday Inn.\u201d The color and shape remained generally the same, and the sign was illuminated at night. The modified sign remained on display until after the granting of an injunction in December, 1978, at which time it was covered with plastic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-23\">. The district court, 493 F.Supp. 1625, ultimately based its jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 and determined liability under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b975-8\">. The Act imposes civil liability on any person who, without consent of the registrant, shall \u201cuse in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b976-7\">. The portion of <em>Kinnear-Weed </em>cited above was decided under Texas precedents pertaining to oil drilling ventures. The court was uncertain that any infringement of the drilling bit patent had occurred. More determinative, however, was that the exonerated \u201cnon-operator\u201d was merely an investor and did not own, use, or have any responsibility for the drilling equipment. Airport, by contrast, admits to outright ownership of the Great Sign and the other motel properties found to have infringed plaintiff\u2019s trademark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b976-12\">. As explained in part II, <em>infra, </em>the trial judge reasoned that only thirty percent of the hotel\u2019s business during the period in question was attributable to the infringement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
