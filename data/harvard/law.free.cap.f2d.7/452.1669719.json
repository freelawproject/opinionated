The negligence of the third assistant engineer is admitted, and respondents\u2019 case is rested wholly on the third section of the Harter Act (27 Statutes, 445). This section is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVs\">\u201cSec. 3. That if the owner of any vessel transporting merchandise or property to or from any port in the United States of America shall exereise due diligence to- make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied, neither the vessel, her owner or owners, agent, or charterers, shall become or be held responsible for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of said vessel nor shall the vessel, her owner or owners, charterers, agent, or master be held liable for losses arising from dangers of the sea or other navigable waters, acts of God, or public enemies, or the inherent defect, quality, or vice of the thing carried, or from iusufficieney of package, or seizure under legal process, or for loss resulting from a,ny act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative, or from saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or from any deviation in rendering such service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Under the maritime law the owner is charged with the duty of furnishing a seaworthy vessel. Carver on Carriage by Sea (6th Ed.) \u00a7 17; Sumner v. Caswell (D. C.) 20 F. 249, 252; The Eugene Vesta (D. C.) 28 F. 762; Bowring v. Thebaud, 56 F. 520, 5 C. C. A. 640. The Harter Act has not abrogated this principle. The Carib Prince, 170 U. S. 655, 662, 18 S. Ct. 753, 42 L. Ed. 1181; The Silvia, 171 U. S. 462, 464, 19 S. Ct. 7, 43 L. Ed. 241. The third section of the Harter Act provides that, when thei owner \u201cshall exercise duo diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied,\u201d he shall be relieved of certain enumerated responsibilities. The burden devolves upon the owner to prove the seaworthiness of the vessel or dne diligence to make her so. Evidence was received from which the District Court was \u2022warranted in holding that the Newport, when her voyage from Christobal to San Francisco began, was \u201cin all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied,\u201d unless it can be said that she became unseaworbhy through the negligent act of the third assistant engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The authorities give to the word \u201cseaworthiness\u201d a wider application than the word itself imports. \u201cIt means that the vessel must he lit for carrying the goods on the voyage in question.\u201d McFadden v. Blue Star Line, 10 Asp. N. S. 55, 58. In The Southwark, 191 U. S. 1, 8, 24 S. Ct. 1, 3 (48 L. Ed. 65), the Supreme Court adopts the following definition from Bouvier: \u201cThe sufficiency of the vessel in materials, construction, equipment, officers, men and outfit for the trade or service in which it is employed.\u201d In The Silvia, 171 U. S. 462, 19 S. Ct. 7, 43 L. Ed. 241, it is said: \u201cThe test of seaworthiness is whether the vessel is reasonably fit to cany the cargo which she has undertaken to transport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">In The Southwark, 191 U. S. 1, 24 S. Ct. 1, 48 L. Ed. 65, the vessel in question was used for the transportation of fresh meat. It was hold that the inefficiency of her refrigerating plant rendered her unseaworlhy. The failure securely to close a porthole, not readily accessible during the voyage, may render a vessel unseaworthy. International Co. v. Farr Co., 181 U. S. 218, 21 S. Ct. 591, 45 L. Ed. 830; The Manitoba (D. C.) 104 F. 145. A defect in the. equipment, which permits water to come in contact with perishable eargo, spells unseaworthiness. The Jeanie, 236 F. 463, 149 C. C. A. 515.; The Asuarca (C. C. A.) 291 F. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The identical situation with which we are concerned in the ease at bar has been held to constitute unseaworthiness. The Manitou (D. C.) 116 F. 60, 65. In this case the court held that the valves controlling the admission of steam to the smothering system, had not been properly closed before the vessel sailed. The owner was therefore denied exemption from, liability under section 3 of the Harter Act. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the above ease. 127 F. 554, 63 C. C. A. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">If the negligent act of the third assistant engineer had been committed an hour later, and after the vessel was under way, it would have been a \u201cfault or error in the management of the vessel,\u201d for which the owner would be relieved of liability under the Harter Act. The Sandfield (D. C.) 79 F. 371, affirmed 92 F. 663, 667, 34 C. C. A. 612; The Merida, 107 F. 146, 149, 46 C. C. A. 208; The Indrani, 177 F. 914, 101 C. C. A. 194; Sun Co. v. Healy, 163 F. 48, 49, 50, 89 C. C. A. 300; The Carisbrook (D. C.) 247 F. 583; Rowson v. Atlantic Transport Co., 9 Aspinall, N. S. 458; The Glenochil, Probate 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The negligent act of the third assistant engineer was committed while he was endeavoring to obey an order looking to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>beginning of the voyage, but the voyage had not begun. In International Co. v. Farr Co., 181 U. S. 218, 21 S. Ct. 591, 45 L. Ed. 830, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller said: \u201cSeaworthiness at the commencement of the voyage is a condition precedent.\u201d \u201cFault in management is no defense, when there is lack of due diligence before the vessel breaks ground.\u201d It is held that the warranty of seaworthiness applies \u201cbefore the commencement of the voyage and until it is actually commenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The owner is chargeable with the duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel \u201cat the commencement of the voyage,\u201d Carver on Carriage by Sea (6th Ed.) \u00a7 18; \u201cat the time she sails,\u201d McFadden v. Blue Star Line, 10 Asp. N. S. 55, 58, Sumner v. Caswell (D. C.) 20 F. 249, 252; In re Meyer (D. C.) 74 F. 881, 885; \u201cwhen she breaks ground,\u201d The Eugene Vesta (D. C.) 28 F. 762; Bowring v. Thebaud, 56 F. 520, 5 C. C. A. 640; \u201cat the beginning of her voyage,\u201d The Silvia, 171 U. S. 462, 464, 19 S. Ct. 7, 43 L. Ed. 241; The Willdomino (C. C. A.) 300 F. 5, 10, 11; \u201cbefore the commencement of the voyage and until it is actually commenced,\u201d Kaufer Co. v. Luckenbach Steamship Co. (D. C.) 294 F. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">When the Newport broke ground, steam was passing through the pipes of her smothering .system into the portion of the hold in which libelant\u2019s coffee was stowed. In this respect the vessel was not at that time \u201creasonably fit to carry the cargo whieh she had undertaken to support.\u201d Appellees argue that the owner is entitled to the protection of the Harter Act if he furnishes a seaworthy vessel when the loading is completed and all preparations are made to begin the voyage. They rely chiefly on Ralli v. New York Co., 154 F. 286, 83 C. C. A. 290, Steamship Wellesley Co. v. Hooper, 185 F. 733, 108 C. C. A. 71, and Gilchrist Transportation Co. v. Boston Insurance Co., 223 F. 716, 139 C. C. A. 246. In all of these cases the shipowner was held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In Ralli v. New York Co. the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said: \u201cWe are of the opinion that respondent cannot claim the benefit of the section above quoted [section 3 of the Harter Act] for the reason that the voyage had not commenced, the cargo was not yet all on board, nor the vessel ready to sa\u00fc.\u201d In the next sentence the court says: \u201cThe language of the section so clearly contemplates a distinction between the preparation for a voyage, and the management of the same after it has begun,\u201d etc. The opinion does not hold that the obligation of the owner is fulfilled by furnishing a seaworthy vessel at some time prior to the commencement of the voyage. The feeding of steam to the capstan for the purpose of casting off the lines was an act of preparation for the voyage. Under the principles announced in the Ralli Case appellees have not made out their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In Steamship Wellesley Co. v. Hooper, 185 F. 733, 738, this court speaking through Judge Gilbert comments on the Ralli Case and follows it. Judge Gilbert holds that improper loading renders a vessel unseaworthy. His opinion does not imply that the owner performs his full duty by furnishing a vessel whieh is seaworthy at some time before the voyage begins. In Gilchrist Transportation Co. v. Boston Insurance Co., 223 F. 716, 139 C. C. A. 246, the vessel had been fully loaded and then moved to a place in Duluth harbor seven miles distant. She had not been inspected, and the navigation season had not opened. It was held for these reasons that the voyage had not commenced, and the protection of the Harter Act was unavailable to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">There is language in the Glenoehil, Probate 10, which supports respondents\u2019 contention, but it was not necessary to the conclusion reached by the British court. The case holds that the Harter Act w\u00fcl protect the owner from responsib\u00fcity for a negligent act in the management of the vessel during the discharge of cargo. This principle is also announced in Sun Co. v. Healy, 163 F. 48, 49-50, 89 C. C. A. 300, and is approved in The Germanic, 196 U. S. 589] 597, 25 S. Ct. 317, 49 L. Ed. 610. The clear weight of authority supports appellant\u2019s contention that the vessel must be seaworthy when the voyage begins, or that due diligence has been exercised to make her so.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">This court has held that the Harter Act is to be strictly construed. The Jeanie, 236 F. 463, 471, 149 C. C. A. 515. To sustain appellees' contentions would be to construe the statute liberally. Appellees are seeking to escape responsibility for the negligent act of their servant. The burden devolves upon them to show that at the commencement of the voyage the Newport was seaworthy, or that they had exercised due diligence to make her so. They have faded to sustain this burden. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The decree is reversed, and a decree w\u00fcl be entered, charging respondents with the payment of libelant\u2019s damages, to be assessed by the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
