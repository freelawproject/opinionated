The answer denied the alleged negligence, and pleaded contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-26\">The minutes of the court below show that the plaintiffs, after introducing their testimony, rested, and that the defendant moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>for nonsuit \u201con the grounds stated, which motion being submitted, it was ordered that the motion be and is granted, and that judgment bo entered accordingly, and the jury discharged.\u201d It was further adjudged that the defendant recover from the plaintiffs its costs. No bill of exceptions is presented in this court and none appeal\u2019s to have been made or allowed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The plaintiffs in error, however, seek to bring before this court the material evidence in the case, by injecting into their assignments of error the grounds of the motion and the testimony pertinent thereto. This, of course, is not permissible. The proposition that evidence received in the trial court cannot be brought before this court, otherwise than by a bill of exceptions duly allowed and authenticated, or by the stipulation of the parties, is so fundamental as to preclude the necessity of discussion or the citation of authority. And in the absence of a proper record showing the grounds of the motion for nonsuit, this court must assume that they were sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">There being no showing of error in the court below, the judgment must be and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
