The motion was denied, and exception was saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">The testimony of the prohibition agents was that they had information that the building was being used for some kind of an illicit brewery; that they went there, and smelled the odor of beer coming from the premises, a large building, with corrugated sides; that they walked to the side of the building, lifted a loosened piece of corrugated iron, looked in, and saw numerous bottles of beer, machinery, and vats, and observed two men rolling barrels; that they went to the front door of the building, and waited there until a man delivered a package, when, as the door was opened and the man entered, <em>they </em>followed and went inside, where they found about 500 cases of beer and machinery suitable for making beer. The agents saw Vaught enter the premises, and, upon being asked by the ag\u2019ent what he was doing there, Vaught replied that <em>\u201ca </em>fellow told him where he could get some good beer,\u201d and that be came down <em>to get </em>some. It was proved that the beer was of unlawful strength, and that Vaught was the lessee and in possession and control of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-24\">We can see no ground for the contention that the search and seizure were illegal. It was plain that the building was not a home or residence, nor bang used as such. The odors which came from it were of beer, and the things seen in the building were such as are used in making beer. There was enough to justify the reasonable be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>lief that defendant was at the time engaged in the commission of offenses defined in. the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 10138% et seq.), and to warrant seizure of the beer and the instrumentalities used in making' beer. For crimes committed in the presence of officers, warrant is not required. Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 44 S. Ct. 445, 68 L. Ed. 898; Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543; Garske v. United States (C. C. A.) 1 F.(2d) 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Error is assigned upon the ruling of the court admitting in evidence an affidavit by defendant Vaught, annexed to his petition for a return of the property, wherein Vaught deposed that he was in possession and control of the premises described in the information, and that certain persons in' the premises were his employees. The affidavit was properly admitted as an admission by Vaught.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
