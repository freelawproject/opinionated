He testified on cross-examination : That he was still in jail serving such sentence, and that \u201cnobody came down there and told me I could have a little time off if I would testify about Black. * * * They didn\u2019t tell me they would make it a little easier on me. I wasn\u2019t looking for any time off.\u201d It was not prejudicial error for the district attorney to state, after the witness had so testified: \u201cI will say to you I am going to recommend that his time he cut down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-26\">An assignment of error that no evidence was offered tending to prove that the offense charged was a second offense must be overrated, where it appears that during the trial of the cause counsel for the accused, in his presence, admitted in open court that the accused had theretofore been convicted of a like offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-27\">Where, at the conchision of the government\u2019s evidence, the defendant moves the court for a directed verdict, and the motion is overruled and exception noted, the error, if any, is waived by the introduction of further evidence on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-28\">The verdict and judgment in this case are fully sustained by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-29\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
