In our opinion the evidence adduced was riot such as to justify the setting aside of the court\u2019s finding to the effect that appellee\u2019s purchase of the land was in good faith, at a time when he had no reason to think that the seller was insolvent, and was unaccompanied by any intention on the part of the appellee to hinder or defraud the seller\u2019s creditors. The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
