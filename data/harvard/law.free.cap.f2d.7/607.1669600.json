The distinction has recently been commented upon in Martin v. Camp, 219 N. Y. 170 [114 N. E. 46], L. R. A. 1917F, 402, where the New York Court of Appeals, after citing earlier cases in unanimous opinion, said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-21\">\u201cThese cases, and many others that might appropriately lie cited to tho same effect, establish that, while so far as the attorney is concerned the contract is entire, and the attorney cannot recover unless he completely performs, the client, with or without cause, may terminate the contract at any time. The substance of the rale declared in these cases was expressed by Judge Hiseock in Re Dunn, supra, 205 N. Y. 398 [98 N. E. 914, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 536], In that ease it was said: 'It is well established, in the case of tho client, that he may at any time for any reason which seems satisfactory to him, however arbitrary, discharge his attorney.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">The relationship of attorney and client rests upon such confidential and personal elements that it is wise that dissolution may bo had at tho will of the client, and the decisions go to the extent of holding that the right of the client to dismiss the attorney, whether with or without cause and at any time, is an implied condition of the contract of employment. 2 R. C. L. 957. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Therefore dismissal of the attorney, arbitrarily or without cause, does not constitute a breach. The Court of Appeals of New York refers to a number of cases which take a different view, but our inclination is in accord with those which sustain the right of termination at the will of the client, and which hold that, where the client exercises his undoubted right to settle the suit without consulting his attorney, the attorney cannot recover in damages for a breach of contract, hut is limited to recovery for the reasonable valu\u00e9 of services <em>rendered. </em>Martin v. Camp, supra; Wright v. Johanson, 132 Wash. 682, 233 P. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In the present case, inasmuch as the client had a right to settle and compromise the actions, the averment that the compromise and. settlement were made by Yaehon for the purpose of defeating payment of attorney\u2019s fees is not material. There is no allegation that the settlement itself was not real or proper. The client, in settling without consulting his attorneys, but exercised a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Settlement, however, does not relieve the client of liability for the reasonable value of services rendered by the attorney up to the time of the settlement and the filing of the stipulation for dismissal. The remedy of the attorneys is upon a quantum meruit, and not upon the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
