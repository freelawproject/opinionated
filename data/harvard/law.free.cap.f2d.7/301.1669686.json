It may be called a disguise; the Westwego undoubtedly became a \u201cwhitewashed\u201d ship, but the machinery of ownership was designed and important, and in no sense fictitious. The object was to avoid one statute, that regarding vessel transfers, and if, in such avoidance, another and quite different statutory reef is encountered, the matter is only hard in the sense that it is one of the accidents of financial navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">What is really the matter here is that the Westwego came under Anglo-American control in 1916, when few, if any, men foresaw the war strain of taxation that was encountered in 1917. The corporate apparatus originally created before 1916, and continued of a purpose by Anglo-American Company, is too rigid to be disregarded. The taxable entity is plaintiff, and no other; it is impossible to look beyond or behind that artificial person. What is taxable is plaintiff\u2019s capital, not that of any other; and what plaintiff is really asking is that we regard as its invested capital, not what went into its own coffers or' property, but the money of Anglo-American Company, which went into the pockets of the original shareholders in plaintiff corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Seeing, therefore, nothing in the nature of things why plaintiff should not respond to the tax according to its own corporate financial history, which contains no reference to the sale of its share-stock by its original shareholders, we turn to the statute, supra, and find it impossible to consider what the Anglo-American paid, either as \u201cactual cash paid in,\u201d or the \u201ccash value of tangible property paid in,\u201d or \u201cearned surplus and undivided profits.\u201d This is because Anglo-American never paid anything <em>in </em>to the plaintiff; it only bought from third persons an interest in the plaintiff, and certainly the enhanced value of plaintiff\u2019s shares cannot be called \u201cearned surplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">On authority, La Belle Iron Works v. United States, 256 U. S. 377, 41 S. Ct. 528, 65 L. Ed. 998, is conclusive; and see especially exposition of the above statutory definition of invested capital at page 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
