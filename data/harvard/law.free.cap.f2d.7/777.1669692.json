From a refusal to remand, no appeal lies to this court (see Bender v. Pennsylvania Co., 148 U. S. 502, 13 S. Ct. 640, 37 L. Ed. 537, but, waiving that question, we may say we agree with the court\u2019s findings and its order so refusing to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">Aa to the second question, the court found \u201cthat the New York corporation neither owns property nor does business in the state of New Jersey, and that under those circumstances, there is nothing' for a New Jersey receiver to take under his charge\u201d; adding, \u201cI must give expression to a sense of poignant regret that the complainant herein should have been advised that his safety as a stockholder demanded such a cause of action as ho has lodged against the defendant corporation \u2014 a course which has perilously jeopardized, not only Ms own security, but that of 7,000 other stockholders, great and small.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">We agree with the conclusions, actions, and expressions of opinion of the court below, and its order vacating the rule to show cause and discharging the receiver is therefore affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
