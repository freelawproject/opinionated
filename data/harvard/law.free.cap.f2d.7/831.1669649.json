As above noted, we express no opinion as to defendant\u2019s well-urged proposition that plaintiff\u2019s patent is no more than a restatement of what other and earlier inventors long ago told the world, nor, in respect of the differing and irreconcilable opinions of Judge Advocates of different years, need we go further than to say that, while we should, if it were necessary, prefer the earlier opinion as better reasoned on the wording of the statute, we think this case was rightly decided below, even if the later views of statutory meaning are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s position is that he swore in his application that \u201cany person in the United States\u201d might use his asserted invention without paying anything'therefor because in brief he thought he was compelled so to do. He acted under a mistake of law, the yoke of which error was not lifted from his neck until 1918-20, when light broke on the Department of Justice, in the manner and to the extent abov\u00e9 noted. We have assumed for argument\u2019s sake that there was a mistake of law made by the Judge Advocate General of 1910 when he construed the act of 1883, but it does not at all follow that this plaintiff acted on or was guided by the same mistake in openly and spontaneously dedicating his work to the public, as he plainly did. In brief, if we assume, though not find, the law to be as plaintiff asserts, plaintiff\u2019s own acts and words still prevent his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">It is first observable that nothing compelled Maj. Squier to take out a patent of any sort; any patent seeking was volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ta,ry. Next, it is undisputed that he could have sought an ordinary patent at his own expense; he had done so before repeatedly, and nothing but his own preference or a sense of duty, wholly uninfluenced by the act of 1883, would or could lead to proceeding under the staLute. Further, had he taken out an ordinary patent, his rights thereunder in respect of the United States were clear enough under Salomons v. United States, 137 U. S. 342, 11 S. Ct. 88, 34 L. Ed. 667, and Gill v. United States, 160 U. S. 426, 16 S. Ct. 322, 40 L. Ed. 480, both well-known rulings before 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"AHb\">But there were special reasons why a man trained from youth to government service would in Ms better moments at all events be more than willing, would indeed ardently desire, to devote what he had discovered to public service, and indignantly decline to make money therefrom. Such an invention as is here asserted was conceivably possible from a genius brain, but for most even first-rate men an investigation of existing plants and trial of existing apparatus was to say the least desirable, and Maj. Squier had those advantages at public expense; again, the whole appropriation was evidently a chance to 'advertise and aggrandize the Signal Corps, and that both plaintiff and his military superiors intended throughout to exploit this departmental pride is perfectly plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Thus, after proclaiming an intent to give the invention to the public in the application itself, the patentee approved published statements by the Chief Signal Officer to the same effect; he personally communicated similar declarations to the daily press, and addressed a technical association in words that can only mean the same thing. Pride in the army and Ms own corps and a very human liking for the \u201clime light\u201d all combined to produce in Maj. Squier a desire, quite sincere at the time, to do exactly what the subtitle on his patent indicated and have it \u201cdedicated to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Of course the very existence of this suit shows that the fit of public spirit has passed; but what controls the interpretation of this patent is the intent of the patentee when he received it, not his present opinion that he would have thought differently, about what he <em>wished to </em>do, had he been better instructed as to what he <em>might </em>have done. We are satisfied that plaintiff wished and was proud to be generous in 1911; that he now regrets that generous emotion is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Decree affirmed, with costs,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
