The Champion. Spark Plug Company manufactures and sells a well-known spark plug used on motors. On January 20, 1922, the Morris Company presented to.the Plug Company a letter prepared by the latter and accepted by it on January 22d, which, constituting the eontraet.between them, was canceled by the Plug Company May 11th, on the ground that its relations with the Morris Company could not be \u201camicable and co-operative.\u201d Thereupon the Morris Company brought this suit for damages. The District Court, being of opinion that the contract was merely an agreement as to prices and terms of shipment when and as defendant chose to accept orders from the plaintiff, directed the jury, at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the trial, to return a verdict for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the defendant, npon which judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"AWf\">Tho controversy here is as to whether the contract is valid, and, if so, what obligations are imposed by it. It begins: \u201cWe [plaintiff] hereby agree that all of onr purchases of the Chainpion spark plugs between January 1, 1922, and December 31, 1922, shall be specified, accepted, and paid for at tho prices and npon the toi'ms and conditions following. Your performance of this agreement is subject to delay caused by strikes, lookouts, labor disturbances, shortage not within your reasonable and practical control.\u201d Then follows the price list, after which come the terms of payment. Under the shipping specifications it is provided: \u201cWe agree to keep on hand at all times a stock of the different types of Champion plugs sufficient to supply the requirements of our regular dealer trade and to specify only the types required for that trade. We herewith specify shipping dates, quantities, and types for shipment to be made within 60 days, and wherever possible will anticipate onr requirements 60 days.\u201d There is a provision relating to \u201csales co-operation,\u201d to the effect that a representative of the Ping Company would work directly with the salesmen of tho Morris Company, with the view of increasing the sales of Champion plugs to the mutual benefit of the parties. Other clauses relate to distributor\u2019s agreements, and it was provided that the prices set out might be advanced by the Plug Company from time to time without previous notice to the Morris Company. Another provision is: \u201cShould any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this agreement he evaded or violated by us [Mills-Morris Company], you are to have the right to cancel or suspend at your option this agreement and/or any orders or specifications in your hands at that time.\u201d The Morris Company was to canvass the territory for purchasers and promote the Plug Company\u2019s trade and interest in every reasonable way, agreeing that, if \u201cwe do not cover our territory or handle our sales, or keep or perform this agreement in all respects to your satisfaction, you may cancel without notice this agreement and/or all unfilled orders and specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">It will be noted that plaintiff agreed that all of its purchases of Champion spark plugs, of which defendant was the sole manufacturer, between January 1st and December 31st, should be specified, accepted, and paid for at the prices and upon the terms set out, and, 'further, it would keep on hand a stock sufficient to supply the requirements of its regular trade, and order only the types required for that trade. There was an understanding as to co-operation between the two in increasing sales to their \u201cmutual benefit and profit,\u201d plaintiff agreeing to promote the trade and interest of defendant in every reasonable way.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Plaintiff had been handling Champion pings prior to the arrangement of January 22d, and, as stated, defendant alone manufactured them. It did not agree in express terms to sell plugs to the plaintiff, hut the obligation was clearly implied in its undertakings and the requirements that it exacted of plaintiff. If the agreement related solely to prices and terms of shipments when and if defendant elected to accept orders, as it contends, it is difficult to see why there was oxaeted from plaintiff an obligation to keep on hand a stock sufficient to supply its trade, or why defendant reserved to itself the option of canceling, not only orders received, but also the agreement. In our opinion it was obligated to supply plaintiff, upon tho conditions sot out in the contract, with the plugs required by it for its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Nor is the agreement lacking in mutuality because imposing no obligation to buy. Plaintiff had an established trade, and there was implied in the language referred to an obligation to buy from defendant all the plugs that plaintiff should actually, in good faith, and in the normal course of its business, require in supplying its trade. This was sufficiently definite in quantity to be binding. Lima Locomotive &amp; Machine Co. v. National Steel Castings Co. (6 C. C. A.) 155 F. 77, 83 C. C. A. 593, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 713; Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. H. Neuer Glass Co. (6 C. C. A.) 253 P. 163, 165 C. C. A. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">But it is argued that, even if the agreement was binding, defendant properly exercised its right of cancellation for dissatisfaction in performance. It will be observed that in one of tho clauses tho right was made dependent upon an evasion by plaintiff of any of \u201cthe terms, provisions, or conditions of this agreement\u201d; in the other, it was contingent upon the failure of plaintiff to \u201ccover our territory or handle our sales or keep or perform this agreement in all respects to your satisfaction.\u201d It is contended under the last provision that defendant\u2019s mere declaration of dissatisfaction was conclusive as to its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">Coneededly the rights of the parlies must be determined by what they have put into their agreement. But this is not a contract involving art, personal taste, or fancy, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>which the party to be satisfied is the sole judge of his own satisfaction. Crawford v. Publishing Co., 163 N. Y. 404, 57 N. E. 616. The performance here related exclusively to the character, utility, and quality of a commercial service. In this class of cases it has been held by some courts that, to justify cancellation under a provision of this kind, there must be reasonable grounds for the' dissatisfaction. This court, however, considered the question in American Music Stores v. Kussel, 232 F. 306, 146 C. C. A. 354, L. R. A. 1916F, 882, and after a review of many authorities reached the conclusion that the right of cancellation depended upon the existence of dissatisfaction, regardless of its reasonableness. See, also, Computing Scale Co. v. Barnard Co. (6 C. C. A.) 259 F. 250, 170 C. C. A. 318. The line of demarcation between this and the rule requiring reasonable grounds is admittedly narrow, In the one ease, there must be actual dissatisfaction, with or without reason, the question being one of fact for the court or the jury (Thaler Bros. v. Construction Co., 229 Pa. 512, 79 A. 147, 33 L. R. A. [N. S.] 345); in the other, the question of fact is whether there is reason for the dissatisfaction even if it exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">No evidence was introduced tending to show that defendant was not satisfied save its letter canceling the agreement for lack of co-operation and amicable relations. The prima facie case made out by this evidence the jury might have thought to be rebutted by proof of amicable business relations between the parties, plaintiff\u2019s \u2018 full compliance with the'contract while in force, and its ability and willingness effectively to carry out all the terms thereof. Defendant introduced no evidence. If upon another trial it can show that it was actually dissatisfied with plaintiff\u2019s performance \u2014 not with the contract \u2014 it will be entitled to a judgment of acquittance.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
