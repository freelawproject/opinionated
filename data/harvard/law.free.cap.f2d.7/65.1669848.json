The following is an excerpt from the testimony of one of these-officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">\u201cQ. Did 'you see the defendant Morris Greenberg and Max Niernberg that day? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">\u201cQ. Whereabouts? A. The comer of 102d street and Jamaica avenue, Queens county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">\u201cQ. Here in the Eastern district? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">\u201cQ. Were they together? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">\u201cQ. Where were they when you saw them? Were they walking, or \u2014 -? A. There was a truek on the comer of 102d street and Jamaica avenue; we were about a block away, and saw one of the defendants roll a barrel in the cellar. We walked up to this truek and -saw this defendant, the thin one of the two, Niernberg\u2014 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">\u201cThe Witness: I saw him on the sidewalk with the truck. I asked him what he had on the truek. He said \u2018Near Beer\u2019. I said, \u2018Open the truck.\u2019 He says,-\u2018Do I have to?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and showed him my shield, and opened the truek and found\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">\u201cMr. Manne: I object, on the ground that the defendant was illegally forced to give evidence against himself, and his constitutional rights were invaded by the action of the officer; that there is no evidence here of anything that would warrant the officer in making such a search or in, forcing the defendant to open the truek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-17\">\u201cThe Court: What Constitution are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-18\">\u201cMr. Manne: The Constitution of the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-19\">\u201c\u00edhe Court: Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-20\">\u201cMr. Manne: I respectfully except.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-21\">\u201cQ. You saw the truek on 102d street and Jamaica avenue? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-22\">\u201cQ. Where was the truck \u2014 in front of the building? A. A former licensed liquor saloon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-23\">\u201cQ. Was this truek standing or in motion when you first observed it? A. Standing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-24\">\u201cQ. Was any one with you? A. Officer Reich and Sherry and Hughs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-25\">\u201cQ. You saw this defendant. What was he doing when you first observed him? A. I observed about a block away a man rolling a barrel in the cellar. The cellar door was open, and walked toward there and saw Niernberg at the door, side door, of this truck, and the door was closed, and while asking him who owns the beer he wouldn\u2019t answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-26\">\u201cQ. Tell us the first thing you said to him? A. I said \u2018Where did you get this?\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t answer me. With that, the defendant Greenberg came out of the cellar, and Officer Reich approached him and spoke to him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-27\">\u201cQ. Tell us what you said to this defendant Niernberg, and what he said to you. A. I asked him where he got it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-28\">\u201cQ. Got what? A. The beer; the barrel of beer. There were 9 barrels and 6 empties, and he wouldn\u2019t say anything at all.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-29\">\u201cQ. What kind of a truek was this? A. About a 2-ton truck, a closed truek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-30\">\u201cQ. Completely closed when you approached it? A. Yes, sir; the side door sliding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-31\">\u201cQ. Did you open the truek? A. I did\u2014 he did after I showed him my shield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-32\">\u201cQ. Did you ask him to open the truek? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-33\">\u201cQ. He did? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-34\">\u201cQ. What did you do? A. I went in to count the barrels, 9 full barrels and 6 empties. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-35\">\u201cQ. After your examination of the barrels what did you do ? A. Placed the two defendants under arrest, took them to the station house, and Officer Reich had one of the barrels and took a sample \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-36\">The admission of the evidence was objected to on the ground that neither of the police officers, who made the arrest and seizure, had a search warrant; and it is claimed that the search and seizure was unlawful, and that the testimony was inadmissible, and contrary to the Fourth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. There is no evidence in this record 'which brings this ease -within the doctrine of Flagg v. United States, 233 F. 481, 147 C. C. A. 367, and we think the ease is disposed of by the decision of this court in Schroeder v. United States, 7 F. (2d) 60, handed down this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Before concluding this opinion, wo may call attention to the fact that it is not necessary, even in the case of federal officers, that they should in all cases have a search warrant to justify a search and seizure. The Fourth Amendment only provides that \u201ctho right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures, shall not be violated. ' \u201d And section 26, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, provides in part as follows: \u201cWhen the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall he his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. \" <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The right of a federal agent to search and seize without a warrant intoxicating liquors being transported in an automobile contrary to law was considered very fully in the decision of the Supreme Court in tho recent case of Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543, decided on March 2, 1925. It is not necessary for us to consider whether the decision of the instant ease would have been different, if a federal officer had searched and seized the truck containing the liquors herein involved. If he had done so without a warrant, the seizure would still have been lawful, unless it appeared that the circumstances were such as to make his conduct unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
