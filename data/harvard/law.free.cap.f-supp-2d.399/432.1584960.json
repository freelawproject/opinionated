INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">Plaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of certain purchasers of common stock in GeoPharma, Inc. (\u201cGeoPharma\u201d), a publicly-traded pharmaceutical company. The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations is that defendants issued a deliberately misleading press release that caused investors to believe that the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) had granted GeoPharma approval for a new drug, when in fact the FDA had merely approved a (much less potentially lucrative) medical device. Plaintiffs allege violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants now move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, defendants\u2019 motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-17\">II. THE COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"AtX\">A. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">Plaintiffs are a group of investors who purchased GeoPharriia common stock during the putative class period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are suing on behalf of a putative class defined as \u201call persons or entities who purchased the common stock of GeoPharma on December 1, 2004 and/or December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>2, 2004, inclusive (the \u2018Class Period\u2019), and who were damaged thereby.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATF\">GeoPharma manufactures, packages and distributes dietary supplements, over-the-counter drugs, pharmaceuticals and health/beauty care products for companies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Belcher Pharmaceuticals, a unit of GeoPharma, develops and manufactures generic and over-the-counter drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Plaintiffs also name three individual defendants, all of whom are officers and directors of GeoPharma. Kotha S. Sekharam is President,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mihir K. Taneja is the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Jugal Taneja is the Chairman of the Board of Directors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> All three individual defendants held their current positions during the putative class period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">B. The Alleged Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">1. Development of Mucotrol</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Beginning in early 2004, GeoPharma made several announcements regarding its development of a new product, eventually designated as Mucotrol, intended to treat a condition called mucositis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mucositis is an inflammation of the mucosa in the mouth, caused by chemotherapy and radiation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to a GeoPharma press release excerpted in the Complaint, \u201cmucositis affects approximately 15-40% of patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy and 76-100% of patients receiving higher doses of chemotherapy in bone marrow transplant ... [mjucositis complications may lead to (a) delay in the chemotherapy schedule (b) reduction from the desired dose (c) complications such as pain, dehydration, malnutrition and infection.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">On June 29, 2004, GeoPharma filed its annual report with the SEC. According to a GeoPharma Form 10-K filed at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-16\">[Fjormulation work and stability studies are currently underway on three other drug products one of which is a product that treats mucositis ... [w]e have developed a formulation using all natural ingredients. Preliminary results indicated promising results in the regeneration of mucosal lining. We have filed a patent on this formulation. Preliminary double blind placebo controlled clinical studies are underway in a prestigious hospital abroad.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">Defendants again referred to a mucositis drug in a July 13, 2004 press release (entitled \u201cGeoPharma Reports Success in Clinical Studies on Oral Mucositis Drug for Cancer Patients.\u201d)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The release reported that GeoPharma had completed a double blind clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of \u201ca patent-pending drug for mucositis in cancer patients.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This press release also stated that \u201cthe market potential is estimated to be at $300 million to $500 million.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the same release, defendant Sekharam was referred to as the drug\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>inventor, and was quoted as asserting that this drug was expected to have no side effects.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">However, while GeoPharma had characterized this new mucositis treatment as a drug, by September 2004 it apparently realized that it was actually a medical device. On September 1, 2004, GeoPharma filed an application with the FDA seeking 510(k) approval<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to market a medical device by the name of Mucotrol Concentrated Oral gel wafer (\u201cMucotrol\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nowhere on the application was Mucotrol referred to as a drug.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The FDA granted marketing approval for Mucotrol in a letter dated November 24, 2004.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This letter stated that, as required by the 510(k) approval process, the FDA determined that the device is substantially equivalent to other products already in the market.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Defendants did not disclose the receipt of this letter until December 2, 2004.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Plaintiffs assert that GeoPharma\u2019s sudden shift from development of a drug to a medical device carries great significance. A device has a more limited market than a drug, because a device can only be used for relief once mucositis develops, while a drug can be administered to cancer patients to reduce their chances of developing mucositis in the first place.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Similarly, a drug, but not a medical device, shortens hospital stays, a factor important to insurance companies.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Finally, while there was no available drug for treatment of mucositis, there were already several medical devices in the market.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> For these reasons, plaintiffs estimate the potential market for a medical device treating mucositis at $1.2 million, as opposed to $150 million for a drug treatment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">2. The December 1 Press Release</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">On December 1, 2004, prior to the opening of the trading day, GeoPharma issued a press release entitled \u201cGeoPharma, Inc. Receives FDA Approval for Mucotrol\u2122; Manages Mucositis Caused by Radiation and Chemotherapy Required in Cancer Treatment\u201d (\u201cThe December 1 Release\u201d).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Release states in pertinent part that \u201cGeoPharma, Inc. today announced that Belcher Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GeoPharma, Inc., has received approval from the [FDA] for Mucotrol\u2122, a <em>prescription product </em>for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The release also estimated that, given the number of people who suffer from mucositis, \u201concology market potential for Mucotrol\u2122 sales are between $75 million and $800 million per annum and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>estimated global market is between $250 million and $1 billion per annum.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Plaintiffs allege two misstatements and an actionable omission in the December 1 Release.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>plaintiffs allege that the Release\u2019s statement that GeoPharma \u201creceived approval from the [FDA] for Mucotrol, a prescription product for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis\u201d is misleading because it faded to make clear that, despite GeoPharma\u2019s earlier statements, Mucotrol was approved as a medical device and not a drug.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>plaintiffs allege that GeoPharma had a duty to disclose that Mucotrol had existing competition in the field of medical devices addressing mucositis.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Finally, the Release allegedly \u201cmaterially overstated\u201d the market potential for Mucotrol.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The December 1 Release had a dramatic effect on GeoPharma\u2019s stock. That morning, the price zoomed to an all-time high of $11.25 per share, a one-day increase of 153%.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Volume was extraordinary as well; 42 million shares changed hands on December 1, against an average daily volume of 22,000 shares.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">3. Corrective Disclosures</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">This newfound prosperity did not last even half a day. In response to media inquiries, an FDA spokesperson erroneously stated that the agency had no record of <em>any </em>approval for Mucotrol.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> After the FDA statement, the price of GeoPharma stock promptly cratered. When trading was halted at approximately 1:30 p.m. on December 1, the stock had fallen to $6.81 per share.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">The FDA then corrected its misstatement, clarifying that Mucotrol had received marketing approval as a medical device.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The next day, GeoPharma issued another press release prior to the opening of the market, intended to address the confusion caused by the December 1 Release. This release stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">[i]n an earlier press release (July 2004), GeoPharma, Inc. had announced the results of a double blind clinical study of their produc[t] (MF5232, now called Mucotrol\u2122). On December 1, 2004, a press release was issued by the Company after receiving FDA Section 510(k) premarket approval, noting that the FDA approval allows for the marketing of the medical device based on the FDA\u2019s finding of the device being \u2018substantially equivalent to legally marketed predicate devices.\u2019 The Company\u2019s application to the FDA requested approval for this prescription device to be approved to be marketed for the mechanical action indicated for the management of pain by soothing oral lesions caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy mucositis/stomatitis, oral irritations due to oral surgery, braces or dentures in addition to diffusing apthous ulcers. Although it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>estimated that approximately 300,000 cancer patients in the U.S. suffer from mucositis, revenues from the Company\u2019s distribution of Mueotrol\u2122 cannot be estimated at this time.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avp\">On December 2, 2004, GeoPharma shares rose 8.22% to close at $7.37 (at one point reaching an intra-day high of $9.58).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYg\">After the markets closed on December 2, GeoPharma and two of the individual defendants held a conference call with investors to discuss the December 1 Release. On the call, defendants Mihir Taneja and Sekharam declined to provide a basis for the previous estimate of Mucotrol\u2019s .market potential.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Asked why previous company releases referred to development of a drug to treat mucositis, when Mueotrol itself was a device, Sekharam stated that the Company initially tried to develop a drug treatment but ended up with a device.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"An2\">Plaintiffs allege that due to the further disclosures made on the conference call, GeoPharma\u2019s share price fell 12.48% in after-market activity on December 2, closing at $6.45 per share. The shares fell to $5.46 per share the next day.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aex\">4. Scienter Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"AC7\">Plaintiffs allege that in 2004 GeoPharma embarked on a strategy to \u201ctransition [into] a drug manufacturer,\u201d for which \u201cthe Company needed to raise substantial capital, which it subsequently did.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> To this end, GeoPharma entered into three separate financing arrangements in the Spring of 2004.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The terms of each agreement vary, but in brief plaintiffs allege that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1s\">Under the terms of the Company\u2019s financing agreements, Defendants could force a portion of its note holders and preferred shareholders to accept shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in lieu of cash payments if the stock reached a minimum of $7.19 per share for only five consecutive days. From the middle of March 2004, until the start of the Class Period, the price of GeoPharma stock did not trade above the trigger prices for the required period of time. Accordingly, during this time, Defendants [made] expensive monthly cash payments to the Company\u2019s note holders and preferred stock owners.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKq\">Therefore, defendants \u201cwere motivated to engage in the fraudulent scheme ... in order to force the conversion of GeoPharma\u2019s debt and equity financing into common stock (which it would be able to do if the Company\u2019s stock reached certain levels for five consecutive days) in order to avoid making substantial monthly payments on its Term Note and preferred stocks.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Plaintiffs also- allege that defendants knew that the December 1 Release was materially false or misleading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">Defendants knew that the Company had submitted an application to the FDA for approval of a medical <em>device, </em>not a <em>drug, </em>and knew that the FDA had approved Mucotrol as a medical <em>device, </em>not as a <em>drug. </em>Nonetheless, in numerous statements prior to the Class Period, Defendants represented that Mucotrol was a <em>drug </em>and when Defendants announced the FDA approval during the Class Period, they failed to disclose that the approval was for a medical device with a dramatically smaller market than that of a <em>drug.</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">III. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"AKr\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to dismiss should be granted only if \u201c \u2018it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim[s] which would entitle [them] to relief.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The task of the court in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \u201cmerely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> When deciding a motion to dismiss, courts must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Courts generally do not consider matters outside the pleadings but may consider documents attached to the pleadings, documents referenced in the pleadings, or documents that are integral to the pleadings.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Courts may also \u201ctake judicial notice of well-publicized stock prices without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">B. Section 10 and Rule 10b-5</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">To state a prima facie case for securities fraud under section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, a plaintiff must allege that \u201c \u2018the defendant, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact, with scienter, and that plaintiffs reliance on defendant\u2019s action caused injury to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The requisite state of mind, or scienter, in an action under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is \u201c \u2018an intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">Securities fraud actions are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>plaintiff alleging securities fraud under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must also satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> To plead a material misrepresentation or omission under the PSLRA \u201cthe complaint [must] specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information or belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> \u201cTo meet the pleading standard of Rule 9(b), this Court has repeatedly required, among other things, that the pleading \u2018explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">1. Actionably False or Misleading Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">To state a cause of action under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must first plead that defendants made \u201ca false material representation or omitted to disclose material information.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Liability is not restricted only to statements that are literally false: \u201c[s]ome statements, although literally accurate, can become, through their context and manner of presentation, devices which mislead investors. For that reason, the disclosure required by the securities laws is measured not by literal truth, but by the ability of the material to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Therefore, a statement or omission is actionably misleading when a reasonable investor would have been misled.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This determination is fact-specific, rarely amenable to disposition as a matter of law.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">Regarding omissions, generally there can be no liability for an omission under Rule 10b-5 absent a duty to disclose the omitted information.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Omissions are actionable only when they cause the statements actually made to be misleading, or if a duty to disclose is created by statute or regulation.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">2. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">Under the PSLRA, the complaint must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>dant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough speculation and eonclusory allegations will not suffice, neither do we require \u2018great specificity\u2019 provided the plaintiff alleges enough facts to support \u2018a strong inference of fraudulent intent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter can be alleged by one of two methods: the plaintiff may plead \u201cmotive and opportunity to commit fraud\u201d or \u201cstrong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">i. Motive and Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u201cMotive would entail concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements.and wrongful non-disclosures alleged,\u201d while \u201c[ojpportunity would entail the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> \u201cMotives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Specifically, insufficient motives include \u201cthe desire for the corporation to appear profitable and ... the desire to keep stock prices high to increase officer compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Courts have also rejected as insufficient allegations that a company desired to inflate stock as a method of maintaining its credit rating.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">On the other hand, the desire \u201cto inflate stock prices while [defendants] sold their own shares\u201d may support a viable claim.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Some courts have also found that a company\u2019s desire to inflate its stock price as a prelude to completing a stock-based acquisition of another company can support a scienter inference.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Regarding the \u201copportunity\u201d <em>prong, </em>courts often assume that corporations, corporate officers and corporate directors would have the opportunity to commit fraud if they so desired.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> However, opportunity to commit fraud may not exist if the alleged scheme had no chance of succeeding.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">ii. Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">When plaintiffs have failed to plead motive and opportunity, \u201cit is still possible to plead scienter by identifying circumstances indicating conscious behavior [or recklessness] by defendant, though the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Conscious misconduct is relatively easy to identify, \u201csince it encompasses deliberate illegal behavior, such as securities trading by insiders privy to undisclosed and material information ... or knowing sale of a company\u2019s stock at an unwarranted discount.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">However, \u201c[r]ecklessness is harder to identify with ... precision and consistency.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> To sufficiently allege recklessness, the facts must \u201capproximate an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Plaintiff must allege facts showing that the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201chighly unreasonable, representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Recklessness is typically shown in one of two ways; plaintiff must \u201cspecifically allege[ ] defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public statements,\u201d or \u201callege[ ] facts demonstrating that defendants failed to review or check information that they had a duty to monitor, or ignored obvious signs of fraud.\u201d <footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">3. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">To maintain a claim for securities fraud, a plaintiff must also plead both (1) that it relied upon defendant\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conduct in purchasing or selling securities, and (ii) that defendant\u2019s conduct caused, at least in part, plaintiffs loss.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> These two elements are known, respectively, as \u201ctransaction causation\u201d and \u201closs causation.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Loss causation refers to the requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate that the fraudulent scheme caused her loss.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In the case of a 10b-5 action alleging a material misstatement or omission, loss causation generally requires a plaintiff to show that her investments would not have lost value if the facts that defendants misrepresented or omitted had been known.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">A plaintiff cannot satisfactorily allege loss causation simply by alleging that she purchased securities at artificially inflated prices. In <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo,</em><footnotemark><em>89</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s permissive pleading standard for loss causation, which required only that a plaintiff allege that she had bought a security at an artificially inflated price.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIz\">[I]t should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has suffered an economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind. At the same time, allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause that the plaintiff has in mind would bring about harm of the very sort the statutes seek to avoid.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Most recently, the Second Circuit has held that a plaintiff must allege that \u201cthe loss be foreseeable and [] the loss be caused by the materialization of the concealed risk.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> This Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation </em>describes in detail the Second Circuit\u2019s loss causation standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">Where the alleged misstatement conceals a condition or event which then occurs and causes the plaintiffs loss, it is the materialization of the undisclosed condition or event that causes the loss. By contrast, where the alleged misstatement is an intentionally false opinion, the market will not respond to the truth until the falsity is revealed \u2014 i.e. a corrective disclosure.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>IV.

Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Cause of Action Against Jugal Taneja</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Plaintiffs have sued Jugal Taneja, the Chairman of GeoPharma\u2019s Board of Directors.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> But plaintiffs do not make any specific allegations against him anywhere in the Complaint.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Instead, plaintiffs invoke the \u201cgroup pleading doctrine,\u201d which allows a plaintiff to rely on \u201ca presumption that statements in ... press releases, or other group-published information, are the collective work of those individuals with direct involvement in the everyday business of the company.\u201d <footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">However, this doctrine is \u201cextremely limited in scope, applying only to clearly cognizable corporate insiders with active daily roles in the relevant companies or transactions.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> To be sure, the doctrine may apply to outside directors who \u201calthough almost by definition [are] excluded from the day-to-day management of a corporation, can fall within the group pleading presumption when, by virtue of their status or a special relationship with the corporation, ... have access to information more akin to a corporate insider.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9g\">Plaintiffs fail to allege that Jugal Taneja has a special relationship with GeoPharma. A bare allegation that Jugal Taneja is Chairman of the Board, in the absence of any specific allegation that he played a role in the preparation of the December 1 Release, or otherwise took part in the day-to-day operations of GeoPharma, does not justify applying the group pleading doctrine.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Therefore, all claims against him are dismissed.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>B. Actionably Misleading Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Plaintiffs allege three distinct misstatements in the December 1 Release. <em>First, </em>plaintiffs allege that the statement that GeoPharma \u201creceived approval from the [FDA] for Mucotrol, a prescription product for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis\u201d is misleading because it failed to specify that, despite GeoPharma\u2019s earlier statements, Mucotrol was approved as a medical device and not as a drug.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>the Release allegedly \u201cmaterially overstated\u201d the market potential for Mucotrol.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> <em>Third, </em>plaintiffs allege that GeoPharma had a duty to disclose that Mucotrol had existing competition in the field of medical devices.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">I. Mucotrol as a \u201cPrescription Product\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Defendants first note that plaintiffs cannot allege that the description of Mucotrol as a \u201cprescription product\u201d is literally false.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> After all, Mucotrol is in fact a product available by prescription.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> But plaintiffs actually allege that the term \u201cprescription product\u201d in the December 1 Release could be interpreted by a reasonable investor as referring to a new drug, given the context created by defendants\u2019 earlier statements concerning GeoPharma\u2019s ongoing development of a new <em>drug </em>to treat mucositis, as well as the context of the rest of the December 1 Release, which spoke of a vast market potential for Mucotrol more consistent with a new drug than a new medical device.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-16\">Defendants\u2019 argument that the December 1 Release\u2019s reference to a \u201cprescription product\u201d was not misleading reduces to the proposition that a reasonable investor would have understood the December 1 Release as an <em>update </em>of earlier GeoPharma statements which had referred to Mucotrol as a drug. In particular, defendants make much of the fact that the December 1 Release describes Mucotrol as a product that \u201cmanages\u201d mucositis \u2014 a verb that to a reasonable investor should denote a medical device, as opposed to a drug that \u201ctreats\u201d a disease.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Therefore, defendants argue that a reasonable investor could not be misled by the December 1 Release into thinking that GeoPharma had gained approval of a new drug, because such an investor would necessarily \u201chave to recognize that the December 1 Press Release, in the most significant way, was <em>not </em>consistent with the earlier statements about Mucotrol.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">This case is similar to <em>In re Ribozyme Pharmaceutical, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>a case on which plaintiffs rely.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In that case, a drug company defendant announced that a drug it was developing had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>entered Phase II clinical trials.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Defendant subsequently issued a media advisory claiming that the same drug had \u201c[made] cancer drug history,\u201d and asserting that the drug had taken \u201can important step forward,\u201d \u201cmaking both clinical history and industry news.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">After this media advisory, the company\u2019s stock doubled in less than two hours.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> But after trading was halted, defendants disclosed that the media advisory merely referred to the previously-disclosed commencement of Phase II trials.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> At the motion to dismiss stage, the court accepted plaintiffs\u2019 argument that this media advisory could be actionably misleading; in light of defendants\u2019 earlier announcements it was reasonable to interpret the advisory as announcing additional progress beyond the previously-disclosed Phase II trials.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Defendants are correct that a company is not required to use the clearest language possible in its public statements.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Even so, a reasonable investor could have been misled by failing to absorb the f\u00edne distinction between the terms \u201cdrug\u201d and \u201cprescription product.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiffs have properly alleged that the use of a rather vague term such as \u201cprescription product\u201d in the December 1 Release, given the context of GeoPharma\u2019s previous statements, could be objectively misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">2. Statement of \u201cMarket Potential\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANi\">The December 1 Release contained the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">Mucositis afflicts approximately 40% of patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and 75% of bone marrow transplant recipients as well as 100% of patients receiving radiotherapy for cancer of the head and neck. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 cancer patients in the U.S. suffer from mucositis associated with cancer treatments. <em>Based on this, the estimated U.S. oncology market potential for Mucotrol sales are between $75 million and $800 million per annum and the estimated global market is between $250 million and $1 billion per annum.</em><footnotemark><em>117</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">Defendants argue that the statement is not actionable because it qualifies for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>protection of the PSLRA\u2019s safe-harbor for forward-looking statements.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> This safe harbor protects forward-looking statements if one of three conditions are met: 1) the forward-looking statement is identified as such and accompanied by \u201cmeaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement;\u201d 2) the statement is \u201cimmaterial\u201d; or 3) the plaintiff fails to prove that the statement was made with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Fairly read as a statement of potential revenues Mucotrol might garner, the market potential statement qualifies as a forward-looking statement under the PSLRA, thereby warranting protection as long as it meets one of the three statutory conditions .<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Neither of the first two conditions are met.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> But, for the reasons discussed later in this Opinion, plaintiffs have failed to plead that defendants had actual knowledge that the market potential statement was false.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Plaintiffs attempt to avoid the PSLRA safe harbor by characterizing the market potential statement as a statement of historical fact. \u201cAt any point in time the \u2018market potential\u2019 of a product is a fixed number \u2014 whether or not knowable with certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> But if the market potential statement is <em>not </em>a revenue projection for Mucotrol, then it could only be interpreted as an estimate of the total market for <em>all </em>products that treat or manage mucositis, whether or not the products are manufactured by GeoPharma. If this is the case, plaintiffs have not pled that the statement is false. As defendants note, \u201cgiven the number of people who suffer from mucositis, as set forth in the December 1 Press Release, it is entirely reasonable to assume that there is at least $75 million out in the market to be spent on products addressing the affliction.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> The statement is either a protected forward-looking statement, or it is a statement of historical fact that is not alleged to be false. Either way, for the reasons set forth more fully below, the market potential statement is not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">3. Non-Disclosure of Competitors\u2019 Products</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Plaintiffs assert that, in light of earlier company statements in connection with Mucotrol to the effect that no effective treatment for mucositis is available, GeoPharma had a duty to disclose competitor products as a part of its general duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to update statements that may have become misleading as a result of intervening events.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> But plaintiffs are not claiming that those earlier statements are false, and there is normally no duty to disclose the existence of competitors.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> At most, as plaintiffs themselves recognize, the failure to disclose the existence of competition is not a separate misstatement or omission, but merely an example of how defendants could have worded the December 1 Release differently so as to avoid misleading investors on the central issue of whether Mucotrol was a drug or a medical device.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Therefore, this alleged omission is not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">C. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">While plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the December 1 Release\u2019s description of Mucotrol as a \u201cprescription product\u201d could be objectively misleading, \u201ca statement does not become actionable simply by virtue of being false (or otherwise misleading), \u2014 the other elements of fraud, such as scienter and reliance, must also be present.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> For the following reasons, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations must be dismissed because they have failed to \u201cgiv[e] rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d <footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">1. Motive and Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"AOq\">a. GeoPharma</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">Plaintiffs allege that GeoPharma\u2019s motive to inflate its share price was to force some of its noteholders and preferred shareholders to accept shares of its common stock, so GeoPharma could avoid making principal, interest and dividend payments pursuant to those financing arrangements.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> GeoPharma could accomplish this if its stock traded above certain levels for either five or ten days, depending on the particular security purchase agreement in question.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> In short, plaintiffs allege that \u201c[defendants embarked on a scheme which would enable them to reduce the Company\u2019s monthly cash payments [for interest on the notes].\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> These allegations are insufficient for a fundamental reason \u2014 the alleged scheme could not possibly have succeeded.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>FDA. approval of Mucotrol was public information, and it would have been obvious <em>ex ante </em>to defendants that financial reporters and/or analysts would contact the FDA immediately after the December 1 Release (which is of course what occurred).<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> There was never the slightest chance that GeoPharma stock could be inflated by the December 1 Release for anywhere close to the five days needed to carry out the alleged scheme, and therefore plaintiffs cannot raise a strong inference of scienter on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motive allegations fail for another reason \u2014 courts in this Circuit have consistently held that allegations that a defendant was motivated to commit securities fraud by a desire to reduce its debt burden, or otherwise reduce borrowing costs, are insufficient to raise a scienter inference.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that GeoPharma sought to reduce its cash outlays for debt service fall squarely into this category.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Plaintiffs argue that the desire to inflate the stock to activate the conversion feature of GeoPharma\u2019s financing agreements is a valid motive because it represents a \u201cspecific corporate transaction,\u201d citing cases where- a company\u2019s desire to make a corporate acquisition with inflated stock was held to be a valid motive for scienter purposes.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> But plaintiffs read these cases too broadly \u2014 they are in fact limited to the desire to carry out corporate <em>acquisi</em>tions,<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> The Second Circuit has explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>that the motive to acquire another company can support an inference of scienter because, unlike the motive to reduce borrowing costs, it is a motive not generally possessed by all corporations.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Plaintiffs fail to offer any convincing reason why the short-term or unusual nature of the debt arrangement in this case merits departure from the <em>San Leandro </em>rule.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">b. Individual Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"Aj8\">There are no motive and opportunity allegations against the individual defendants. Typically, a plaintiff alleges that an individual traded in company stock after the stock was artificially inflated as a result of the scheme.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> No such allegations are made in this case against any individual defendant.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> For that matter, there are no allegations explaining how any of the individual defendants personally profited from the alleged scheme.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Moreover, a corporate motive (such as the desire to activate the conversion features of the securities purchase agreements) cannot be ascribed to individual defendants.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiffs have not alleged scienter against the individual defendants through motive and opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">2. Conscious Misbehavior/Recklessness</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Defendants argue, in their reply brief, that because the alleged scheme could not have succeeded, this alone precludes a finding of the required strong inference of scienter, even when plaintiffs attempt to prove scienter by alleging conscious misbehavior or recklessness.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 novel argument has merit.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> Conscious misbehavior is an intentional wrongful act. Surely if such alleged mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>behavior is incapable of defrauding investors, that, in itself, negates the inference of intent to defraud.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> The same must be true for allegations of reckless conduct. Reckless acts are highly unreasonable, representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care. If the alleged reckless behavior is incapable of defrauding investors, that, too, negates any inference of intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In any case, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of conscious misbehavior or recklessness fall far short of the required standard.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that defendants were at least reckless in issuing the December 1 Release, because defendants knew that the FDA approval was for a medical device, not a drug.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the December 1, 2004 press release was issued, Defendants knew or were extremely reckless in not knowing that they were misrepresenting \u25a0 material facts related to the corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> But even if the FDA approval letter could be said to have contradicted the December 1 Release in some sense, the FDA approval of Mucotrol was public information. Plaintiffs have cited no case, and I am aware of none, where a plaintiff adequately pled scienter based solely on the contradiction between <em>public </em>information and the company\u2019s public statements.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> Cases in this Circuit assume that the contradictory information in question must be non-public.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> Especially in light of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to put forward a plausible motive for the alleged scheme, I cannot conclude that defendants\u2019 statements, even though confusingly worded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>exhibited \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care\u201d necessary to support an inference of scienter.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">D. Loss Causation<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ayr2\">Defendants also dispute plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of loss causation. <em>First, </em>defendants note that GeoPharma\u2019s stock price actually increased after the alleged corrective disclosures (the December <em>2 </em>Press Release and the December 2 conference call), reaching a high at one point of $9.58.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>defendants argue that any artificial inflation during the class period cannot be attributed to GeoPharma\u2019s alleged misstatements, as opposed to other possible causes such as the incorrect news reports by Reuters and Dow Jones on the morning of December 1 that GeoPharma had gained approval of a \u201cdrug\u201d.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Leaving aside for the moment that plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege scienter, their loss causation allegations are sufficient. Defendants overstate the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 burden at this stage of the proceedings when they argue that plaintiffs must exclude all other possible causes of the artificial inflation.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> To the contrary, plaintiffs must only allege a false or misleading statement,<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> which caused an artificial inflation of the stock,<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> followed by a dissipation of that inflation after corrective disclosures were made.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> The corrective disclosure in this case involved the correction of the misapprehension, fostered by the December 1 Release, that GeoPharma had gained approval of a new drug instead of a new medical device. Therefore, the Complaint puts defendants on sufficient notice of the \u201ccausal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.\u201d<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">E. Section 20(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Plaintiffs also bring allegations against the individual defendants under section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> However, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>primary violation of section 10(b) is a prerequisite to finding control person liability under section 20(a).<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> Accordingly, as plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead scienter, the control person allegations are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">F. Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Plaintiffs have requested leave to amend the Complaint in the event of dismissal.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> Pursuant to Rule 15(a), leave to amend a complaint \u201cshall be freely freely granted when justice so requires.\u201d<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[i]t is the usual practice upon granting a motion to dismiss to allow leave to re-plead.\u201d <footnotemark>166</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are therefore granted leave to replead within twenty days of this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted, without prejudice, with leave to replead within twenty days of receipt of this Opinion and Order.
