We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">Tazi challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien must show the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have reviewed the record and conclude Tazi fails to demonstrate that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief Tazi seeks. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Tazi cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for.withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">We also uphold the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Tazi faded to establish eligibility for protection under the CAT. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
