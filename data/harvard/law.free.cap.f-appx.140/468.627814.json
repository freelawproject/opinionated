To obtain reversal of a determination finding no eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that Kyalwe fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-19\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). As Kyalwe did not show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-20\">We also find that Kyalwe fails to meet the standard for relief under the CAT. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Kyalwe failed to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
