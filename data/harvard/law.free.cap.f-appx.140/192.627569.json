Reynolds contends that, because his career offender status was not used in the calculation of his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, any reference to his status as a career offender violates his right to accurate information and should be deleted from his Presentence Investigation Report and Bureau of Prison records. Because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to reach the merits of Reynolds\u2019s petition, we vacate and direct the district court, on remand, to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-21\">Although the district court did not dismiss Reynolds\u2019s petition on jurisdictional grounds, we must examine subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking. <em>Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 410 (11th Cir.1999). We must examine both our jurisdiction and that of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 409. If we are without jurisdiction, then we will not address the merits of Reynolds\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-22\">Section 2241 does not offer Reynolds an avenue for relief. \u201cThe \u2018savings clause\u2019 of \u00a7 2255 permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition only if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 945 (11th Cir.2005). The statutory prohibition against filing successive petitions under section 2255 without our permission does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>not render Reynolds\u2019s remedies under section 2255 inadequate or ineffective for purposes of the savings clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s ... restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause, and, consequently, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Id. </em>The district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Reynolds\u2019s petition, because he did not meet the requirements of the savings clause of section 2255. We, therefore, vacate the decision of the district court and remand so that the district court may dismiss Reynolds\u2019s motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
