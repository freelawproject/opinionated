We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in upholding the denial of Ramirez\u2019s motion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Ramirez, </em>No. A70-674-170 (B.I.A. Oct. 18, 2004).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-11\"> In his brief, Ramirez challenges the fact that his decision was rendered by a single Board member without following the proper regulations based on his mistaken belief that his case was decided pursuant to the regulatory procedures governing orders that summarily affirm without opinion. Instead, Ramirez\u2019s case was decided by a single Board member pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (2005). Thus, we find that Ramirez\u2019s claim that the Board failed to follow its own regulations is clearly without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
