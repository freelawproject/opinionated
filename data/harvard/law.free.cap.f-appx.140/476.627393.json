Baker seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order construing his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion as a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) and dismissing it as successive. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t </em>of Corr., 434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) <em>(quoting United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on August 12, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on December 9, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Baker failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We deny Baker\u2019s motion to appoint counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
