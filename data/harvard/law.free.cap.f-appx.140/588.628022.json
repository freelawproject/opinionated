As he concedes, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Sanchez also contends that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines contrary to the rule of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). Although there was an error, Sanchez has failed to a demonstrate a sufficient probability \u201cthat the district judge would have imposed a different sentence\u201d under advisory guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 733; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 502, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Sanchez thus fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights as he must do to meet the plain-error standard. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
