Davis, </em>No. 95-5378, 114 F.3d 1200, 1997 WL 251325 (11th Cir. May 8, 1997) (not published), we affirmed appellant Anthony Leon Davis\u2019s conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine. Thereafter, Davis moved the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied his motion, and we refused to grant a certificate of appealability. On July 29, 2004, Davis moved the court to dismiss the indictment (in the case that led to his conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine). Although Davis\u2019s motion stated that it was being filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, the district court treated the motion as a motion filed under \u00a7 2255 and dismissed it because Davis had not obtained leave of court as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(a) and 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Davis now appeals the court\u2019s ruling. We affirm. The court properly treated the motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Arj\">. The district court considered whether, before ruling on the motion, to advise Davis that it would treat the motion as having been filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). The court concluded that <em>Castro\u2019s </em>notice requirement only applies to a defendant\u2019s <em>first </em>collateral attack on his conviction or sentence pursuant to a motion that is not labeled a \u00a7 2255 motion. The instant motion was not Davis\u2019s first collateral attack on his conviction and sentence; hence, <em>Castro </em>notice was not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
