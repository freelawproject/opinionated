Evans argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system and in sentencing him based upon facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-26\">The two-level adjustment to Evans\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) violated his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, and the Government has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376-77 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Evans\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. Because it is necessary to vacate Evans\u2019s sentence based upon the Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error, we do not address Evans\u2019s argument that his sentencing pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme constitutes reversible error. <em>See Akpan, </em>407 F.3d at 377 n. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-27\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
