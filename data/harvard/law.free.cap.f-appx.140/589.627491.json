For the first time on appeal, he argues that the district court plainly erred when it increased his offense level based on his state-court conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">A state felony conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance is an aggravated felony for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes, even if the conviction is a misdemeanor under federal law. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943), does not change this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">Armendariz-Chavez also contends that the district court committed reversible plain error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S.--, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although the district court committed plain error when it sentenced Armendariz-Chavez pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>mandatory guidelines system, Armendariz-Chavez has not shown that the court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). Further, this court has rejected Armendariz-Chavez\u2019s argument that a <em>Booker </em>error or the application of the then mandatory guidelines is a structural error or is presumptively prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005)(same), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
