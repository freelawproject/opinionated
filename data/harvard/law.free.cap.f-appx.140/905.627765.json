Foster appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of her claims against the defendants, Savannah Communication (\u201cSC\u201d), the United States Army (\u201cArmy\u201d), McLlanham Auto-motives, Inc. (\u201cMcLlanham\u201d), and A <em>&amp; </em>E Electronic Company (\u201cA <em>&amp; </em>E\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Foster brought her claims under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729, <em>et seq. </em>Specifically, she alleged that she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>constructively discharged by her employer, the Army, for reporting fraud to her supervisors in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h), which is the whistleblower provision of the FCA. She also apparently sought to bring a <em>qui tam </em>action against the remaining three defendants (\u201cthe contractor defendants\u201d), who were allegedly involved in the fraud, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Foster raises two arguments on appeal. First, she argues that the district court erred in finding that her complaint was filed beyond the statute of limitations. Foster argues that she did her best to ensure that the complaint was filed in a timely manner. She notes that she mailed her complaint to the district court (admittedly with a request for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in lieu of the filing fee) two days before the statute of limitations expired and that the district court received it one day before it expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Second, Foster argues that the district court erred by alternatively dismissing her complaint for failure to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 3730(b)(2) for <em>qui tam </em>actions. She notes in particular that she \u201chad no knowledge of sealing a case.\u201d Each argument is addressed in turn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004). A motion to dismiss is granted only when the movant demonstrates \u201cbeyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim that would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201cThe standard of review for a motion to dismiss is the same for the appellate court as it was for the trial court.\u201d <em>Spain, </em>363 F.3d at 1187 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">Failure to Comply with Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">The applicable limitation period for an action brought under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730 is no \u201cmore than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731(b)(1). Generally, a statute of limitations defense is an affirmative defense that must be pled. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c). However, failure to comply with the statute of limitations may be raised on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), when failure to comply with the statute of limitations is plain on the face of the complaint. <em>AVCO Corp. v. Precision Air Parts, Inc., </em>676 F.2d 494, 495 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">In her complaint, Foster alleged that she complained of fraud and was constructively discharged by the Army on July 23, 1997. Foster could not have witnessed or had knowledge of any alleged fraudulent activity, such as submission of false claims, after that date. The record reflects that Foster\u2019s complaint was not filed until August 8, 2003, more than six years after the date on which her employment ended. Consequently, all of the acts of which Foster claims the contractor defendants took part occurred more than six years before Foster filed her complaint. Furthermore, Foster concedes that her complaint is untimely in light of the limitation period. Therefore, to the extent that Foster sought to bring a <em>qui tam </em>action against the contractor defendants, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>court did not err in finding that her complaint was barred by the six-year statute of limitations set forth at \u00a7 3731(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">To the extent that Foster sought relief under the anti-retaliation provision of the FCA, the most closely analogous state limitations period, rather than the six-year statute of limitations in the FCA, applies to her claim. <em>See Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2444, 2446, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014, \u2014 (2005). We do not address that issue here, however, because Foster never suggests, and our <em>de novo </em>review does not reveal, that the applicable period would be more than six years. Moreover, as noted above, Foster concedes that her filing was outside this period. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of her retaliation claim against the Army for failure to comply with the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Failure to Comply with Procedural Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">To maintain a <em>qui tam </em>action under the FCA, a private party must satisfy several procedural requirements. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(A), (b)(4)(B). Specifically, a private party must first bring the action in the name of the United States government and must have served upon the government \u201c[a] copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3730(b)(1) and (b)(2). The complaint also must be filed <em>\u201cin camera, </em>[and] shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\u201d \u00a7 3730(b)(2). Within 60 days of service, the government must choose either to \u201cintervene and proceed with the action,\u201d or notify the court that it declines to intervene, in which case the individual obtains the right to proceed with the <em>qui tam </em>action. \u00a7 3730(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">It is apparent from the face of Foster\u2019s complaint that she did not comply with any of the statutory requirements before filing her <em>qui tam </em>action. Foster\u2019s claims against the three contractor defendants were brought directly in the district court, were brought in her name, and were not filed under seal. Foster concedes her noncompliance with the procedural requirements of the FCA. Accordingly, after considering the parties\u2019 contentions, we find n\u00f3 abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s finding that she failed to comply with the procedural filing requirements for <em>qui tam </em>actions under the FCA as to the contractor defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-19\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Foster\u2019s complaint for failure to file within the statute of limitations, and, alternatively, for failure to comply with the procedural filing requirements of \u00a7 3730(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-14\">. Neither McLlanham nor A &amp; E are present on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\">. Foster further contends that the defendants failed to respond timely to her complaint and that therefore she should have received a default judgment against them. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s refusal to enter default judgments was not an abuse of discretion under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b938-13\">. We note that Foster\u2019s retaliation claim against the Army arose under \u00a7 3730(h). We decline to address whether the procedural requirements for a <em>qui tam </em>action were also applicable to Foster\u2019s retaliation claim, or whether noncompliance with such rules provides an additional basis for affirming the district court's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
