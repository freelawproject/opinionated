Bertineau challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that her application for asylum was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Bertineau\u2019s asylum application was not timely. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-24\">With regard to Bertineau\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in denying her application for withholding of removal, we conclude that substantial evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the BIA\u2019s determination that Bertineau did not meet her burden of establishing either past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution. <em>See Efe v.

Accordingly, she has waived the issue. <em>See Rodriguez v.
