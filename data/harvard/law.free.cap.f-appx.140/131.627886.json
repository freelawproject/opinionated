We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">According to the PSI, Holmes\u2019s Guidelines range, based on an adjusted offense level of 31 and a criminal history category VI, was 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the government moved for a downward departure, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, based on Holmes\u2019s substantial assistance and recommended that he be sentenced to a 200-month term of imprisonment. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion, but stated that it would mitigate the reduction in light of Holmes\u2019s criminal history and impose a 240-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">On appeal, Holmes argues that because he was sentenced under a mandatory Guidelines scheme that required the district court to consider only the career-offender sentencing range in determining the departure amount, he was sentenced based on an erroneous application of the Guidelines, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Holmes raised his <em>Booker </em>objection in the district court, we review this claim <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse only if any error was harmful. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">We have stated that two types of <em>Booker </em>error exist: constitutional error and non-constitutional, or statutory, error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). The latter type of error \u2014 the kind asserted here \u2014 is subject to a less demanding harmless-error standard than that for constitutional errors. <em>Id. </em>A \u201cnon-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted). Thus, in cases involving preserved <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional error, the government must show that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948^49 (holding that the government could not meet its burden under harmless error analysis because the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>indicated that had the guidelines been advisory, defendant\u2019s sentence would have been shorter); <em>see also United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cNon-constitutional error is harmless when it does not affect the substantial rights of the parties\u201d (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111)).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">After thorough review of all relevant parts of the record, including the sentencing transcript and the presentence investigation report, and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence, based on a mandatory application of the Guidelines, constituted harmless error. Pursuant to the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the district court reduced Holmes\u2019s sentence to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, specifically stating that it had \u201cto temper\u201d the government\u2019s requested reduction for a 200-month sentence to take into account Holmes\u2019s criminal history, which included many crimes of violence. Moreover, in response to Holmes\u2019s <em>Booker </em>objection, the district court stated that it believed that the sentence was \u201ca fair one,\u201d notwithstanding the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the court went on to note: \u201cI will tell you that, if freed from the guidelines, it\u2019s not clear to me that the sentence would be any less. In fact, I think there\u2019s a chance it would have been higher.\u201d On this record, it is clear that any <em>Booker </em>error resulting from the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion was harmless as the error did not affect the sentence, or had but a slight effect. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. Thus, this is not a case where the government has tried to satisfy its burden to show harmlessness by relying only on the district court\u2019s grant of a \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction. <em>Compare United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
