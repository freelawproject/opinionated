Morales has abandoned on appeal his argument that the district court\u2019s three-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(A) violated his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-23\">Morales renews his argument, preserved in the district court, that his constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>rights were violated when the district court assessed a three-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5), based on judicially determined facts, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the three-level increase violated Morales\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, and the Government has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Morales\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285-86 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
