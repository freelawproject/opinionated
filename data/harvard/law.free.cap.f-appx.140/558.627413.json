New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Reyes-Rodriguez acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-22\">He also argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system. After <em>Booker, </em>it is clear that application of the federal sentencing guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005). Reyes-Rodriguez\u2019s contention that this error is structural and gives rise to a presumption of prejudice is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 559-60 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Reyes-Rodriguez must show that the error affected his substantial rights, and he has not done so. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
