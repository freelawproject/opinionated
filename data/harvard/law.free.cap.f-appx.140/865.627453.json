Aleide filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief in support of his <em>Blakely </em>argument before he filed his objections to the magistrate judge's report. However, before the district court ruled on whether to allow Aleide to file a supplemental brief, Aleide attempted to file the supplemental brief, .followed by a motion, to correct that brief and a motion to strike those corrections. The district court subsequently denied Alcide\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief and, thus, Alcide\u2019s initial <em>Blakely </em>argument is found in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b895-28\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b895-29\">Federal prisoner Eriveau Alcide, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132,110 Stat. 1214 (1996), governs this appeal because Alcide filed his motion after the effective date of the AEDPA. Because in <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>F.3d 864 (11th Cir.2005) we determined that the rules announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) do not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Aleide, who is serving a 188-month sentence for a drug-related offense, filed this \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and various errors occurring at his plea colloquy and sentencing hearing. The magistrate judge recommended denial of Alcide\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Aleide timely filed various objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report that are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">In his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, Aleide argued that he is entitled to resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>According to the record, Aleide pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. The district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s findings in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and sentenced Aleide based on the conclusion that his offense involved 65 kilograms of cocaine. Aleide maintained that his sentence would be lower if the court resentenced him under the rule in <em>Blakely. </em>Aleide further argued that retroactivity of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and therefore <em>Blakely, </em>was not an issue in his case because his direct appeal was pending when <em>Apprendi </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The district court affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Alcide\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The court reasoned that it did not have authorization to hear Alcide\u2019s motion for resentencing because in <em>In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2004), we held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. Aleide appealed, and we granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following issues on appeal: (1) \u201c[w]hether <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and/or <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, [160] L.Ed.2d [621] (2005), are retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\u201d; and (2) \u201cif so, whether the district court properly denied appellant\u2019s claim that his sentence was improperly enhanced based on drug quantity?\u201d R1-27, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">On appeal, Aleide argues that the rules from <em>Booker </em>are not barred by the nonretroactivity doctrine set forth in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). Specifically, Aleide contends that, under a <em>Teague </em>analysis, the constitutional rule derived in <em>Booker </em>is not a new rule, but rather an extension of <em>Apprendi. </em>Even if the <em>Booker </em>constitutional rule is a new rule, Aleide argues that it is a \u201c \u2018watershed rule of criminal procedure\u2019 \u201d and, thus, it will not be barred by the <em>Teague </em>non-retroactivity doctrine. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 21. Additionally, Aleide argues that the rule regarding the advisory nature of the federal Sentencing Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>lines from Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion in <em>Booker </em>is similarly not barred by the nonretroactivity doctrine because that rule is a new substantive rule that must be applied retroactively on collateral review. Alcide further argues that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>apply retroactively on collateral review as a matter of law or, in the alternative, as reaffirmations of <em>Apprendi. </em>Alcide concedes, in conclusion, that <em>Varela </em>controls in his case but contends that his arguments are presented to us \u201cas a first time argument for review by this panel for future <em>en banc </em>consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and questions of fact for clear error when reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Varela, 400 F.3d </em>at 867 n. 3. <em>De novo </em>review also \u201capplies to the issue of whether a claim is barred by the non-retroactivity doctrine of <em>Teague.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The application of new rules of law to final convictions occurs only in limited circumstances. <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). New substantive rules of law generally apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 620-21, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1610, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). Such substantive rules include decisions narrowing the scope of criminal statutes or constitutional rulings that place persons or conduct beyond the power of the state to punish. <em>See Schriro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2522-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">New rules of criminal procedure, however, generally do not apply retroactively. <em>Id. </em>124 S.Ct. at 2523. In <em>Teague, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 310, 109 S.Ct. at 1076. The first <em>Teague </em>exception states that \u201ca new rule should be applied retroactively if it places [particular conduct] beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1076 (quotation omitted). The second <em>Teague </em>exception includes only new \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2523 (quotation omitted). To fit within the second exception, the new rule \u201cmust be one without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is <em>seriously </em>diminished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">We first addressed the question of whether <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review in <em>Varela.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The prisoner in <em>Varela </em>argued, as Alcide similarly argues in the instant ease, that the drug quantity upon which the district court based his sentence was neither admitted by him nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, as is required under <em>Apprendi. Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 866. The prisoner contended in <em>Varela, </em>as Alcide does here, that he was entitled to resentencing in light of the <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>line of decisions. <em>Id. </em>We determined that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Here, Alcide argues that the new <em>Booker </em>rule is a \u201cwatershed rule of criminal procedure\u201d and, as such, should apply retroactively to his case on collateral review. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 21-24. However, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>decided in <em>Varela, Booker\u2019s </em>new rule is not a \u201cwatershed rule of criminal procedure\u201d and does not retroactively apply to \u00a7 2255 cases. <em>Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 868. Alcide concedes that <em>Varela </em>controls in his case but contends that his arguments are presented to us \u201cas a first time argument for review by this panel for future <em>en banc </em>consideration.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17. Given that <em>Varela </em>is directly on-point in this case, we are bound by its decision. Because <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>do not apply retroactively on collateral review, we need not address the second question in Alcide\u2019s COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">It is noteworthy that in the district court\u2019s order denying Alcide\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the court relied on <em>In re Dean </em>for the proposition that it did not have the authority to hear Alcide\u2019s motion for resentencing because we held in <em>In re Dean </em>that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. While the court\u2019s ultimate determination that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review is correct, its reliance on <em>In re Dean </em>is misplaced. In <em>In re Dean, </em>the Applicant was seeking a grant of authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. <em>In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d at 1288. We held that <em>Blakely </em>could not be applied retroactively to support the application because the Supreme Court itself had not declared that <em>Blakely </em>applied retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. The <em>In re Dean </em>panel did not decide, however, whether <em>Blakely </em>applies retroactively in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See generally id. </em>In the instant case, Alcide is filing his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, not a second or successive motion. Therefore, our holding in <em>In re Dean </em>is not applicable to the instant case because the facts here are distinguishable from those in <em>In re Dean. </em>However, despite the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Dean, </em>we may still affirm its decision. <em>See Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1433 n. 9 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that \u201c[this Court] may affirm the district court\u2019s decision for reasons different than those stated by the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">In his first motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Alcide moves us to apply the rules announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>retroactively to his motion. We have previously held in <em>Varela v. United States, supra, </em>to the contrary and thus bound to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion, albeit on a somewhat different basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. We have also decided two cases raising the same issue since deciding <em>Varela. </em>In <em>Garfield v. United States, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 679 (11th Cir. 2005) and <em>Lundin v. United States, </em>131 Fed. Appx. 677 (11th Cir.2005), on facts similar to the instant case, we followed the rule in <em>Varela </em>and held that <em>Booker </em>did not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
