Reynolds, </em>61 Fed. Appx. 668 (11th Cir. Jan.31, 2003). On June 30, 2003, petitioner, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, moved the district court to set aside his convictions and resulting sentences on several grounds, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>eluding that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by operating under a conflict of interest because he advised petitioner to plead guilty, which petitioner did not wish to do. The court referred the motion to a magistrate judge who issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d) recommending that the motion be denied. Addressing the above ineffective assistance claim, the R &amp; R stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-4\">To the extent that [petitioner] argues that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to enter a guilty plea and testify against his codefendant, he has likewise failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief. In light of the overwhelming evidence against [petitioner], counsel\u2019s advice was not deficient, as it is possible that [petitioner] could have received the benefit of his assistance to the government. Moreover, [petitioner] chose not to follow counsel\u2019s advice and he proceeded to trial. Thus, he has not demonstrated prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">After the district court denied petitioner leave to amend his motion, it adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R and denied petitioner\u2019s motion. Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal. The district court denied petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. We, however, issued a certificate for the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address [petitioner\u2019s] claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for having a conflict of interest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">In his initial brief to us, petitioner did not address this issue. Instead, he briefed an issue unrelated to the issue we certified. He has therefore abandoned the certified issue and his appeal is due to be dismissed. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>273 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 979, 122 S.Ct. 1457, 152 L.Ed.2d 397 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
