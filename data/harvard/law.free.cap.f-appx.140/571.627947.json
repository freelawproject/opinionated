McDonald asserted that the sentence imposed exceeded the statutory maximum sentence for the offense to which he pleaded guilty based on judicially determined facts, in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction because the petition was in fact a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion filed without prior authorization from this court. As the district court determined, because McDonald\u2019s petition challenges errors that occurred at sentencing, it should have been brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). McDonald\u2019s argument that he is entitled to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because relief under that section is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d is unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 425 (holding that a claim under <em>Booker </em>does not fit within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AGh\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
