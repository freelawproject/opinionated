On appeal, Giovanardi argues, that the district court committed both constitutional and statutory errors, under <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it sentenced Giovanardi under a mandatory sentencing regime based on a drug quantity that was not found by a jury. Because the district court did not commit a constitutional error and its statutory error was harmless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">Giovanardi was indicted for possessing with intent to distribute \u201ca detectable amount\u201d of cocaine. Giovanardi sold to a government informant a total of 171.1 grams of cocaine \u2014 54.6 grams of cocaine on one occasion and 116.5 grams of cocaine on another occasion. Before trial, the government sent Giovanardi a \u201cNotice of Penalties, Elements, and Facts\u201d that alleged a drug quantity of approximately 171.1 grams purchased by the informant. Giovanardi did not object to that statement either before or during the hearing at which Giovanardi pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">At his sentencing hearing, Giovanardi objected on the ground that the indictment charged him only with possession of \u201ca detectable amount\u201d of cocaine and \u201ca detectable amount\u201d was the maximum drug quantity that the district court could employ in sentencing him. The district court overruled that objection and sentenced Giovanardi to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the high end of his Guideline range, because Giovanardi tested positive for cocaine use while out on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-19\">Giovanardi timely raised his objection, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), at his sentencing hearing. \u201cWhere there is a timely objection, we review the defendant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim in order to determine whether the error was harmless.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). As this Court discussed in <em>Mathenia, </em>\u201c[t]here are two harmless error standards. One of them applies to <em>Booker </em>constitutional errors, the other to <em>Booker </em>statutory errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The standard for constitutional error requires the government to show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The standard for statutory error requires us to determine whether the error either did not affect the sentence or only had a very slight effect. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004)). The standard of review for statutory error \u201cis not easy for the government to meet. It is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Giovanardi argues that the district court erroneously calculated his sentence based a drug quantity that was not charged in the indictment or found by a jury. Giovanardi contends that his 18-month sentence, which was based on a drug quantity of 171.1 grams of cocaine, is less advantageous than the sentence of zero to six months to which he was entitled. Giovanardi also argues that the district court committed statutory error, under <em>Booker, </em>when it sentenced him under the Sentencing Guidelines as a mandatory, not advisory, system.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Giovanardi\u2019s constitutional argument fails because he did not object to the factual statement of the government that included the drug quantity for which he was sentenced. Before the Supreme Court decided <em>Booker, </em>we stated that \u201ca stipulation to a specific drug quantity \u2014 whether as part of a written plea agreement, part of a jury trial, or at sentencing \u2014 serve[s] as the equivalent of a jury finding on that issue, since the stipulation takes the issue away from the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1271 (11th Cir.2001). <em>Booker </em>did not change that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">After <em>Booker, </em>we held that a sentence imposed based on facts that a defendant admitted was not constitutional error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Giovanardi did not object to the factual statement of the government, which included the allegation that Giovanardi possessed with the intent to distribute 171.1 grams of cocaine. The district court did not commit constitutional error when it sentenced Giovanardi based on that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Giovanardi\u2019s statutory argument also fails. After Giovanardi was sentenced in the district court, the Supreme Court determined \u201cthat the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). A statutory error was committed when the district court sentenced Giovanardi under a mandatory guidelines regime, but the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We can say with fair assurance that the statutory error had no effect on Giovanardi\u2019s sentence. In <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>the defendant was sentenced \u201cto the highest sentence available under the applicable guideline range, and [the district judge] considered sentencing Gallegos-Aguero ... the maximum allowable under the statute of conviction.\u201d 409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005). The statutory error was harmless because the defendant was sentenced on the high end of the Guideline range, <em>id., </em>and, as the Tenth Circuit stated, the district judge \u201cexercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>his limited discretion under the <em>^re-Booker </em>system to give [the defendant] the highest permissible sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Riccardi, </em>405 F.3d 852, 876 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The same facts are present here; the district court imposed the maximum sentence available under the mandatory Guidelines system and adequately explained its rationale for imposing that sentence. When asked by the federal public defender to impose a lenient sentence, the district court stated that the \u201crequest of a year and a day would normally seem like an appropriate sentence in this case. I\u2019m not going to accept it in this case. I\u2019m going to impose the maximum sentence under [the Guidelines because of the drugs while on bond.\u201d The district court further explained its rationale: \u201c[Mr. Giovanardi, y]ou need to realize for a number of factors you have to stop using drugs. You have a family and either this is the beginning of your criminal activity or the end of it. Your attorney says it\u2019s the end. I hope he\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The government has met its high burden. The statutory error was harmless because the district court sentenced Giovanardi at the high end of the Guideline range because of his positive test for cocaine while on bond awaiting trial. The use of advisory Guidelines would not have changed that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We conclude that the district court did not commit <em>Booker </em>constitutional error. We also conclude that, although the district court committed statutory error when it sentenced Giovanardi under a mandatory system, that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
