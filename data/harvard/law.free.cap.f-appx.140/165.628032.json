We deny the petition in part and dismiss the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-23\">Because the BIA adopted the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion, we review the Immigration Judge\u2019s analysis as if it were the analysis of the BIA. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal determinations of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAdministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this [C]ourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-24\">Derstila makes several arguments on appeal. Derstila argues (1) that BIA violated his due process rights when it summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge; (2) that the Immigration Judge and the BIA denied him due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>cess by distorting the evidence; (3) that the conduction of the hearing by the Immigration Judge constituted a denial of due process; and (4) that it was an abuse of discretion for the Immigration Judge and BIA to deny his application for asylum or withholding of removal. None of Dertsila\u2019s arguments have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Derstila\u2019s arguments that the BIA and Immigration Judge denied him due process fail. First, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Derstila\u2019s claim that the Immigration Judge denied him due process, because Derstila did not raise this argument before the BIA. <em>Asencio v. I.N.S., </em>37 F.3d 614, 616 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Second, under Federal Regulations a single member of the BIA may affirm, without opinion, the decision of the Immigration Judge if the Board member determines that any error was harmless and immaterial. <em>Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1342. There is no entitlement to a full opinion by the BIA, and the issuance of a summary affirmance does not demonstrate a lack of due process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Derstila\u2019s argument that the BIA and Immigration erred in denying his application for asylum or withholding of removal also fails. The Immigration Judge found Derstila to be \u201cless than credible.\u201d Notwithstanding that finding, the Immigration Judge also found that Derstila had not suffered past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. The Immigration Judge found that Derstila\u2019s arrests by the police and mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution, and that improved country conditions along with the continued residence of Derstila\u2019s father in Albania diminished the possibility of any future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility determination. The Immigration Judge detailed numerous inconsistencies between Derstila\u2019s sworn statement made at the airport, his testimony, and the documentary evidence. Derstila contradicted his own testimony at his hearing and also testified at his hearing in flat contradiction to his sworn statement to the asylum officer. \u201cThis [Cjourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. In the light of the record supporting the credibility finding of the Immigration Judge, we need not address the alternative finding of the Immigration Judge that Derstila\u2019s alleged mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Derstila\u2019s arguments regarding withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT also fail. An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThis standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum.... [Bjecause [Derstila] cannot meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, it is <em>a fortiori </em>that he cannot meet the withholding of removal standard.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">To obtain withholding of removal under the CAT, the burden is on the applicant to establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Because Derstila did not show that he \u201cmore likely than not\u201d would be tortured upon his return to Albania, he cannot establish eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
