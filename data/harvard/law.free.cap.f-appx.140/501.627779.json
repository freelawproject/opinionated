Mandamus is a drastic remedy, which will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir. 1987) The party seeking mandamus relief has the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate avenue of relief and that his right to the relief sought is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980); <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Because Mills has other means of challenging his prison conditions, we find that he has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-20\">Accordingly, we deny Mills\u2019 petition. We dispense with oral argument, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
