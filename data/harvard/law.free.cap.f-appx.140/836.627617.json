California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Crenshaw\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">In 1992, Crenshaw was resentenced to concurrent sentences of 160 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release, for committing aggravated sexual assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a), and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Crenshaw\u2019s conditions of release included that he (1) not commit another federal, state, or local crime; (2) answer truthfully all inquires by, and follow the instructions of, his probation officer; and (3) participate in a program of testing and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. In July 2002, Crenshaw was released from incarceration and began serving his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">In July 2003, the government filed a \u201cpetition for warrant or summons for of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>fender under supervision,\u201d based on the following alleged violations: (1) being arrested on July 8, 2003, in Cedar Hill, Texas, on a state charge of assault with bodily injury to his wife, Ann Crenshaw; (2) repeatedly calling Ann Crenshaw after his probation officer instructed him not to have further contact with her; and (3) failing to participate in a court-ordered drug-treatment program. During Crenshaw\u2019s preliminary revocation hearing, the magistrate judge informed him (1) of the nature of the alleged violations; (2) that he had a right to counsel; and (3) that the court had appointed for him Charles Jones, the attorney who had represented Crenshaw during his trials on the underlying offenses. After Crenshaw stipulated to probable cause and waived his preliminary hearing, the court set the proceeding for a final revocation hearing on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">At the beginning of this final revocation hearing, Crenshaw\u2019s counsel informed the court that Crenshaw \u201cwants to no longer have me as his lawyer.\u201d After asking Crenshaw\u2019s counsel to remain in the courtroom, the court summarized the extent of his counsel\u2019s prior representation of Crenshaw and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">So Mr. Jones is probably more familiar with this case than anybody ever anywhere. So, if you will remain inside the courtroom in the event I have to ask you some question, Mr. Jones, I would appreciate it. Mr. Crenshaw has rejected his service here this morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The government then presented testimony by Ann Crenshaw and another witness on facts supporting the assault charge. After being given the opportunity to question each of these witnesses, Crenshaw declined. Richard Bruner, a police officer with the Cedar Hill Police Department who responded to Ann Crenshaw\u2019s assault report, also testified as to how Ann Crenshaw appeared when he arrived at the scene of the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the government introduced the testimony of Steven Gray, Crenshaw\u2019s probation officer, which included that (1) another probation officer instructed Crenshaw not to have any contact with Ann Crenshaw after his arrest on the Texas offense; (2) phone records reflected that Crenshaw subsequently had called Ann Crenshaw\u2019s cell-phone number from his jail cell; and (3) Crenshaw had missed multiple appointments the court had ordered him to attend as part of his drug-treatment program. Crenshaw also declined to cross-examine Officer Bruner and Officer Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">At the close of the government\u2019s evidence, the court stated to Crenshaw that his appointed counsel still was in the courtroom, that this counsel was familiar with the case, and that Crenshaw had the right to testify. Crenshaw responded that he did not wish to testify. When the court asked Crenshaw if he wished to consult with his appointed counsel, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-10\">Crenshaw: I have spoken with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-11\">The court: Do you wish to talk to him now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-12\">Crenshaw: I don\u2019t know if he have (sp.) anything different to tell me than he already has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-13\">The court: Of course, I cannot ask you or him what he told you. So, I will not ask you that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">Crenshaw: Well, basically it was that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-15\">The court: No, don\u2019t tell me. Just talk to him a minute there. Mr. Jones, would you come here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Jones: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">The court: I wanted him to know if you had anything you wanted to tell him or he wanted to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">Jones: Well, I talked to him over there. And he said he wanted to change lawyers. And I said I would be happy to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">The court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\">Jones: I still would be happy to change lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">The court: I there anything else, Mr. Crenshaw, you want to talk to him about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">Crenshaw: Well, I asked him if he was familiar with this process, because he said I was facing ten years on a violation of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-11\">The court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">Crenshaw: Ten years, I mean, like, you know, I didn\u2019t expect to be facing such for that. So, I really, you know, didn\u2019t know if he was really aware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">The court: Now, you had a hearing before the [mjagistrate [jjudge. And you had a magistrate judge out in Texas; did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">Crenshaw: Yes sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-15\">The court: All right. The [cjourt is going to make certain findings at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">After summarizing the evidence that the government had presented during the hearing, the court found that Crenshaw had violated the conditions of his supervised release, as set forth in the petition for revocation. When the court gave Crenshaw the opportunity to allocute, he stated that (1) he had not \u201ckidnaped\u201d Ann Crenshaw, (2) his name was on the lease of the residence at which the assault occurred, and (3) his wife had first initiated contact after Crenshaw was ordered not to have contact with her. The court, without objection, ultimately revoked Crenshaw\u2019s supervised release and sentence him to a total term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">Crenshaw argues on appeal that the district court denied him his right to appointed counsel because, after he asserted at his preliminary revocation hearing that he wished to be represented by counsel, he did not effectively relinquish that right when his appointed counsel informed the court that Crenshaw no longer wanted his representation. Crenshaw contends that a constitutionally valid waiver of counsel, instead, requires evidence in the record showing that the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself is \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d Crenshaw also asserts that he did not have the assistance of standby counsel for the majority of the hearing, and that the record reflects that he and his appointed counsel had some type of conflict. Finally, Crenshaw argues that, even if we were to conclude that he effectively waived his right to counsel, the district court committed a <em>per se </em>error by failing to warn him about the dangers or risks of proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">We ordinarily review a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel is valid \u2014 that it is knowing, voluntary, and <em>intelligent </em>\u2014 de <em>novo. United States v. Kimball, </em>291 F.3d 726, 730 (11th Cir.2002). Under this review, we examine \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s age, health, and education; (2) the defendant\u2019s contact with lawyers prior to trial; (3) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the charges and possible defenses and penalties; (4) the defendant\u2019s understanding of the rules of evidence, procedure and courtroom decorum; (5) the defendant\u2019s experience in criminal trials; (6) whether standby counsel was appointed and, if so, the extent to which standby counsel aided in the trial; (7) any mistreatment or coercion of the defendant; and (8) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>defendant was attempting to manipulate the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">However, when a defendant raises an argument for the first time on appeal, such as in the instant case, our review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder plain error review, which is authorized by Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), federal appellate courts have only a limited power to correct errors that were forfeited because they were not timely raised in the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270-71 (internal quotations and marks omitted). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARk\">we may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.... Even then, we will exercise our discretion to rectify the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1271 (internal quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The Supreme Court has determined that revocation proceedings are not a part of a criminal prosecution. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (parole revocation); <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759-60, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (probation revocation). However, a defendant facing possible revocation of supervised release, \u201calthough not entitled to all of the procedural protections afforded a defendant in a criminal proceeding, is entitled to certain [due process] protections.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 414 (11th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 480-82, 92 S.Ct. at 2599-2601; <em>Gagnon, </em>411 U.S. at 782-91, 93 S.Ct. at 1760-64).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In <em>Gagnon, </em>the Supreme Court specifically addressed whether an indigent defendant has a due process right to be represented by appointed counsel at a revocation hearing. <em>Gagnon, </em>411 U.S. at 783, 93 S.Ct. at 1760. The Court ultimately declined to adopt an absolute rule in <em>Gagnon, </em>and, instead, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">We thus find no justification for a new inflexible constitutional rule with respect to the requirement of counsel. We think, rather, that the decision as to the need for counsel must be made on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the state authority charged with responsibility for administering the probation and parole system. Although the presence and participation of counsel will probably be both undesirable and constitutionally unnecessary in most revocation hearings, there will remain certain cases in which fundamental fairness \u2014 the touchstone of due process \u2014 will require that the State provide at its expense counsel for indigent probationers or parolees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 790, 93 S.Ct. at 1763. Moreover, the <em>Gagnon </em>Court explained that, although \u201cit [was] neither possible nor prudent to formulate a precise and detailed set of requirements,\u201d counsel presumptively should be appointed only in cases where the defendant, after being told of his right to counsel, (1) requests counsel, and (2) either (a) claims that he did not commit the alleged violation; or (b) argues that substantial reasons, which are complex or otherwise difficult to present, make revocation inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 790, 93 S.Ct. at 1764.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Here, the magistrate judge initially appointed Jones as Crenshaw\u2019s counsel, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>parently before Crenshaw requested such an appointment. However, after Crenshaw\u2019s counsel informed the court at Crenshaw\u2019s final revocation hearing that Crenshaw did not wish to be represented by his appointed counsel, the court did not appoint him other counsel. Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Gagnon, </em>Crenshaw did not concede at his final revocation hearing that he committed the alleged violations. On the other hand, he neither requested alternative counsel, nor argued that he (1) did not commit the alleged violations, or (2) was justified in acting based on substantial reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Nevertheless, even assuming that error occurred, Crenshaw, who carries the burden of proof under the third prong of plain-error standard of review, has failed to show how this error affected his substantial rights. In making such a showing, the defendant normally must prove that the error \u201cmust have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and marks <em>omitted),cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). \u201cThe standard for showing that is the familiar reasonable probability of a different result formulation, which means a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and marks omitted). \u201c[Wjhere the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate \u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Here, the magistrate advised Crenshaw of the nature of his violations and his right to be represented by appointed counsel at his preliminary revocation hearing. Crenshaw conceded during his final revocation hearing that he had discussed his case with his appointed counsel before the hearing had commenced. Moreover, during this final revocation hearing, the court gave Crenshaw the opportunity to cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses, present evidence, and to confer with his appointed counsel, who the court had ordered to remain in the courtroom. Because Crenshaw has failed to explain, and the record does not reflect, how he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to appoint him alternative counsel, he has failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice, and no plain error occurred. <em>See Peters, </em>403 F.3d at 1270-71; <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Furthermore, we have concluded that \u201ceven plain[-]error review is unavailable in cases where a criminal defendant \u2018invites\u2019 the constitutional error of which he complains.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1289 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA defendant who invites error may not cite that error as a basis for reversal on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Dicks, </em>338 F.3d 1256, 1258 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1200, 124 S.Ct. 1462, 158 L.Ed.2d 118 (2004). As discussed above, after Crenshaw\u2019s appointed counsel informed the court that Crenshaw was declining his representation, neither he nor Crenshaw, himself, moved the court to appoint alternative counsel, or objected to Crenshaw proceeding <em>pro se. </em>Thus, if any error occurred, it was invited and is not reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">Finally, to the extent Crenshaw is arguing that the court erred in not warning him of the dangers of proceeding without counsel, the Supreme Court determined in <em>Faretta </em>that the Sixth Amendment affords criminal defendants the right to defend themselves if they so desire. <em>Id., </em>422 U.S. at 816-21, 95 S.Ct. at 2532-34. However, the <em>Faretta </em>Court also recognized that \u201cin most criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>prosecutions defendants [can] better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834, 95 S.Ct. at 2540. Thus, the Court concluded that, before a defendant is allowed to waive the assistance of counsel, he \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541 (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Moreover, we have discussed that the \u201cideal method\u201d of assuring that a defendant understands the consequences of a waiver is for the trial court to conduct a pretrial hearing, at which the court \u201cshould inform the defendant of the nature of the charges against him, the possible punishments, basic trial procedure and the hazards of representing himself.\u201d <em>Kimball, </em>291 F.3d at 730 (citing <em>United States v. Cash, </em>47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir. 1995)). \u201cThe purpose of this hearing is to allow judges to determine whether the defendant understands the risks of self-representation.\u201d <em>Kimball, </em>291 F.3d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">However, an error must be \u201cplain\u201d for this Court to conclude that plain error occurred. <em>See Peters, </em>403 F.3d at 1270. \u201cPlain error is, by its terms, error which is so obvious and substantial that it should not have been permitted by the trial court even absent the defendant\u2019s timely assistance in detecting it.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>402 F.3d 1303, 1322 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-1390 (U.S. April 15, 2005). \u201c[W]here neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has concluded that the procedure outlined in <em>Faretta </em>should be applied to proceedings involving the revocation of supervised release. Indeed, as discussed above, a person facing the revocation of supervised release is not entitled to all of the procedural protections afforded a defendant in a criminal proceeding. <em>See Copeland, </em>20 F.3d at 414. Thus, the court did not plainly err in failing to conduct a <em>Faretta </em>hearing before proceeding with Crenshaw\u2019s revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in either (1) granting Crenshaw\u2019s oral motion to proceed without his appointed counsel, or (2) allowing Crenshaw to proceed <em>pro se </em>without first advising him pursuant to <em>Faretta. </em>We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Crenshaw\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\">. After Crenshaw's final revocation hearing, the district court relieved Crenshaw\u2019s appointed counsel of any further representation. However, on Crenshaw\u2019s motion, we appointed new counsel to represent him on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-12\">. We reversed Crenshaw\u2019s original conviction, based on an erroneous evidentiary ruling by the trial court, and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>See United States v. Hines, </em>955 F.2d 1449 (11th Cir.1992). After a jury again convicted Crenshaw and the court reimposed the sentence outlined above, we affirmed Crenshaw\u2019s conviction in an unpublished opinion. <em>See United States v. Hines, 4 </em>F.3d 1000 (11th Cir. Sept.16, 1993) (unpub.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">.

Although <em>Gagnon </em>involved the revocation of probation, we have concluded that the analy^ sis of the revocation proceedings relating to probation and supervised release are \"essentially the same.\u201d <em>See United States v.
