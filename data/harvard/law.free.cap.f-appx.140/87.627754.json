Gonzalez-Quintero also petitions for review of the final order of the BIA that affirms the IJ\u2019s determination that she abandoned her application for a waiver of deportability under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996) (\u201c212(c) waiver\u201d) and withholding of deportation under former INA \u00a7 234(h) (1996) (now INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)) because she failed to file those applications by the ordered date. On appeal, Gonzalez-Quintero argues that the IJ and the BIA violated her due process rights in determining that she abandoned her applications for the 212(c) waiver and withholding of deportation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Before reaching the merits of GonzalezQuintero\u2019s petition, we must consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). We also review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo </em>and will defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). \u2018We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo.\u201d Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 352 </em>F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">The transitional rules provide that \u201cthere shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in ... [former] section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D).\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G). \u201cNotwithstanding this restriction, this Court retains jurisdiction to determine whether an alien is deportable under the immigration statute.\u201d <em>Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. Our authority to review exists only to determine whether a petitioner is \u201c(1) an alien (2) deportable (3) by reason of a criminal offense listed in the statute.\u201d <em>Id.; Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002). If these conditions are met, then IIRIRA \u00a7 309(e)(4)(G) divests us of our jurisdiction to review the deportation order. <em>Garcia, </em>329 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">According to former INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after entry is deportable.\u201d Furthermore, according to former INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(B)\u00ae,\u2019 \u201c[a]ny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of ... any law or regulation of ... the United States ... is deportable.\u201d Because the IJ found and the BIA affirmed that Gonzalez-Quintero was deportable under both of these provisions, IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>implicated. <em>See Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1215 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Despite the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G), we retain jurisdiction to review \u201csubstantial constitutional questions raised by a petitioner on direct review.\u201d <em>Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1322. We also retain jurisdiction over questions of law raised in a petition for review. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005) (\u201cREAL ID Act\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The administrative record supports the conclusion that Gonzalez-Quintero is \u201c(1) an alien (2) deportable (3) by reason of a criminal offense listed in the statute.\u201d <em>See Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. During her deportation hearing, Gonzalez-Quintero conceded that she was a native and citizen of Colombia. She did not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that she was an alien before the BIA, nor does she do so before this Court. Moreover, Gonzalez-Quintero admitted during her deportation hearing\u2014 and admits before this Court \u2014 that she was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of \u201cCDS: heroin and cocaine,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. As ordered by the IJ and affirmed by the BIA, this conviction was sufficient to deport Gonzalez-Quintero under either former \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) (conviction for aggravated felony) or former \u00a7 241(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (conviction for violating a law of the United States). Thus, Gonzalez-Quintero is an alien deportable under either former \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) or former \u00a7 241(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Gonzalez-Quintero also concedes that, because she has been convicted of an offense covered under former INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), and is therefore an alien deportable under either former \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) or former \u00a7 241(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) limits this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over her appeal. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to address the merits of her petition for review, except to the extent she raises any substantial constitutional issues or questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">II. Substantial Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Gonzalez-Quintero raises two due process claims. Due process requires that all aliens be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in their deportation proceedings. Fern<em>andez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cIn order to establish a due process violation, an alien must show that he or she was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted error caused [her] substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>329 F.3d at 1222 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">A. 212(c) Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">Gonzalez-Quintero argues on appeal that the IJ and BIA violated her due process rights in holding that she abandoned her application for a discretionary 212(c) wavier and in failing to hold a hearing on the issue. \u201c[T]his Court has held that the failure to receive discretionary relief in the immigration context does not deprive an alien of a constitutionally protected liberty\u2019interest.\u201d <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1300 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, \u201can alien has no constitutionally-protected right to discretionary relief or to be eligible for discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Oguejiofor v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>277 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.2002). Because a 212(c) wavier is discretionary relief from deportation, and an alien has no constitutional right to relief, Gonzalez-Quintero\u2019s argument does not constitute a substantial constitutional question. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>B. Withholding of Deportation</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Gonzalez-Quintero also argues on appeal that the IJ and BIA violated her due process rights in holding that she abandoned her request for withholding of deportation by filing her asylum application after the ordered deadline. Unlike a 212(c) waiver, \u201cwithholding of removal [or deportation], where warranted, is a mandatory and not a discretionary remedy.\u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1265 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The IJ \u201cmay set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and related documents and responses thereto, if any. If an application or document is not filed within the time set by the [IJ], the opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We have not addressed whether an IJ violates an alien\u2019s due process rights when the IJ finds that the alien\u2019s failure to file an asylum application by the ordered deadline results in an abandonment or waiver of the alien\u2019s request for withholding of deportation. However, in a similar case, <em>Kuschchak v. Aschroft, </em>366 F.3d 597, 604-06 (7th Cir.2004), the Seventh Circuit held that the IJ did not violate the alien\u2019s due process rights in finding that the alien abandoned his withholding of removal application. The IJ advised the alien of the deadline to file any documents, but the alien ignored it; any confusion in relation to the application was due to the alien and his attorney \u2014 not to the IJ; and the alien failed to show prejudice, i.e., that the IJ\u2019s actions had the potential for affecting the outcome of the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Likewise, in the instant case, the IJ informed Gonzalez-Quintero that she must file an asylum application before he could consider the relief of withholding of deportation. The IJ scheduled GonzalezQuintero\u2019s next deportation hearing for approximately one year later and notified Gonzalez-Quintero of her asylum application deadline, which was approximately one month before the next hearing. He also asked whether she had any questions, and she replied, through counsel, that she had none. The IJ also sent GonzalezQuintero written notice of her next deportation hearing, and reminded her that her application was due. Thus, any confusion in relation to the application deadline was due to Gonzalez-Quintero or her attorney, not the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Moreover, Gonzalez-Quintero has not demonstrated, or even argued, that the determination that she abandoned her application for withholding of deportation prejudiced her. She has not presented any evidence or arguments that the outcome of the hearing would have been different had the IJ considered her untimely application. Accordingly, GonzalezQuintero cannot establish a due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">III. Question of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Gonzalez-Quintero also argues that her 212(c) waiver application should have been considered \u201cfiled\u201d when she submitted it, despite the fact that she had not paid her filing fees. However, the immigration regulations mandate that a fee receipt or a fee waiver form accompany the application for the application to be considered filed with the immigration court. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(b). Gonzalez-Quintero had not paid her filing fee, nor had she requested a fee waiver, when she initially submitted her 212(c) waiver application. Therefore, her application was not considered filed when she submitted it to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">Accordingly, because Gonzalez-Quintero has raised no substantial constitutional ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>guments or questions of law that affect our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s deportation order, we dismiss her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">. Because Gonzalez-Quintero\u2019s deportation proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, and the BIA issued the final deportation order after October 30, 1996, this case is governed by the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\"IIRIRA\u201d). <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1276 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
