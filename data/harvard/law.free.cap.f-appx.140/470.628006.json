Hurst had sought in the bankruptcy court a ruling invalidating a debt that resulted from a criminal judgment against him in a Delaware County Court. We have reviewed the record and the lower courts\u2019 opinions and orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Hurst v. Wilkins, </em>Nos. CA-04-1357; BK-03-15031-SSM; AP-04-1023-SSM (E.D.Va. Feb. 1, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
