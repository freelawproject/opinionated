As discussed below, we dismiss the appeal, deny Petitioners\u2019 motions for summary judgment and attorney\u2019s fees, and grant respondent\u2019s motion for sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38 in the amount of $3,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">In February 2001, Petitioners filed their 1998 federal income tax return. On that return, they reported all zeros, except they claimed a refund of $5,115 for withholding amounts. The IRS, having determined that Petitioners owed $15,267 in tax, $2,538 for filing late, and $2,030 in aceuracy-related penalties, issued a notice of deficiency. After an administrative hearing requested by Petitioners under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330, the IRS notified Petitioners that it had determined that their arguments were frivolous and the IRS proposal to collect the tax by levy was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">In February of 2004, Petitioners requested review of that determination by the Tax Court under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The petition argued, in essence, that the IRS has no authority to impose or collect taxes. The Tax Court granted the IRS\u2019s motion to dismiss, ordering that the IRS could proceed with the proposed levy, and ordering Petitioners to pay the United States $5,000 in sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">Petitioners filed a motion to vacate the order and decision in May of 2004, which the Tax Court denied. In August of that year, Petitioners filed an untimely motion for reconsideration of the order and decision of the Tax Court, which also was denied. In November of 2004 Petitioners filed an untimely notice of the instant appeal. In their brief, they advance essentially the same arguments presented to the Tax Court. Specifically, they argue that they are \u201cnot subject to formal procedures of rules and law, unless the [Cjcourt declares that Petitioners are slaves of the government\u201d and that they are \u201cSuperior Sovereigns not subject to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">Petitioners\u2019 failure to file a timely notice of appeal is fatal to our jurisdiction. Petitioners had 90 days from the date of the decision of the Tax Court, May 13, 2004, to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7483. The appeal period was tolled under Fed. R.App. P. 13(a)(2) until May 21, 2004, the date the Tax Court denied Petitioners\u2019 timely motion to vacate the decision. Petitioners\u2019 untimely motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>for reconsideration did not further toll the filing period. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 13(a)(2) (providing tolling for a <em>\u201ctimely </em>motion to vacate or revise the Tax Court\u2019s decision\u201d (emphasis added)). Consequently, the 90-day filing period expired on August 19, 2004. By the time Petitioners filed a notice of the instant appeal in November, the decision of the Tax'Court was no longer subject to review. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7481(a)(1). In any event, the arguments raised by Petitioners have at all times been frivolous and without merit, and we decline to entertain those arguments here. <em>See Crain v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>737 F.2d 1417, 1417 (5th Cir.1984)(\u201c[R]efut[ing] these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent ... might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Accordingly, the case is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees and motion for summary judgment are DENIED. Respondent\u2019s motion for sanctions under Rule 38 is GRANTED in the amount of $3,500.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
