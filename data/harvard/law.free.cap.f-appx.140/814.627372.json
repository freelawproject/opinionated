Barreto appeals his 27-month sentence for wire fraud and argues that we should remand his case for resentencing because he was sentenced by the district court under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime. Barreto preserved this argument, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in the district court. The government has conceded on appeal that it cannot prove that the error of sentencing Barreto under a mandatory regime was harmless, and we, therefore, vacate Barre-to\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-23\">Barreto was indicted in the Southern District of Florida for one count of wire fraud. Barreto pleaded guilty to that charge, and the district court sentenced him to 27 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. That sentence was at the low end of the suggested 27-33 month Guideline range. Barreto was also ordered to repay the fraudulently obtained money and prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,929,210 in restitution. Barreto does not challenge on appeal the restitution imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-24\">Barreto, under <em>Blakely, </em>objected to the presentence investigation report. The district court overruled Barreto\u2019s objections and sentenced him under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines that were used by district courts before <em>Booker. </em>Barreto contends that the district court erred, under <em>Booker, </em>when it did not treat the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory during his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-25\">\u201cWhere there is a timely objection, we review the defendant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim in order to determine whether the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>No. 04-15250, 409 F.3d 1289, 2005 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>1201455, at *2 (11th Cir. May 23, 2005). As this Court discussed in <em>Mathenia, </em>\u201c[t]here are two harmless error standards. One of them applies to <em>Booker </em>constitutional errors, the other to <em>Booker </em>statutory errors.\u201d <em>Id, </em>The second standard, for statutory error, applies here, and that standard requires us to determine whether the error either did not affect the sentence or only had a slight effect. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004)). The standard of review for statutory error \u201cis not easy for the government to meet. It is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The government concedes that it cannot sustain its burden of proving that the effect of the statutory error on Barreto\u2019s sentence was harmless. We must, therefore, remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Barreto\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and we REMAND this case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
