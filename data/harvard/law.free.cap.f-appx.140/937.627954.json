He was previously convicted for: (1) conspiracy to commit robbery (of Burger King and Anthony\u2019s Pizza restaurants) (count one), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; (2) robbery of Leticia Martinez, a Burger King employee, and Henry Lee Ryans, an Anthony\u2019s Pizza employee (counts two and four), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; (3) using and carrying a firearm during the crime of violence in count two (count three), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1); and (4) assault with intent to murder Henry Lee Ryans (count six), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Williamson argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to modify his term of imprisonment. He claims that pursuant to amendment 599 to the sentencing guidelines, the seven-level enhancement for discharging a firearm that the district court imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A), should be removed. Williamson claims that the robberies of the Burger King and the Anthony\u2019s Pizza were a continuing series of crimes, and he should have been charged only with one count of robbery. He also asserts that because the robbery took place in the same building, the seven-level enhancement should not have been applied, especially since he had been convicted for using a firearm, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Williamson argues that the same firearm was used in all of the crimes, and, therefore, the seven-level enhancement was imposed for the same firearm that he was charged for using under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Moreover, for the first time on this appeal, Williamson argues that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, because the seven-point enhancement was imposed for conduct that he did not admit to and the jury did not find, as required by <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Id. citing Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a modification of a term of imprisonment if, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>sentencing, the Sentencing Commission lowers the sentencing range pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 599, which became effective on November 1, 2000, addresses the circumstances under which a court may impose a weapons enhancement on a defendant who was convicted of a firearms offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>2000 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, Appendix C.; <em>see also United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1176 (11th Cir.2003). The portion of amendment 599 that Williamson relies upon for his reduction of sentence states, in pertinent part, \u201c[i]f a sentence under this guidelines is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d 2000 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, Appendix C. However, \u201c... if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In this case, Williamson was sentenced in a manner later contemplated by amendment 599, and therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Williamson\u2019s motion to modify his term of imprisonment. First, Williamson committed two separate robberies \u2014 one of the Burger King, and the second of the Anthony\u2019s Pizza, and he pled guilty to both of them. Accordingly, his argument that there should have been only one count of robbery is without merit. Second, the district court only considered the robbery of the Burger King to be the crime of violence underlying Williamson\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Third, the seven-point firearm enhancement was imposed only on the counts underlying the Anthony\u2019s Pizza robbery, as contemplated by amendment 599. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Williamson\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from us before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944-45 (11th Cir.2005). Such an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion based on <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>does not meet the statutory criteria since we have held that the Supreme Court has not made <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker </em>retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2004) (Blakely); <em>In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The record reveals that Williamson filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in 1998, which was denied as time-barred. Accordingly, the merits of his <em>Booker </em>claim raised for the first time cannot be reviewed on this appeal, and the only avenue available to Williamson is to ask our permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. However, such an application would be denied because we have held that the Supreme Court has not made <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker </em>retroactively applicable on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
