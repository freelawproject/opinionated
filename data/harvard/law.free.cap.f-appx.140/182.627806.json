The district court denied Gerrow\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, but granted her request for a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following issue: \u201cwhether [her] constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel was violated where [her] trial attorney did not appeal the enhancement of her base offense level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Gerrow now raises two issues: (1) whether her counsel was ineffective in appealing the imposition of the firearm enhancement, and (2) whether her counsel was ineffective for telling her that she was ineligible for a safety-valve reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Gerrow asserts the record did not indicate she knew of her codefendant\u2019s possession of a firearm, and the firearm enhancement should not have been imposed because her codefendant\u2019s possession of the firearm was not reasonably foreseeable to her. She admits she raised this issue on direct appeal, but she contends that, because we did not specifically address the issue, the law of the case doctrine does not preclude her from presenting this issue again.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Gerrow asserted her claim regarding the firearm enhancement on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 833 n. 1 (11th Cir.2000), and, thus, this issue cannot be re-litigated in a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, <em>see United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 2000). However, Gerrow also challenges, and the COA permits, an appeal regarding the effectiveness of her counsel in raising this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">On appeal <em>from </em>a denial of a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review. <em>Greene v. United States, </em>880 F.2d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.1989). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Gerrow must show that: (1) her counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable assistance, and (2) there is a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different but for her counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, i.e., counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">A review of our opinion in Gerrow\u2019s direct appeal reveals Gerrow\u2019s counsel challenged the imposition of the firearm enhancement, and we summarily affirmed as to this issue, under 11th Circuit Rule 36-1. <em>Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d at 833 n. 1. Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ing in the record or in our opinion indicates Gerrow\u2019s counsel did not adequately raise the argument regarding the firearm enhancement on direct appeal. Rather, after considering the argument, we elected to summarily affirm as to this issue under 11th Circuit Rule 36-1. Gerrow has not shown how her counsel\u2019s performance in relation to this issue fell below an objective standard of reasonable assistance. <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064, 2068. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gerrow\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-16\">. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), governs this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. Gerrow made no mention of her counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance in relation to the safety-valve provision in her \u00a7 2255 motion before the district court, and cannot raise this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1994) (refusing to consider arguments not raised in the district court with certain exceptions which do not apply here). Furthermore, the COA limited the issue on appeal to \u201cwhether Gerrow\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel was violated where [her] trial attorney did not appeal the enhancement of her base offense level.\u201d The safety-valve provision is <em>not an </em>enhancement, but a mechanism that permits a defendant subject to a statutory mandatory minimum to be sentenced within the guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). Accordingly, this issue is beyond the scope of the COA issued by the district court, which permitted Gerrow to appeal only her claims regarding ineffective assistance in regards to sentencing enhancements, and, therefore, this issue is not properly before us. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
