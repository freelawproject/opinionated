Shobert appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Employee Benefits Administrative Committee of the Employees\u2019 Retirement Plan of USEC, Inc. (\u201cCommittee\u201d) summary judgment (No. 05-1122) and the district court\u2019s order denying Shobert\u2019s motion for other relief requesting reconsideration of its order denying Shobert\u2019s motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal (No. 05-1528). The Committee has filed a motion to dismiss Shobert\u2019s appeal in No. 05-1122 for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal challenging the district court\u2019s order granting the Committee summary judgment was not timely filed. We grant the Committee\u2019s motion to dismiss No. 05-1122 and affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Shobert\u2019s motion for other relief in No. 05-1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-28\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment order granting summary judgment was entered on the docket on November 22, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on January 21, 2005. Because Shobert failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant the Committee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Further, this court reviews the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>NOW v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995). Because Shobert\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely and because she failed to demonstrate excusable neglect, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion for other relief, which, like her motion for extension of time, argued only that the time for appeal should be extended under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order in No. 05-1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
