Debreus\u2019 attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel does assert however, that Debreus\u2019 sentence is improper in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Debreus filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, the selection of the jury and the enhancements under the sentencing guidelines. While we affirm the conviction, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Debreus was involved in a significant drug conspiracy distributing crack cocaine and cocaine in South Carolina. At trial, many of Debreus\u2019 co-defendants testified against him. The evidence was overwhelming that Debreus was a significant operative in the conspiracy that spanned several years. Accordingly, we find the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Debreus\u2019 challenge to the jury venire must fail. There is no evidence he challenged the selection of the jury venire at trial. Accordingly, review is waived. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867 (2000); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>639 F.2d 174, 180 (4th Cir.1981). Moreover, our review of the record shows no support for such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt Debreus was responsible for 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and 5 kilograms of cocaine. Combining these drug amounts would have resulted in a base offense level of 32, with a corresponding guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment for Debreus\u2019 criminal history category. At sentencing, however, the district court found Debreus was responsible for 77.19 kilograms of crack cocaine, possession of a firearm, a leadership or managerial role in the conspiracy and obstruction of justice. As a result, Debreus\u2019 offense level was adjusted upward to 44. The result was a guideline sentence of life imprisonment. None of the sentencing enhancements were found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by Debreus. Debreus\u2019 sentence was imposed prior to the decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts not admitted by Debreus or found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-60 (4th Cir.2005). His life sentence thus meets the standard for plain error that must be recognized under the reasoning set forth in <em>Hughes.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we will vacate Debreus\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and vacate and remand his sentence for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and Hughes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We deny Debreus\u2019 motion to relieve counsel and to appoint new counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Debreus' sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-23\">. Given that we are vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing, we will not review at this juncture Debreus\u2019 challenge to the sentencing enhancements. If there is an appeal after resentencing, it may be appropriate to review the enhancements at that point in the process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
