She contends that the IJ based the adverse credibility determination solely on the inconsistencies that existed in her testimony, her airport statement, and her credible fear interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case, not the BIA\u2019s, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney. Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). An IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application. D-M<em>uhumed v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">It is the duty of the fact finder to determine credibility, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings. <em>Vasquez-Mondragon v. INS, </em>560 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977). An adverse credibility determination must be upheld unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3rd Cir.2002) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the applicant bears the burden of showing that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We readily conclude that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision in this case was supported by specific, cogent reasons and was based on substantial evidence. The IJ noted several serious inconsistencies in Lin\u2019s various statements. The IJ stated that Lin had \u201csubmitted no evidence that she is a Falun Gong other than her own testimony and a statement from her parents in China.\u201d The IJ further noted that Lin\u2019s story warranted skepticism because she claimed she was Falun Gong for less than a month, could not adequately explain what Falun Gong was, and was not really detailed as to what she did to practice Falun Gong. We find that these reasons provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s credibility determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Upon review of the record on appeal and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-19\">. We decline to address Lin\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s alternative finding that the mistreatment that she suffered did not rise to the level of persecution because we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ's credibility determination. We find Lin\u2019s other challenge, that the IJ denied her due process rights, to be wholly without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
