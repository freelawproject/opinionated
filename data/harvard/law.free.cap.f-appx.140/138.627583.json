Although the district court erred in failing to expressly determine the reliability of the hearsay evidence and weigh Morris\u2019s confrontation rights against the government\u2019s reasons for failing to produce the witness, the error, if any, was harmless. The record also contained a written report concerning the same subject matter that, as a business record, bears significant indicia of reliability. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b169-20\">In 2002, Morris, pursuant to a written plea agreement, pleaded guilty to one count of uttering and possessing counterfeit obligations of the United States, with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472. The district court sentenced Morris to four years of probation. The conditions of the probation included, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Morris was not to use any controlled substance, except as prescribed by a physician; and (2) Morris was to reside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>at and participate in the Community Corrections Center (\u201cCCC\u201d or \u201chalfway house\u201d) for a period not to exceed 120 days, or until otherwise released at the direction of the U.S. Probation Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">On 31 March 2004, the probation office notified the district court that Morris had violated the terms of his probation by unlawfully possessing or using a controlled substance. The probation office noted that Morris\u2019s urine sample had tested positive for cocaine and that, upon questioning, Morris had admitted to using cocaine on 16 and 23 February 2004. The probation officer recommended that Morris\u2019s probation be modified to require 30 days in a comprehensive sanction center, followed by 90 days in the CCC, followed by 60 days on electronic monitoring. The court authorized the modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On 18 August 2004, the probation office notified the court that Morris had again violated the terms of his probation. The report included the February 2004 positive urine sample, and also stated that Morris had failed to participate in the CCC. It stated that, on 15 July 2004, Morris was unsuccessfully discharged from the center for being \u201cunaccountable.\u201d Rl-25 at 1. The probation officer recommended that the court revoke Morris\u2019s probation. The court issued a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">A hearing was held regarding the revocation of Morris\u2019s probation. The court noted that the violations included (1) Morris\u2019s admission that he used cocaine on two occasions in February, and (2) his alleged failure to participate in the CCC. At first, Morris stated that he admitted the violations and wished to proceed to sentencing. However, when asked whether he had any questions, Morris stated that officials had just decided that he should be expelled from the halfway house and that it was \u201ckind of like an open and shut case on my part.\u201d R1 at 5. When the district court asked Morris whether he was saying that he wanted to contest the violations, Morris stated that he wanted to admit to the positive urine test violation but contest the violation concerning his discharge from the CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The government called to the stand U.S. Probation Officer Donald Harrell, who had been Morris\u2019s probation officer since he was sentenced. Harrell testified that he was notified by Melissa Bohler, Harrell\u2019s case manager at the CCC, that on 14 July 2004, Morris was allowed to sign out to go to a doctor\u2019s appointment. The CCC had a requirement that all participants must call the center upon their arrival at and before their departure from the office. Bohler informed Harrell that, on 14 July, Morris signed off for his doctor\u2019s appointment and was supposed to report to work at 12:30. Bohler stated that Morris failed to call upon his arrival at the doctor\u2019s office and upon his departure from the doctor\u2019s office. He also failed to call upon his arrival at work. Bohler told Harrell that she placed a random call to his employer at 3:00 and was advised that Morris was not there and was due back to work at 4:00. Bohler told Harrell that Morris was \u201cunaccountable\u201d during the time he left the CCC. R1 at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Harrell further testified that Bohler told him about a subsequent incident on 15 July 2004. Morris was signed out to go to work at 12:00 noon and was to attend a treatment session after work. At 12:30, it was discovered that Morris had not called upon his arrival at work and had not called to report that he left work to attend his treatment session. A random call was placed to his employer at 12:35, and the employer advised that Morris had already left for the day. Bohler stated that, at 2:15, Morris called the case manager and stated that he was still at work and that his treatment session had been cancelled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Bohler ordered Morris back to the CCC. Upon his arrival, the CCC terminated him from the program. Bohler indicated to him that Morris was discharged from the CCC on 15 July. Harrell testified that Morris had not completed his court-ordered term at the CCC at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On cross-examination, Harrell testified that he did not have personal knowledge of the events that occurred on 14 and 15 July 2004, and that his information came from what Bohler had told him and from a written report that she submitted. The written report was entered into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When asked whether he knew who Bohler spoke to when she called to \u201ccheck up\u201d on Morris\u2019s location, Harrell stated that he did not know the specific person, but that Bohler stated that she had called Morris\u2019s employer. Rl at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The government rested its case, and the defense rested without presenting any evidence or witnesses. Morris then argued that the hearsay testimony of the probation officer, who admittedly had no personal knowledge of the events in question, was not sufficient to satisfy the government\u2019s burden to prove Moms guilty of the violations. He asserted that \u201cthere was some successful time in the halfway house and it appears to be just a misunderstanding that could have been resolved that didn\u2019t need to result in a violation.\u201d Rl at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The district court noted that it had only the evidence presented by the government to base its decision on, stating, \u201cthere was no evidence challenging what happened.\u201d The court found that the government had met its burden of proving the violations by a preponderance of the evidence. The court noted, \u201cWhen the evidence is not challenged, the matter of hearsay is not really that significant. If he took the stand and testified to facts [to the] contrary, then we\u2019d have to consider the weight of the hearsay, but in this case there was no such challenge.\u201d Rl at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The court stated that the guideline imprisonment range was 4 to 10 months. Morris requested a sentence that did not include incarceration, perhaps including electronic monitoring instead. The government requested a sentence of four months\u2019 imprisonment, noting that there were two violations, one admitted and one contested. The district court revoked Morris\u2019s probation and sentenced him to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 30 months of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">On appeal, Morris argues that the district court denied him due process when it found that he violated the terms of his probation based upon \u201cunreliable hearsay.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9. Morns does not dispute that the district court was permitted to consider hearsay evidence in the probation revocation hearing, but rather claims that its discretion was not unlimited and that the hearsay in his case was unreliable. Morris notes that the Supreme Court recently addressed the reliability of hearsay evidence in <em>Crawford v. Washington, 541 </em>U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, <em>158 </em>L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Morris asserts that the hearsay evidence was unreliable because the only evidence before the court was the testimony of Harrell, who admitted that he had no personal knowledge of the facts and who based his entire testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>information he received from Bohler. He argues that Bohler was not called as a witness and there was no evidence that she was unavailable. He further argues that the information Bohler related to Harrell was received by a \u201ccompletely unidentified\u201d third party at Morris\u2019s office. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Finally, Morris asserts that the district court \u201cimproperly relied upon the fact that [he] did not testify during the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in supervised release revocation hearings. <em>Id. </em>at 114. However, defendants in probation and supervised release revocation proceedings are entitled to \u201ccertain minimal due process requirements\u201d including the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether to admit hearsay testimony, the district court \u201cmust balance the defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses against the grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This includes making a finding that the hearsay was reliable and weighing the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation against the government\u2019s reasons for not producing the witness. <em>Id. </em>However, the district court\u2019s failure to make such findings, although erroneous, is subject to harmless error review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">This case is very similar to <em>United States v. Lora, </em>No. 00-15420, 251 F.3d 164 (11th Cir.2001), <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief, Appendix B. Although the opinion is unpublished and, therefore, not binding on us it is useful for purposes of consistency. In <em>Lora, </em>the defendant\u2019s probation officer testified that Lora had violated the conditions of his supervised release by, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to participate in the Comprehensive Sanction Center. The district court admitted the probation officer\u2019s testimony that Lora did not complete the program, failed to follow the procedures of the program, and was discharged from the program. The probation officer\u2019s testimony relied upon a summary report provided to him by Lora\u2019s case manager at the Comprehensive Sanction Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">In <em>Lora, </em>we held that, although the district court erred in falling to make express findings on the record under the <em>Frazier </em>balancing test, the error was harmless. We held that the case manager\u2019s report to the probation officer, which was an official report regularly kept in the course of the center\u2019s business, bore significant indicia of reliability and was admissible as a business records exception to the hearsay rule under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). We also noted that Lora never disputed that he was terminated from the Comprehensive Sanction Center before completing the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The instant case is indistinguishable from <em>Lora. </em>Although the district court in the instant case made no specific findings concerning the reliability of the hearsay and did not expressly balance Morris\u2019s right to cross-examination against the government\u2019s reasons for failing to produce the witness, the error, if any, was harmless. Bohler\u2019s written report on the violation, which provided the basis for and was essentially the same as Officer Harrell\u2019s testimony, was entered as evidence at the hearing without objection. <em>See </em>R2 at 11; <em>see also </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief at Appendix A. This report, like the report in <em>Lora, </em>\u201cbears significant indicia of reliability\u201d and, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in a criminal proceeding where the Federal Rules of Evidence apply, would have been admissible as a business records exception to the hearsay rule under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). <em>See Lora, </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief, Appendix B at 4. Additionally, Morris, like Lora, never disputed that he was terminated from the CCC before completing the program. <em>See id. </em>at 5; <em>see generally </em>R2.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">To the extent that Morris relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>decision, that decision is inapplicable to his situation. <em>Crawford </em>dealt with an initial criminal proceeding, not a revocation of probation or supervised release, and was based upon the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. at 1357. However, the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is specifically limited to \u201ccriminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S. Const., amend. VI. The Supreme Court previously has held that the revocation of parole is not a part of a criminal prosecution. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Although we have not had an opportunity to address the issue, two Circuits have held <em>Crawford </em>inapplicable to probation or supervised release revocation hearings. <em>See United States v. Aspinall, </em>389 F.3d 332, 342-43 (2d Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>382 F.3d 840, 844 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Finally, we conclude that Morris\u2019s argument that the district court improperly relied upon the fact that he did not testify is without merit. Although the court commented that Morris had not taken the stand, an examination of this comment in context reveals that the district court was saying that Morris had not presented any evidence at all to dispute the evidence that the government had presented and, therefore, the government had met its burden to prove the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. The court was not focused on Morris\u2019s failure to testify, but rather his failure to present any evidence at all to refute the government\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Based on our review of the record and Morris\u2019s arguments, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in revoking his probation. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">. It appears that the written report was not included in the record on appeal. <em>See generally </em>Rl. However, the government has attached the report to its brief. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief at Appendix A. Morris has not submitted a reply brief challenging the authenticity of the appended report. Bohler\u2019s report was consistent with Officer Harrell\u2019s testimony. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">. Although <em>Frazier </em>deals with the revocation of supervised release, probation revocation and supervised release revocation are \"so analogous as to be interchangeable\u201d and there is \"no significant conceptual difference\u201d between the two. <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 113-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
