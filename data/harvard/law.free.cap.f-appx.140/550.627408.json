He asserts that he faced past persecution given the evidence that militants shot at his home. Because of the mistaken assumption that he collaborated with the Israelis, Shtaya states that he cannot safely return to Israel, the West Bank, or any of the occupied territories. Shtaya maintains that the fact that his family has not been harmed is of no consequence because only he is wanted for his alleged collaboration with the Israelis.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">Because Shtaya has failed to show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against the BIA\u2019s determination that he is not entitled to asylum, we must affirm that finding. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). As Shtaya has not made the showing required to obtain asylum, he has not met the more demanding standards for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>See Efe v.
