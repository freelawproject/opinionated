After review, we deny Semenchuk\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-16\">On April 13, 2001, Semenchuk, a native and citizen of Ukraine, entered the United States as a non-immigrant, intra-company transferee, with authorization to remain until December 9, 2001. In February 2002, the INS issued Semenchuk a notice to appear, charging her with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States longer than authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">On February 24, 2003, the IJ denied Semenchuk asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. On April 15, 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order denying Semenchuk asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Thus, Semenchuk had until May 17, 2004, to file a petition for review in this Court. However, Semenchuk did not file a petition for review until September 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a direct petition for review in an immigration case is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and [is] not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because Semenchuk\u2019s petition for review was filed outside the 30-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>day window, we do not have jurisdiction to consider it. Consequently, we dismiss Semenchuk\u2019s September 28, 2004, petition for review to the extent it challenges the IJ\u2019s February 24, 2004, denial of asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">In contrast, to the extent Semenchuk\u2019s September 23, 2004, petition challenges the BIA\u2019s September 4, 2004, denial of her motion for reconsideration, we have jurisdiction to entertain Semenchuk\u2019s petition for review. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 38, 160 L.Ed.2d 200 (2004); <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999). Judicial review of motions for reconsideration is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garciar-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Semenchuk\u2019s motion for reconsideration simply repeated the same arguments she made in her initial appeal to the BIA. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Semenchuk\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
