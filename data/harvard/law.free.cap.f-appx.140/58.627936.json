We find that the district court did not commit plain error in applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion, because Herrera failed to show that his substantial rights were affected, or in imposing an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c), because the record reflected that Herrera had previously been convicted of a drug offense that qualified as an aggravated felony. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-21\">Herrera was indicted by a federal grand jury for: (1) illegally re-entering the United States after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2); and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>representing himself as a United States citizen to gain entry into the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911. Via a plea agreement, Herrera, pled guilty to Count 1 of the indictment. The government agreed to dismiss the remaining count.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">At Herrera\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the government asserted that the evidence indicated: (1) that Herrera was deported on or about 1 March 1996; (2) that he was removed from the United States on 27 January 1999; (3) that he had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony; and (4) that he attempted to enter the United States again. Herrera admitted these facts except to the extent that the government alleged that he had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony, and he pled guilty to the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Herrera\u2019s base offense level was 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The PSI added eight additional levels, under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c), because Herrera previously had been deported or unlawfully remained in the United States after a conviction for an aggravated felony. Three levels were deducted from the base offense level to reflect Herrera\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). The resulting total offense level was calculated to be 13. The PSI indicated that Herrera\u2019s previous convictions placed him in a criminal history category of III. Accordingly, the PSI indicated that the corresponding guideline range was 18 to 24 months. In describing Herrera\u2019s prior criminal history, the PSI referenced, <em>inter alia, </em>a previous conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in New York. The PSI indicated that in 1988, Herrera was found guilty and sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment. The PSI did not indicate, however, the statute which Herrera was convicted of violating. Neither Herrera nor the government filed objections to the contents of the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">At sentencing, the district court asked whether the parties objected to any aspect of the PSI, and Herrera indicated that he did not. The court then adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the PSI. The court sentenced Herrera to 23 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">On appeal, Herrera maintains that the district court imposed a sentence within the guideline range, and included a term of supervised release, because it understood the Guidelines to be mandatory. He argues that had the court treated the Guidelines as merely advisory, it might have exercised its discretion to impose a lesser sentence. Herrera contends that \u201c[t]o say that [he] would receive the same sentence \u2014 including the guideline-mandatory 3-year supervised release term \u2014 absent the guideline range is speculative at best, and on this record, most unlikely.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10. Herrera contends that the PSI failed to consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 when recommending a sentence. Accordingly, he maintains, his substantial rights were affected, and a resentencing is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">In response, the government asserts that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), only in believing mistakenly that it was required to apply the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. Because Herrera did not object below to the imposition of a guideline sentence, the government contends that we should review his sentence for plain error only. The government concedes that this <em>Booker </em>error was plain but argues that Herrera has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>facts supporting his sentencing enhancement were essentially uncontroverted. Furthermore, the government maintains, Herrera has not demonstrated that there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it considered the Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory In fact, the government asserts, the fact that the district court imposed a sentence near the top of the guideline range indicates that it is not likely that the court would have imposed a lower sentence under advisory guidelines. Finally, the government contends that Herrera has not demonstrated that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Because Herrera did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence in the district court, we review his appellate claims regarding the constitutionality of his sentence only <em>for </em>plain error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). To satisfy the plain-error standard, we must find that (1) the district court committed \u201cerror,\u201d (2) the error was plain or obvious, and (3) the error \u201caffected substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29. If these criteria are met, we may, in our discretion, correct the plain error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (citation and internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>the Court held that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.... </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d 542 U.S. 296, -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">After the sentencing in the instant case, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker </em>and found \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court held that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">In a second and separate majority opinion in <em>Booker, </em>Justice Breyer concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence to be within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>sory only. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764. The Court indicated that both its \u201cSixth Amendment holding and ... remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act\u201d must be applied to \u201call cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As we have explained, there are two types of <em>Booker </em>errors: (1) Sixth Amendment error based upon sentencing enhancements neither admitted by the defendant nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) statutory error based upon sentencing under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329-31. In the instant case, the district court applied the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. However, the only enhancement applied to Herrera\u2019s sentence reflected a prior conviction. The <em>Booker </em>court specifically indicated that only facts other than prior convictions must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, 543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756, and we recently held that \u201cthere is no Sixth Amendment violation when a district court enhances a sentence based on prior convictions.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the imposition of the enhancement to reflect Herrera\u2019s prior conviction was not constitutional <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">As to a district court\u2019s statutory error, a defendant meets the first and second prongs of the plain error test if the district court considered the Guidelines to be mandatory at the time of sentencing and if the error was plain at the time of appellate consideration. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir.2005). To satisfy the third prong of plain error, the defendant must demonstrate that the error \u201c \u2018affects [his] substantial rights,\u2019 and that the error \u2018actually did make a difference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005)). In other words, the defendant must show that \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion ... \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">In this case, the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion constituted <em>Booker </em>error, and the error is now plain. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. However, we conclude that Herrera failed to satisfy the third prong of plain error. Herrera has not shown, and the record does not indicate, that he would have received a lesser sentence had the district court considered the Guidelines advisory as opposed to mandatory. The court sentenced Herrera towards the upper end of the guideline range, 23 months, and without a clear statement or sign from the district court that it would have imposed a lighter sentence but for the fact that its discretion was constrained under the Guidelines, we can only speculate as to the likelihood of a different result. Herrera, therefore, has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result of his sentencing would have been different but for the <em>Booker </em>error, and we need not apply the fourth prong of the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Additionally, Herrera asserts that the district court plainly erred in determining that he qualified for an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(e), because nothing in his criminal history constitutes an aggravated felony. If this enhancement was imposed to reflect his prior conviction of \u201ccriminal possession of a weapon,\u201d he asserts, the record fails to support the enhancement because the government did not meet its burden of showing that the offense qualified as a crime of violence, and none of the categories of aggravated felonies apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the weapon possession conviction at issue. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18-19. Herrera further asserts that his prior conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance would not qualify as a \u201c\u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 \u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 20. Because the record does not indicate which offense the PSI relied upon in adding the eight-level enhancement, he contends, the district court plainly erred in imposing the enhancement, and this Court should remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Simon, </em>168 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.1999). Objections to sentencing issues that are not raised at the district court, however, are reviewed for plain error to avoid manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999). Because Herrera did not dispute the imposition of the eight-level enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The government bears the burden of establishing that a sentence enhancement is warranted. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1440 (11th Cir.1998). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States) is the guideline applicable to the offense of being illegally found in United States after deportation, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. A. In detailing the applicable specific offense characteristics, \u00a7 2L1.2 indicates that if the defendant previously was deported after a \u201cconviction for an aggravated felony,\u201d the base offense level should be increased by eight levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as it is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which, in turn, defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cincluding a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G, \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3(A)); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Section 924(c)(2) defines the term \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as including \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq.), </em>the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq.), </em>or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1901 <em>et seq.).\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. 924(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">In <em>Simon, </em>we held a drug offense falls within the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(2), and thus fits within the definition of aggravated felony, if two criteria are met: (1) the offense must be punishable under one of the three enumerated statutes, including the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d); and (2) the offense must be a felony. <em>Simon, </em>168 F.3d at 1272. The CSA defines the term \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201cany Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">In the instant case, the district court did not plainly err in imposing the eight-level enhancement. As Herrera argues, the record contains virtually no information about Herrera\u2019s previous conviction. The PSI indicated that the eight-level enhancement was warranted under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c), but did not specify which of Herrera\u2019s previous convictions justified the enhancement. On appeals, the government explains on appeal that Herrera\u2019s 1988 New York conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance constituted an aggravated felony. The PSI referenced that conviction by indicating that Herrera was found guilty and sentenced to four years of imprisonment for \u201cCriminal Possession of a Controlled Substance,\u201d but it did not indicate which New York statute Herrera violated. PS11125.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Nevertheless, Herrera\u2019s conviction satisfies the two criteria enumerated in <em>Simon. </em>First, possession of a controlled substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>is an offense punishable under the CSA. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. Second, Herrera\u2019s conviction was a felony under New York law because he was sentenced to more than four years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>N.Y. PENAL LAW \u00a7\u00a7 55.10, 70.15 (penalties for class A, class B, and unclassified misdemeanors do not exceed one year). Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in applying the enhancement to Herrera\u2019s sentence. <em>See Simon, </em>168 F.3d at 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In his brief, Herrera asserts that the conviction for simple possession cannot qualify as a drag trafficking crime under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1). However, the conviction was not considered a \u201cdrag trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) or (B), but rather an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(c). <em>See </em>PSI 1110. Finally, Herrera\u2019s reliance upon the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Shepard, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205, is misplaced. In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court considering prior convictions for the purpose of sentencing a defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the career criminal provision, could look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions, but not to police reports or complaint applications, to determine whether an earlier conviction qualified as a violent felony. <em>Shepard, </em>\u2014 U.S. at--, 125 S.Ct. at 1257. In the instant case, the district court did not consider any documents that the Supreme Court deemed to be inappropriate, because, as discussed above, the fact that Herrera\u2019s previous conviction qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 was evident from the nature of the offense and the duration of his imprisonment. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in imposing an eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">While the application of the Guidelines by the sentencing court was done in a mandatory fashion constituting statutory <em>Booker </em>error, Herrera has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different but for such error. Moreover, a review of the record demonstrates that the sentencing court did not err in imposing an eight-level enhancement under \u00a7' 2L1.2(b)(l)(e). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
