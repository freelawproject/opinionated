Vega Angulo subsequently submitted an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging persecution on account of his political opinion and membership in a particular social group: the Liberal Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-20\">The IJ denied Vega Angulo\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. The IJ found that Vega Angulo\u2019s asylum application was time barred, and that he had not established exceptional and/or extraordinary circumstances for not filing within one year of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>arrival.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As for Vega Angulo\u2019s application for withholding of removal, the IJ concluded that Vega Angulo\u2019s testimony was uncorroborated, unsubstantiated, and \u201cincredible.\u201d Accordingly, the IJ determined that Vega Angulo had failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, and Vega Angulo filed the present petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">With regard to Vega Angulo\u2019s asylum application, the IJ determined that his application was untimely. This Court is without jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding that Vega Angulo\u2019s asylum application was untimely, and his petition for review of that decision is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Fahim v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., 278 </em>F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2002). However, we have jurisdiction to entertain Vega Angulo\u2019s constitutional challenge to the one-year time bar for filing asylum applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Although we have jurisdiction to entertain Vega Angulo\u2019s constitutional challenge, his claim is without merit. Accordingly, we deny Vega Angulo\u2019s petition for review to the extent it raises a constitutional challenge to the one-year time bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Lastly, Vega Angulo makes a passing reference to the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. However, Vega Angulo fails to identify a standard of review or make any citations, authority, or argument regarding the denial of withholding of removal. Such a failure is fatal to Vega Angulo\u2019s appeal of this issue, and we con-elude that his argument as to withholding of removal has been waived. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 429 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1212 n. 6, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (explaining that \u201c[ajsylum and withholding of removal are two distinct forms of relief\u2019 and distinguishing between the two).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-12\">. Vega Angulo is the primary applicant. Vega Angulo\u2019s wife and two children are derivative applicants and, therefore, rely on his asylum application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-13\">. Because Vega Angulo\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\"IIRIRA\u201d), govern his petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-22\">. Angulo does not raise any challenge in his brief to the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">. An alien may apply for asylum if he \"demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">[a]n application for asylum of an alien may be considered ... if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuY\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
