Penn\u2019s indictment stemmed from an undercover operation by the Charlotte County Sheriffs Office (\u201cCCSO\u201d), whereby an undercover deputy purchased cocaine base from Penn\u2019s residence. During the buy, the deputy recognized Penn as an illegal alien who had previously been deported. The deputy informed the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) that Penn had re-entered the United States. After ICE agents confirmed that Penn was a deported alien who had illegally re-entered the United States, CCSO officers arrested Penn and turned him over to the ICE agents. Penn subsequently pled guilty to illegal re-entry by an aggravated felon, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). On appeal, he maintains that the district court erred, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-24\">In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court held that, under the state of Washington\u2019s mandatory sentencing guidelines system, the imposition of a sentencing enhancement based upon facts neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. 542 U.S. 296, 124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>S.Ct. 2531, 2534-38, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court extended this holding to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 760. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, we have stated that there could be two <em>Booker </em>errors: (1) a Sixth Amendment error \u2014 the error of imposing a sentencing enhancement based on judicial findings that go beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury, and (2) a statutory error \u2014 the error of being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">When, as here, a defendant raises, in the district court, an objection to the mandatory nature of the guidelines, we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289,-, slip op. at 2328 (11th Cir.2005). A statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless if, \u201cviewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-- -, slip op. at 2328-2329 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">In the case at bar, there was a statutory, <em>Booker </em>error, which the government concedes, because the district court sentenced Penn under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See id. </em>at ----, slip op. at 1330-31. Moreover, the government has not proven, and concedes that it may not be able to prove, that the district court\u2019s error did not affect, or had but a slight affect, on Penn\u2019s sentence. When it sentenced Penn, the district court did not state that it would sentence Penn exactly the same if <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at -----, slip op. at 2329-2330 (affirming a defendant\u2019s sentence despite a <em>Booker </em>statutory violation because the district court stated that it would impose the same sentence if the guidelines were advisory). Accordingly, the error by the district court in sentencing Penn under a mandatory guidelines system was not harmless and we vacate and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">VACATE AND REMAND.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
