Moore argues that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it sentenced him under mandatory guidelines as a career offender based on facts not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the government did not establish that the statutory error under <em>Booker </em>was harmless, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">\u201c[A] constitutional objection that is timely, ... receives the benefit of preserved error review.\u201d <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1305 (11th Cir.2001). Where, as here, an error was preserved below, we review <em>de novo </em>and, \u201cif error is found, it is generally subject to the harmless error analysis of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1303 n. 3. Rule 52(a) states that \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. We have explained that there are two kinds of sentencing errors based on <em>Booker. </em>The first is constitutional error: \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). The second is statutory error: \u201c[a]s a result of Booker\u2019s remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Each kind of <em>Booker </em>error requires a different standard of review to determine whether the error was harmless. <em>Booker </em>constitutional error is harmless when the government can show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that error did not contribute to the ultimate sentence. <em>Booker </em>statutory error is subject to a less demanding test. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). A statutory error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, the error did not affect the sentence or had only a \u201cvery slight effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence was not \u201csubstantially swayed\u201d by the error, then the sentence is due to be affirmed in spite of the error. <em>Id. </em>The harmless error standard for statutory errors is not easy for the government to meet, and is as difficult for the government to meet as the third-prong prejudice standard that a defendant must meet under plain error review. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the government has the burden to show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">This appeal requires that we apply each of these standards. Moore raised in the district court both constitutional error and statutory error. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">The district court did not commit constitutional error under <em>Booker </em>when it applied the career offender enhancement based on Moore\u2019s previous convictions. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224 118 S.Ct. 1219 (1997), the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>preme Court concluded that recidivism is not a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 247, 118 S.Ct. at 1232-33. <em>Booker </em>specifically excepted prior convictions from its holding. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. We have repeatedly determined that the Supreme Court has left its holding in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>undisturbed, and that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains good law and binding precedent until the Supreme Court decides otherwise. <em>See United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Moore\u2019s related argument that the district court violated his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment is frivolous. At the sentencing hearing, Moore admitted his previous convictions and the district court alternatively relied upon the judgments regarding those convictions filed by the government. Moore did not even attempt to invoke his privilege against seF-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Although there was no constitutional error, the district court erred when it sentenced Moore under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. Accordingly, we must determine whether the government showed that the error did not affect the sentence or had only a \u201cvery slight effect.\u201d <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. We conclude that the government has not met that heavy burden. There is nothing in the record to suggest that had the district court known the guidelines were advisory, the district court would have imposed the same sentence. We, therefore, vacate and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
