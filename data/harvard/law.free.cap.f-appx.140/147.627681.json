On appeal, Herea-Martinez argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a mitigating-role reduction. He also argues that the court committed reversible error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , when it (1) denied his request for a mitigating-role reduction on the basis of facts neither alleged in the indictment nor admitted by him, and (2) sentenced him under a mandatory Guidelines system.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">\n<em>Mitigating-Role Reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a question of fact to be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en banc). </em>A defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d is entitled to a four-level reduction for his minimal role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), cmt. n. 4. A defendant \u201cwho is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal\u201d is entitled to a two-level reduction for his minor role. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), cmt. n. 5. \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>we established a two-part test for whether a mitigating-role reduction is appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 940-45. In applying the first prong, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor [or minimal] role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Critically, the first prong of <em>De Varon </em>is often dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201cOnly if a defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable ... should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the district court may assess a defendant\u2019s relative culpability vis-a-vis \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making the fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Here, the record supports the district court\u2019s findings that the conduct attributed to Herea-Martinez was identical to his actual conduct and that he did not demonstrate that he was less culpable than his codefendants. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Herea-Martinez\u2019s request for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\n<em>Blakely /Booker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">When an applicant has timely objected to the application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim \u201cin order to determine whether the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Constitutional errors are harmless where the government can show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">A non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1292 (quotations and alterations omitted). \u201cIt is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292; see <em>also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.) (describing the defendant\u2019s burden under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>plain-error analysis), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005)(No. 04-1148).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court struck down an upward departure imposed under Washington state sentencing guidelines that was based solely on judicial factfinding, clarifying that the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u2019 for Apprendi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court extended this holding to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. 543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756. To cure the Sixth Amendment violation in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court (1) exercised two statutory provisions that reinforced the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, (2) held that the Guidelines were advisory, and (3) determined that sentences should be reviewed on appeal for reasonableness, considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">We have held that there could be two distinct <em>Booker </em>errors \u2014 (1) the error of imposing a sentence enhancement based on judicial findings that go beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury, or \u201cconstitutional error\u201d; and (2) the error of being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system, or \u201cstatutory error.\u201d <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. When there is no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, this court still must determine whether the non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing a defendant under the Guidelines as mandatory constituted reversible error. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201c[t]he use of the guidelines as mandatory [is] error, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">In the preserved error context where the government bears the burden of proving that the statutory error is harmless, we have affirmed a defendant\u2019s sentence, despite the <em>Booker </em>error when the district court stated its sentences would be the same even if the Supreme Court affirmed the decision in <em>Booker </em>and held that \u201cunder <em>Blakely, </em>the United States Sentencing Guidelines [were] unconstitutional....\u201d <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">Although Herea-Martinez suggests that the district court committed a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in denying his request for a mitigating-role reduction on the basis of facts neither alleged in the indictment nor admitted by him, (1) by its own terms <em>Booker </em>refers only to factors that increase a defendant\u2019s sentence, <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756; and (2) even if <em>Booker </em>applied to sentence reductions, the sentencing court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Herea-Martinez\u2019s request for a role reduction on the basis of acts that Herea-Martinez admitted during the change-of-plea hearing. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not commit a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In regard to the non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, because the district court sentenced Herea-Martinez at the bottom of his guideline range and did not offer an indication that its sentence would have been the same if the Guidelines were not mandatory, the government cannot show \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines did not substantially sway Herea-Martinez\u2019s sentence. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. Therefore, the statutory <em>Booker </em>error is not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Herea-Martinez\u2019s request for a mitigating-role reduction, but we vacate Herea-Martinez\u2019s sentence and remand this case for resentencing consistent with <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-12\">. <em>Apprendi v.

(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
