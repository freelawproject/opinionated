Mosley, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 387 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has vacated our prior judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker v. United States, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-25\">In our initial opinion, we declined to address Mosley\u2019s argument based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) because he did not raise it in his initial brief or in the district court. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>did not change this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-26\">Following the well-established rule in this circuit, <em>see United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2004), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>391 F.3d 1327 (11th Cir.2004), issues that are not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned. In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001), we applied this rule to a case remanded from the Supreme Court in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>Recently, we applied <em>Ardley </em>to a <em>post-Booker </em>remand and found that the defendant had abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim because he failed to raise it at the district court or in his initial brief. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Our opinion affirming the conviction and sentence in this case is accordingly REINSTATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
