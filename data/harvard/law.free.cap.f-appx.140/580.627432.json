He was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment and one year of supervised release. He argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence is invalid because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>district court applied the Sentencing Guidelines as if they were mandatory. We review for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.Bd 511, 513, 520-22 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Ramos-Lucio is unable to establish plain error with regard to his <em>Booker </em>claim because he cannot establish that being sentenced under a mandatory Guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights. The record does not indicate that the district court \u201cwould have reached a significantly different result\u201d under a sentencing scheme in which the Guidelines were advisory only. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22; <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Ramos-Lucio also asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
