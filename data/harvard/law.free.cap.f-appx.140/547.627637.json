The BIA\u2019s June 3, 2004, decision, however, denied Jaquez\u2019s motion to reconsider. Jaquez offers no legal argument relevant to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. Instead, Jaquez\u2019s brief is devoted to why the IJ erred in denying Jaquez\u2019s motion to reopen the removal proceedings and the BIA\u2019s January 28, 2004, affirmance of that denial. Jaquez did not file a petition for review from the denial of his motion to reopen the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">The BIA\u2019s denial of an appeal and its denial of a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders, each of which require their own petitions for review. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). A timely petition for review is a jurisdictional requirement, and the lack thereof deprives this court of jurisdiction to review a decision of the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993). Under <em>Stone, </em>this court is without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Jaquez\u2019s motion to reopen the removal proceedings. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537. Furthermore, by failing to brief any issue relative to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, he has waived the only viable appellate issue. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Jaquez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
