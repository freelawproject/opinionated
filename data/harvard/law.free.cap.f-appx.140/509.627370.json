Because we agree that Osborne cannot show that he suffered an \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims of disability discrimination and retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-28\">In April 1999, while working as a mail processing equipment mechanic for the United States Postal Service (\u201cPostal Service\u201d), Osborne suffered an on-the-job inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ry to his back and neck. Approximately three months later, he received a letter from Suzanne Elmer, the Injury Compensation Specialist for the Postal Service, explaining that his Continuation of Pay would soon terminate. Approximately one year later, Osborne returned to work at the Postal Service with work restrictions due to his physical condition. In accordance with these restrictions, the Postal Service asked that he agree to be reassigned to work in custodial services, for which he was paid the same salary he earned as an equipment mechanic. Believing that his reassignment was unjust, Osborne lodged several complaints with the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">While working as a janitor, Osborne was approached by Scott Sulik, Manager of In-Plant Support at the Postal Service, who told Osborne that he needed temporary help in his department performing work similar to that done by Osborne before his injury. Osborne informed his superiors, but, before a final transfer decision was made, Sulik no longer needed assistance, and Osborne returned to his duties in custodial services, where he continues to work. Osborne later filed this lawsuit, arguing that the Postal Service\u2019s treatment of him after his injury amounted to disability discrimination, and that the Postal Service failed to approve his transfer to Sulik\u2019s department in retaliation for his EEOC complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The district court dismissed Osborne\u2019s claims of disability discrimination, finding that, among other reasons, none of the above conduct constituted an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d The district court also dismissed Osborne\u2019s retaliation claim, concluding that the Postal Service\u2019s delay in approving Osborne\u2019s transfer to a temporary position did not constitute an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On appeal, Osborne concedes that none of the above incidents, taken alone, amount to an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d However, he urges this court to find that the Postal Service\u2019s conduct \u201cas a whole\u201d constituted a \u201ccampaign of retaliatory harassment\u201d that satisfies the requirement of \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d Even if such a theory is available to the plaintiff, we agree with the district court that Osborne has failed to show that the record evidence supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">For the reasons stated above and the reasons assigned by the district court denying recovery because plaintiff failed to establish an \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
