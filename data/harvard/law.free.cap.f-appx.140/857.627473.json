For the reasons stated in Member Meisburg\u2019s dissenting opinion, we conclude that NLRB\u2019s finding that Fisher violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Int\u2019l Bhd. of Boilermakers v. NLRB, </em>127 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir. 1997). NLRB\u2019s application for enforcement of its cease and desist order is therefore denied. NLRB\u2019s order requiring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>a new employee representation election be held is not a final order within the meaning of \u00a7 160(f) and is therefore unreviewable at this time. <em>See Florida Bd. of Bus. Regulation v. NLRB, </em>686 F.2d 1362, 1366 n. 8 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see also Cooper/T. Smith, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>177 F.3d 1259, 1261 n. 1 (11th Cir.1999) (stating that an employer can obtain review of a Board representation decision only by refusing to bargain after a union is certified). For that reason, NLRB\u2019s application for enforcement must be denied in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
