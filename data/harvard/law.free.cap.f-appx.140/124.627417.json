Estrada\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after 1 April 1997, and therefore, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply. The plain language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) forecloses judicial review of the BIA\u2019s decision regarding the untimely filing of Estrada\u2019s asylum application. Moreover, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that Estrada was not entitled to asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) because he failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Likewise, Estrada failed to meet the higher burden to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT. Accordingly, we DISMISS this petition in part and DENY it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">On 1 May 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> served Estrada with a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), alleging that he (1) was a native and citizen of Colombia; (2) entered the United States on or about 25 April 2000, as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure, and (3) remained in the United States beyond the amount of time authorized by the INS. The INS charged that Estrada was subject to removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Estrada, a Colombian citizen, subsequently filed an asylum and withholding of removal application, alleging persecution on account of his nationality, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. In his application for asylum, Estrada stated that he was a political military target of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) because of his \u201cpolitical participation and social works with the peasants.\u201d AR at 111. Estrada maintained that he was a member of the Conservative Party and vice-president of the Community Action Board (\u201cCAB\u201d) in the village of Caieedonia, Valle del Cauca. He asserted that in order to prevent the peasants \u201cfrom abandoning the country,\u201d his organization would assist the peasants in areas involving literacy and agriculture. AR at 111. Estrada averred that the FARC recruited many peasants in the region, compelling them to abandon their farmland. He further stated that the peasants who did not want to be recruited were assassinated by the FARC in front of their family members. Estrada stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>that as a result of his participation in the CAB, and the CAB\u2019s support of the peasants in that region, he suffered persecution, death threats, and a murder attempt from the FARC. Estrada also alleged two specific incidents during which he was threatened by the FARC which occurred in January and March of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Estrada submitted a number of documents in support of his asylum application. These documents included a police report filed on behalf of his sister, dated 18 December 2002, which stated that on 6 December 2002 and 18 December 2002, his sister received phone calls from the FARC asking about Estrada\u2019s whereabouts. These documents also included a letter from the (1) President of the Caicedonia Municipal Council stating that Estrada had \u201cbeen a great political activist\u201d in various campaigns in Caicedonia, Valle, and that according to Estrada\u2019s own accounts, he received death threats and left the municipality to save his life; (2) Nanciancenistar Conservative Directory attesting to the work Estrada had done for them; (3) Municipal Mayor of Caicedonia, Valle, explaining the FARC\u2019s impact in that region, and that as a result of the FARC\u2019s activities, Estrada was forced to leave the region; (4) Electoral Organization in Caicedonia, Valley certifying that Estrada served as a voting jury in Montealegre Village; and (5) Municipal Representative\u2019s Office of Caicedonia, Valle, attesting to Estrada being an honest person, and that Estrada had to leave the region because of death threats from the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Also in the record is the State Department\u2019s 2002 Country Report on human rights practices for Colombia, which reflected that Colombia was a constitutional, multiparty democracy, in which the Liberal and Conservative parties had long dominated politics. Despite years of drug and politically related violence, the economy is diverse and relatively advanced, but the government\u2019s human rights record remains poor. Internal security is maintained by both the armed forces and the national police. As a result of a major internal armed conflict between the government and leftist guerillas, including the FARC and the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d), 5,000 to 6,000 civilians were killed during the year, including combat casualties, political killings and forced disappearances. The rate of guerilla abuses increased during the year as they kidnapped thousands of civilians to help finance subversion and put political pressure on the government. Of the 2,986 kidnaping reported, 936 were attributed to the FARC. Guerillas caused mass displacements and thousands of civilian deaths and injuries through indiscriminate attacks on small towns and random terrorist bombings throughout the country. The report also stated that many of the unlawful killings committed by guerrillas were politically-motivated, and that the guerrillas, particularly the FARC, appeared to have committed a higher percentage of Colombia\u2019s unlawful killings than the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">At Estrada\u2019s removal hearing, he conceded removability and sought to proceed on his asylum application. At the asylum hearing, with the assistance of counsel, Estrada essentially reiterated the statements in his asylum application and added some information. Estrada clarified that he first worked as a consultant with the CAB, and in 2000, was named vice president of the group. Estrada stated that as vice president, he \u201chad a more direct relationship with the peasant[s] of the neighborhood or town.\u201d AR at 74. He testified that he became a military target of the FARC because of his political and social assistance to the peasants through the Conservative Party. Estrada stated that he was the target of one \u201cdeath attack,\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>December 1999. AR at 78. He testified that he was driving to his family\u2019s farm early in the morning and stopped because there were some trees in the road. He stated that he was shot at and threw himself in a ditch, but was not hurt. Estrada acknowledged that he did not file a police report about that incident. Estrada stated that during the January 2000 incident, the FARC commander told him that he was a military objective of the FARC, and if he continued to prevent recruitment, they were going to kill him. Estrada acknowledged, however, that he did not file a police report about the January 2000 incident either. He testified that he could not relocate within Colombia because the FARC would be able to find him anywhere in Colombia. Estrada stated that he waited several years to file an asylum application because he was not familiar with this country\u2019s customs or INS laws. He also stated that he was advised that if his asylum application was denied, he could be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">On cross-examination, Estrada testified that he could not recall the date on which his sister was declared a military objective by the FARC, but that it was at least three years earlier. He added that his sister was protected by the municipal government and was in \u201cconstant movement\u201d in Colombia. AR at 89-90. Estrada was then asked why the FARC, who knew where he lived and considered him a military objective, did not come to his home and kill him. He responded that once he found out he was a military target in March 2000, he traveled around Colombia while preparing to come to the United States. Estrada also testified that the other board members of the CAB remained in the region but were not military targets because \u201cthey [did not] have such a straight and direct relationship with peasants as [he] did.\u201d AR at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The IJ denied Estrada\u2019s asylum and withholding application and ordered him removed to Colombia. In his oral decision, the IJ first noted that Estrada did not apply for asylum until approximately 23 months after he arrived in the United States, and that he claimed \u201che was afraid that filing an application would cause his deportation.\u201d AR at 41. Accordingly, the IJ found that Estrada\u2019s asylum application was untimely, and that his reasons for the untimely filing did not constitute extraordinary circumstances. The IJ then pretermitted his asylum application. The IJ determined, however, that even if Estrada\u2019s asylum application were to be considered, his application would still be denied on the merits. The IJ reviewed Estrada\u2019s testimony and noted that there were no police reports regarding the December 1999, January 2000 or March 2000 incidents. The IJ also noted that after the March 2000 incident, Estrada testified that he traveled around Colombia without interference by anybody. The IJ stated that Estrada\u2019s parents still remained in Colombia and had not been harmed or threatened. Additionally, the IJ stated that although Estrada\u2019s sister was a military objective of the guerrillas, it \u201c[was] difficult to fully understand\u201d how she managed to remain in Colombia, under some type of governmental protection. AR at 45. The IJ noted that Estrada testified that the FARC was everywhere in Colombia, and could accomplish any goal that they intended to accomplish. The IJ also stated that Estrada\u2019s fellow board members at the CAB remained in the region and had not been disturbed. The IJ rejected Estrada\u2019s claim that he was the only CAB member targeted because he had a unique relationship with the peasants. Accordingly, the IJ denied Estrada\u2019s asylum application \u201cboth on the time issue, and in the alternative, on the merits.\u201d AR at 46. The IJ also found that Estrada did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal because there was no basis to conclude \u201cthat it [was] more likely than not that [Estrada] would be subject to persecution if he was returned to Colombia.\u201d AR at 46. The IJ also rejected Estrada\u2019s application for CAT protection, finding that Estrada was never harmed and had failed to demonstrate \u201cthat it would be more likely than not that he would be tortured if he was returned to Colombia.\u201d AR at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Estrada filed a notice of appeal to the BIA alleging that the IJ erred in denying his asylum and withholding of removal applications. Estrada argued that he demonstrated exceptional circumstances to excuse the late filing of his of his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, stating that it agreed with the IJ\u2019s (a) finding that Estrada failed to establish an exception to the one-year deadline for filing asylum applications, (b) alternate finding that Estrada\u2019s asylum claim failed on the merits, and (c) determination that Estrada had failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">A. <em>Whether the BIA Erred in Denying Asylum Based on the Expiration of the One-Year Statute of Limitations Deadline</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Estrada argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s finding that Estrada failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimely filing of his asylum application. Specifically, Estrada maintains that \u201c[t]he lingering effects of the state of fear ... produced a significant barrier to the timely filing of the application.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18. Estrada asserts that his unfamiliarity with the asylum laws, \u201ccompounded with ... a distraught state of mind,\u201d constituted extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">An alien may not apply for asylum unless he demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within one year of his arrival in the United States. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The one-year filing period commences either on the date of the alien\u2019s arrival or on 1 April 1997, whichever is later. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(2)(ii). A late application for asylum may be considered in the existence of extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing the application. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), (D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). However, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) states, \u201c[n]o court shall have the jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2) [the provision providing that the one-year time limit may be waived if extraordinary circumstances are demonstrated].\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances, such that the time limit should be waived, is not renewable by any court. <em>See Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y General, </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). Accordingly, the plain language of the statute and our case law bar review of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny asylum because the application was not filed within the one-year limit and no exceptional circumstances existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">B. <em>Whether the BIA\u2019s Decision to Deny Asylum and Withholding of Removal is Supported by Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Estrada asserts that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>application on the merits. Estrada maintains that he provided sufficient evidence that he suffered past persecution from the FARC. He avers that the FARC threatened him after he was promoted to vice president of the CAB and continued his political activities with the peasants. In support, Estrada mentions the (a) January 2000 incident in which a FARC commander allegedly told Estrada that if he continued with his anti-guerilla activities, the FARC would kill him; and (b) March 2000 incident in which the FARC allegedly painted the walls of the farm with proFARC slogans, hanged his dog, and left a threatening note in its mouth. Estrada alternatively asserts that he has presented a well-founded fear of future persecution in Colombia. Specifically, Estrada maintains that the FARC has continued its attempt to locate him, well after he left Colombia. He also avers that his family has continued to receive threatening telephone calls from the FARC and cites to a police report his family filed after one such incident. Estrada then maintains that he met his burden of proof for withholding of removal because it is more likely than not that he will be subject to persecution if he is returned to Colombia. In support, Estrada essentially reiterates the factual claims he provided in support of his asylum application. Finally, in a footnote, Estrada maintains that although the IJ denied his claim for relief under the CAT, the State Department\u2019s 2002 Country Report for Colombia indicates \u201cthat the Colombian government would be unable to control acts of torture by the FARC against [Estrada].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25-26 n. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">As discussed above, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusions that Estrada\u2019s asylum claim was untimely and no extraordinary circumstances existed to excuse the untimely filing. However, as the BIA and IJ alternatively considered and denied Estrada\u2019s asylum claim on the merits, see AR at 2, 41-46, we will also address this finding as well their conclusions about the withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, the BIA\u2019s decision must be deferred to as supported by substantial evidence, unless the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise. <em>Sepulveda v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except when it adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, such that a review of that decision is warranted. <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA both adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and made some of its own findings, so we should review both. Further, the BIA\u2019s decision can only be reversed if the applicant\u2019s evidence \u201cis so powerful that a reasonable factfinder would <em>have </em>to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of the United States Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original). The INA states that \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Any alien who is physically present in or arrives in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). An alien may obtain asylum if he is a refugee within the meaning of INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>any person who is unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of, the country of his nationality or where he last habitually resided, \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden of proof is on the alien to establish that he is a refugee. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). An alien may establish eligibility for asylum if he shows that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b), <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. While the INA does not define persecution, courts have generally held that persecution is \u201cpunishment or the infliction of harm for political, religious, or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.\u201d <em>See, e.g. Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, </em>222 F.3d 417, 424 (7th Cir. 2000) (punctuation omitted). \u201cPersecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom; non-life threatening violence and physical abuse also fall within this category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have observed that mere harassment is not persecution, and persecution requires \u201c \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; <em>see also Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (persecution \u201cmust rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Past persecution includes persecution that occurred in the applicant\u2019s country in the past \u201con account of ... political opinion,\u201d and the applicant \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to, or avail ... himself of the protection of, that country owing to such persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution may be established by showing, (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, which may be rebutted with proof that, <em>inter alia, </em>the alien could relocate and it would be reasonable to expect the alien to do so, (2) a reasonable possibility of future personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which he is part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (b)(2). The well-founded fear inquiry requires the alien to demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution \u201c \u2018is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Further, the alien must establish a causal connection between the statutory ground and the feared persecution by presenting \u201c \u2018specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [the statutory ground].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Finally, after establishing a well-founded fear of persecution, the alien must demonstrate that he or she cannot avoid the persecution by relocating within the country. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Estrada failed to establish that he suffered past persecution or will suffer future persecution on account of his political opinions or community involvement. Estrada testified about an alleged 1999 attack from the FARC; January 2000 incident in which a FARC commander allegedly warned Estrada; and a March 2000 incident in which the FARC allegedly killed his dog, and left a threatening note in its mouth. However, he did not produce a police report for any of these incidents, and after the March 2000 incident, he was able to travel around Colombia, for a month, without interference by anybody. This evidence supports a conclusion that Estrada had not suffered past persecution within the meaning of the INA. While the record may have supported another conclusion, we affirm the IJ\u2019s reasonable in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>terpretation that Estrada failed to establish that he was persecuted to warrant asylum. <em>See Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1324. Estrada never testified that he was physically harmed, kidnapped, abused, or anything other than merely being harassed by the FARC. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231(mere harassment is not persecution); <em>Nelson, </em>232 F.3d at 264 (the alien did not face persecution, or have a well-founded fear of persecution, when she was three times placed in solitary confinement and physically abused, and subjected to periodic surveillance, threatening phone calls, occasional stops and searches and visits to her place of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Similarly, the IJ and BIA\u2019s findings that Estrada did not have a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution because (a) Estrada\u2019s family remains in Colombia and has not been harmed by the FARC; (b) his sister, who he claimed was currently a military target of the FARC, manages to remain in Colombia under some governmental protection; and (c) the other Board Members of the CAB are not targeted by the FARC, are supported by substantial evidence. Although Estrada testified that he, unlike other Board Members, had a special relationship with the peasants; and presented documented evidence that the FARC made two threatening telephone calls after his departure from Colombia, the substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ\u2019s findings, and a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to disagree. <em>See Mazanegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1323-24. Also, as stated above, mere harassment is not persecution, and persecution requires \u201c \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u2019\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Upon review of the record, and having considered the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error.
