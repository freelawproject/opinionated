Sills\u2019 attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ing that he has reviewed the record and has not found any meritorious grounds for appeal. In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Sills\u2019 counsel raised one issue related to the calculation of Sills\u2019 sentence: that the court violated Sills\u2019 due process rights in calculating his sentence based upon a large quantity of drugs improperly attributed to him. Although informed of his right to do so, Sills has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, and we have found a meritorious ground for appeal: that Sills\u2019 sentence violated the rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005), we held that when a sentence calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by facts found by the jury alone or admitted by the defendant, the defendant could demonstrate plain error that warranted resentencing under <em>Booker. </em>Because it is undisputed that the district court made factual determinations beyond facts Sills admitted that increased his sentence, we find plain error occurred and that Sills is entitled to resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Sills\u2019 conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing \u201cconsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Booker. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"we of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Sills\u2019 sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. .\u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2)(2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range ... and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
