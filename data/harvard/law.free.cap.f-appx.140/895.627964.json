Coleman filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996); therefore the provisions of that act govern his appeal. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">Coleman, presently serving two consecutive life sentences for first degree rape and sodomy, filed this <em>pro se </em>petition for federal habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to object to an \u201cemotional outburst by the victim\u2019s grandmother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">The state responded, arguing that Alabama state courts had addressed the merits of Coleman\u2019s claims and those decisions were neither contrary to nor involved an unreasonable application of federal law. With regard to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the outburst of the victim\u2019s grandmother, the state argued that a state appellate court had found that Coleman failed to adequately plead his claim and that, therefore, Coleman failed to meet his burden of proving either ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice, as required under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">Relevant to Coleman\u2019s certificate of appealability (\u201cCOURT OF APPEALS\u201d), the state\u2019s evidence showed that, at trial, the victim, who at the time of the offense was Coleman\u2019s 13-year-old step-daughter, tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>tified that Coleman, some time prior to July 4, promised her that if she let Coleman \u201cdo something,\u201d Coleman would take her somewhere with her boyfriend. Coleman then took the victim into his bedroom and touched her breasts and her vagina. On another occasion, Coleman used his mouth and, eventually, penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his penis. The victim also testified that Coleman took her \u201cto the woods\u201d in a car and penetrated her anus with his penis. When she cried and told Coleman to stop, he hit her in the face. On another occasion, Coleman took the victim to a cemetery and again touched the victim\u2019s breasts and vagina before penetrating her anus with his penis. After this last incident, the victim told her mother that she didn\u2019t want to stay at home any longer, and informed her mother that Coleman was \u201cmessing with [her].\u201d The victim identified Coleman as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Near the end of the victim\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, the record showed that \u201ca hysterical woman ran toward the defendant, was apprehended, and was escorted out of the courtroom.\u201d The court called for a 15-minute recess, and the trial then resumed. The court\u2019s jury instructions included the following statement: \u201c[y]ou should not permit sympathy, emotion or prejudice to influence your verdict one way or another in this case.\u201d Two hours into deliberations, the jury returned to the courtroom \u201cdeadlocked\u201d and, after lunch, requested \u201cthe testimonies of the doctor and defendant\u201d as well as the testimony of the victim. One of the reasons was that the jury was not \u201cclear what [the witnesses] said in context.\u201d The court decided that \u201cthe easiest way to do that is just to replay the tapes,\u201d and in closed session, the jury reheard the testimony of three witnesses, including the victim and, presumably, also reheard the \u201coutburst\u201d of the woman who ran at Coleman during trial. After rehearing the testimony and deliberating for 25 minutes, the jury was still unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The following day, the jury convicted Coleman of sodomy and rape in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">On direct appeal, Coleman argued that \u201cthe trial court committed reversible error by failing to grant a mistrial following an outburst by a spectator during the course of the trial. This woman, who turned out to be the grandmother of the victim, began shouting very loudly at the defendant: \u2018That man\u2019s a snake.\u2019 This spectator repeated the same outburst and continued to make loud, verbal outbursts as a sheriffs deputy subdued her, lifted her up in the air, and carried her out of the courtroom.\u201d In a memorandum opinion, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals found that Coleman had failed to move for a mistrial, ask for a curative instruction, or otherwise object regarding the outburst and, therefore, concluded that the issue was not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Coleman then filed in Alabama state court a petition for relief from his conviction or sentence pursuant to Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, arguing <em>inter alia, </em>that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to object to the outburst described <em>supra. </em>The state responded that Coleman had failed to show that his trial counsel was deficient under <em>Strickland. </em>The court issued a written order, finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">Petitioner has failed to meet the requirements of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) in proving his allegations. Furthermore, the undersigned trial judge is the judge that presided over this Petitioner\u2019s jury trial. Based upon this Court\u2019s observations of defense counsel at trial and all phases leading to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>trial, the Petitioner was properly and effectively represented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Coleman appealed the state trial court\u2019s decision. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, finding that it (1) could not consider Coleman\u2019s factual assertions because they were presented in an unverified motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) Coleman\u2019s allegations were conclusory and general. Therefore, it found that the \u201ccircuit court properly denied relief on this ineffective-counsel claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The district court, upon review of the evidence, found that \u201c[e]ach of the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were raised by the petitioner in his Rule 32 petition, and these claims were addressed on their merits in the state appellate court ... and ... found ... to be without merit.\u201d Thus, it found that Coleman could:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-6\">[Olbtain relief on these claims only if he can establish that the ... adjudication of the claims \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The district court then concluded that Coleman had not established what was required, and dismissed his petition. It found that the \u201cAlabama Court of Appeals\u2019 adjudication of [Coleman\u2019s] claims ... was not based on unreasonable determinations of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Coleman appealed and we granted a COA on the following issue: \u201cWhether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to an outburst by the victim\u2019s grandmother and move for a mistrial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Anc\">On appeal, Coleman argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the \u201coutburst\u201d during his trial or to request an immediate curative instruction and polling of the jury to ensure that no member was affected by it. He argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object permitted the jury to hear the outburst a second time after it had reported being \u201cdeadlocked\u201d and, had counsel objected, the outburst would have been stricken from the record and Coleman would have received a hung jury or a verdict of not guilty. Thus, he contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. He cites no federal cases in support of his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">\u201cAppellate review in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Sec\u2019y for the Dept of Corr., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 (11th Cir.2004). We review <em>\u201c[de novo </em>] issues of law presented in a certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1053 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-13\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-14\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-15\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>tion of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] state-court decision is contrary to this Court\u2019s clearly established precedents if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases, or if it confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court but reaches a different result.\u201d <em>Brown v. Payton, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 1438, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005). \u201cA state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Court\u2019s clearly established precedents if the state court applies this Court\u2019s precedents to the facts in an objectively unreasonable manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 125 S.Ct. at 1439. An objectively unreasonable application of precedent occurs when (1) a state court identifies the correct legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts or (2) a state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply. <em>See Diaz v. Sec\u2019y for the Dept. of Corr., </em>402 F.3d 1136, 1141 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">\u201cIt is past question that the rule set forth in <em>Strickland </em>qualifies as \u2018clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1512, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant can only succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim if he proves (1) his counsel was deficient, i.e., made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. It is not enough for the defendant to show that the error had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067. Moreover, \u201cit is not enough to convince a federal habeas court that, in its independent judgment, the state-court decision applied <em>Strickland </em>incorrectly ____he must show that the [state court] applied <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 699, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1852, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">The district court found that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 adjudication of Coleman\u2019s claims did not result in a decision contrary to, or involving an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>The Court of Criminal Appeals had affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Coleman had failed to establish that his counsel was deficient under <em>Strickland. </em>A review of the trial record shows that the dismissal of Coleman\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was not objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">First, Coleman has not pointed to any Supreme Court cases reaching a different result under indistinguishable facts. Second, in order to prevail under the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>Coleman had to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome if, in fact, his counsel committed error. Assuming it was error for Coleman\u2019s counsel not to object to the outburst, request a curative instruction or poll the jury, or move for a mistrial, Coleman has not shown that, but for the error, there was a reasonable probability that the jury would not have convicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">Coleman\u2019s entire argument is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-17\">[H]ad his counsel objected and asked for a mistrial, there is a reasonable proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>bility that the trial court would have granted a motion for mistrial or at the very least, the trial court would have given specific detailed instructions to disregard the outburst and polled the jury to make sure that none of them were affected and the outburst would not have been available on tape for the jury to hear that second time because it would have been stricken from the record .... [Bjecause of the jury\u2019s deadlocked position, [Coleman] would have gotten a hung jury or even an innocent verdict had [the jury] not been exposed to that tape recording of the outburst during their deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The victim testified at the trial to several occasions during which Coleman penetrated her vagina and anus with his penis. The outburst in question appears, from the record, to have been short and inconsequential, reading only that \u201ca hysterical woman ran towards, the defendant, was apprehended, and escorted out of the courtroom.\u201d And while it is true that no immediate instruction was given to the jury to disregard the outburst, the jury instructions admonished the jurors to avoid basing a decision of guilt on sympathy, emotion, or prejudice, and they were well informed of a defendant\u2019s presumed innocence. Jurors are presumed to follow the instructions they are given. <em>See, e.g., Raulerson v. Wainwright, </em>753 F.2d 869, 872 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Moreover, when the jury requested to rehear the testimony that Coleman argues contained the outburst in question, it stated that it wanted to clarify the context of witness statements. Even assuming that the grandmother of the victim said what Coleman asserts that she said, \u201che\u2019s a snake, I\u2019m going to kill him, he deserves to burn in hell for what he did to my baby,\u201d the jury would have gleaned nothing new, nor been informed of anything other than the grandmother was understandably upset at the man the state accused of raping her granddaughter. <em>See, e.g., Kinnamon v. Scott, </em>40 F.3d 731, 734 (5th Cir.1994) (persuasive authority noting that, after the jury was exposed to an outburst by the daughter of a murder victim, the fact that \u201cthe young girl was upset and angry at the person accused by the state as the murderer of her father communicated nothing new to the jury.\u201d). Notably, the trial judge in Coleman\u2019s case, who was present throughout the trial, found no deficiency in the counsel\u2019s performance. As we have held in a similar context, \u201cbecause the trial judge is in the best position to assess the prejudicial effect of an emotional outburst, the decision whether to grant a mistrial lies within his sound discretion.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Moreover, Coleman\u2019s argument regarding prejudice is purely speculative, as he argues that, but for the jury hearing the outburst a second time, there would have been a hung jury or a verdict of not guilty. Coleman makes much of the fact that the jury was deadlocked before hearing the tapes with the outburst. However, the record shows that the jury had only deliberated for two hours before informing judge that it was \u201cdeadlocked.\u201d After breaking for lunch, the jury requested to rehear the testimony of three witnesses, did not return to deliberations until several hours later, deliberated for 25 minutes, and returned to the court \u201cunable to reach a unanimous verdict.\u201d The jury returned at 9 a.m. the next day and returned a unanimous verdict of guilty in 30 minutes. The fact that the jury was deadlocked before hearing the tapes and still unable to reach a unanimous verdict immediately after hearing the tapes runs contrary to Coleman\u2019s argument. In any event, the fact that it took a jury roughly three hours of total deliberation time to convict Cole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>man is not evidence of a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different, especially in light of the fact that Coleman testified on his own behalf, denied committing the crime, and was found guilty anyway. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cwhen a defendant takes the stand in a criminal case and exposes his demean- or to the jury, the jury may make adverse determinations about his credibility and reject his explanation as a complete fabrication.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Finally, because Coleman must prove a reasonable probability of a different outcome, and the best that can be said about the outburst is that it may or may not have impacted the jury and may or may not have affected the outcome, Coleman cannot carry his burden of proof and persuasion under the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299-1301 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, to succeed under plain error review of a Sixth Amendment right to a jury violation at sentencing, a defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d (citing <em>Strickland) </em>of a different outcome, and where the effect of the error was uncertain, the defendant failed to meet that burden). The evidence does not demonstrate that the outburst had any effect on the factfinder\u2019s ultimate determination of guilt. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the state courts\u2019 decisions rejecting Coleman\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim for failing to object to the outburst at trial were not an unreasonable application of the law under <em>Strickland. </em>We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-9\">. Coleman asserted that the actual words said by the grandmother were: \"he\u2019s a snake, I\u2019m going to kill him, he deserves to burn in hell for what he did to my baby.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
