Because the government failed to demonstrate that the district court committed a harmless <em>Booker </em>error, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Fenimore on four counts of firearm violations. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Fenimore pled guilty to (1) knowingly receiving, possessing, and transferring an unregistered silencer, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), (e), and \u00a7 5871, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; (2) knowingly possessing a semiautomatic UZI 9-millimeter rifle, which had its serial number removed, obliterated, or altered, and which had been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k); (3) knowingly making a rifle having a barrel less than 16 inches in length, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(f), 5845(a), and 5871; and (4) knowingly receiving and possessing an unregistered short barrel rifle, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), \u00a7 5871, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The presentence investigation report indicated that Fenimore\u2019s guideline sentencing range was 24 to 30 months of imprisonment based on a total offense level of 17 and a criminal history category of I.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Just prior to the sentencing hearing, Fenimore filed a motion to declare the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. During the sentencing hearing, Fenimore\u2019s counsel argued that the guidelines were unconstitutional but conceded that there was \u201cabsolutely nothing outside of the indictment ... that is going to be relied upon by the [district] [c]ourt for sentencing purposes.\u201d R2 at 5. The district court concluded that, under the state of the law at that time, <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines and overruled Fenimore\u2019s objection. The district court then sentenced Fenimore to 24 months of imprisonment for each count, to run concurrently. Although the district court sentenced Fenimore to the low end of the applicable guideline range, the district judge did not indicate whether he would have given Fenimore a lower sentence had he not been constrained by the guidelines. Fenimore renewed his objections to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">On appeal, Fenimore argues that the federal sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional under <em>Blakely </em>and contends that he is entitled to a resentencing. In response, the government avers that any non-constitutional error in the district court\u2019s application of mandatory guidelines was harmless. Specifically, the government contends that there is no reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme because (i) the district court was not persuaded by mitigating facts concerning Fenimore\u2019s role in the offense; (ii) no other mitigating facts were presented; and (iii) the district court did not indicate that it would have imposed a lesser sentence if not for the mandatory guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines made them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-51. The Court concluded that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Additionally, the Court invalidated two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 that had made the guidelines mandatory but held that district courts must continue to take the guidelines into account in conjunction with other sentencing goals. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764. The Court explicitly noted that both its Sixth Amendment holding and remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act should be applied \u201cto all cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings, we have concluded that district courts could have committed \u201cconstitutional\u201d and/or \u201cstatutory\u201d errors in sentencing defendants before <em>Booker. </em>The statutory error, relevant in this case, occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Skelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Because Fenimore preserved his objection to the district court\u2019s \u201cstatutory\u201d <em>Booker </em>error, we review the issue <em>de novo, </em>but we will reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We deem a non-constitutional error harmless if, \u201cviewing the proceedings in their entirety,\u201d we can \u201csay with fair assurance\u201d that \u201cthe error did not affect the [sentence], or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (mandate withheld) (citation and quotations omitted). The government carries the burden to show that the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>We have recognized that the government\u2019s burden is \u201cnot easy\u201d to meet. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">In this case, the district court committed a <em>Booker </em>statutory error in sentencing Fenimore under a mandatory guidelines scheme. However, even considering the government\u2019s arguments, we cannot determine what the district court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory. We thus conclude that the government has not demonstrated with fair assurance that this error had but slight effect on Fenimore\u2019s ultimate sentence. Accordingly, the <em>Booker </em>statutory error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Because the government has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>statutory error was harmless, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">. Additionally, the government argues that Fenimore is not entitled to a resentencing because, in a brief filed before the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Fenimore argues that he is entitled to resentencing only if the guidelines are held facially unconstitutional, which they were not. We reject the government\u2019s argument and construe Fenimore\u2019s argument as an appeal of the district court's <em>Booker </em>statutory error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
