On appeal, Gonzalez contends that the district court should have granted a downward departure on the basis of his criminal history category overrepresenting the seriousness of his criminal history, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Initially, Gonzalez claims that this Court has the authority to review the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure because the court erroneously believed it was not authorized to depart. Gonzalez then argues that the district court should not have solely examined the timing and pattern of his offenses in denying the downward departure, but should have considered the nature and quality of the juvenile offenses before determining whether to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-24\">We do not normally review the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure, except in cases where the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>incorrectly believed that it did not have authority to depart. <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>358 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11th Cir. 2003). If the district court expresses anabivalence about its authority to depart, we review the record to determine the district court\u2019s understanding. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cWhere ... the district court\u2019s statements reflect an ambiguity concerning its ability to depart, we resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendant\u201d and review the court\u2019s downward departure decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1279 n. 3. However, \u201cwe assume that the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward\u201d when the record does not indicate any ambivalence. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999). When the district court properly recognizes the scope of its authority to depart, this Court has no jurisdiction to review the denial of a downward departure and will dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>15 F.3d 169, 171 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We conclude that the district court properly understood its authority to depart because the court found that: (1) the timing and pattern of Gonzalez\u2019s crimes weighed against granting a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3; and (2) case law prohibited it from examining the facts of prior crimes when considering a departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>120 F.3d 227, 231-32 (11th Cir. 1997) (rejecting defendant\u2019s contention that the circumstances surrounding a prior conviction can be considered in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 departures, and stating the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 policy statement \u201cis concerned with the pattern or timing of prior convictions\u201d). Because the district court understood it had the authority to depart, we cannot review the district court\u2019s denial of the downward departure. Accordingly, we dismiss Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">DISMISSED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\">.
