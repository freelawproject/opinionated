Because Samedi\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), apply. On appeal, Samedi argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen because he ordered removed in absentia without receiving proper notice of the November 13, 1997, hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, [this court] review[s] the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, we will review both decisions because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cThe BIA abuses its discretion when its decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>or contains only summary or eonclusory statements.\u201d <em>Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.2003) (persuasive authority) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Any alien who, after written notice has been provided to the alien or the alien\u2019s counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding shall be ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>if the government establishes by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d it gave written notice and the alien is removable under the standards set forth in the INA. INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). An <em>in absentia </em>removal order may be rescinded if (1) within 180 days after entry of the order, the alien moves to reopen and demonstrates that his failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) the alien moves to reopen at any time and demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice. INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii). Exceptional circumstances include circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as \u201cserious illness of the alien,\u201d but do not include \u201cless compelling circumstances.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">To the extent that Samedi argues that his failure to appear at the November 13, 1997, hearing was due to exceptional circumstances, and thus relies on INA \u00a7 240(b) (5)(C) (i), the record shows that Samedi\u2019s second motion to reopen was time-barred because he filed it more than 180 days after the IJ\u2019s decision. Additionally, because Samedi did receive proper notice of the November 13, 1997, hearing, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Samedi\u2019s motion to reopen pursuant to INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">After a careful review of the entire record, as well as the parties\u2019 respective briefs, we find no discernable error and hold that the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s ruling was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
