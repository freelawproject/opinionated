This issue, however, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">Alejo-Agramon also contends, for the first time on appeal, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-19\">Finally, Alejo-Agramon contends that the district court committed reversible plain error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. </em>Booker,U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that the error was plain, structural, and presumptively preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>dicial. We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005)(No. 05-5556).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The district court erred when it sentenced Alejo-Agramon pursuant to the mandatory Guidelines system. <em>See id. </em>at 733. However, the error was not structural or presumptively prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). Further, Alejo-Agramon has failed to point to anything in the record indicating that the district court would have reached a different conclusion had it known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Although the district court sentenced Alejo-Agramon at the lowest end of the guideline range, it found no reason to depart from that range. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535). Therefore, Alejo-Agramon has not demonstrated that his substantial rights were affected, and he has failed to establish plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
