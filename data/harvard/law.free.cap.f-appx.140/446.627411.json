He alleged violations of his Eighth Amendment rights, as well as a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In his complaint and in his declaration submitted in response to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Manning averred that staff and inmates routinely violate the prison\u2019s smoking policy and that he is suffering health consequences as a result of the high level of ETS to which he is exposed. He also stated that prison guards do not enforce the smoking policy. The district court granted summary judgment, and Manning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">Summary judgment is only appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact given the parties\u2019 burdens of proof at trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In determining whether the moving party has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact, a court must assess the factual evidence and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ., </em>84 F.3d 672, 675 (4th Cir.1996). We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Stone v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>105 F.3d 188, 191 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\">After a careful review of the record, we find that the district court inappropriately credited the Defendants\u2019 evidence and discredited Manning\u2019s evidence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Manning, we find that he has raised material issues of fact as to whether he was being exposed to \u201cunreasonably high levels of ETS\u201d under <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 35, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993), whether he suffered from a serious injury or medical need under <em>Estelle v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and whether Defendants exercised ordinary diligence in enforcing the smoking policy. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-15\"> <em>Bivens v.
