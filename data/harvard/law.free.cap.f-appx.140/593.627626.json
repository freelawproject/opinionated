Booker, </em>-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because he was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme. We review for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>United States v.

However, Adams fails to carry his burden of showing that this error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 733-34. The district court made no comments indicating that it would have imposed a lesser sentence in the absence of mandatory guidelines. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
