On appeal, Lockhart argues that the district court erred in ruling that his \u00a7 3582 motion was procedurally improper and contends that the district court should have looked behind the label of his \u00a7 3582 motion and re-characterized it, although he fails to specify under what remedial framework the district court should have construed his motion. In addition, Lockhart maintains that the district court should have addressed the merits of his claim relating to <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because he presented that claim in the trial court. Finally, Lockhart makes a passing reference that he is appealing the district court\u2019s order \u201cthat appellant\u2019s motion may be fairly construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">We review a district court\u2019s decision with respect to a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except (1) on a, motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or (2) to the extent authorized by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1). In turn, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 provides that a court may correct a sentence (1) that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error within seven days after sentencing, or (2) upon a substantial assistance motion filed by the government. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">A plain reading of the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1) supports the conclusion that the district court correctly found that none of the provisions of \u00a7 3582(c) or Rule 35 applied, and therefore, that it did not have the authority to modify Lockhart\u2019s sentence. Here, the record establishes that neither the Director of the Bureau of Prisons nor the government filed a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>for a sentence reduction, and Lockhart\u2019s motion was not filed within seven days of sentencing. Therefore, the district court was powerless to modify Lockhart\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1), and we affirm. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1319 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that outside of Rule 35, there exists no inherent authority for a district court to modify a sentence.).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The district court also properly found that \u201cto the extent [Lockhart\u2019s] \u00a7 3582 motion may be fairly construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the [district court] is powerless to consider it absent authorization from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\u201d Because Lockhart sought a modification of his sentence that did not comport with \u00a7 3582(c), the only statute that may have accorded him relief was \u00a7 2255. This Court had previously denied Lockhart\u2019s application for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding it did not have the power to consider it as such, and properly denied Lockhart\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-8\">. In any event, we have held that because the Supreme Court has not made <em>Booker </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition based on <em>Booker </em>does not meet the statutory criteria. <em>In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-23\">.
