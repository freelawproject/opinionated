Booker, </em>548 U.S. --, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing her sentence based on facts that were not proven to a jury or admitted to by her, and by applying the Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-23\">Because Cotton raised a constitutional objection to her sentence before the district court based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review the constitutional issue <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse only for a harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). A constitutional error is harmless if \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). The government bears the burden to show that any error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>We have noted that \u201cthe party bearing the burden faces a difficult challenge\u201d when \u201cwe simply do not know what sentence the district court would have imposed absent the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324,-, manuscript op. at 8 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>see also United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the government could not meet its burden when \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-26\">Because Cotton preserved her constitutional objection by timely raising it before the district court, the burden is on the government to show beyond a reasonable doubt that this error was harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948. Because there is no clear indication of what sentence the district court would have imposed had it known the Guidelines were advisory only, we hold that the government has not met its burden to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
