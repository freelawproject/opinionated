Because the Petitioners\u2019 removal proceedings commenced after 1 April 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), apply. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because they failed to argue the appropriate grounds for such relief. Therefore, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">The Petitioners are natives and citizens of Colombia who were admitted to the United States as non-immigrant visitors. Jaime was admitted on 6 August 2000 and authorized to stay until 30 June 2001, and Clara and Mayra were admitted on 28 November 2000 and authorized to stay until 27 May 2001. They remained in the United States beyond these dates and on 28 September 2001 were issued Notices to Appear by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging them with removability under Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-18\">On 9 October 2001, Jaime filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief on behalf of himself and his family. In his application, he alleged that he was offered employment by the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d) due to his expertise and knowledge of computers. According to Jaime, the ELN threatened him and his family when he refused the offer of employment, and he was kidnaped by the ELN but released on his promise to return and accept the job. After a hearing on the merits, the IJ denied the application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ found that Jaime (1) had not shown a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground because the ELN attempted to recruit him due to his knowledge, not his political views, and \u201c[rjecruitment of an individual by a gueril<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>la organization is not, in and of itself, persecution on account of a political opinion,\u201d Administrative Record \u201cAR\u201d at 73-74, (2) lacked credibility, and (3) could relocate to another area of Colombia without fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The Petitioners appealed the IJ\u2019s decision and argued that: (1) portions of the decision were \u201ctotally outside of the parameters of the U.S. Supreme Court <em>(Cardozar-Fonseca</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>case decision and the B. I.A. (Mogharrabi<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) [c]ase concept of the \u2018reasonable person,\u2019 \u201d AR at 18; (2) the decision was \u201cnot within the letter nor the spirit of the Refugee Act of 1980,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and (3) the IJ ignored (a) the fact that Petitioners were \u201cchosen political targets,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, and (b) the current country conditions, which has led to \u201ca civil war,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22. On 18 May 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, pursuant to 8 C. F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On 14 June 2004, the Petitioners filed a timely motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s decision. They argued that: (1) portions of the IJ\u2019s decision were \u201ctotally outside of the parameters set forth in the Supreme Court case decision of <em>Cardoza-Fonseca </em>and the B.I.A. case of <em>Mogharrabi, </em>where the concept of the \u2018reasonable person\u2019 is fully explained,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6; (2) the decision was \u201cnot within the letter, nor the spirit of the Refugee Act of 1980,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and (3) the IJ \u201cdid not give any weight to the persecution [they] endured in Colombia\u201d or consider current country conditions, which has led to \u201ca civil war,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8. The Petitioners asserted that they were entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because they had \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution based on [their] experienced persecution\u201d and \u201cwould be killed\u201d if they returned to Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The BIA denied the Petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration based on its finding that they had \u201cfailed to specify any particular errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision\u201d but merely reiterated, \u201cin conclusory fashion,\u201d the arguments they made on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 2. The BIA stated that it had considered those arguments before reaching a decision and would not revisit them. <em>Id. </em>This timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration followed. The Petitioners did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">The Petitioners argue that, in their motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, they listed the reasons for reconsideration and specified the particular errors of fact and law, including the IJ\u2019s failure to apply the \u201creasonable person\u201d concept to define \u201cwell-founded fear of future persecution,\u201d and the BIA\u2019s failure to consider that Jaime \u201cwas persecuted, threatened, and kidnaped by the ELN guerillas.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5, 6. The government responds that the Petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration merely reiterated the arguments raised in their brief in support of their appeal, which arguments the BIA already had considered and rejected. Thus, the government argues, the Petitioners\u2019 motion did not satisfy the standard for reconsideration, as it did not specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision or identify any legal argument or aspect of the case that had been overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Motions to reconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>er are disfavored in removal proceedings. <em>See Immigration and Naturalization Serv. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 814, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing motions to reopen and explaining that such motions are disfavored because \u201cas a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States\u201d). A motion to reconsider must specify \u201cthe errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In this case, the BIA correctly found that the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider failed to specify any error of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision, but merely reiterated arguments that were considered and rejected on appeal from the IJ\u2019s order denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The BIA properly denied the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s affirmation of the IJ\u2019s order of removal be: cause it only reiterated arguments that were advanced and rejected on appeal of the IJ\u2019s order denying Petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-11\">.
