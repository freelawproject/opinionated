Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellants\u2019 convictions. <em>See United States v. Swasey, </em>112 Fed.Appx. 5 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>For the reasons that follow, we affirm Appellants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">Appellants Charlie Lawrence (\u201cLawrence\u201d) and Cederick D. Swasey (\u201cSwasey\u201d) appeal their 70-month sentences for conviction as to Count 1 of the indictment (armed robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d)) and a consecutive 84-month sentence for conviction under Count 2 (using a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (ii)). Neither Lawrence nor Swasey raised any challenge to their sentences on direct appeal under <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>or the Sixth Amendment. Instead, Lawrence for the first time raised the argument that his sentences were un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>constitutional in his petition for certiorari. Swasey raised the issue for the first time in his petition for rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Appellants\u2019 failure to timely raise an argument challenging their sentences is fatal to this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\"><em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (considering the case in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and holding appellant abandoned challenge to his sentence because he did not raise the issue in his initial brief on appeal) (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001)); <em>see also United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1241 (11th Cir.2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">In the present case, the remand instructions do not demand a different conclusion. Because Lawrence and Swasey failed to timely raise a constitutional challenge to their sentences or any challenge to their sentences based upon <em>Apprendi </em>or any case applying the principle of <em>Apprendi </em>they have abandoned this argument. Thus, we affirm Appellants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"A0J\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
