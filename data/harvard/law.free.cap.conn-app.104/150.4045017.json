In both appeals, the defendants, the freedom of information commission (commission) and S,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim that the court improperly concluded that police records pertaining to the plaintiffs investigation of the alleged sexual abuse of S\u2019s minor child were exempt from disclosure under the state Freedom of Information Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 1-200 et seq. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our resolution of the defendants\u2019 appeals. On November 18, 1998, S requested a copy of the police reports concerning allegations that her minor child had been sexually assaulted. The plaintiff denied her request on the ground that the police reports contained uncorroborated allegations of criminal activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 15, 1998, S filed a complaint with the commission. The hearing officer agreed with the plaintiff and issued a report recommending that the complaint be dismissed. The commission conducted an in camera inspection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and subsequently ordered the plaintiff to disclose the police reports to S, finding that the allegations were corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The plaintiff commenced an administrative appeal to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 13, 2001, the court, <em>Dyer, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision remanding the matter to the commission. The court, sua sponte, raised the applicability of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101k (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commissioner of Children and Families shall maintain a registry of the commissioner\u2019s findings of abuse or neglect of children .... <em>The information contained in the registry and any other information relative to child abuse, wherever located, shall be confidential, subject to such statutes and regulations governing their use and access as shall conform to the requirements of federal law or regulations. </em>Any violation of this section or the regulations adopted by the commissioner under this section shall be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The court concluded that \u201cthe issue must be resolved because of the important public policy of protecting the welfare of children, and because the ordered disclosure may be violative of the law mandating the confidentiality of child abuse records wherever located.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Nevertheless, because the applicability of \u00a7 17a-101k had not been argued or considered, the court remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Following the remand order, the hearing officer concluded that \u00a7 17a-101k exempted the record from disclosure and recommended that S\u2019s complaint be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>dismissed. The commission rejected the hearing officer\u2019s report, as well as a second report that also recommended dismissing S\u2019s complaint. On December 23, 2004, the hearing officer issued a third report, this time recommending that the record be released in a redacted form. On February 9, 2005, the commission voted to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s third report.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The commission found that the police records sought by S constituted \u201cinformation relative to child abuse, wherever located\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 17a-101k (a). It further found that because S, the parent of the victim, requested the information, there was an implied waiver of the confidentially requirement of \u00a7 17a-101k. The commission also determined that the allegations contained in the report were corroborated. Accordingly, the commission concluded that the plaintiff improperly had withheld the police report and that it should have been released, subject to certain redactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In a petition filed March 30, 2005, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, arguing that the commission\u2019s order to release the police reports should be vacated. On January 31, 2006, the court, <em>Pinkus, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision sustaining the plaintiffs appeal. The court concluded that the commission improperly had determined that there had been an implied waiver of \u00a7 17a-101k. The court further was concerned that \u201cthe implied waiver of confidentiality, if allowed, would open these records to members of the general public.\u201d These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">It will be helpful to set forth the legal principles that guide the resolution of both appeals before us. Our legislature passed the act in 1975. <em>Rules Committee of the Superior Court </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 234, 240, 472 A.2d 9 (1984). The act is \u201cour right-to-know law, providing for disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>public information . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>22 Conn. App. 316, 320, 577 A.2d 300, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 814, 580 A.2d 56 (1990). Our Supreme Court has \u201cstated that the [act] expresses a strong legislative policy in favor of the open conduct of government and free public access to government records. ... At the time of its unanimous passage by the General Assembly, the act was noted for making sweeping changes in the existing right to know law so as to mark a new era in Connecticut with respect to opening up the doors of city and state government to the people of Connecticut. . . . The general rule under the act is disclosure.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 550, 436 A.2d 266 (1980); see also <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 196, 585 A.2d 96 (1991) (act makes disclosure of public records statutory norm).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Our legislature, however, has balanced this general rule with the need to exempt certain records from disclosure to the public. See, e.g., <em>Batte-Holmgren </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>281 Conn. 277, 302 n.14, 914 A.2d 996 (2007). General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) enumerates various exemptions from disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, documents that are not \u201cpublic records\u201d are not subject to disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1-210 (a). See <em>Fromer </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>90 Conn. App. 101, 109, 875 A.2d 590 (2005). Finally, as provided by the first sentence of \u00a7 1-210 (a), the act recognizes that federal law and other state statutes may exclude certain records. See <em>Commissioner v. Freedom of Information Commission, </em>204 Conn. 609, 621-22, 529 A.2d 692 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We now set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cOrdinarily, [o]ur resolution of [administrative appeals] is guided by the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; to the determinations made by an administrative agency. [W]e must decide, in view of all the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u201cA reviewing court, however, is not required to defer to an improper application of the law. ... It is the function of the courts to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . We previously have recognized that the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts, where the administrative decision is not entitled to special deference. . . . Questions of law [invoke] a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Because this case forces us to examine a question of law, namely, the construction and interpretation of [statutes] as well as the standard to be applied, our review is de novo.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Director, Retirement &amp; Benefits Services Division </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>256 Conn. 764, 770-72, 775 A.2d 981 (2001). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>other words, the issue before us is one of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Our Supreme Court previously has instructed that \u201cin construing statutes, [the] fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loughlin </em>v. Loughlin, 280 Conn. 632, 641-42, 910 A.2d 963 (2006); <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Scherwitzky Gutter Co., </em>279 Conn. 265, 273, 901 A.2d 1176 (2006). \u201cIn seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kinsey </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>277 Conn. 398, 405, 891 A.2d 959 (2006); <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 129, 848 A.2d 451 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>\u201cCourts may not </em>by construction supply omissions ... or <em>add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them. . . . </em>The intent of the legislature, as [our appellate courts have] repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. <em>... It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the </em>legislature.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 216, 901 A.2d 673 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(2006). Mindful of these tenets of statutory construction, we turn to the specifics of each appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">AC 27390</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In the appeal designated AC 23790, S challenges the decision of the court sustaining the plaintiffs appeal. Specifically, S argues that \u00a7\u00a7 17a-101k and 1-210 (b) (3) (F) both seek to maintain confidentiality concerning child abuse records and, therefore, must be read together to create a consistent body of law. She further maintains that the court interpreted \u00a7 17a-101k too broadly by concluding that the police records were confidential and not subject to disclosure under the act. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">As we noted previously, \u00a7 1-210 (b) sets forth certain exemptions from the general rule of public disclosure under the act. Specifically, \u00a7 1-210 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in the Freedom of Information Act shall be construed to require disclosure of . . . (3) Records of law enforcement agencies not otherwise available to the public which records were compiled in connection with the detection or investigation of crime, if the disclosure of said records would not be in the public interest because it would result in the disclosure of . . . (F) the name and address of the victim of a sexual assault under section 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-73a, or injury or risk of injury, or impairing of morals under section 53-21, or of an attempt thereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Section 17a-101k provides in relevant part that any information, wherever located, regarding information of child abuse shall be confidential, subject to federal law and regulations. This statutory language has not been the subject of substantial judicial inteipretation. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[a]ny information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>that is gathered concerning the reports of suspected abuse ... is prohibited from public disclosure.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>267 Conn. 539, 553-54, 839 A.2d 1259 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The plaintiff refers to the commission\u2019s prior consideration of the scope of \u00a7 17a-101k. For example, in <em>Pflederer v. Dept. of Public Health, </em>FIC 1997-230 (February 11, 1998), the commission stated that \u00a7 17a-101k provides <em>\u201ca broad grant of confidentiality </em>with respect to information pertaining to child abuse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Resources, </em>FIC 93-213 (June 22,1994) (concluding identical language in General Statutes [Rev. 1995] \u00a7 17a-101 [g] constituted \u201cbroad grant of confidentiality\u201d as to information pertaining to child abuse); <em>DeRosa </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>FIC 92-12 (February 26, 1992) (same). The plaintiff contends that the commission\u2019s interpretation of language contained in \u00a7 17a-101k in the present case to allow for disclosure is contrary to these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">S essentially argues that the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 17a-101k creates a conflict with \u00a7 1-210 (b) (3) (F) and seeks to \u201cnullify the commissioner\u2019s clear authority ... to determine whether the disclosure of certain law enforcement records is permissible as long as the \u2018names and addresses of the victim of injury or risk of injury\u2019 are not disclosed.\u201d Put another way, S claims that in order to effectuate both statutes, the commission must balance the two statutes. In our view, however, the court properly determined that the mandate set forth in \u00a7 17a-101k controlled the resolution of the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The statutes in question, although overlapping in some respects, afford different protection from disclosure to different classes of persons. First, \u00a7 1-210 (b) (3) (F) prevents disclosure, under the act, of the names and addresses of <em>any </em>victim of a sexual assault under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-73a, <em>regardless of age, </em>whereas the confidentiality requirement contained in \u00a7 17a-101k offers protection only to children whom have been abused. Second, \u00a7 1-210 (b) (3) (F) prevents the disclosure of the names and addresses of victims of sexual assault and risk of injury unconditionally, while the protection afforded by \u00a7 17a-101k is subject to conditions set forth in federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In our view, \u00a7 17a-101k falls within the opening sentence of \u00a7 1-210 (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (a). In other words, because \u00a7 17a-101k mandates confidentiality of information regarding child abuse, records of child abuse, wherever located, are exempted from the general rule of disclosure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the court properly interpreted the relevant statutes and concluded that the police records sought by S were not subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">AC 27389</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In the appeal designated AC 27389, the commission appeals from the decision of the court sustaining the plaintiffs appeal. Specifically, the commission argues that the court should have concluded that the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 17a-101k was implicitly waived by S when she requested the police records. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>At the outset, we note that our jurisprudence recognizes the applicability of waiver with respect to the act and the disclosure of information. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 1-214 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever a public agency receives a request to inspect or copy records contained in any of its employees\u2019 personnel or medical files and similar files and the agency reasonably believes that the disclosure of such records would legally constitute an invasion of privacy, the agency shall immediately notify in writing (1) each employee concerned, provided such notice shall not be required to be in writing where impractical due to the large number of employees concerned and (2) the collective bargaining representative, if any, of each employee concerned. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 1-214 (c) affords such an employee the opportunity to file a written objection; otherwise, the information is subject to disclosure. Furthermore, the employee may authorize disclosure of the information, even if his or her collective bargaining representative has submitted a written objection. General Statutes \u00a7 1-214 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Another example of waiver in the context of the act is found in General Statutes \u00a7 10-151c. This statute exempts records of teacher performance and evaluation from disclosure under the act because they are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>considered public records. It also expressly permits a teacher to waive the exemption. \u201cAny records maintained or kept on file by any local or regional board of education which are records of teacher performance and evaluation shall not be deemed to be public records and shall not be subject to the provisions of section 1-210, <em>provided that any teacher may consent in writing to the release of such teacher\u2019s records by a board of education. </em>Such consent shall be required for each request for a release of such records. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 10-151c. In both examples, the subject of the records sought, rather than the requestor, has the authority to waive the nondisclosure protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The matter before us, however, presents an unusual situation in which the subject of the information sought and the requestor are the same person; S acted in a dual capacity as both the decision maker for her child and as a member of the general public seeking information. Mindful of this anomaly, we must determine whether S could implicitly waive the protections afforded to her child by the sweeping scope of \u00a7 17a-101k.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">As a preliminary manner, it will be helpful to set forth the background regarding confidentiality of records of child abuse. Congress enacted the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, authorizing grants to states for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5106a et seq.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>requirements in order for a state to be eligible for such a grant is a confidentiality provision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5106a (b) (2) (A) (v). This statute is implemented by regulations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Runge, </em>317 Md. 613, 619, 566 A.2d 88 (1989); see also <em>Cure </em>v. <em>State, </em>600 So. 2d 415, 417 (Ala. Crim. App.), cert. denied, 600 So. 2d 421 (1992). Specifically, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1340.14 (h) (i) (1) provides that \u201c[t]he State must provide by statute that all records concerning reports and reports of child abuse and neglect are confidential and that their unauthorized disclosure is a criminal offense.\u201d The regulations further permit a state, in its discretion, to authorize by statute disclosure to a defined class of persons and agencies, including \u201c[a] child named in the report or record alleged to have been abused or neglected or (as his/her representative) his/her guardian or guardian ad litem . . . .\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1340.14 (h) (i) (2) (ix).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Our legislature, in enacting \u00a7 17a-101k (a), used unrestricted language that states that <em>\u201cany other information relative to child abuse, wherever located, shall be </em>confidential\u201d and is only \u201csubject to such regulations governing their use and access as shall conform to the requirements of federal law or regulation.\u201d In other words, the General Assembly has not employed the permissive discretion, as authorized by the federal government, to allow for disclosure to any of the persons or agencies listed in the regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[a]ny information that is gathered concerning the reports of suspected abuse . . . is prohibited from public disclosure.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 553-54.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given this context, which clearly favors confidentiality, we now turn to the question of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We begin by addressing the status of S as a requestor of the records through the act. The commission found that S implicitly waived the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 17a-101k by requesting the police records of the alleged sexual abuse of her child. The issue of whether a record is disclosable under the act \u201cdoes not depend in any way on the status or motive of the applicant for disclosure, because the act vindicates the public\u2019s right to know, rather than the rights of any individual.\u201d <em>Chief of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>252 Conn. 377, 387, 746 A.2d 1264 (2000); see also <em>Pane </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>267 Conn. 669, 680, 841 A.2d 684 (2004) (legislature enacted act for benefit of general public, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>which desires information regarding conduct of its government); <em>Bona </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>44 Conn. App. 622, 630, 691 A.2d 1 (1997) (act provides public with right to know government information). It is clear, therefore, that S\u2019s status as the parent of the alleged victim is immaterial to the request for the police records under the act. We agree with the statement of the court that \u201cS is not seeking the information as a parent.\u201d By invoking the act to request the records, S is not seeking the records as a parent but, rather, as a member of the general public. This case, therefore, is unlike the situation in which an employee or teacher, the subject of the requested information, waives nondisclosure protection. We conclude, therefore, that S\u2019s status as a parent, in the context of her request pursuant to the act, has no bearing on the issue of whether she had waived the confidentiality requirement of \u00a7 17a-101k and was therefore entitled to the police records. Additionally, we note that both S and the commission conceded that if the police reports were disclosed to her, they would be available to the general public. Under these circumstances, a decision by the commission recognizing waiver would be, in effect, allowing a member of the general public to waive the protection of \u00a7 17a-101k, which would be a bizarre result. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the law favors rational and sensible statutory construction, and that the courts interpret statutes to avoid bizarre or nonsensical results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>92 Conn.

Our General Assembly may want to consider a similar framework to allow, in the appropriate circumstances, persons similarly situated to S access to such records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> We note that \u00a7 17a-101-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, governing the department of children and families, provides in relevant part: \u201c(2) Additional persons eligible only for routine access to the registry include the following: (A) Any person named in the report or record who is alleged to be abused or neglected; if the person named in the report or record is a minor or is otherwise incompetent, his guardian ad litem or conservator; (B) A parent, guardian of other person responsible for the welfare of a child named in a report or record or their attorney except that the name or names of persons reporting the incidents of alleged abuse shall not be discharged . . . .\u201d In other words, this regulation affords S access to information contained in the registry maintained by the department of children and families but does not extend to police reports pertaining to allegations of child abuse maintained by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b190-4\"> As we previously indicated, our law recognizes that information that is not available to the public may be disclosed after waiver by an individual. Unlike the situation involving an employee\u2019s personnel or medical file, or a teacher\u2019s evaluation, there is no established procedure for a determination of the validity of a purported waiver of \u00a7 17a-101k. For example, \u00a7 10-151c expressly states that a teacher may disclose his or her performance evaluations by writing to the board of education. There is no such provision in \u00a7 17a-101k. Additionally, our legislature has not provided access to records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>of child abuse to any person or agency, despite the discretion to do so by the federal regulation. Finally, we note that the alleged victims are not the only parties protected by this statute; other persons named in such reports have privacy interests at stake as well. For example, our Supreme Court has staled that the confidentiality statute is likely designed to protect the accused abuser. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 555. Depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, siblings, other family members, day care providers and those subjected to false or unsubstantiated allegations also may have privacy interests. It is clear that S\u2019s waiver could not include all of these parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
