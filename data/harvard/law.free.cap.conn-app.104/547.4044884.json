The plaintiff, Geraldine D. Lyon, appeals from the trial court\u2019s dismissal, on the basis of sovereign immunity, of her claims against the defendants, the office of the attorney general (attorney general\u2019s office), and certain of its employees, Virginia Jones and Edward Reynolds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>At the time this case began, the plaintiff was a paralegal specialist 1 at the attorney general\u2019s office and had worked in that capacity since 1987. On April 18, 2000, she filed a complaint with the commission on human rights and opportunities (commission) alleging har assment and a hostile work environment, and that she was denied a promotion to paralegal specialist 2 on the discriminatory bases of her age, sex and disability. The commission found that the plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence to show discrimination and issued a release of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The plaintiff then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, claiming that the defendants discriminated against her on the bases of age, sex and disability in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111 et seq. (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq. (Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (Title VII), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 (a), 46a-60 (a) (1) and 46a-70(a) of the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 et seq. She sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, a temporary and permanent injunction and other fair and equitable relief. The District Court dismissed all of her state law based claims and the majority of her federal claims, leaving only her claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which alleged a hostile work environment and failure to promote.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Upon the dismissal by the District Court of her claims based on state law, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the judicial district of Hartford. The plaintiffs amended complaint consisted of four counts alleging age, sex and disability discrimination: one count against the attorney general\u2019s office under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) and one count against each of the three defendants under \u00a7 46a-70 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">While the state claims were pending, the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the remaining federal claims. In its decision, the District Court found that the Title VII failure to promote claim was time barred, that there were no material issues of fact in support of the plaintiffs claim that she was treated differently from other similarly situated individuals, that her treatment was insufficiently severe to create a hostile environment either under Title VII or \u00a7 1983, and that there was no discriminatory intent. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>260 F. Sup. 2d 507 (D. Conn. 2003), aff'd, 91 Fed. Appx. 196 (2d Cir. 2004). Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with the trial court, claiming, inter alia, that the doctrines of sovereign immunity and collateral estoppel bar the plaintiff from recovery in state court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On February 28, 2006, the court issued a lengthy memorandum of decision dismissing the \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (l)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claim against the attorney general\u2019s office for lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to obtain the requisite authorization from the claims commissioner before bringing her \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) claim against the state. The court also found that although General Statutes \u00a7 46a-99 provides plaintiffs with a private right of action for injunctive relief for discrimination by the state in violation of \u00a7 46a-70 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a claim for compensatory and punitive damages and costs cannot be brought under \u00a7 46a-70 (a) without permission to sue from the claims commissioner or the General Assembly. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">First, we consider whether the court properly dismissed the plaintiffs \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) claim against the attorney general\u2019s office for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court dismissed this claim suasponte under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, concluding that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165 require the plaintiff to obtain authorization from the claims commissioner or the General Assembly prior to bringing a claim against the state under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). After reviewing the applicable statutes, we agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">We begin our analysis with the appropriate standard of review as set forth by our Supreme Court. \u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss. ... A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 313, 828 A.2d 549 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of the common law that a state cannot be sued without its consent. ... A sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends. . . . The practical and logical basis of the doctrine is today recognized to rest on this principle and on the hazard that the subjection of the state and federal governments to private litigation might constitute a serious interference with the performance of their functions and with their control over their respective instrumentalities, funds, and property.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>263 Conn. 74, 78-79, 818 A.2d 758 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\u201cWe have held that a plaintiff seeking to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity must show that: (1) the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity ... or (2) in an action for declaratory or injunctive relief, the state officer or officers against whom such relief is sought acted in excess of statutory authority, or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The plaintiff sued the attorney general\u2019s office, alleging discriminatory employment practices under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1), which broadly prohibits employment discrimination by all employers and their agents in the state of Connecticut. See footnote 4. The plaintiff contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>that she properly initiated her complaint with the commission. She further argues that upon release of jurisdiction by the commission, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-100 waives the state\u2019s immunity, permitting her to bring her \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) claim directly in Superior Court. Our examination of the relevant statutes, however, reveals no express or implied waiver of the state\u2019s immunity for claims under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Chapter 53 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165, titled \u201cClaims Against the State,\u201d describes the responsibilities and powers of the claims commissioner. From this legislation, it is apparent that the General Assembly intended to make the claims commissioner the gatekeeper through which lawsuits against the state must pass. \u201c[Chapter 53] expressly bars suits upon claims cognizable by the claims commissioner except as he may authorize, an indication of the legislative determination to preserve sovereign immunity as a defense to monetary claims against the state not sanctioned by the commissioner or other statutory provisions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 317-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Furthermore, chapter 53 evidences the legislature\u2019s clear intent to provide the claims commissioner with the authority to decide whether to waive sovereign immunity for claims against the attorney general\u2019s office. General Statutes \u00a7 4-141 provides in relevant part that \u201c \u2018state agency\u2019 includes every department, division, board, office, commission, arm, agency and institution of the state government, whatever its title or function . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Nevertheless, the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 46a-100 waives the state\u2019s immunity. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-100 provides: \u201cAny person who has timely filed a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities in accordance with section 46a-82 and who has obtained a release from the commission in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>with section 46a-83a or 46a-101, may also bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district in which the discriminatory practice is alleged to have occurred or in which the respondent transacts business, except any action involving a state agency or official may be brought in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the phrase \u201cany action involving a state agency or official may be brought in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford\u201d provides a waiver of the state\u2019s immunity to suit. We are not persuaded. In light of the requirement that our state\u2019s sovereign immunity not be diminished without clear intent, we find that the more reasoned interpretation of this clause regards venue and provides for the Hartford judicial district to be the proper venue for a claim against a state actor. Thus, we believe that the provisions of \u00a7 46a-100 do not constitute a waiver of the state\u2019s immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Because there is no statute that carves out a specific waiver of sovereign immunity for \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) claims, the plaintiff was required to apply to the claims commissioner for permission to sue the attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cWhen a plaintiff brings an action for money damages against the state, he must proceed through the office of the claims commissioner pursuant to chapter 53 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165. Otherwise, the action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Prigge </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>265 Conn. 338, 349, 828 A.2d 542 (2003). We therefore affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We next consider whether the court properly dismissed the plaintiffs claims under \u00a7 46a-70 (a) on the ground that \u00a7 46a-99 does not waive sovereign immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>for money damages. We reiterate that this court\u2019s standard of review for a question of subject matter jurisdiction is plenary. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The question of whether \u00a7 46a-99 waives sovereign immunity in an action for money damages is an issue of first impression for this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the legislature is disclosed, by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>99 Conn. App. 492, 497, 913 A.2d 1146, cert. granted on other grounds, 281 Conn. 929, 918 A.2d 278 (2007). When interpreting a statute, \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46a-99 provides: \u201cAny person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of any provision of sections 46a-70 to 46a-78, inclusive, or sections 46a-81h to 46a-81o, inclusive, may petition the Superior Court for appropriate relief and said court shall have the power to grant such relief, by injunction or otherwise, as it deems just and suitable.\u201d The plain meaning of \u00a7 46a-99 provides a right of action for individuals with discrimination claims against the state (\u00a7\u00a7 46a-70 to 46a-78 or 46a-81h to 46a-81o) who are seeking injunctive relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The indefinite language, \u201cby injunction or otherwise,\u201d fails, however, to convey whether the legislature intended to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity from liability to pay money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201c[Bjecause the state has permitted itself to be sued in certain circumstances, this court has recognized the well established principle that statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity should be strictly construed. . . . Where there is any doubt about their meaning or intent they are given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity. . . . Further, this court has stated that the state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the legislature is disclosed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 82. An examination of \u00a7 46a-99, in relation to other statutes that expressly waive the state\u2019s immunity to claims for money damages, reveals that the General Assembly is quite capable of waiving the state\u2019s immunity when it intends to do so. For example, a person injured by a state employee driving a state owned and insured vehicle \u201cshall have a right of action against the state to recover damages for such injury.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-556.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Particularly instructive is General Statutes \u00a7 46a-98a, which provides a cause of action in the Superior Court for claims of discriminatory housing practices or sexual discrimination in housing. Section 46a-98a is located within the same chapter and part of the General Statutes as \u00a7 46a-99 and includes nearly identical language: \u201cThe court shall have the power to grant relief, by injunction or otherwise, as it deems just and suitable. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-98a. Unlike \u00a7 46a-99, \u00a7 46a-98a includes the express statement that the court may provide relief commensurate with that provided in the procedures detailed under \u00a7\u00a7 46a-86 and46a-89. Both \u00a7 46a-86 and \u00a7 46a-89 permit a claim for an award of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the legislature had intended to permit recovery of money damages in \u00a7 46a-99, it clearly knew how to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the court properly concluded that \u00a7 46a-99 does not constitute a waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity with respect to claims for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\"> The court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to the plaintiffs requests for injunctive relief under General Statutes \u00a7 46a-70 (a), concluding that the plaintiff was estopped from relitigating issues previously decided in federal court. See <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>260 F. Sup. 2d 507 (D. Conn. 2003), aff'd, 91 Fed. Appx. 196 (2d Cir. 2004). The plaintiff failed to challenge the court\u2019s findings of collateral estoppel in her principal brief. \u201c[Ojur practice requires an appellant to raise claims of error in his original brief, so that the issue as framed by him can be fully responded to by the appellee in its brief, and so that we can have the full benefit of that written argument. Although the function of the appellant\u2019s reply brief is to respond to the arguments and authority presented in the appellee\u2019s brief, that function does not include raising an entirely new claim of error. ... In accordance with this practice, we have consistently held that [tjhis court will not review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>claims that are raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Embalmers\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Giannitti, </em>103 Conn. App. 20, 60-61, 929 A.2d 729 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Also, the plaintiff raises no issue concerning the grant of summary judgment in regard to the claim under General Statutes \u00a7 46a-70 (a) against Jones.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> Upon completion of a merit assessment review, the executive director of the commission may issue a release, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-83a, which permits the complainant to bring an action in Superior Court within ninety days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\"> Alternatively, the defendants asserted that the failure to promote claim under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) was time barred and that the claims under \u00a7 46a-70 (a) were pleaded inadequately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section ...
