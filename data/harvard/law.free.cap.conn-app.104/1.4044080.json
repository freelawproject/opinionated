On the basis of the procedural posture of the case, however, we dismiss the appeal for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation claim arose out of a fall that occurred while he was working in the defendant\u2019s warehouse, storing mattresses. In a written decision dated February 11, 2004, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiffs injury was compensable, among other things. In addition, although it was not listed as an issue for the hearing, the commissioner found that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff \u201cleft him totally disabled, at least through the date of the last hearing, June 4, 2003.\u201d On the basis of this finding, the commissioner \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that the defendant pay the plaintiffs medical bills and total temporary benefits from January 18, 2000, to June 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The defendant appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board pursuant to the procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its opinion dated October 19, 2005, the board upheld the commissioner\u2019s findings as to the compensability of the plaintiffs injuries, yet concluded that the commissioner improperly considered whether the plaintiffs injury rendered him disabled and the amount of compensation to which he was entitled. Accordingly, the board ordered the parties to disregard the commissioner\u2019s findings as to plaintiffs disability status and announced that the statements concerning payment of the plaintiffs medical expenses were \u201cwithout legal consequence.\u201d The board did not, however, explicitly issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>a remand ordering the commissioner to determine whether the plaintiffs injuries rendered him disabled and, if so, the proper amount of any damages award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">It is well settled that a party must await the rendering of a final judgment by the board before appealing claims of law and fact to this court. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 293, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). \u201cThe test that determines whether such a decision is a final judgment turns on the scope of the proceedings on remand; if such further proceedings are merely ministerial, the decision is an appealable final judgment, but if further proceedings will require the exercise of independent judgment or discretion and the taking of additional evidence, the appeal is premature and must be dismissed. \u201d <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 556, 573 A.2d 1 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>282 Conn. 477, 923 A.2d 657 (2007) (en banc), our Supreme Court concluded that a judgment was interlocutory, and therefore not final, where the board upheld the commissioner\u2019s determination regarding compensability but where further proceedings, involving the exercise of independent judgment, would be required to determine the amount of the award. As in this case, the board in <em>Hummel </em>did not issue an express remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For purposes of final judgment, we find that case to be materially indistinguishable from the one at bar. Here, the board upheld the commissioner\u2019s findings as to the compensability of the plaintiffs injuries, but reversed the commissioner\u2019s findings as to the plaintiffs disability status and his recommendations as to the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of total temporary benefits and bills resulting from the plaintiffs fall. Because the board\u2019s decision left unresolved the question of whether the plaintiff was disabled, and if so, the appropriate amount of damages, further proceedings before the commissioner will be necessary. A determination of these remaining issues will require the commissioner to exercise independent judgment and discretion, as well as to consider additional evidence from the parties. Accordingly, under the principles established in <em>Szudora </em>and affirmed in <em>Hummel, </em>we conclude that this appeal must be dismissed for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-16\"> The workers\u2019 compensation insurer for Better Bedding, Inc., Seaco Insurance Company, also is a defendant but is not a party to the appeal. We therefore refer in this opinion to Better Bedding, Inc., as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b26-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time within twenty days after entry of an award by the commissioner . . . either party may appeal therefrom to the Compensation Review Board . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\"> The Supreme Court stated that although it is preferable for the board to use explicit remand language, the court was \u201cconfident that parties ordinarily will have little difficulty in ascertaining when such proceedings are contemplated even if the board decision is silent in that regard.\u201d <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 282 Conn. 489.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
