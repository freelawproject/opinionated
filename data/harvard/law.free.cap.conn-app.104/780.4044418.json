We affirm the judgment of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The panel reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant met the victim in late 1998. After a brief relationship, the victim became pregnant with the defendant\u2019s child. Before the child was bom in December, 1999, the relationship between the defendant and the victim had fallen into discord, and after the child was bom, the couple often fought over issues such as child support, visitation and parenting. The defendant often was fmstrated and angered by the victim\u2019s efforts to collect child support payments and to minimize her contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">On March 28, 2003, the victim planned to drop off the child for his scheduled visitation with the defendant. Over the course of that day, the defendant exchanged numerous telephone calls with the victim, arguing over the drop-off time. Ultimately, the victim arrived at the defendant\u2019s house at about 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Upon the victim\u2019s arrival at his home in Windsor, the defendant met the victim at her car and informed her that he would not take the child unless she agreed to discuss their visitation and support arrangements. When the victim refused to have any discussion with him, the defendant began walking back toward the house. The victim responded by shouting an expletive and striking the defendant from behind with an unknown object before turning her attention back toward the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Without further provocation, the defendant pulled from his pocket a three inch folding knife and attacked the victim with it, stabbing her twelve times in the head, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>neck, face, back, chest and buttocks. The defendant then picked up his child, who had just witnessed his father brutally assault his mother, and fled the scene in the victim\u2019s car. As the defendant drove off, two neighbors who had heard the struggle came to the victim\u2019s aid and summoned police and paramedics. The victim was pronounced dead upon her arrival at Hartford Hospital a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Meanwhile, the defendant drove the victim\u2019s car from Windsor to the Hartford police station. There he passed his child, whose clothing was stained with blood, to one of the officers on duty and informed the officer that he wanted to turn himself in on a \u201cdomestic dispute.\u201d Subsequently, the defendant was transferred to the custody of the Windsor police, to whom he confessed to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The state charged the defendant with murder and risk of injury to a child. The defendant elected a trial before a three judge panel, <em>Mullarkey </em>and <em>Keller, Js., </em>and <em>Hon. John F. Mulcahy, Jr., </em>judge trial referee. At trial, the defendant asserted the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. After several days of trial, the panel rendered judgment convicting the defendant of both charges. The court sentenced the defendant to forty-eight years incarceration for the murder conviction, twenty-five years mandatory, and to ten years incarceration for the risk of injury conviction, to be served concurrently with the murder sentence. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The defendant first claims that the panel improperly found that he had failed to prove his affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, the defendant argues that the panel could not have reasonably concluded that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>had not proved his defense because the panel improperly considered only whether a provoking or triggering event occurred, either on the day of the murder or during the days immediately prior, that exposed him to an extremely unusual or overwhelming state. Further, the defendant argues that the court improperly discredited the testimony of his expert witness. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[I]n any prosecution [for murder], it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be ... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Our Supreme Court has set forth the standard of review that guides our analysis. \u201c[0]ur review of the conclusions of the trier of fact, whether it be a judge, a panel of judges or a jury, is limited. . . . This court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s [judgment] and will affirm the conclusion of the trier of fact if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . . The probative force of direct and circumstantial evidence is the same.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 676, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S. Ct. 911, 142 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1999). \u201cUltimately, the question is whether upon the facts established and the inferences drawn therefrom the fact-finder could have reasonably concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence failed to establish that the defendant acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. In sum, except where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>an abuse of discretion is clearly shown, the conclusion of a trial court should be affirmed so long as it is a reasonable one on the basis of the evidence adduced and the inferences drawn therefrom. ... In the final analysis . . . the ultimate determination of the presence or absence of extreme emotional disturbance [is] one of fact for the trier, aided by the expert testimony of both sides, but left to its own factual determinations. \u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 677-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[e]xtreme emotional disturbance is a mitigating circumstance which will reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter. . . . Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b), [w]hen a defense declared to be an affirmative defense is raised at a trial, the defendant shall have the burden of establishing such defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 675-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">\u201cA homicide influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance ... is not one which is necessarily committed in the \u2018hot blood\u2019 stage, but rather one that was brought about by a significant mental trauma that caused the defendant to brood for a long period of time and then react violently, seemingly without provocation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, 177 </em>Conn. 1, 7-8, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). \u201cFor the defendant to have prevailed on this defense, he would have had to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had caused the death of the victim under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse measured from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. . . . To sustain his burden of establishing extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>persuade the trier of fact that: (1) the emotional disturbance is not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of insanity as defined by the penal code; (2) the defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state, that is, not mere annoyance or unhappiness; and (3) the defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there was a loss of self-control, and reason was overborne by extreme intense feeling, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 676-77. \u201cConsideration is given to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that his usual intellectual controls failed and the normal rational thinking for that individual no longer prevailed at the time of the act. . . . [T]he term \u2018extreme\u2019 refers to the greatest degree of intensity away from the norm for that individual.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the panel made specific findings with respect to each of the factual bases that would support a finding of extreme emotional disturbance. First, the panel found that \u201cthe defendant did not suffer from any emotional disturbance that consisted of a mental disease or defect that rose to the level of insanity as defined by the penal code.\u201d Further, the panel found that the defendant had indeed lost his self-control on the night he killed the victim. Most importantly, however, the panel unanimously found that the defendant\u2019s loss of self-control was not caused by \u201can extremely unusual and overwhelming state that was not mere annoyance or unhappiness.\u201d In support of its finding, the panel stated: \u201cThe evidence disclosed a contentious relationship between the defendant and the victim, with ongoing animosity over issues of child support and visitation for a period of four years prior to the date of the incident. For most of this time period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the defendant and the victim were able to maintain contact and a shared parenting arrangement, despite constant arguments and consequent resentment and hurt feelings. We heard no evidence that made March 28, 2003, or the period immediately preceding that date, extremely different in intensity from any other period during the defendant\u2019s and [the victim\u2019s] relationship. Not only was there no one event or series of events that occurred out of the norm on or immediately before March 28 that reasonably provoked an extreme emotional disturbance, there also was never any single event or series of events during the course of the relationship that were so extreme they might reasonably have caused the defendant to lose control after brooding for a longer period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The record in this case clearly supports the finding that when he attacked the victim, the defendant was overcome by something that caused him to lose his self-control. The panel, however, found \u201cno reasonable explanation or excuse, measured from \u2018the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be,\u2019 to justify his loss of self-control . . . .\u2019\u2019In reaching its conclusion, the panel noted that \u201c[disputes over money, visitation, parenting and perceived infidelity were a <em>regular </em>occurrence between the victim and the defendant,\u201d and that the \u201ccircumstances on March 28, 2003, were <em>not significantly different </em>from those surrounding any of the couple\u2019s prior interactions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although this language does highlight the absence of a provoking or triggering event that might have led to the attack, the memorandum as a whole also makes clear that the panel examined the defendant\u2019s entire four year relationship with the victim for signs that the defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state that was not mere annoyance or unhappiness, but found none. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>The panel reasonably could have reached this conclusion on the basis of the evidence before it. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We also find no merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that the panel improperly discredited testimony by his expert witness. Although the defendant introduced expert testimony in support of his affirmative defense and the state offered no rebuttal, the court was not obligated to adopt the expert\u2019s conclusions as its own. The trier of fact can disbelieve any or all of the evidence proffered concerning the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, including expert testimony, and can construe such evidence in a manner different from the defendant\u2019s assertions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 201, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). The fact, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s expert witness supported his claim of extreme emotional disturbance, while the state chose to call no expert witness, but instead relied on cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s expert, does not require this court to determine that the panel reasonably could not have concluded that the defendant had failed to prove extreme emotional disturbance by the required standard. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">During cross-examination, the state elicited testimony from the defendant\u2019s expert that reasonably could have called the plausibility of his opinion into question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIn a case tried before a court, the [panel] is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. . . . On appeal, we will give the evidence the most favorable reasonable construction in support of the verdict to which it is entitled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coscuna, </em>59 Conn. App. 434, 444, 757 A.2d 659 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Thus, the record provides ample support for the panel\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state that was not mere annoyance or unhappiness at the time he stabbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly admitted testimony under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. Specifically, the defendant claims that the panel improperly allowed the victim\u2019s mother and brother to testify that prior to the victim\u2019s death, the victim had told them of her fear of the defendant. The defendant argues that the victim\u2019s statements were hearsay and inadmissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. Further, the defendant argues that even if the victim\u2019s statements were admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, they were not relevant to any issue before the panel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">During the state\u2019s direct examination of the victim\u2019s brother, the witness stated that at one point, the victim had expressed to him her fear of the defendant. The state then asked the witness: \u201c[W]hat did she say?\u201d The witness responded: \u201cShe said that one of these days, he\u2019s going to hurt me. I think one of these days, he\u2019s going to hurt me.\u201d During the state\u2019s direct examination of the victim\u2019s mother, the state elicited similar responses to essentially the same questions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the testimony on the grounds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>responses were both inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">\u201cTo the extent a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. They require determinations about which reasonable minds may not differ; there is no judgment call by the trial court, and the trial court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion. ... In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218-19, 926 A.2d 633 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\u201c[ A]n out-of-court statement that is offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is inadmissible hearsay unless the statement falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>261 Conn. 336, 355, 803 A.2d 267 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1217, 123 S. Ct. 1318, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2003). \u201cAn out-of-court statement is not hearsay, however, if it is offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then present state of mind, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 632, 626 A.2d 273 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In this case, the testimony of both witnesses, the victim\u2019s brother and the victim\u2019s mother, was not hearsay. Although the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements to the witnesses foreshadowed her death at the hands of the defendant, the state offered the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements not to prove that he did, in fact, harm her, but to prove circumstantially the victim\u2019s state of mind, that she was afraid of the defendant. We find no distinction between these statements and the statements challenged by the defendant in Blades.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>conclude that the court properly overruled the defendant\u2019s hearsay objections to the witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s second argument, relevancy, \u201c[e]vidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be wdthout the evidence. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1. There is no exact or universal test of relevancy. Rather, each such determination must be guided by sound legal reasoning and judicial experience. ... A fact is relevant to another if in the normal course of events its existence, alone or in conjunction with other facts, makes the existence of the other fact more likely or more certain. . . . The probative value of evidence is merely its tendency to persuade the trier of fact on a given issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>97 Conn. App. 719, 726-27, 906 A.2d 705 (2006), cert. denied, 281 Conn. 913, 916 A.2d 55 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cevidence of a victim\u2019s mental state may be relevant to establish the defendant\u2019s motive to kill the victim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 356. Further, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s articulated or implied theory of defense may make the victim\u2019s state of mind material to the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 357. For example, a defendant\u2019s assertion of an extreme emotional disturbance defense may put the victim\u2019s state of mind into issue. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In this case, the defendant asserted the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. In support of this defense, the defendant elicited testimony from several witnesses that the victim was the antagonist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>who caused the breakdown in their relationship and that his violence toward her was completely at odds with the way in which he normally handled their conflicts. Evidence that the victim harbored fear of the defendant, therefore, would be relevant to rebut his claims. Accordingly, the panel did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony for purposes of rebutting the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b805-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who (1) wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of such child is endangered, the health of such child is likely to be iryured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child . . . shall be guilty of a class C felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> For example, the defendant\u2019s expert testified that in conducting his evaluation of the defendant, he failed to explore several available sources of relevant information, including the victim\u2019s family and friends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\"> The defendant also argues that the court improperly admitted the victim\u2019s statements in violation of the rule for admissibility of nontestimonial hearsay as set forth in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.
