On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Our review of the record discloses the following facts relative to the defendant\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 7, 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Michael Morgan, a Newington police detective, was assigned to traffic detail for the purpose of accident reduction and safety on the Berlin Turnpike. At approximately 11:20 p.m., Morgan observed the driver of a Nissan Altima, subsequently identified as the defendant, make two abrupt lane changes in heavy traffic without using a turn signal. On the basis of this observation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Morgan stopped the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following his usual procedure, Morgan reported the license plate number of the Altima to a police dispatcher, alerted the dispatcher that he had commenced a traffic stop and provided his location.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Morgan proceeded to the driver\u2019s window and asked the defendant to produce his driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration and insurance card. After the defendant complied with this request, Morgan returned to his unmarked police vehicle. Morgan characterized the defendant as appearing \u201cunusually nervous compared to someone who\u2019s stopped for such a routine traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>violation.\u201d The defendant produced a New Jersey driver\u2019s license and a vehicle rental agreement in lieu of a registration. The vehicle was registered in Pennsylvania. Morgan called in the defendant\u2019s information to the dispatcher in order to determine if the license was valid and if there were \u201cany wants, warrants or cautions\u201d associated with the defendant. After learning that the license was valid and that there were no outstanding warrants, Morgan nevertheless requested the defendant\u2019s consent to search the vehicle and called another officer for backup assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Morgan proceeded to fill out an infraction ticket for the traffic violation that he had observed. By the time he finished filling out the ticket, Derrick Sutton, a Newington police sergeant, had arrived at the scene. At this point, Morgan returned to the defendant and asked him to get out of the vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Morgan inquired whether the defendant \u201chad anything illegal on him.\u201d The defendant responded in the negative. Morgan testified that he did not believe that the defendant was armed. Nevertheless, Morgan searched him but did not find anything illegal on the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">After he explained the ticket, Morgan asked the defendant if he had anything illegal in the vehicle. Morgan stated that the basis for this question was the defendant\u2019s nervousness, combined with the facts that the rented Altima had a Pennsylvania registration and license plate and that the defendant had a New Jersey driver\u2019s license and claimed that he was coming from New York where he had visited his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The defendant responded to Morgan\u2019s inquiry by stating: \u201c[N]ope, just some beer on the passenger seat floor; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>go ahead and check. You can check if you want.\u201d Morgan instructed the defendant to move away from the vehicle and to stand with Sutton, behind the Altima. He then began to search the interior of the Altima. He opened the center console and found a package wrapped in white paper. Morgan unwrapped the paper and found a plastic ziplock bag containing a white powder substance that he believed to be cocaine. After Morgan completed his search of the front area of the Altima, the defendant was placed under arrest for possession of cocaine and handcuffed. Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, the back area of the Altima and the trunk were searched. A large quantity of heroin and an additional amount of cocaine were found in the trunk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On July 13, 2004, the defendant filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence seized in the search. The court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion on December 16, 2004, at which Morgan was the sole witness. On January 14, 2005, the court heard legal arguments from the state and defense counsel. On February 17, 2005, the court issued a memorandum of decision denying the motion to suppress. The court found that \u201cthere was no untoward conduct on either the part of . . . Morgan or . . . Sutton [and] that there was no threatening, coercive or overpowering behavior exhibited at any time during this incident.\u201d The court further found that \u201cthe defendant voluntarily and knowingly gave permission to have his vehicle searched [and that] the defendant never withdrew this consent. \u201cThe court did not accept or credit the defendant\u2019s claim that his statement to the police that evening was meant only to have the officer look at the beer in his car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">On March 18, 2005, the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the charge of possession of narcotics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent. The court sentenced the defendant to twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after eight years, and five years probation. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The standard of review in connection with the court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is well settled. As stated by our Supreme Court: \u201cThis involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. That is the standard and scope of this court\u2019s judicial review of decisions of the trial court. Beyond that, we will not go. ... In other words, to the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether those findings were clearly erroneous. Where, however, the trial court has drawn conclusions of law, our review is plenary, and we must decide whether those conclusions are legally and logically correct in light of the findings of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>262 Conn. 686, 694, 817 A.2d 76 (2003); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Foote, 85 </em>Conn. App. 356, 360, 857 A.2d 406 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 937, 875 A.2d 43, 44 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carcare, 75 </em>Conn. App. 756, 764, 818 A.2d 53 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>We begin by reviewing the legal principles pertaining to the claims raised on appeal by the defendant. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment to the United States constitution protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search and seizures. Ordinarily, police may not conduct a search unless they first obtain a search warrant from a neutral magistrate after establishing probable cause. [A] search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is <em>per se </em>unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 423, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u201cA warrantless search ... is not unreasonable, however, under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution . . . when a person with authority to do so has freely consented. . . . It is . . . well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search [or seizure] that is conducted pursuant to consent. . . . Whether a defendant has voluntarily consented to a search is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances. The trial court makes this determination on the basis of the evidence that it deems credible along with the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wragg, </em>61 Conn. App. 394, 401, 764 A.2d 216 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Azuka, </em>278 Conn. 267, 275, 897 A.2d 554 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence. Specifically, he argues that (1) even if his consent to search the vehicle had been voluntary, it was tainted by a prior, unconstitutional search of his person, (2) the state failed to establish that he actually consented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>search of the vehicle, (3) any consent to search was not given voluntarily and (4) any consent to search was obtained by a violation of the Connecticut constitution by the police improperly converting a traffic stop into a criminal investigation. We conclude that the defendant was unlawfully detained, that his consent to search the vehicle was tainted by that illegal detention and that the state failed to purge the taint of the illegal detention. For those reasons, the evidence procured through the defendant\u2019s consent should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The defendant argues that even if he had voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle, any evidence found was tainted as a result of the illegal search of his person that occurred prior to the search of the vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state contends that this claim is being raised for the first time on appeal and is, therefore, unreviewable. The state further argues that the record is inadequate for review pursuant to the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s preservation of this issue and its reviewability, this claim formed the heart of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, filed in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>court, in which he claimed that the officer \u201cillegally detained the defendant for an extended period without probable cause or a reasonable and articulable suspicion . . . .\u201d On appeal, the defendant first raises this issue within his voluntariness claim by arguing that \u201c[t]he traffic stop . . . should have ended after Detective Morgan explained the traffic infraction to the defendant, at which time [Morgan] should have given him the traffic ticket and returned his documentation to him. Instead, the seizure of the defendant was extended even though the stop at its inception was justifiable only as a traffic stop and that the police had developed neither probable cause nor reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Further, the second assignment of error in the defendant\u2019s brief sets forth the issue of \u201c[w]hether the police violated the Connecticut [constitution by converting a traffic stop into a criminal investigation in which the defendant was detained by two officers in two police vehicles and searched without justification before he \u2018consented\u2019 to the search of his car.\u201d Within this claim, the defendant cites the dissent in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 51, 117 S. Ct. 417, 136 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting), for the proposition that when an officer completes the task of either arresting or reprimanding the driver of a speeding car, the officer\u2019s continued detention of that person constitutes an illegal seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s reply brief properly sets forth the claim that the search of his car during an extension of a routine, noncriminal traffic stop was unconstitutional. Thus, although the defendant, within the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis in his main appellate brief, argues that his consent to search the car was the product of the illegal search of his person, he neither limited his tainted consent claim to that sole issue nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>abandoned his claim that the detention was unreasonably prolonged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">It is axiomatic that <em>\u201d[t]he scope of [an investigative\\ detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification [and </em>the] <em>investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S. Ct. 1319, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1983). Thus, a stop pursuant to <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), \u201cthat is justified at its inception can become constitutionally infirm if it lasts longer or becomes more intrusive than necessary to complete the investigation for which that stop was made. . . . Like the determination of the initial justification, this inquiry is fact-bound. . . . The results of the initial stop may arouse further suspicion or may dispel the questions in the officer\u2019s mind. . . . If . . . the officer\u2019s suspicions are confirmed or are further aroused, the stop may be prolonged and the scope enlarged as required by the circumstances. . . . One function of a constitutionally permissible <em>Terry </em>stop is to maintain the status quo for a brief period of time to enable the police to investigate a suspected crime. A police officer who has proper grounds for stopping a suspect has constitutional permission to immobilize the suspect briefly in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>check a description or an identification, so long as his conduct is strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible. . . . Determination of the means that are reasonably necessary to maintain the status quo necessarily depends on a fact-bound examination of the particular circumstances of the particular governmental intrusion on the personal security of a suspect.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>45 Conn. App. 32, 40-41, 692 A.2d 1312, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 924, 697 A.2d 360 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In determining if a seizure has exceeded the scope of a permissible motor vehicle stop, the court must determine whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carcare, </em>75 Conn. App. 756, 767, 818 A.2d 53 (2003); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234, 240-41 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that although initial stop of defendants\u2019 vehicle for speeding was valid, continued detention, after completing computer check on drivers\u2019 licenses and rental papers revealed clean records, was unreasonable and violated fourth amendment). With respect to whether the results of the initial stop aroused further suspicion warranting a prolonged inquiry, \u201c[t]he police officer\u2019s decision . . . must be based on more than a hunch or speculation. ... In justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>257 Conn. 610, 617, 778 A.2d 108 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Here, Morgan stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle because he observed the vehicle making illegal lane changes. The defendant does not contest the validity of the initial stop. Rather, the defendant\u2019s relevant claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>on appeal relates to whether Morgan improperly expanded the scope of the stop by questioning the defendant about whether he was engaged in unrelated illegal activity and then performing a search of the defendant\u2019s person<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and his car, after the initial purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The initial purpose of the stop had been achieved.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Morgan did not embark on his inquiry into whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>defendant was engaged in other illegal activity until <em>after </em>Morgan had (1) completed a check of the defendant\u2019s license and determined that it was valid and that there were no outstanding warrants for him, (2) examined the car rental agreement and determined that it appeared in order and that the time frame for the rental was valid and (3) returned to the defendant\u2019s vehicle, had him exit the vehicle and explained the traffic ticket to the defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the record clearly reveals that Morgan\u2019s inquiry into other suspected illegal activity came after Morgan\u2019s purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We reject the state\u2019s argument that the record is inadequate on the issue of whether Morgan had returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the defendant\u2019s license to him prior to questioning him about other illegal activity and that it would, therefore, be sheer speculation to conclude that the initial purpose of the stop had been achieved. First, the testimony of Morgan and the court\u2019s memorandum of decision do not support that position. When asked whether he had handed the defendant the ticket at the time he asked him about other illegal activity, Morgan stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201d In its memorandum of decision, the court did not discredit the defendant\u2019s claim that he remained seized at the time the officer asked him for consent. As the court explained, \u201c[e]ven crediting the defendant\u2019s claim that he remained \u2018seized\u2019 because the detective had not handed him his motor vehicle ticket, this court does not find this to be dispositive in determining the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Second, even if the record is not absolutely conclusive with regard to whether the license and traffic citation were handed to the defendant prior to the additional unrelated questioning by Morgan, any inadequacy in the record should be charged to the state because it bore the burden at the suppression hearing to establish that fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>310 F.3d 336, 343 n.4 (5th Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is unclear from the record whether [the officer] handed back the vehicle registration as he testified that he received the registration but also stated that he did not seize the registration. However, there is no evidence in the record that [the officer] handed back the driver\u2019s licenses. Additionally, at oral argument, counsel for both sides were asked whether the licenses were returned and what evidence was in the record indicating such. Neither side could recall the presence of any evidence indicating that the licenses were returned. As we have already stated . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>however, the burden was upon the government to show the admissibility of evidence procured by the search, i.e. that the search and seizure were [c]onstitutionai and that the consent was voluntary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Third, to conclude that the record is inadequate on this issue creates the implication that a police officer, during a routine motor vehicle stop made on the basis of a driving infraction, is authorized to make arbitrary requests for consent searches that are wholly unrelated to the initial purpose of the stop and unsupported by additional suspicion justifying the expansion of the stop, so long as the officer chooses not to conclude the encounter. Such a blanket authorization is contrary to our search and seizure jurisprudence, which generally proscribes such arbitrary conduct on the part of the police. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>278 Conn. 620, 631, 899 A.2d 1 (2006) (\u201c[t]he police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees on the street or of whom he makes inquiries\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Moreover, to conclude otherwise also creates an implication that, during a routine motor vehicle stop, a defendant may not contest the validity of a consent to search unless the officer\u2019s request for consent occurs <em>after </em>the officer has returned the defendant\u2019s license and the ticket. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>53 Conn. App. 733, 741, 732 A.2d 785, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 901, 738 A.2d 1093 (1999), this court concluded that a police officer\u2019s request for consent to search on the basis of nothing more than a hunch was not improper because the officer did not request the consent to search until <em>after </em>the stop had concluded and the defendant was free to leave at the time of the request. Mindful of <em>Story, </em>if we now sanction arbitrary requests for consent searches by the police <em>prior </em>to the conclusion of a stop, we effectively close the door on a criminal defendant\u2019s ability ever to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>contest the validity of a consent to search during a motor vehicle stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On the basis of the record, we conclude that Morgan\u2019s inquiry as to whether the defendant was engaged in illegal activity went beyond the scope of the traffic stop and occurred at a time when the stop <em>reasonably should have ended. </em>Having reached that conclusion, we now must determine whether Morgan had reasonable, articulable suspicion to expand the scope of the stop by questioning the defendant about illegal activity unrelated to the purpose of the underlying stop. See <em>United States </em>v. Santiago, supra, 310 F.3d 341-42 (\u201cOnce a computer check is completed and the officer either issues a citation or determines that no citation should be issued, the detention should end and the driver should be free to leave. ... In order to continue a detention after such a point, the officer must have a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that a crime has been or is being committed.\u201d [Citation omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Morgan testified that he decided to seek consent to search the defendant\u2019s car because the defendant had \u201cappeared to be unusually nervous compared to someone who\u2019s stopped for such a routine traffic violation .... At that point, based upon the suspicion that I had already gathered during my initial contact, I decided that [I was] probably going to ask for consent to search the vehicle.\u201d Morgan also called for backup assistance on the basis of those observations. Further, Morgan testified that he decided to expand his inquiry to investigate other potential illegal activity on the basis of the defendant\u2019s nervousness, the car registration and license plates, and because the defendant told him that he was returning from New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">At the suppression hearing, it was established that many of Morgan\u2019s stated concerns were quickly dispelled. For example, on cross-examination, Morgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>conceded that it was not unusual that a rental vehicle would be registered in a state other than the home residence of the driver. Morgan further testified that the defendant\u2019s license was determined to be valid and that he had no information that the defendant was, or had been, involved in any criminal activity other than the traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Moreover, the state did not establish a predicate at the suppression hearing for the court to draw the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s unusual nervousness, combined with those other factors, justified an expansion of the scope of the stop. Morgan offered no testimony that he had specific training in narcotics interdiction, that the area on the highway was a high crime area or an area common to drug traffickers, or that the defendant\u2019s actions were consistent with criminal activity such as those exhibited by a drug courier. Compare, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Der Werff, </em>8 Conn. App. 330, 332, 513 A.2d 154 (\u201c[the officer testified that he] believed that the defendant\u2019s nervous mannerisms matched the so called \u2018drug courier profile,\u2019 a group of characteristics developed by law enforcement agencies and used to identify persons who illegally transport narcotics along the nation\u2019s airways\u201d), cert. denied, 201 Conn. 808, 515 A.2d 380 (1986), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 547 n.1, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1980); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 634 (\u201cIn the matter presently before us, the trial court found that [the officers] had extensive experience and training in narcotics investigation and enforcement. The court credited the officers\u2019 testimony that: the stop had taken place in a high crime area at approximately 5 p.m. in March; they had observed the defendant engaged in hand-to-hand exchanges on two separate occasions; this behavior was consistent with narcotics transactions in which the defendant was a dealer; and narcotics dealers often are armed and work with others who are in the immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>vicinity. The court also found that the defendant immediately upon being stopped had engaged in verbal resistance toward the officers.\u201d). Thus, other than the bald assertion that the defendant was unusually nervous, the state, which bore the burden of proof at the suppression hearing, offered nothing to substantiate that reasonable suspicion existed to allow Morgan to expand the scope of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Reviewing the evidence presented by the state, we conclude that it did not establish that Morgan had reasonable suspicion to expand the scope of the stop into an inquiry of whether the defendant was engaged in illegal activity unrelated to the underlying stop or that Morgan was proceeding on anything more than a mere hunch. Therefore, once Morgan began to question the defendant about unrelated illegal activity, the formerly valid motor vehicle stop morphed into an illegally prolonged seizure of the defendant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 310 F.3d 338, 342 (unreasonable for officer to detain suspect after records check was completed on basis of \u201cextreme nervousness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">This court having concluded that Morgan unlawfully detained the defendant, the next relevant question is what effect, if any, the defendant\u2019s continued and unlawful detention had on his subsequent consent to search his vehicle. \u201cUnder the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the fruit of prior police illegality. . . . All evidence is not, however, a fruit of the poisonous tree simply because it would not have been discovered but for the illegal action of law enforcement officials. . . . Rather, the more apt question in such a case is whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. . . . The initial determination is, therefore, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal government activity.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>99 Conn.

In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603, 95 S. Ct. 2254, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1975), the United States Supreme Court rejected the idea that a confession resulting from an illegal arrest is untainted simply because it is \u2018voluntarily\u2019 given. It follows from <em>Brown </em>that the mere fact a consent to a search or seizure is voluntary does not necessarily remove the taint.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 621, 522 A.2d 788 (1987); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Melendez-Garcia, </em>28 F.3d 1046, 1054 (10th Cir. 1994) (noting in addition to proving voluntariness, \u201c[w]e require the government to demonstrate that any taint of an illegal search or seizure has been purged or attenuated not only because we are concerned that the illegal seizure may affect the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s consent, but also to effectuate the purposes of the exclusionary rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In determining whether the state has purged the taint of an unlawful detention followed by a consent to search, the factors considered relevant by the United States Supreme Court are (1) the temporal proximity between the police illegality and the consent to search, (2) the presence of intervening circumstances and (3) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 603-604; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Turning to the first factor, \u201c[c]ourts have frequently held that a purportedly voluntary consent given after an illegal arrest or search is nonetheless a tainted fruit when that consent was given very soon after the illegal police action.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 621. Here, there is absolute temporal proximity between the unlawful detention and the defendant\u2019s consent because he gave his consent <em>while </em>he was unlawfully detained.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With respect to the second factor, Morgan testified that he did not inform the defendant of his right to refuse consent, which may have purged the taint of the unlawful detention and supported the conclusion that the consent was an act of free will. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>McGill, </em>125 F.3d 642, 644 (8th Cir. 1997) (concluding that defendant\u2019s understanding of his right to refuse consent was intervening circumstance), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1141, 118 S. Ct. 1108, 140 L. Ed. 2d 161 (1998). Regarding the third factor, Morgan testified that he conducted a patdown search of the defendant although he did not believe that the defendant was armed. While the record is inadequate to determine whether the defendant\u2019s person was illegally searched, it is disconcerting that the officer testified that he conducted such a patdown without any justifiable basis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 632 (police officer may only undertake patdown if, during course of lawful investigatory detention, officer reasonably believes that detained individual might be armed and dangerous).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Accordingly, given the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the state failed to purge the taint of the defendant\u2019s unlawful detention and that the evidence procured through his consent should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In this opinion GRUENDEL, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-11\"> We note that the court did not set forth detailed facts in its written memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.

Although we decline his invitation to do so, we mention this argument to demonstrate that the defendant did provide analysis and case law in his appellate brief in support of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Although the claim may not have been briefed as clearly and explicitly as the dissent preferred, we conclude that it has been incorporated in the defendant\u2019s claims from the time he argued his motion to suppress through the presentation of his issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\"> The state is correct that the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s person was illegally searched was not raised in the trial court and that the record is inadequate to establish whether the defendant consented to the search of his person. Moreover, even if we assume arguendo that an illegal search of the defendant\u2019s person occurred, this, in an of itself, does not necessarily invalidate the search of the defendant\u2019s car. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (3d Ed. 1996) \u00a7 8.2 (d), pp. 663-64 (\u201cif the police have made a search which did <em>not </em>result in the finding of incriminating evidence against the person from whom consent is sought to continue the search on the same occasion, the illegality of the first search will not necessarily invalidate the consent given by one who knows that the police do not claim any authority to continue the search without consent\u201d [emphasis in orignal]). Nevertheless, as discussed herein, the fact that the defendant was patted down prior to the search of his car is relevant to whether his consent was tainted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> This is not a factual finding but, rather, is a legal conclusion based on the facts contained in the record. We note that in addressing the issue of when a traffic stop had been completed, the courts in the federal cases and cases from other jurisdictions cited by the dissent reached their conclusions as to whether the purpose had been effectuated only after reviewing the facts and circumstances of each case. That is what we have done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">We agree with the dissent that no appellate case law in Connecticut has considered the question of when the purpose of a traffic stop has been achieved. Nevertheless, we can make that determination, as the courts in other jurisdictions have done, by reviewing the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The dissent concludes that the defendant failed to provide an adequate record to review this claim. We disagree. As we have noted in this opinion: (1) the defendant was stopped for a traffic infraction; (2) the officer checked the defendant\u2019s license and registration and determined that there were no outstanding warrants for him; (3) the officer reviewed the car rental agreement and found nothing suspicious; and (4) the officer had written the traffic ticket and then asked the defendant to exit the vehicle so the officer could explain the ticket to him. Only after all that had occurred did the officer ask the defendant if he had anything illegal in his vehicle. The officer indicated that he made this inquiry because the defendant had appeared nervous. The record is sufficient to make the conclusion that, under these circumstances, the purpose for which the stop had been made had been effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">We decline to adopt a bright line test for such a determination. A trial court, in making such a determination, would have to consider the totality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of the circumstances in each case. Whether the driver\u2019s license or ticket had been turned over to the individual would be only one factor. It should not be the determinative factor because, otherwise, an officer could wrongfully detain that person by purposefully withholding those items in order to make impermissible inquiries. For discussion of this issue, see <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, 284 </em>Kan. 763, 166 P.3d 1015 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We finally note, in connection with the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the record was inadequate for review, that it is the state\u2019s burden to prove that the search and seizure of an individual were constitutional. The defendant, however, has raised issues on appeal and has the responsibility to provide an adequate record. A review of the file reveals that he filed a motion for articulation with the trial court, comprised of several questions, requesting additional articulation of the factual and legal basis for the denial of his motion to suppress. The court denied the motion for articulation. The defendant filed a motion for review of that decision with this court, which motion was granted, but the relief requested was denied. The defendant, therefore, did all that he could to perfect the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> Specifically, Morgan, during the state\u2019s direct examination, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: <em>[O]noe you had explained the ticket to [the defendant], </em>did you ask him a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, I did. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And what did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">\u201c[The Witness]: I asked him if he had anything illegal in the vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Later in the hearing, Morgan made it clear that the question regarding other illegal activity came <em>after </em>he had explained the ticket to the defendant.

The majority concludes that the defendant, Christopher Jenkins, was detained unlawfully and that the improper detention tainted his subsequent consent to search his vehicle.

Moreover, the defendant has not briefed adequately the issue of whether the purpose of the traffic stop had been effectuated. I am unable to reach the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s consent was tainted by an illegal seizure. Because I am not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s remaining claims, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">At the outset, I note my agreement with the factual and procedural history as set forth in the majority opinion. In order to explain my disagreement, however, it is useful to expand briefly on some of these details. On July 13, 2004, the defendant moved to suppress, as the fruits of an illegal search, all evidence seized from the traffic stop that occurred on May 7, 2004. Specifically, the motion stated: \u201cOnce the traffic citation was issued, the officer illegally detained the defendant for an extended period without probable cause or a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in illegal activity which resulted in an illegal seizure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">At the suppression hearing, Michael Morgan, a Newington police detective, testified as to the events of May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>7, 2004. After filling out the infraction for the motor vehicle violation that he had witnessed, he asked the defendant to step outside of his vehicle. During their interaction, Morgan asked the defendant if there was anything illegal in the vehicle. The defendant stated that there was nothing illegal in the vehicle, just some beer on the floor, and then granted Morgan permission to search the vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">During cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and Morgan:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u201cQ. Incidentally, after you explained the ticket to [the defendant], did you go over it with him and show him and what he had to do, how he had to deal with it or no?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u201cA. I told him what it was for and the fact that he had to mail it in by whatever the answer date was. I don\u2019t recall it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u201cQ. All right. So, you were standing there with him, showing him the ticket, going over it. Was that before or after you asked if he had anything illegal in his car?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u201cA. That\u2019s before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">On January 10, 2005, the defendant filed a memorandum of law in support of his motion. Specifically, he argued that \u201c(1) the detention of the defendant exceeded the scope of the justification for the initial stop, (2) the defendant did not freely and voluntarily consent to the search of his vehicle, and, alternatively, (3) even if the defendant\u2019s alleged \u2018consent\u2019 was free and voluntary and could be interpreted as permission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>it was limited in scope and cannot justify a wholesale search as occurred here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On January 14, 2005, the court heard argument with respect to the defendant\u2019s motion. During this proceeding, the court stated: \u201cMy understanding of the facts are that once he stepped out of the car, <em>but before the ticket was issued to him, </em>he was asked to give consent. Is that correct? Is that your reading of the facts of the case?\u201d (Emphasis added.) The prosecutor responded that he believed that the court was correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On the basis of this minimal record, the majority determines that \u201c[t]he initial purpose of the stop had been achieved.\u201d I cannot conclude, on the basis of this record, that the trial court made such a finding. It is not our province to do so. \u201cNo citation is needed for the fundamental principle that as an appellate tribunal, this court cannot find facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>98 Conn.

The vague and ambiguous record before us invites speculation. For reasons that I will point out, making this determination without either a proper record or clear standards will produce uncertainty in the trial courts. \u201cIt is well settled that it is the duty of the appellant to provide this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>with an adequate record to review his claims. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 61-10.

App. 674, 685, 835 A.2d 451 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>46 Conn. App. 791, 700 A.2d 1198 (1997), is particularly instructive. In that case, two Hartford police officers observed the defendant and another individual selling drugs. Id., 792-93. The defendant moved to suppress the seized crack cocaine and currency on the ground that he had been arrested without probable cause. Id., 794. The trial court denied the motion. Id., 795. On appeal, the defendant again claimed that he had been arrested without probable cause and that crack cocaine and currency were seized in violation of his constitutional rights. Id. We declined to review this claim on appeal. Id., 796. \u201c[W]e cannot address the issues the defendant raises on appeal because we do not have any findings or conclusions of law by the trial court on a number of important factors. Specifically, we do not have before us a finding by the trial court of when the valid arrest of the defendant occurred, at the point when he was initially detained or after the crack cocaine was found. We also do not have a finding of whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the planter in which the crack cocaine was found. Finally, we do not have a finding of whether the seizure of the currency occurred before or after the valid arrest. Because the record is inadequate, we decline to review this claim.\u201d Id., 795-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The record in the present case is similarly devoid of certain important factors. It is not clear whether Morgan had finished explaining the ticket to the defendant. It is uncertain whether Morgan had returned the defendant\u2019s license or registration. It is uncertain whether the defendant had any questions regarding the traffic citation. As I explain more fully in part II, these are critical matters that courts use to determine whether the purpose of a traffic stop has been completed. Simply put, I believe that making a determination without this information is speculation, and I would decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In addition to the problems of the lack of a finding by the trial court and an inadequate record, I also conclude that the defendant failed to brief adequately the issue of whether Morgan unconstitutionally extended the traffic stop. In my view, the defendant merely assumes, without citation or analysis, that the purpose of the traffic stop had been effectuated.

Morgan explained the traffic infraction to the defendant, at which time [Morgan] should have given him the traffic ticket and returned his documentation to him. . . . Extending the traffic stop and withholding the traffic ticket from the defendant signaled in no uncertain terms that the defendant was being held for more than a traffic stop\u2014despite the inability of the police to justify any intrusion outside the scope of the traffic stop.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>than a passing reference to Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent in <em>Ohio </em>v.

It then concludes that this improper seizure tainted the defendant\u2019s subsequent consent. In my view, it cannot be determined whether the purpose of the traffic stop was completed, and, therefore, there is no \u201csecond\u201d impermissible seizure. Accordingly, there is no tainted consent that warrants a reversal of the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I am mindful that \u201c[t]he scope of [an investigative] detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification [and the] investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>Florida </em>v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S. Ct. 1319, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1983). Nevertheless, neither this court nor our Supreme Court has considered the question of when the purpose of a traffic stop has been achieved. Simply put, no appellate decision in this state has established, as a matter of law, when a traffic stop is completed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the defendant acknowledged as much in his brief. Despite this observation, the defendant simply concludes that the traffic stop ended after Morgan explained the ticket to him. Absent a thorough and complete presentation of this issue by the parties in their briefs, I am unwilling to accept the conclusion urged by the defendant. I believe that before we enter an uncharted area of search and seizure jurisprudence and establish a rule that, subject to review by our Supreme Court, will bind all of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>trial courts, we should have the benefit of both a proper record and thorough analysis by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Moreover, it does not follow, a fortiori, that merely explaining the ticket to a driver signals the end of the traffic stop. My research reveals that various approaches to this issue exist in both our sibling jurisdictions and the federal courts. For example, in <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>State, </em>355 Md. 356, 362, 735 A.2d 491 (1999), the defendant was stopped by a Maryland state police trooper for speeding. The defendant complied with the trooper\u2019s request to see his driver\u2019s license and registration. The trooper completed the citation form and provided it to the defendant, who signed it. Id., 363. The trooper then returned the signed copy of the citation, the driver\u2019s license and registration to the defendant. Id. At that point, the trooper began to ask the defendant questions, which led to his admission that he was in possession of marijuana. Id., 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">After his motion to suppress had been denied, the defendant appealed. Id., 366. The Maryland Court of Appeals stated that it had not \u201chad occasion to consider the question of the extent to which a law enforcement officer who has properly stopped a motor vehicle based on probable cause may detain and question the driver after the officer has concluded the purpose for the initial stop.\u201d Id., 370. It noted the decisions of Maryland\u2019s intermediate appellate court that held that once the purpose of the initial stop had been concluded, by issuing a warning or citation to the driver, further detention was not permitted. The Court of Appeals concluded, \u201cafter considering all of the circumstances of the initial encounter between [the trooper] and [the defendant], that <em>the traffic stop essentially came to an end upon the trooper\u2019s delivery of the citation, and return of the driver\u2019s license and registration. </em>Once [the defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>signed and returned the citation [to the officer] in compliance with Maryland traffic laws ... he had completed all his duties pertaining to the traffic stop itself. Because the traffic stop had ended there, [the defendant] was lawfully free to drive away . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 373. The end point of the traffic stop, therefore, was the delivery of the citation and the return of the driver\u2019s documents. The Court of Appeals ultimately concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would not have felt free to leave and therefore was seized for purposes of the fourth amendment. Id., 378-79. In other words, there were two seizures, one for the traffic violation, which was proper, and a second, after the purpose of the traffic stop had been completed, which was improper. Id., 384; cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>563 Pa. 47, 757 A.2d 884 (2000) (although no express endpoint to first lawful detention, such endpoint existed and officer confined subsequent interaction with defendant in manner consistent with consensual encounter).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">As a matter of state constitutional law, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that evidence obtained as a result of a search based on consent obtained during an impermissibly expanded traffic stop is subject to suppression. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>660 N.W.2d 415, 416 (Minn. 2003), the defendant was a passenger in a motor vehicle that was stopped for speeding and having a cracked windshield. After the police officers determined that neither the defendant nor the driver had a valid driver\u2019s license, they elected to have the vehicle towed. Id., 417. As the defendant exited the vehicle, he was questioned about drugs and weapons, and he eventually stated that he would not mind if the officers searched the vehicle. Id. In concluding that the motion to suppress filed by the defendant should have been granted, the court stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201cWhile there is nothing improper in the record to suggest that the initial stop was improper, <em>the scope and duration of a traffic stop must be limited to the justification for the stop. . . . </em>The purpose of this traffic stop was simply to process violations for speeding and a cracked windshield and there was no reasonable articulable suspicion of any other crime. Investigation of the presence of narcotics and weapons had no connection to the purpose for the stop. We therefore conclude that the investigative questioning, consent inquiry, and subsequent search went beyond the scope of the traffic stop and was unsupported by any reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 418-19; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hight, </em>146 N.H. 746, 781 A.2d 11 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In the <em>Ferris </em>case, the Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that the initial seizure, based on the traffic violation, was completed when the defendant received the citation and the police officer returned his license and registration. The court concluded that following the return of the license and registration, an unconstitutional seizure occurred when the officer began questioning the defendant because, at that point, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>lacked either probable cause or a reasonable articulable suspicion. It was this improper seizure that tainted the defendant\u2019s consent. In contrast, in <em>Fori, </em>the Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that it was the questioning of the defendant about a matter unrelated to the purpose of the traffic stop that was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Additionally, I note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has stated that \u201c[t]his Circuit follows the brightline rule that an encounter initiated by a traffic stop may not be deemed consensual unless the driver\u2019s documents have been returned to him.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lerma, </em>14 F.3d 1479, 1483 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1095, 114 S. Ct. 1862, 128 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1994), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>441 F.3d 900, 903 n.1 (10th Cir. 2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>93 F.3d 1493, 1498 (10th Cir. 1996); see also <em>Daniels. State, </em>277 Ga. 840, 843, 597 S.E.2d 116 (2004). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>140 F.3d 1129, 1135 (8th Cir. 1998), the court indicated that the defendant was not seized for the purposes of the constitution after his papeiwork had been returned and the officer told him that he was \u201cfree to go.\u201d See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>474 F.3d 1100, 1103-1104 (8th Cir. 2007); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>385 F.3d 625, 630 (6th Cir. 2004) (traffic stop concluded when officer handed driver citation and shook his hand); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Meikle, </em>407 F.3d 670, 673 (4th Cir. 2005) (after papers had been returned to defendant and he was told he was free to go, further interaction between officer and defendant was consensual); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 877 (4th Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 926, 113 S. Ct. 351, 121 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1992). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dortch, </em>199 F.3d 193, 199 (5th Cir. 1999), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir. 2000), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit focused its analysis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>whether the computer check of the defendant and documents had been completed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1282 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 830, 122 S. Ct. 73, 151 L. Ed. 2d 38 (2001), stated that the issue of whether the officer had returned the license to a motorist was a factor in the totality of circumstances with respect to the issue of consent, but was not a \u201clitmus test . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">These cases demonstrate that no clear and well established fourth amendment jurisprudence as to when the purpose of a traffic stop has been effectuated exists. Various jurisdictions have adopted different tests and factors to consider when making this determination. It is unclear from the majority\u2019s decision how it determined at what point the purpose of the stop was effectuated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> My colleagues note that Morgan had completed the check on the defendant\u2019s license, examined the rental agreement and explained the ticket. The majority then concludes that \u201cthe record clearly reveals that Morgan\u2019s inquiry into other suspected illegal activity came after Morgan\u2019s purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved.\u201d As previously noted, the record is not clear that Morgan had finished explaining the ticket to the defendant, although he was in the <em>process </em>of explaining the ticket at the time of his request for consent to search the vehicle. If we assume, arguendo, that Morgan had explained the ticket fully, the defendant failed to analyze why we should adopt explanation of the ticket as completing the purpose of a traffic stop rather than other events, such as the return of the driver\u2019s license, registration and insurance information or whether the officer had indicated that the driver was free to leave. As noted, several of the Circuit Courts of Appeals have used the return of the driver\u2019s paperwork <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>as a crucial factor in determining whether the traffic stop has been completed. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lerma, </em>supra, 14 F.3d 1479. It is not clear what standards and type of rule are adopted by the majority; that is, whether a bright line test rather than a consideration of the totality of the circumstances test is endorsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">By simply concluding, without analysis, that \u201c[t]he initial purpose of the stop had been achieved\u201d and that Morgan\u2019s inquiry \u201ccame after [his] purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved,\u201d I believe that the conclusion lacks certainty and will not provide the trial courts with proper guidance for future cases. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 690, 735 A.2d 267 (1999) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>232 Conn. 707, 739, 657 A.2d 585 (1995) <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring); <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 757, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring and dissenting) (important to give clear guidance to trial courts), on appeal after remand, 38 Conn. App. 546, 662 A.2d 153 (1995) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>52 Conn. App. 85, 97, 726 A.2d 119 (1999) <em>(Lavery, J., </em>dissenting), aff'd, 253 Conn. 639, 756 A. 2d 833 (2000). I am unable to ascertain from the majority opinion what factors should be considered or what test a trial court should employ when faced with a motion to suppress claiming that a police officer exceeded the scope of a valid traffic stop. I consider these questions, as well as the rationale for the resolution of the issue, to be of critical importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Additionally, because the issue was not analyzed or discussed adequately in the defendant\u2019s brief, the state did not have a proper opportunity to present its counterarguments. The inadequacy is such that, essentially, the issue of the completion of a traffic stop was not \u201craised\u201d in the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Our Supreme Court has recently stated: \u201cWe long have held that, in the absence of a question relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction, the Appellate Corut may not reach out and decide [an appeal] before it on a basis that the parties never have raised or briefed. . . . To do otherwise would deprive the parties of an opportunity to present arguments regarding those issues. ... If the Appellate Court decides to address an issue not previously raised or briefed, it may do so only after requesting supplemental briefs from the parties and allowing argument regarding that issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>282 Conn. 709, 715, 924 A.2d 809 (2007); see also <em>Sheff v. </em>O\u2019Neill, 238 Conn. 1, 87-88, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996) (Borden, J., dissenting) (fairness to parties and fact that appellate court more likely to reach proper result if it follows adequate briefing). Accordingly, I believe it improper for us to reach that issue. Because the issue of when the purpose of a traffic stop has been effectuated in Connecticut was not analyzed properly in the briefs and was not supported by the record, I believe it is inappropriate for us to decide this important issue, in effect, sua sponte. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>supra, 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">I now turn to the other claims raised by the defendant with respect to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Specifically, the defendant argues that (1) even if his consent had been voluntary, it was tainted by a prior unconstitutional search of his person, (2) the state failed to establish that he actually consented to the search of the vehicle, (3) any consent to search was not given voluntarily and (4) any consent to search was obtained by a violation of the Connecticut constitution by the police improperly converting a traffic stop into a criminal investigation. I am not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The defendant argues that even if he had voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle, any evidence found was tainted as a result of the illegal search of his person that occurred prior to the search of the vehicle. The state contends that this claim was not raised before the trial court. The state further argues that the record is inadequate for review pursuant to the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">After carefully reviewing the entire record, I conclude that the issue of whether Morgan improperly conducted a patdown search of the defendant\u2019s person was not raised before the trial court. Our Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[B]ecause our review is limited to matters in the record, we will not address issues not decided by the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185, [now \u00a7 60-5] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>260 Conn. 649, 658, 800 A.2d 1160 (2002). I conclude, therefore, that this issue has not been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In the alternative, the defendant requests review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. I also would conclude that the record is inadequate to review the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to the issue of Morgan\u2019s patdown search of the defendant\u2019s person. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim that the illegal search of his person tainted the subsequent consent to search the vehicle fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis. I would therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendant next argues that the state failed to establish that he actually consented to the search of the vehicle. Specifically, he maintains that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant actually consented to . . . Morgan\u2019s search of his automobile is unsupported by the facts and is clearly erroneous.\u201d He further maintains that there was not an \u201cactual communicative exchange\u201d between himself and Morgan. I am not persuaded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u201cA warrantless search is not unreasonable under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution when a person with authority to do so has freely consented. . . . The question of whether a defendant has given voluntary consent to . . . search ... is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court by considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the . . . search.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carcare, </em>75 Conn. App. 756, 770-71, 818 A.2d 53 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The trial court expressly found that \u201cthere was no untoward conduct on either the part of . . . Morgan or . . . Sutton. The court finds that there was no threatening, coercive or overpowering behavior exhibited at any time during this incident. . . . The court finds that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly gave permission to have his vehicle searched.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>When asked if there was anything illegal in the vehicle, the defendant indicated that there was some beer on the floor and invited Morgan to search the vehicle to check the veracity of his response. This invitation was made in response to Morgan\u2019s inquiry and not a demand for access to search the interior of the vehicle. Although Morgan did not inform the defendant that he was free to refuse to respond to this inquiry, that warning is not mandatory or a prerequisite to a voluntary consent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Der Werff, </em>8 Conn. App. 330, 341, 513 A.2d 154, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 808, 515 A.2d 380 (1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In short, the record reveals nothing coercive about the manner in which Morgan interacted with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Additionally, the court found that Morgan inquired whether there was any illegal substance inside the vehicle and that the defendant responded to that inquiry by granting Morgan permission to search the interior for contraband. In other words, I reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that there was no communicative exchange between him and Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The defendant next argues that any consent to search was not given voluntarily. He specifically contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the court failed to consider the totality of the circumstances to ascertain whether his consent was voluntary or coerced and that under the totality of the circumstances, his consent was not free and voluntary. I am not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">I would decline to reach the merits of the claim that the court failed to consider the totality of the circumstances. The basis for this contention is that, in its memorandum of decision, the court did not address the search of the defendant\u2019s person that occurred prior to the search of the vehicle. As I concluded in part III A, this matter was not presented to the trial court, and the record is inadequate to review pursuant to <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">With respect to the contention that under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s consent was not free and voluntary, I previously concluded, in part III B, that the court\u2019s finding of valid consent, i.e., consent that is free and voluntary, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The defendant next claims that any consent obtained resulted from violation by the police of his rights under the Connecticut constitution. The defendant proposes four \u201crules\u201d that offer greater levels of protection for the privacy of motorists detained during a traffic stop. Such \u201crules,\u201d the defendant argues, would afford citizens of Connecticut greater protection, pursuant to article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution, than the fourth amendment to the federal constitution. I am not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">The defendant-requests that this court adopt, as part of our state constitutional jurisprudence, one of the following \u201crules\u201d in order to protect adequately the privacy of motorists detained during a traffic stop. \u201cFirst, the defendant proposes a rule under which an officer may not ask for consent to search a car unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion of illegal activity. A citizen would be free to leave as soon as the officer has achieved the traffic enforcement purpose of the initial stop and detention\u2014unless the police had reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity to justify extending the stop to investigate further. Second, the defendant proposes a rule under which an officer performing traffic duty must inform a motorist that he is free to leave and free to refuse consent to search as a prerequisite to obtaining consent to search a car detained for a mere motor vehicle infraction. Third, the defendant proposes a rule that the state must show any \u2018exchange\u2019 between a police officer clearly and unambiguously supports the conclusion that the motorist actually agreed to a car search and to its purpose. Fourth, the defendant proposes a rule holding the state to an enhanced burden of proof in establishing voluntary consent where it is obtained during a traffic stop.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">At the outset, I conclude that the defendant failed to preserve the state constitutional claims that he raises on appeal. The defendant also requests <em>Golding </em>review of his state constitutional claims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.1 conclude that he has failed to satisfy all four prongs of that test.</p>\n<p id=\"AxR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendant\u2019s first proposed rule is that a police officer be prohibited from asking for consent to search once the initial purposes of the stop have been achieved. He directs our attention to other states that have adopted such a rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The fatal flaw with this argument, however, is that the record in the present case is unclear as to whether the initial purposes of the stop were achieved. See part II of this opinion. Given the uncertain status in the record of whether the purpose of the stop had been achieved, I conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Golding, </em>and, therefore, this claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The defendant\u2019s second proposed rule is that the defendant\u2019s consent \u201cmust be knowledgeable.\u201d Specifically, he asks this court to \u201cmandate that police conducting mere traffic stops follow set procedures to avoid confusion and possible abuse of authority.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> I decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to require such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">At the outset, I reiterate that it is unclear, legally and factually, as to whether the traffic stop actually was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>completed at the time of Morgan\u2019s inquiry. Second, Morgan did not ask to search the vehicle; he merely inquired as to whether there was anything illegal in the vehicle. It was the defendant who offered Morgan the opportunity to search the interior of the vehicle. The facts and circumstances of this case, therefore, do not provide an adequate record for the creation of the state constitutional rule proposed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Additionally, our Supreme Court expressly has stated on several occasions that the validity of a consent to search is to be determined by the <em>totality of the circumstances </em>and that <em>no one factor is controlling. </em>See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em>279 Conn. 39, 57, 901 A.2d 1 (2006) (no one factor controlling on issue of voluntariness), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1212, 127 S. Ct. 1328, 167 L. Ed. 2d 85 (2007). If we were to accept the defendant\u2019s second proposed rule, we would, in effect, be disregarding that precedent because we would focus solely on the fact that Morgan did not apprise the defendant of his right to refuse to allow the search. In other words, we would abandon our Supreme Court\u2019s instruction to consider the totality of the circumstances with respect to the issue of consent. I would conclude, therefore, that this claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\"> \u201cWhile most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so without being told they are free not to respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 309-10 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 847, 123 S. Ct. 186, 154 L. Ed. 2d 75 (2002); see also <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 104 S. Ct. 1758, 80 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> I further note that in his appellate brief, the defendant states that \u201c[h]e was never handed an infractions ticket.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-10\"> I note that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cervantes-Arredondo, </em>17 P.3d 141, 148 (Colo. 2001), the Colorado Supreme Court noted that the trial court had failed to make findings about whether the officer had returned the defendant\u2019s license and registration to him and remanded the case with instruction for the court to make such findings. In others words, the presence of these facts is of critical importance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> The defendant argues that Morgan impermissibly expanded the <em>scope </em>of the traffic stop. It does not appear, however, that the defendant claims that Morgan\u2019s inquiry improperly extended the <em>duration </em>of the stop. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>906 F.2d 319, 322 (7th Cir. 1990) (determination of propriety of investigative detention after traffic stop involves inquiry as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>to duration and scope). I further note that the majority\u2019s analysis appears to focus on the issue of the scope rather than duration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> I note that in his dissenting opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>53 Conn. App. 733, 744, 732 A.2d 785 <em>(Hennessy, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 251 Conn. 901, 738 A.2d 1093 (1999), Judge Hennessy indicated that a traffic stop was complete when the officer returned the driver\u2019s paperwork and issued him a citation. The majority opinion in <em>Story, </em>however, did not address the issue of when a traffic stop has been completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> I note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has stated: \u201cIf the police may ask (without suspicion) questions of persons who are in no custody (e.g., walking down the street), people who are in practical but not legal custody (e.g., passengers on busses and airplanes), and people who are in formal custody pending trial or following conviction . . . then why would the police need probable cause or reasonable suspicion to direct questions to persons . . . who are in legal custody but likely to be released soon? To say that questions asked of free persons and questions asked of prisoners are not seizures but that questions asked of suspects under arrest <em>are </em>seizures would have neither the text of the Constitution behind it nor any logical basis under it.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>277 F.3d 947, 951 (7th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 829, 123 S. Ct. 126, 154 L. Ed. 2d 43 (2002). The court indicated that \u201c[i]t is difficult to see why custody should turn an inquiry into a \u2018seizure.\u2019 \u201d Id., 950. In the view of the majority of the Seventh Circuit, a question asked during a traffic stop that is unrelated to the purpose of the traffic stop is not absolutely forbidden by the constitution. Id., 954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> Moreover, we are not presented with a fact pattern in which tinder <em>any test </em>Morgan\u2019s actions would be unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> I note that the majority, in footnote 11, concludes that this issue was not raised in the trial court and that the record is not adequate for appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> The defendant also asserted in his brief that \u201c[i]f any \u2018consent\u2019 were established, at most it authorized Morgan only to check for some beer on the passenger seat floor.\u201d He also stated in his brief that \u201cMorgan chose to interpret the defendant\u2019s cryptic reply to mean that Morgan could search the entire car for anything illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">To the extent the defendant claims on appeal that Morgan exceeded the scope of the consent given by the defendant, I would decline to review such a claim on the basis of an inadequate brief. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>John G., </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 355 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b476-11\"> During cross-examination, Morgan acknowledged that he did not record the defendant\u2019s response verbatim in his report. Specifically, he testified: \u201cI did not quote him. It just says that he just had some beer on the floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>near the passenger\u2019s seat, but that I could check if I want to.\u201d Nevertheless, Morgan\u2019s testimony regarding his inquiry and the defendant\u2019s response remained consistent. The defendant\u2019s citation to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caicedo, </em>85 F.3d 1184 (6th Cir. 1996), therefore, is misplaced. In <em>Caicedo, </em>the arresting officer could not recall at the suppression hearing whether he performed a patdown search before or after he had received consent to search the defendant\u2019s backpack. Id., 1189. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the District Court\u2019s finding that the patdown occurred after the defendant\u2019s consent was clearly erroneous. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\"><em>Caicedo </em>is distinguishable from the present case. Although Morgan could not recall the exact words used, his testimony regarding his request as to the defendant\u2019s vehicle remained constant. Further, the court, as the trier of fact, was free to credit his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b477-11\"> See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> With respect to his third and fourth proposed rules, the defendant has not adequately briefed these issues.
