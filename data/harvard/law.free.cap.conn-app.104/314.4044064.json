Browne III, following a plea of nolo contendere, was convicted of possession of more than four ounces of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (b). The plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>nolo contendere was conditioned on the defendant\u2019s right to challenge on appeal the validity of the search warrant. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to that warrant. He argues that the warrant authorizing the search was invalid because the particularity section authorized a search for cocaine, crack cocaine and collateral items,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> not marijuana, the intended target of the search. We agree that the warrant was invalid and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. In December, 2003, the Middletown police department began an investigation of the defendant for the sale of marijuana. Police officers observed two controlled purchases of marijuana from the defendant by a confidential informant. As a result of this investigation, they applied for a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s person, automobile and residence. The warrant application requested permission to search for \u201ccocaine, crack cocaine\u201d and collateral items believed to be related to the sale of narcotics. The application also stated that these items were believed to constitute evidence of the crime of possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>marijuana. The affidavit in support of the warrant application detailed the affiants\u2019 knowledge of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the sale of marijuana, including the observation of two controlled purchases of marijuana from the defendant. The warrant itself did not name marijuana as an item to be seized or make any reference to marijuana. Instead, the particularity clause of the warrant listed \u201ccocaine, crack cocaine\u201d and collateral items as those for which police were authorized to search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The warrant was executed on December 30, 2003. Seven and one-half pounds of marijuana, two scales, proof of residence and plastic bags were seized during the search, leading to the defendant\u2019s arrest;. When the warrant was executed, neither the warrant application nor the supporting affidavit accompanied the warrant because they had been placed under seal to protect the identity of a confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant. At the suppression hearing, Detective Jorge Yepes testified that cocaine, rather than marijuana, was listed as an item to be seized because he mistakenly had copied the particularity section from another warrant and failed to edit the text before submitting the affidavit and warrant to the magistrate for his determination of probable cause and signature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u201cThe particularity clause of the fourth amendment requires that no warrants issue except those particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. U.S. Const., amend. IV. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>With respect to the things to be seized, the standard is met if the officer executing it can identify the property sought with reasonable certainty. 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 3-4 (f), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Muldowney, </em>60 N.J. 594, 600, 292 A.2d 26 (1972).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>8 Conn. App. 290, 304, 513 A.2d 710 (1986). The parties agree that the principal object of this search was marijuana, and it was not listed on the warrant. Instead, cocaine and crack cocaine were Usted. This warrant, on its face, simply did not describe the property sought, and we hold that it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The state argues that the aUegations asserted by the affiants in the affidavit and warrant application reflected a consistent and continuous reference to marijuana such that the absence of marijuana from the particularity clause of both the warrant and application was merely a scrivener\u2019s error. This argument was addressed in the recent United States Supreme Court case of <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>540 U.S. 551, 124 S. Ct. 1284, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1068 (2004). In <em>Groh, </em>the court held: \u201cThe fact that the apphcation adequately described the \u2018things to be seized\u2019 does not save the warrant from its facial invaUdity. The Fourth Amendment by its terms requires particularity in the warrant, not in the supporting documents. See <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, [988 n.5, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737] (1984) (\u2018[a] warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional\u2019); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stefonek, </em>179 F.3d 1030, 1033 ([7th Cir.] 1999) (\u2018[t]he Fourth Amendment requires that the <em>warrant </em>particularly describe the things to be seized, not the papers presented to the judicial officer . . . asked to issue the warrant\u2019 . . . ) [cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1162, 120 S. Ct. 1177, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1085 (2000)]. And for good reason: \u2018The presence of a search warrant serves a high function,\u2019 <em>McDonald </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 451, 455 [69 S. Ct. 191, 93 L. Ed. 153] (1948), and that high function is not necessarily vindicated when some other document, somewhere, says something about the objects of the search, but the contents of that document are neither known to the person whose home is being searched nor available for her inspection. We do not say that the Fourth Amendment forbids a warrant from cross-referencing other documents. Indeed, most Courts of Appeals have held that a court may construe a warrant with reference to a supporting application or affidavit if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation, and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant. . . . But in this case the warrant did not incorporate other documents by reference, <em>nor did either the affidavit or the application (which had been placed under seal) accompany the warrant. </em>Hence, we need not further explore the matter of incorporation.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis altered.) <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 557-58. Even if the state is correct that the affidavit and allegations sufficiently describe the items to be seized so as to inform the reader that marijuana, not cocaine, is the object of the search, here, as in <em>Groh, </em>the affidavit did not accompany the warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The state also argues that the warrant was valid because the executing officer had personal knowledge of the crime being investigated and knew that marijuana, not cocaine, was the focus of this search. \u201cIt is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>trae that the executing officer\u2019s personal knowledge of the place to be searched may \u2018cure\u2019 minor, technical defects in the warrant\u2019s <em>place </em>description. 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure [(2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 4.5 (a), pp. 209-10]. . . . However, where the inadequacy arises not in the warrant\u2019s description of the place to be searched but rather in the things to be seized, the officer\u2019s personal knowledge of the crime may not cure the defect. See generally 2 W. LaFave \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-4.6 (discussing the particularity requirement in relation to a warrant\u2019s description of the places to be searched and the things to be seized). This is so because the purpose of a warrant is not only to limit the executing officer\u2019s discretion, but to inform the person subject to the search what items the officer may seize. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>794 F.2d 1348, 1355 (9th Cir. 1986) [cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1086, 107 S. Ct. 1289, 94 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1987)].\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>121 Wash. 2d 22, 28-29, 846 P.2d 1365 (1993). The United States Supreme Court has \u201clong held, moreover, that the purpose of the particularity requirement is not limited to the prevention of general searches. See <em>[Maryland </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1987)]. A particular warrant also assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The state argues that because it had probable cause to believe that some of the collateral items were located in the house, the police officer could seize the marijuana under the plain view doctrine. \u201c[Ojbjects not named in the warrant, but found within an officer's plain view, may be seized if the . . . officers had a reasonable basis for believing that the seized evidence was reasonably related to the offense which formed the basis for the search warrant. . . . This doctrine is based upon the premise that the police need not ignore incriminating evidence in plain view while they are operating within the parameters of a valid search warrant or are otherwise entitled to be in a position to view the items seized.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 347, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). The problem with this theory in this case is that the police were not lawfully on the premises of the defendant where the marijuana was found. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>George, </em>975 F.2d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 1992) (noting that plain view doctrine inapplicable when \u201cthe sufficiently particularized portions make up only an insignificant or tangential part of the warrant\u201d). Moreover, the collateral items, standing alone without the illegal drug, would not support probable cause to believe a crime was committed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the marijuana could not be seized under the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In this opinion DiPENTIMA, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> The collateral items listed on the warrant include \u201ccutting agents such as lactose and baking soda, white powder, razor blades, scrapers, straws, packaging materials, foil packets, plastic bags, glassine envelopes, glass or plastic vials, scales, records and other \u2018data\u2019 [as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-250 (8)] of sale and or purchases of narcotics, currency, rifles, shotguns, semi-automatic weapons, fully automatic weapons, revolvers, ammunition, and other dangerous weapons.

Within forty-eight hours of [the] search, a copy of the application for the warrant and a copy of ail affidavits upon which the warrant is based shall be given to such owner, occupant or person. . . .\u201d We recognize that this statutory provision makes obvious reference to those warrants that facially conform to the particularity clause of the fourth amendment and merely permits an owner, occupant or other person subject to search to obtain such supplemental information as set forth in a supporting application or affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> The dissent relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>998 F.2d 1112, 1117 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1069, 114 S. Ct. 1644, 128 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1994), for the proposition that a warrant that is clearly lacking in particularity is not incurably defective where both the affidavit and the conduct of law enforcement personnel suggest that \u201cthe involved parties were aware of the scope of and limitations on the search.\u201d <em>Bianco </em>is easEy distinguished from the present case. In <em>Bianco, </em>the affidavit was not incorporated by the warrant nor was it attached; however, it was present at the tune of the search. Id., 1116-17.

IV. Because the search and seizure warrant in the present case mistakenly referenced the illicit drug cocaine instead of the illicit drug marijuana, the majority, relying on <em>Groh </em>v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 124 S. Ct. 1284, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1068 (2004), concludes that the warrant failed to comply with that constitutional mandate. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Preliminarily, I note that the \u201cstandard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record. . . .

On December 23, 2003, a combined application and affidavit for the search and seizure warrant was presented to the Honorable Thomas V. O\u2019Keefe, Jr., a judge of the Superior Court. It is undisputed that the warrant authorized a search for and seizure of illicit drugs. It is also undisputed that the warrant mistakenly referenced the illicit drug cocaine instead of the illicit drug marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Specifically, after listing both the narcotic cocaine and various items associated with the sale thereof, the warrant application stated that the aforementioned \u201cis possessed, controlled, designed or intended for use or which is or has been or may be used as the means of committing the criminal offense of . . . possession of marijuana [in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (c) and] possession of marijuana [with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (b)],\u201d and \u201c[constitutes evidence of the following offense or that a particular person participated in the commission of the offense of . . . possession of marijuana [in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (c) and] possession of marijuana [with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (b)] . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The accompanying affidavit described, in great detail, two controlled pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>chases of marijuana from the defendant, Herbert J.

They stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle approximately one mile from the defendant\u2019s apartment and informed the defendant that they had a search and seizure warrant \u201cfor himself and the vehicle and his apartment for drugs.\u201d The defendant responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything on him or in his car\u201d and then volunteered that \u201cthere was drugs back at [the] apartment.\u201d When they arrived at the apartment, the defendant \u201cshowed [the officers] which key was the key to get into [the] apartment and immediately upon entering the apartment [the defendant] stated that the drugs were in the freezer.\u201d Inside the freezer were two bricks of marijuana, which together weighed seven and one-half pounds. The officers seized the marijuana, along with two scales, multiple plastic bags, proof of residence and <em>$475 </em>in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Following his arrest, the defendant filed a motion to suppress, alleging, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he property seized is not that described in the warrant . . . .\u2019\u2019At the suppression hearing, Yepes was asked why the illicit drug marijuana was not \u201clisted as part and parcel as to the items to be seized.\u201d Yepes testified that \u201c[w]hen I typed up the warrant I made a mistake. I did a cut and copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>section of the warrant. ... I cut and paste from another warrant [with] this section on it and, when I put it in, I forgot to put the delete button for the cocaine and crack cocaine instead of putting the marijuana on it.\u201d On cross-examination, Yepes stated that he reviewed the warrant after its drafting and admitted that \u201cI just missed it. I made a mistake.\u201d The court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>subsequently denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>GROH </em>v. <em>RAMIREZ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 551, the United States Supreme Court concluded that a warrant that fails to identify <em>any </em>of the items intended to be seized is \u201cplainly invalid.\u201d Id., 557. The majority relies on that precedent in rejecting the state\u2019s contention that the reference to cocaine \u201cwas an obvious misprint or scrivener\u2019s error.\u201d Because the present case is patently distinguishable from <em>Groh, </em>I believe that reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Significantly, the warrant in <em>Groh </em>\u201cfailed to identify any of the items that [the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)] intended to seize.\u201d <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 554. As a result, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the warrant \u201cfailed altogether. . . . [It] was deficient in particularity because it provided no description of the <em>type </em>of evidence sought.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 557. The court emphasized that \u201c[t]his warrant did not simply omit a few items from a list of many to be seized, or misdescribe a few of several items. Nor did it make what fairly could be characterized as a mere technical mistake or typographical error. . . . [T]he warrant did not describe the items to be seized <em>at all.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id., 558; see also 2 W. LaFave, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Search and Seizure (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 4.6 (a), p. 619 (noting <em>Groh </em>\u201ccovers . . . only\u201d situation in which warrant did not describe items to be seized at all and \u201cleaves the others for future treatment by lower courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This case is not <em>Groh. </em>Here, the warrant described numerous items in addition to illicit drugs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, it cannot be said that the warrant in the present case failed to describe the items to be seized at all. Notably, the warrant provided ample description of \u201c \u2018the type of evidence sought\u2019 <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 557; which, in this case, was illicit drugs and items relating to the sale thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Moreover, this case presents that situation envisioned by the <em>Groh </em>court but inapplicable to the facts of that case: a mere typographical error. At the suppression hearing, Yepes admitted to making such an error in preparing the warrant. The warrant application and affidavit contained repeated references to the illicit drug marijuana, described two controlled purchases of marijuana from the defendant and alleged violations of \u00a7\u00a7 2 la-279 (c) and 2 la-277 (b), statutory provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>pertaining to the possession and sale of marijuana. Nevertheless, by \u201ccutting and pasting\u201d in the drafting of the warrant, Yepes mistakenly named cocaine instead of marijuana in the warrant itself. His is a classic example of the typographical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">That the <em>Groh </em>court, in analyzing the warrant in that case, distinguished between, on the one hand, failing to describe any items to be seized and, on the other hand, mere technical mistakes or typographical errors strongly suggests that such mistakes do not, a fortiori, ran afoul of the particularity requirement. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit has observed, \u201cthe requirement that a search warrant describe its objects with particularity is a standard of \u2018practical accuracy\u2019 rather than a hypertechnical one.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>92 F.3d 768, 769-70 (8th Cir. 1996); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1965) (\u201cthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract\u201d). \u201cThe point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 13-14, 68 S. Ct. 367, 92 L. Ed. 436 (1948); see also <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 481-82, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963) (\u201c[t]he arrest warrant procedure serves to insure that the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer will be interposed between the citizen and the police\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The warrant application and affidavit presented to Judge O\u2019Keefe detailed the alleged possession and sale of marijuana by the defendant. Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>O\u2019Keefe reviewed those documents and signed the warrant application. \u201cThe Constitution protects property owners ... by interposing, ex ante, the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer . . . between the citizen and the police.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 99, 126 S. Ct. 1494, 164 L. Ed. 2d 195 (2006); see also <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 575-76 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201cin contrast to the case of a truly warrantless search, where a warrant [due to a mistake] does not specify on its face the particular items to be seized but the warrant application passed on by the magistrate judge contains such details, a searchee still has the benefit of a determination by a neutral magistrate that there is probable cause to search a particular place and to seize particular items\u201d). The defendant was afforded that protection in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">A further difference between the present case and <em>Groh </em>involves notice. \u201cThe manifest purpose of [the] particularity requirement was to prevent general searches. By limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause to search, the requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1987); accord <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 624-27, 6 S. Ct. 524, 29 L. Ed. 746 (1886). Furthermore, \u201c [a] particular warrant also assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 561. Although the FBI agent in <em>Groh </em>argued that the goals of the particularity requirement were served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>because he orally described to the residents of the property to be searched the items for which he was searching, the residents disputed that account. Id., 562. Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthis case presents no occasion even to reach this argument . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. By contrast, it is undisputed that when the officers first contacted the defendant on December 23, 2003, they informed him that they had a search and seizure warrant \u201cfor himself and the vehicle and his apartment <em>for drugs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant responded that although he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything on him or in his car . . . there was <em>drugs </em>back at [the] apartment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, upon entering the apartment, the defendant immediately volunteered that <em>\u201cthe drugs </em>were in the freezer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Those exchanges, to me, indicate that the defendant knew precisely what items the officers intended to seize, namely, the illicit drug marijuana. In light of that record, the goals of the particularity clause were satisfied in the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>998 F.2d 1112 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1069, 114 S. Ct. 1644, 128 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1994), is illuminating. In that case, the warrant plainly was deficient, as it \u201ccontained no particular description of items and made no mention of any criminal statute or criminal conduct.\u201d Id., 1116. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he failure of the warrant to particularly describe the items to be seized does not render the warrant incurably defective. ... In this case, while the warrant refers to the affidavit there is no express language of incorporation. Nor does it appear that the affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>was physically attached to the warrant. However, under the facts of this case, the functional purposes of those two requirements\u2014to insure that all parties involved are informed of the scope of and limits upon the authorized search\u2014were fully satisfied. . . . Warrants must be read in a commonsense fashion . . . and we should not adhere to formal requirements of incorporation and attachment where as here, it is clear that the involved parties were aware of the scope of and limitations on the search.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 1116-17. That logic applies with equal force to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">INCORPORATION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>Groh </em>is further distinguishable in that the warrant in that case did not incorporate other documents by reference. <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 558. In the present case, the warrant incorporated by reference the critical parts of the warrant application and accompanying affidavit. The warrant began by directly referencing the warrant application and accompanying affidavit, stating: \u201cThe foregoing Affidavit and Application for Search and Seizure Warrant having been presented to and considered by the undersigned, a Judge of the Superior Court, the undersigned (a) is satisfied therefrom that grounds exist for said application, and (b) finds that said affidavit established grounds and probable cause for the undersigned to issue this Search and Seizure Warrant, such probable cause being the following: From said affidavit, the undersigned finds that there is probable cause for the undersigned to believe that the property described in the foregoing affidavit and application is within or upon the person, if any, described in the foregoing affidavit and application, or the place or thing, if any, named or described in the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>affidavit and application, under the conditions and circumstances set forth in the foregoing affidavit and application, and that, a Search and Seizure warrant should issue for said property.\u201d It further commanded an officer to \u201center into or upon and search the place or thing described in the foregoing affidavit and application,\u201d and to \u201c[s]earch the person described in the foregoing affidavit . . . for the property described in the foregoing affidavit and application . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, 8 </em>Conn. App. 290, 513 A.2d 710 (1986), this court held that almost identical language \u201cclearly incorporated the critical parts of the application and affidavit by reference.\u201d Id., 306. Unlike the present case, in which the narcotic cocaine and numerous other items were specifically listed, in <em>Santiago </em>\u201cthe preprinted box before the words, \u2018enter into or upon and search the place,\u2019 and the space following the phrase, \u2018to wit,\u2019 was left blank.\u201d Id., 300. Despite the fact that the warrant identified not a single item, we concluded that the incorporation of the warrant application and affidavit by reference cured any lack of particularity therein. Id., 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The majority declares that \u201c[e]ven if the state is correct that the affidavit and allegations sufficiently describe the items to be seized so as to inform the reader that marijuana, not cocaine, is the object of the search, here, as in <em>Groh, </em>the affidavit did not accompany the warrant.\u201d For two reasons, that logic troubles me.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">First, when the majority refers to informing \u201cthe reader\u201d that marijuana was the object of the search, I am unsure whether it is referring to the neutral and detached judicial officer required under the fourth amendment; see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 333 U.S. 13-14; or to the searchee, in this case, the defendant. If the latter, that statement is untenable, as the fourth amendment does not require an executing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to present a copy of the warrant to the property owner before conducting a search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>supra, 547 U.S. 98; see also <em>Dalia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>441 U.S. 238, 257, 99 S. Ct. 1682, 60 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1979) (\u201cthe specificity required by the Fourth Amendment does not generally extend to the means by which warrants are executed\u201d). As the United States Supreme Court recently observed, \u201c[t]he Constitution protects property owners not by giving them license to engage the police in a debate over the basis for the warrant, but by interposing, ex ante, the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer . . . between the citizen and the police.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>supra, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Second, whether an incorporated warrant application and affidavit, must accompany the warrant at execution is a question presently unresolved as a matter of federal constitutional law. In a mere sentence, the majority imposes such a requirement. Contrary to the majority\u2019s citation thereto, <em>Groh </em>did not articulate that requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Groh </em>stated: \u201c[I]n this case the warrant did not incorporate other documents by reference, nor did either the affidavit or the application (which had been placed under seal) accompany the warrant. Hence, we need not further explore the matter of incorporation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The proposition espoused by the majority was advanced by the defendant in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurwitz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>459 F.3d 463 (4th Cir. 2006). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit summarily rejected that contention: \u201cAccording to [the defendant], the [attachment itself must have accompanied the warrant at the time of the search for it to be construed to supply the particulars lacked by the search warrant. [The defendant] bases his argument on the language of <em>Groh </em>suggesting that the majority of the Courts of Appeals permit a general warrant to be cured by reference to a separate document only if both requirements\u2014that words of incorporation be used and that the incorporated document accompany the warrant\u2014are met. . . . Thus, [the defendant] reads <em>Groh </em>as establishing a definitive two-part rule for validating a warrant by incorporation of a separate document. <em>Groh, </em>however, establishes no such rule.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) Id., 471; accord <em>Baranski </em>v. <em>Fifteen Unknown Agents, </em>452 F.3d 433, 444 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cGrofe did not establish a one-size-fits-all requirement that affidavits must accompany all searches to prevent a lawfully authorized search from becoming a warrantless one\u201d), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1321, 127 S. Ct. 1908, 167 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2007); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gamboa, </em>439 F.3d 796, 807 (8th Cir.) <em>(\u201cGroh </em>did not rule upon the validity of a warrant that sufficiently incorporated a second document in order to meet the particularity requirement\u201d), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1042, 127 S. Ct. 605, 166 L. Ed. 2d 449 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">As the Fourth Circuit noted in <em>Hurwitz, </em>our federal Courts of Appeals are divided on the question of</p>\n<p id=\"AQu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>whether an incorporated warrant application and affidavit must accompany the warrant at the time of execution. It stated: \u201cWe recognize that a majority of our sister Circuit Courts of Appeals appear to require the satisfaction of both conditions before allowing a separate document to be read as part of the search warrant. <em>See Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>221 F.3d 425, 428-29 (3d Cir. 2000); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McGrew, </em>122 F.3d 847, 849-50 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dahlman, </em>13 F.3d 1391, 1395 (10th Cir. 1993) [cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1045, 114 S. Ct. 1575, 128 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1994)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>991 F.2d 819, 846-47 [(D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1030, 114 S. Ct. 650, 126 L.

In this circuit, however, it is sufficient either for the warrant to incorporate the supporting document by reference or for the supporting document to be attached to the warrant itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurwitz, </em>supra, 459 F.3d 471; see also <em>Baranski </em>v. <em>Fifteen Unknown Agents, </em>supra, 452 F.3d 449-50; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shugart, </em>117 F.3d 838, 845 (5th Cir. 1997); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>supra, 998 F.2d 1117 (courts should not adhere to formal requirements of incorporation and attachment where parties were aware of scope of and limitations on search); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wuagneux, </em>683 F.2d 1343, 1351 n.6 (11th Cir. 1982) (ambiguity in warrant could be cured by affidavit not incorporated by reference or attached to warrant), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 814, 104 S. Ct. 69, 78 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1983). In expanding the scope of the fourth amendment to require that an incorporated warrant application and affidavit must accompany the warrant at the time of execution, the majority fails to even acknowledge this split among our federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>On this divided issue, I side with the minority of jurisdictions that concludes that the particularity clause does not require that an incorporated warrant application and affidavit must accompany the warrant at the time of execution. Indeed, Connecticut law already mandates that, generally, \u201c[wjithin forty-eight hours of [the] search, a copy of the application for the warrant and a copy of all affidavits upon which the warrant is based shall be given to [the] owner, occupant or person. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-33c (a). The proposition today enunciated by the majority\u2014that an incorporated warrant application and affidavit must accompany the warrant at the time of execution for the warrant to be valid\u2014is inconsistent with that Connecticut statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Furthermore, that proposition is not to be found in the United States constitution. Particularly persuasive is the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>Baranski </em>v. <em>Fifteen Unknown Agents, </em>supra, 452 F.3d 433, which observed that \u201c[t]he Warrant Clause contains four textual requirements, each of which places restrictions on the issuance of a warrant. \u2018[N]o Warrants shall <em>issue,' </em>it says, \u2018but upon [1] probable cause, [2] supported by Oath or affirmation, and [3] particularly describing the place to be searched, and [4] the persons or things to be seized.\u2019 U.S. Const, amend. IV. ... By their terms, each of these requirements must be satisfied upon the \u2018issuance]\u2019 of the warrant, and nothing about the text of the clause suggests that a warrant valid upon issuance may become invalid upon execution when the scope and timing of the search is conducted in accordance with the terms of the warrant.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 440-41. The core protection afforded by the particularity clause is the insertion of a neutral and detached magistrate between state and citizen. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>supra, 547 U.S. 99. Although the reasonableness clause of the fourth amendment certainly applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>to the execution of a search and seizure warrant; see, e.g., <em>Dalia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 441 U.S. 257; by its plain language, the particularity clause applies only to the issuance of a warrant. Neither the defendant nor the majority refer to any authority indicating otherwise. As a result, I would conclude that a search and seizure warrant that incorporates by reference the warrant application and affidavit supplies the requisite particularity to the search warrant, regardless of whether those documents accompanied the search warrant at the time of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">ILLICIT DRUGS</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The majority opinion suffers an additional infirmity. Irrespective of the <em>Groh </em>precedent and the issue of incorporation, I would conclude that the warrant was valid in light of the illegal nature of the item in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">In my view, it is unnecessary for a search and seizure warrant to identify the particular illicit drug sought to be seized. As other courts have held, \u201c[i]f the purpose of the search is to find a specific item of property, it should be so particularly described in the warrant as to preclude the possibility of the officer seizing the wrong property; whereas, on the other hand, if the purpose is to seize not a specific property, but any property of a specified character, which by reason of its character is illicit or contraband, a specific particular description of the property is unnecessary and it may be described generally as to its nature or character.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>172 Colo. 285, 290, 473 P.2d 698 (1970); see also <em>Carlton </em>v. <em>State, </em>418 So. 2d 449, 450 (Fla.

App. 640, stating: \u201c[T]he risk of an invasion of constitutionally protected privacy is minimal when there is probable cause to search for a controlled substance. Officers executing a warrant for marijuana are authorized to inspect virtually every aspect of the premises. ... If, during their search they discover another illegal substance, the nonspecified substance would be subject to seizure under the plain view doctrine. . . . Thus, officers executing the warrant at hand had no broader discretion to search than they would have had if the warrant had specified \u2018marijuana.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 645. Likewise, the Supreme Court of South Carolina has noted that \u201cillegal drugs is not such a general term that it allows for abuse and unbridled discretion by law enforcement personnel or allows for a general search.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 297 S.C. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">It is enough, then, for a warrant to describe the item to be seized as \u201cillicit drugs,\u201d \u201cillegal narcotics,\u201d \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d or the like. The warrant in the present case went a step further, mistakenly identifying the narcotic cocaine. I would not hold that mistake to be fatal to the constitutionality of the warrant. \u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract. . . . Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>supra, 380 U.S. 108; <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 704 (\u201c \u2018practical margin of flexibility\u2019 \u201d required in construing terms of warrant). \u201c[B]ecause a search warrant provides the detached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate ... we have expressed a strong preference for warrants and declared that in a doubtful or marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>without one it would fall.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mordowanec, </em>259 Conn. 94, 113, 788 A.2d 48, cert. denied, 536 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 2369, 153 L. Ed. 2d 189 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Practical problems abound with the majority\u2019s decision today. In the present case, the illicit drug cocaine mistakenly was named instead of the illicit drug marijuana, which rendered the warrant invalid under the majority\u2019s reasoning. Applying that reasoning to future cases, what becomes of the warrant that mistakenly lists \u201cd-lysergic acid diethylamide\u201d instead of \u201cpeyote,\u201d or \u201ccocaine\u201d instead of \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d? All are illicit drags under Connecticut law. See General Statutes \u00a7 21a-240 (8). Striking down an otherwise valid warrant due to such tenuous distinctions is a needless exercise in hypertechnical analysis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The protection afforded by the particularity clause centers on the intervention of a neutral and detached magistrate. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>supra, 547 U.S. 99; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 333 U.S. 13-14. Judge O\u2019Keefe was presented with a warrant application and affidavit that chronicled two separate drag transactions involving the sale of marijuana by the defendant. To paraphrase the Supreme Court of Montana, upon reviewing the search warrant, warrant application and affidavit together, the fact that the officers were to search for, and seize, illicit drags is inescapable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Broell, </em>supra, 249 Mont. 122. Indeed, the warrant authorized officers to search 153 Trolley Crossing and seize illicit drags found therein. To invalidate a warrant premised upon an application and affidavit that detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the possession and sale of marijuana by the defendant but, due to typographical error, mistakenly referenced cocaine is the quintessential exaltation of form over substance and is inconsistent with a practical application of the particularity clause. Accordingly, I cannot join my colleagues in concluding that the warrant was invalid under the fourth amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> The search and seizure warrant application stated: \u201cThe undersigned, being duly sworn, complains on oath that the undersigned has probable cause to believe that certain property, to wit: Cocaine, crack cocaine, cutting agents such as lactose and baking soda, white powder, razor blades, scrapers, straws, packaging materials, foil packets, plastic bags, glassine envelopes, glass or plastic vials, scales, records and other \u2018data\u2019 ... as defined by [General Statutes \u00a7] 53a-250 (8) of sale and or purchases of narcotics, currency, rifles, shotguns, semi-automatic weapons, fully automatic weapons, revolvers, ammunition, and other dangerous weapons.

See <em>Groh </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>supra, 540 U.S. 564 (\u201ceven a cursory reading of the warrant in this case\u2014perhaps just a simple glance\u2014would have revealed a glaring deficiency that any reasonable police officer would have known was const itutionally fatal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> This court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 8 Conn.
