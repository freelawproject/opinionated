J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANU\">The defendant, Morris Silverstein, appeals from the judgment of the trial court quieting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>title to land located on Cider Mill Road in Bolton in favor of the substitute plaintiff, Michael M. Taylor, trustee (plaintiff), and finding against the defendant on his counterclaim. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that he failed to establish the existence of two easements over the plaintiffs property by either (a) deed or (b) prescription<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) stated that counts three and four of his counterclaim had been stricken previously. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The following facts as found by the court are relevant to our resolution of the issues on appeal. The plaintiff owns a parcel of land on the easterly side of Cider Mill Road, which consists of approximately fifty-six acres and which abuts land owned by the defendant. As stated in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision: \u201cThe plaintiff acquired title to his parcel as a result of a partition sale order by the Superior Court .... After the committee sale was ratified by the Superior Court in August, 2000, the defendant took an appeal to the Appellate Court [see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Silverstein, </em>67 Conn. App. 58, 787 A.2d 20 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 931, 793 A.2d 1085 (2002)], which finally was resolved on March 1, 2004, after his petition for certification to our Supreme Court was denied, as was his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cDuring the appellate stages, the defendant filed an \u2018Affidavit and Notice of Continued Use\u2019 in the Bolton town clerk\u2019s office . . . claiming two rights-of-way from Cider Mill Road to [the defendant\u2019s] 5.2 acre parcel [which was] referred to by the defendant as \u2018Fish\u2019s five acres.\u2019 The defendant contend[ed] that he [had] two rights-of-way over the plaintiffs property by either or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>all of the following: (a) By grant or reservation of deed; (b) By necessity [or] (c) By prescription. The plaintiff [sought] to quiet title [of] the property to himself, claiming that the defendant [could not] establish entitlement to the rights of way under any theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u201cTestimony was proffered by two witnesses. The plaintiff called Attorney Richard Soranno, who was qualified as an expert in land titles, title searches and realty law. Attorney Soranno [had] some thirty-two years of experience in the field and [had] done approximately 5000 title searches for individuals, banks and insurance companies. The defendant was the sole defense witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The court opined that \u201cit [was] clear that, unless the defendant [could] prove he [had] rights-of-way as he claim[ed], the plaintiff [was] entitled to have title vested in his favor as a result of the approved partition sale and committee deed.\u201d The court went on to conclude that the defendant had not established the existence of the alleged rights-of-way under any theory presented and, therefore, rendered judgment quieting title in favor of the plaintiff. The court also \u201cdenied\u201d the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, which had sought a \u201cjudicial determination recognizing and honoring his rights-of-way . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly concluded that he did not establish the existence of two easements over the plaintiffs property either by deed or by prescription. We will consider each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The defendant claims that in reviewing the deeds in both the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s chains of title, \u201cit is readily apparent that rights-of-way, in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>cart paths, were in existence upon the land and being used as of the dates of those instruments [which went back to 1883].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that, even if rights-of-way, in the form of cart paths \u201cmay\u201d have existed, the defendant failed to establish the actual existence of \u201crights-of-way over the plaintiffs property that were reserved in deeds [he] submitted, the location of the alleged rights-of-way and, fatally, that [his] land was the dominant estate benefited by alleged rights-of-way . . . .\u201d We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Initially, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cThe construction of a deed in order to ascertain the intent expressed in the deed presents a question of law and requires consideration of all its relevant provisions in the light of the surrounding circumstances. ... On appeal the scope of review of such a question is plenary . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Vigliotti, </em>222 Conn. 216, 222, 610 A.2d 565 (1992). \u201cIf, after a plenary review, an appellate court concludes that deeded easements exist, their nature and extent usually must be decided by a trial court, and ordinarily a remand is required for a finding of relevant facts to establish their boundaries.\u201d <em>Mandes </em>v. <em>Godiksen, </em>57 Conn. App. 79, 83, 747 A.2d 47, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 915, 754 A.2d 164 (2000). The question to be determined on appeal is whether there was an intent as expressed in the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s chains of title to establish the easements. We do this by an examination of the deeds, the map referenced in the plaintiffs deed and the recorded instruments that appear in the chain of title to the particular parcel of land. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">At trial, the defendant submitted a warranty deed recorded on January 24, 1911, at volume 18, page 96, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of the Bolton land records, from William F. Risley to Otto E. Mannel, which is in the plaintiffs chain of title. The deed grants Mannel a certain tract of land in Bolton, which contains twelve acres, and is \u201cbounded North by land of William F. Risley and by land of Mrs. L. J. Robinson,\u2014and by land of William Fish,\u2014East by land of Mrs. L. J. Robinson,\u2014and by land of John L. Risley . . . and by land of Gary D. Carpentier and wife,\u2014and by land of Wm. Fish,\u2014West by land of William Fish\u2014 and by Otto E. Mannel\u2019s house lot\u2014and by a highway known as \u2018Bolton Ave.\u2019 \u201d The deed goes on to state that \u201c[t]he right is reserved, to those who have a right, to cross and recross in the usual traveled cart paths\u201d and to reserve to William F. Risley \u201cthe right, until April 1, 1913, to enter upon\u2014cut and cart away certain wood and timber\u201d from land that is \u201csituated on the North\u2014 East\u2014and South of Otto E. Mannel\u2019s house lot.\u201d The deed also provides: \u201cAnd furthermore, I, the said grantor do by these presents bind myself and my heirs forever to Warrant and Defend the above granted and bargained premises to him the said grantee his heirs and assigns against all claims and demands whatsoever. Except as is above stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant also submitted a deed recorded on April 12, 1911, at volume 18, page 97, of the Bolton land records, from William F. Risley to Mrs. Charlotte Robertson. This deed conveyed a \u201ccertain tract of woodland\u2014containing two acres . . . situated in the town of Bolton . . . starting at a bound at the northwest comer of land I have recently sold to Otto E. Mannel\u2014 thence running N. 71V2 [degrees], E. 5 [rods] to Mrs. Robertson\u2019s southwest bound (by a stump) of land she already owns, bounding this tract on the East\u2014thence running N. 1 [degree], W. 32 [rods] on the East line of her above mentioned land, to a bound on the south line of land of Lewis Fish. Thence turn S. 75 [degrees], W. 15 [rods]\u201411 [links] along Lewis Fish\u2019s south line to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>bound on the East line of a highway. Thence turn southerly on the east line of said highway to the first mentioned bound. There is a cart path crossing the southwest comer of this tract of land\u2014to those who have a right\u2014is reserved the right to use this cart path.\u201d \u201cAnd furthermore, I, the said grantor do by these presents bind myself and my heirs forever to Warrant and Defend the above granted and bargained premises to her the said grantee her heirs and assigns against all claims and demands whatsoever. Except as is above stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Although these early deeds in the plaintiffs chain of title, which were submitted by the defendant, state that a right-of-way is \u201creserved\u201d for those who \u201cmay\u201d already possess such a right, neither of these deeds actually conveys or grants a right-of-way to the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title, nor do they make any reference as to who had such a right, with the exception of the limited right granted to William F. Risley.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, any mention of the cart path or other right-of-way is absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>from all of the later documents in the plaintiffs chain of title in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The documents submitted by the defendant to demonstrate his chain of title consist of a warranty deed recorded on December <em>4, </em>1906, found at volume 18, page 15, of the Bolton land records, from Albert F. Wilson to William L. Fish. The deed sets forth an area containing five acres lying in part to the north of land owned by Risley. The deed also provides that the property is \u201cfree from all [enjcumbrances whatsoever except rights of way through said land, if any exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The next deed in the defendant\u2019s chain of title, recorded on August 1, 1950, at volume 28, page 6, of the Bolton land records, is from Albert E. Fish to Fred G. Boss. That deed states, in part, that the land is bordered \u201cWesterly by land of . . . Silverstein and land formerly of one Robinson, but now Shearer, in part by each, together with rights of way for passage to and from Lake Street over land of said Silverstein and said Shearer and being the same land acquired by me from the Estate of my father William L. Fish.\u201d Additionally, the deed also contains a provision that the property is \u201cfree from all encumbrances whatsoever, except rights of way through said land if any exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Although the defendant argues that the combination of these documents clearly demonstrates the existence of his rights-of-way, we agree with the plaintiff and the court that the documents do not establish the actual existence of any rights-of-way, their location or in whose favor they might lie. Early deeds in the plaintiffs chain of title from 1911 and 1913 set forth the retention of the right to cross the property to whomever might possess such right, without establishing, granting or actually reserving any such right. All subsequent deeds in the plaintiffs chain of title, from 1914 to the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>trial set forth no recognition, grant or reservation of a right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We are presented with a situation in which the August 1, 1950 deed in the defendant\u2019s chain of title states there are \u201crights of way for passage\u201d over the former Silverstein and Shearer properties, but there is nothing in the plaintiffs chain of title that grants such rights-of-way to the defendant\u2019s predecessors in title. Although the defendant\u2019s 1950 deed states that there are rights-of-way over the Silverstein and Shearer land, the defendant\u2019s dominant estate cannot grant rights-of-way over the plaintiffs servient estate, and we find nothing in the plaintiffs chain of title itself that granted or reserved to the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title rights-of-way over of the plaintiffs land.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The defendant also argues in his reply brief that if the language in the plaintiffs deeds are considered to be ambiguous because they do not specify to whom the rights-of-way were granted, then the court should have construed such ambiguity in favor of the grantee. Although this may be an accurate statement of the law; see <em>Lago </em>v. <em>Guerrette, </em>219 Conn. 262, 268, 592 A.2d 939 (1991) (\u201c[a]ny ambiguity in the instrument creating an easement, in a case of reasonable doubt, will be construed in favor of the grantee\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); in this case the defendant first had to prove to the court that a deed actually granted a right-of-way and that he, through his predecessor in title, in fact, succeeded to that interest before he could gain the benefit of such construction. This, he did not do. Accordingly, we agree with the court that the defendant did not provide sufficient proof that any of the deeds in the plaintiffs chain of title granted rights-of-way or that he was the beneficiary of deeded rights-of-way over the plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The defendant next claims that if the deeds do not prove that he has rights-of-way over the plaintiffs property, then he established those rights by prescription. In response to the plaintiffs argument that the defendant clearly demonstrated that the plaintiffs predecessor had acquiesced to the use of these cart paths, the defendant also argues that \u201c[w]hile [the plaintiffs predecessor] allowed Arthur Fish to use the cart paths, she did not give him permission to do so.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We review the court\u2019s finding that the defendant failed to establish the existence of a prescriptive easement under the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Muellner, </em>283 Conn. 510, 534, 932 A.2d 382 (2007). \u201cWhen the factual basis of atrial court\u2019s decision is challenged, [an appellate court\u2019s] function is to determine whether, in light of the pleadings and evidence in the whole record, these findings of fact are clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u201c[A] prescriptive easement is established by proving an open, visible, continuous and uninterrupted use for fifteen years made under a claim of right. . . . The standard of proof that is required is a fair preponderance of the evidence. ... To establish an easement by prescription it is absolutely essential that the use be adverse. It must be such as to give a right of action in favor of the party against whom it has been exercised. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>. . . The use must occur without license or permission and must be unaccompanied by any recognition of [the right of the owner of the servient tenement] to stop such use. . . . Use by express or implied permission or license cannot ripen into an easement by prescription.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boccanfuso </em>v. <em>Green, </em>91 Conn. App. 296, 309, 880 A.2d 889 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In the defendant\u2019s answer to the plaintiffs complaint, he states that he \u201cdoes not know if his two [rights-of-way] are aptly described as being \u2018adverse\u2019 to [the] plaintiffs title to land . ...\u201d In his affidavit, the defendant also attested, in part: \u201cAs a youngster growing up on the property, back just prior to and dining the World War II era, the undersigned many times witnessed Albert [Fish\u2019s] son, Arthur, cutting and hauling wood from the said parcel of land. In order to get to the property, Arthur cleared the [rights-of-way] by cutting roadways through the trees that had fallen across the [rights-of-way] during the 1938 hurricane. The wood Arthur thereby created in clearing his way was left along the side of the [rights-of-way] for . . . use [by the plaintiffs predecessor in title,] so consequently, she did not object to Arthur\u2019s doings.\u201d Finally, the defendant testified at trial that the plaintiffs predecessor in title knew that the Fishes were cutting down trees along the cart paths, but because they were leaving wood that she used, she did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On the basis of this and other evidence, the court found that the defendant had failed to establish that the use of the cart paths was adverse, under a claim of right, or that the use was open and uninterrupted for more than fifteen years. Although the defendant had argued that the continuous use of these paths and the 1950 deed in his chain of title gave constructive notice of a prescriptive right to use the rights-of-way, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>found that the use by the Fish family was an approved use.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The defendant, on appeal, does not explain how the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. Rather, he merely disagrees with the court\u2019s findings and its weighing of the evidence. The defendant admitted in his answer that \u201cadverse\u201d probably was not a proper term to define the Fishes\u2019 use of the cart paths, and in his affidavit and in his trial testimony, he admitted that the plaintiff s predecessor in title knew that the Fishes were using the paths and that she did not object to their clearing wood from them because she used the wood that was left behind. As was found by the trial court, this evidence did not demonstrate a use that was adverse to the owner. Accordingly, we conclude that the findings of the court were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly stated that counts three and four of his counterclaim had been stricken previously, and he argues that these counts remain viable, requiring that we remand the case for consideration of these outstanding counterclaims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u201c[T]he interpretation of pleadings is always a question [of law] for the court .... The modem trend, which is followed in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically. . . . Although essential allegations may not be supplied by conjecture or remote implication . . . the complaint [or counterclaim] must be read in its entirety in such a way as to give effect to the pleading with reference to the general theory upon which it proceeded.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>100 Conn. App. 805, 809, 921 A.2d 611 (2007). \u201cAlthough . . . our jurisprudence requires us to interpret pleadings broadly, we [also] must constme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>them reasonably to contain all that they mean but not in such a way so as to strain the bounds of rational comprehension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nazami </em>v. <em>Patrons Mutual Ins. </em>Co., 280 Conn. 619, 629, 910 A.2d 209 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The defendant\u2019s initial answer to the plaintiffs complaint contained a counterclaim that alleged in its entirety: \u201cDefendant seeks cost of suit (including attorney fees), expenses, damages, interest, a reasonable fee for defendant\u2019s time, and any and all other amounts the court deems appropriate, as is finally determined, that are or would be due defendant as a result of defendant\u2019s involvement in this harassing and totally unnecessary law suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In response to this counterclaim, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike on the ground that the counterclaim failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, arguing that it sounded like the defendant was attempting to plead a cause of action for vexatious litigation but that such a claim was not ripe at this stage. The court granted the motion to strike, without written opinion, on February 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The defendant then filed a new pleading entitled \u201crepleading of counterclaim.\u201d The repleaded counterclaim stated in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u201cIn accordance with the provisions of Practice Book [\u00a7] 10-44, defendant herein repleads his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u201cFirst: Defendant seeks a judicial determination recognizing and honoring his [rights-of-way] over plaintiffs subject properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\u201cSecond: Plaintiffs lawsuit is a frivolous lawsuit. Defendant seeks payment of such statutory amounts that are allowed as damages for bringing such a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201cThird: Defendant seeks reimbursement for his expenses involved in this entire mater, including attorney fees, witness fees, expert and specialist fees, interest, and any and all other amounts the court deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u201cFourth: Defendant also seeks a reasonable fee for his own time involved in this entire matter, and such other relief that the court deems proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">On November 3, 2005, the plaintiff filed a request to revise, requesting that the second paragraph of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim be revised by removing the paragraph in its entirety. The plaintiff stated that the ground for this requested revision was twofold\u2014first, the second paragraph virtually was identical to the counterclaim that previously had been stricken, and, second, the defendant had pleaded two separate causes of action in one counterclaim, the first being a request for a declaratory judgment and the second being a frivolous lawsuit claim. In response, the defendant filed an objection, which the court overruled, and the second paragraph of the counterclaim thereby was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In its memorandum of decision after trial, the court, in part, denied the defendant\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment that honored and recognized his rights-of-way, and it stated that \u201cthe second, third and fourth counts [of the counterclaim] were previously stricken . . . .\u201d The defendant now claims that the court was incorrect in its statement and that \u201ccounts\u201d three and four remain outstanding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the court\u2019s statement technically may have been incorrect, we do not agree that those remaining paragraphs constitute two additional causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Reviewing the defendant\u2019s \u201crepleading of counterclaim\u201d both broadly and realistically, it is apparent that this counterclaim consisted of four separate paragraphs, which contained two causes of action, a request for a declaratory judgment and a vexatious litigation claim, followed by two paragraphs outlining his prayers for relief. After the court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the plaintiffs request to revise, thereby eliminating the second paragraph of the counterclaim, the counterclaim consisted of a request for a declaratory judgment recognizing and honoring his rights-of-way, followed by two ancillary paragraphs that set forth his prayers for relief. When the court ruled against the defendant on the remaining counterclaim, no further ruling was necessary on these ancillary paragraphs, as they were not separate causes of action. When the causes of action to which they were ancillary fell, they fell too.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> At trial, the defendant also had claimed, as an alternative, that the easements were acquired by necessity. He has not briefed this alternative claim on appeal, and, therefore, we do not address it. We do note, however, that in addressing this claim, the court found that the plaintiff could access his 5.2 acre parcel via other abutting land that he owned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> The defendant also argues that the court \u201cmistakenly attributed deeds in the plaintiffs chain of title ... as deeds in the defendant\u2019s chain of title.\u201d Because we conduct a plenary review of the record as it pertains to the deeds, these alleged factual discrepancies are not critical here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> In 14 R. Powell, Eeal Property (2007) \u00a7 81A.05 [3] [h] [iv], p. 81A-106, it is explained: \u201cThe term \u2018reservation\u2019 would be appropriate . . . [where] the grantor is creating the easement in himself or herself. However, for the sake of efficiency, or out of ignorance of the conceptual foundation of a \u2018reservation,\u2019 the grantor may attempt to both convey the land to the grantee and \u2018reserve\u2019 an easement in favor of another person, all in the same deed. Under traditional conveyancing doctrine, such aprocedure is impermissible. It notes the fact that the grantor has attempted to reserve an easement in favor of someone other than the grantor himself, and points to the incongruity of that process. The use of the term \u2018reservation\u2019 means that the grantor has kept the interest for himself or herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">More recent decisions, however, \u201cshow a marked tendency toward the rejection of the traditional doctrine. In these cases, the fact that the conveyance grants or reserves an interest in a third person does not automatically invalidate the interest. If the grantor\u2019s intent is clear, the interest is properly conveyed to the third person. Some state statutes also require such an interpretation. However, there remain significant decisions which reject this approach and would continue to endorse the rule that a deed may not reserve an interest in favor of a person other than the grantor.\u201d Id., pp. 81A-106-107.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"> Although the defendant did file a motion for articulation in which he requested that the court correct parts of its memorandum of decision, he made no request for clarification or correction regarding this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
