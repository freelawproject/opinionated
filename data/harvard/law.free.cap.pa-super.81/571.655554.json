The only complaint is that judgment n. o. v. was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Plaintiff Frank P. Height leased furniture from defendant, with the right to purchase \u201cby paying the lessor one cent purchase money,\u201d after complying with the lease. He got back in the rent. On June 7th, defendant sent his agent to the plaintiff\u2019s house (the second to call that day). The agent testified, among other things, that his duty was \u201cto look after delinquent accounts, or accounts that people refused to pay the regular collector and the regular channels.\u201d The controversy in the case centers on what happened when this agent called. The wife testified that as she was about to open the door \u201che pushed it in. He says to me he was Hamburger\u2019s furniture man, and that he came for the things. I says, \u2018Well, I wanted you to see Mr. Height, I think he made arrangements with them.\u2019 He says, \u2018I don\u2019t see Mr. Height.\u2019 He says, \u2018I want the goods,\u2019 and he pushed me, and knocked me up against the wall, and I was dazed, and he grabbed hold of me, but I don\u2019t remember where it was he grabbed me, and that is all I know until I came to.\u201d......\u201cQ. What happened after you say he pushed you? A. The door knob hit me......and knocked me against the wall the way he shoved. I tried to get to my feet, and he grabbed hold of me and says, \u2018I am going to take the goods.\u2019 After I came to I was upstairs in bed.\u201d She regained consciousness the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Defendant\u2019s agent denied that he pushed the door against the plaintiff or otherwise injured her. He said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>lie was admitted to the house and informed her that \u201cthe reports we have gotten do not seem satisfactory, and I thought I would come over here and ascertain the facts myself, because I have charge of this, and I want to give you all of the time we can in regard to making these payments, but you have been so far delinquent in them that we want to know whether it is justifiable to extend time to you or not.\u201d He testified he heard her explanation of the delay and \u201csaid \u2018all right\u2019 and then I left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">The court instructed the jury in a charge of which no complaint is made, to determine whether defendant\u2019s agent injured the wife in the course of performing his duty to his employer, or whether in the circumstances shown, the assault, if made, was outside the scope of the employment. For the purposes of this appeal, the verdict settled the fact against defendant and we are bound by the finding. On the evidence, which was disputed, the question of what was within the course of the employment, and whether what occurred, was so performed, Is for the jury: McClung v. Dearborne, 134 Pa. 396; Marcus v. Gimbel Brothers, 231 Pa. 200; McLaughlin v. Singer Sewing Machine Co., 75 Pa. Superior Ct. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
