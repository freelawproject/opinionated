Stonecipher, </em>and with him <em>John M. Ralston, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjdG\">The popular understanding of the word \u201cmailed\u201d as applied to a letter is that it was duly stamped and placed under the control of the officers of the postal department: Reynolds v. Maryland Casualty Co., 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 456.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AvZ\">July 12, 1923:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Aizq\">Trexler, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">The action was brought in the County Court of Allegheny County to recover the contract price of certain mops. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff, the petition of the defendant for the allowance of an appeal to the court of common pleas was discharged, and the error assigned is the refusal to grant the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The only question properly presented is whether the county court correctly decided to receive as evidence certain letters marked Exhibits \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD.\u201d The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>presented is very meagre and of course the question submitted to us must be decided by reference to the paper-books. The objection to the letters designated as \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d was \u201cthat the testimony in the case does not disclose to whom these exhibits had been mailed, when they were mailed or whether or not they had been mailed to the......defendant\u2019s place of address of whether they had been regularly stamped as they should have been.\u201d The deposition of J. E. Estes received without objection contains the following in reference to the letters \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD.\u201d \u201cThese were mailed by her [the stenographer] the same day [July 19th] to Mr. Shannon\u2019s Pittsburgh office. They were never questioned or returned to us.\u201d There was no cross-examination to ascertain whether the witness knew what he was talking about, but his statement remains as made. The assertion that the letters were mailed implies that they were duly stamped: Reynolds v. Maryland Casualty Co., 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 456. How can the court be convicted of error in refusing to sustain this objection to the letters in the face of testimony which did disclose that the exhibits had been mailed on a day certain to the defendant\u2019s Pittsburgh address, and presumably properly stamped?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The assignment of error is overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
