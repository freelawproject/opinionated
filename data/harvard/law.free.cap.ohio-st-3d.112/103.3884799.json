Agopian\u2019s license to practice law for allegedly improperly billing the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas for court-appointed legal services. After a careful review of the facts in this case, we reject this recommendation and conclude that the conduct here warrants a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">{\u00b6 3} Disciplinary Counsel filed a complaint against Richard Van Agopian of Cleveland, Attorney Registration No. 0030924, in connection with fee bills he submitted to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas for representation of indigent defendants charged with criminal conduct. Admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1975, Agopian has primarily represented defendants in criminal matters in Cuyahoga County since about 1985, and he often served as appointed counsel for indigent parties. This case involves a series of fee bills he submitted to the court for approval primarily between the months of October 2002 and April 2003, a period during which he represented between 30 and 40 such clients. The majority of these cases involved third-, fourth-, and fifth-degree felonies, for which Loc.R. 33 of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, General Division, specified an hourly rate of $40 for out-of-court and $50 for in-court representation and set a maximum fee for these felonies at $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Because his practice necessitated his daily appearance in court, Agopian would spend his weekends preparing fee bills and would approximate the amount of time he spent working on a particular case in drafting his fee requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 5} In a hearing before a three-member panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, Agopian stipulated that he submitted bills to the court that did not reflect the day upon which he rendered the services mentioned. The panel found that his billing records reflected a pattern of recording the same number of hours to prepare and file motions in a number of cases regardless of the actual time spent and that he would assign those hours to a date regardless of whether he actually performed that work on that day. He admitted that he had approximated his actual time to perform these services but had nevertheless certified to the court the accuracy of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 6} The panel found that Agopian submitted fee bills for work performed in excess of 24 hours on three days: Saturday, October 12, 2002; Saturday, November 2, 2002; and Saturday, November 23, 2002. But the reality is that Agopian spent those weekends in his office preparing fee bills for cases he had worked on during the previous weeks and months, giving the appearance that he had performed more than 24 hours of work on a given day. Despite the perception, Agopian did all the work on each individual case but failed to accurately record the exact days of his appearances in court or the specific number of hours that he spent on each case. Rather, Agopian recorded the same number of hours spent in motion practice and in opening each of these case files in an effort to obtain the $400 maximum legal fee authorized by local rule for the work he performed. Despite this careless and sloppy timekeeping practice, there is no evidence of deceit or any course of conduct designed to collect fees for work not performed. The panel found that Agopian \u201croutinely performs services in an amount far in excess of the time for which he submits payment requests.\u201d One panel member noted that Agopian \u201cwasn\u2019t taking one hour * * * and turning it into three. It looks to me like he was taking three hours and turning it into one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b67} Following the hearing, the panel determined that Agopian had violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). The panel recommended dismissal of the Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s allegation of a third rule violation, finding no evidence that Agopian had violated DR 2-106 (a lawyer shall not charge or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 8} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline adopted the panel\u2019s recommendation and recommended a one-year stayed suspension of Agopian\u2019s license to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Disciplinary Counsel objected to the board\u2019s recommendation that the alleged violation of DR 2-106 be dismissed. We overrule Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s objection and accept the board\u2019s recommendation to dismiss this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 10} This court has consistently recognized that \u201cin determining the appropriate length of the suspension and any attendant conditions, we must recognize that the primary purpose of disciplinary sanctions is not to punish the offender, but to protect the public.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 204, 2004-0hio-4704, 815 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 53; see, also, <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Weaver </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 97, 100, 70 O.O.2d 175, 322 N.E.2d 665. As we stated in <em>Weaver, </em>\u201c \u2018In [a] disciplinary matter, the primary purpose is not to punish an offender; it is to protect the public against members of the bar who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the relationship of attorney and client; it is to ascertain whether the conduct of the attorney involved has demonstrated his unfitness to practice law, and if so to deprive him of his previously acquired privilege to serve as an officer of the court.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>In re Pennica </em>(1962), 36 N.J. 401, 418-419, 177 A.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 11} As the panel noted, Agopian\u2019s conduct \u201cdid not involve the exploitative motive found in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Holland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 372, 2005-Ohio-5322 [835 N.E.2d 361],\u201d in which we suspended an attorney for one year for double billing, i.e., \u201c \u2018billing of fees and costs to more than one client for the same work or the same hours.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holland, </em>\u00b6 21, quoting Hopkins, Law Firms, Technology, and the Double-Billing Dilemma (1998), 12 Geo.J.Legal Ethics 93, 99. Agopian did not pad his bills or charge for work he did not perform. Moreover, he took full responsibility for his sloppy record keeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 12} We have considered similar cases involving fees and determined a public reprimand to be the appropriate sanction. In <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Schram, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 512, 2003-Ohio-2063, 787 N.E.2d 1184, in which an attorney violated DR 2-106(A) by charging a nonrefundable fee, we determined that a public reprimand should be imposed. We noted Schram\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, her cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, and the panel\u2019s determination that she \u201chad not intended to keep more money than she earned from her client.\u201d Id., \u00b67.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Randolph </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 325, 708 N.E.2d 192, we publicly reprimanded an attorney who violated DR 2-106(A) by retaining a portion of a fee he had not earned. In so holding, we noted Randolph\u2019s lack of a disciplinary record, his character letters attesting to his honesty and integrity, and his complete acceptance of responsibility. The same considerations expressed in <em>Schram </em>and <em>Randolph </em>militate against imposing any sanction other than a public reprimand for Agopian\u2019s conduct. While we do not condone the billing practices employed in this case, the conduct involves neither a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>deliberate effort to deceive in order to generate funds not earned nor an effort to collect for services not rendered, and it is not a double-billing case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b264-13\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b264-14\">Kegler, Brown, Hill <em>&amp; </em>Ritter, Christopher J. Weber, and Geoffrey Stern, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 14} We have also held that \u201cmitigating evidence can justify a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Carroll, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 84, 2005-Ohio-3805, 831 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 13. In this case, the mitigating evidence demonstrates that Agopian has no prior disciplinary record, has fully cooperated with the disciplinary process, and has accepted responsibility for his conduct. The panel received more than 40 letters attesting to his character, including one from Judge Janet Burnside (\u201cI have always found him honest and forthright in all my dealings with him\u201d) and two from former presidents of the Cuyahoga Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, David L. Grant and James M. Kersey, who attested to his integrity, reputation, and professionalism. In other letters, colleagues Mark A. Stanton noted \u201can unwavering belief that Richard Agopian embodies the highest standards of professional excellence and integrity,\u201d and William T. Doyle wrote that Agopian \u201calways conducted himself in a very professional manner.\u201d This mitigating evidence counsels against imposing the sanction recommended in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 15} Weighing the mitigating factors against the conduct at issue, we reject the board\u2019s recommendation that a one-year stayed suspension be imposed, and instead, based on the fact that Agopian has no prior disciplinary record, has fully complied with the disciplinary process, and has accepted responsibility for his conduct, and further considering the character letters attesting to his reputation, integrity, and professionalism, we issue a public reprimand for the conduct in this case. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-8\">Resnick, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b264-9\">Moyer, C.J., O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b264-10\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APe\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 16} I respectfully dissent.
