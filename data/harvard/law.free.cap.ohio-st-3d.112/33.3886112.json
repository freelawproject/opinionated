New Lexington had entered into a collective-bargaining agreement with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that had been effective until December 2003 and that had provided rights and benefits to Morgan. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>collective-bargaining agreement expired, it continued to govern city employee work rules, benefits, and conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 3} In 2004, New Lexington disciplined Morgan for failure to properly report payroll information to the state Police and Fire Pension Fund, which resulted in the city\u2019s being fined several thousand dollars. After the police chief received complaints from the Fraternal Order of Police of payroll errors and miscalculation of leave balances by Morgan, he and the mayor requested payroll and leave records for all employees from Morgan. Morgan failed to provide her own payroll and leave records.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 4} The police chief then conducted a preliminary investigation of Morgan and found sufficient evidence to warrant turning the matter over to the State Auditor and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cbureau\u201d). By letter dated January 28, 2005, the police chief notified the mayor that based upon his investigation, Morgan \u201creceived compensation that she was not entitled to, and that she falsified official documents to gain said compensation.\u201d The police chief included an investigative report and copies of payroll sheets, check stubs, and canceled checks. A few days later, the Supreme Court of Ohio notified the city that the mayor\u2019s court had failed to submit quarterly statistical reports as required by R.C. 1905.033. According to the police chief, the delinquencies in reporting were the result of Morgan\u2019s neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 5} On February 11, 2005, the police chief turned over the criminal investigation to the bureau. The police chief noted that \u201cevidence has been uncovered that indicates that the payroll clerk was receiving compensation that she was not entitled to,\u201d that \u201cshe falsified payroll records to conceal the alleged theft,\u201d and that it appeared that \u201cshe forged official documents to conceal time she was taking off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 6} On February 18, 2005, the city notified Morgan that it would conduct a predisciplinary conference on February 22, 2005, because charges against her \u2014 if substantiated by evidence \u2014 would constitute a basis for firing her. The city noted that the conference had been continued twice before on Morgan\u2019s request. The city specified 18 separate charges against Morgan, including \u201c[d]ereliction of duty in fading to timely and properly file reports with the Ohio Supreme [CJourt,\u201d \u201cfailure to file reports and make timely payments to public employee retirement systems on behalf of city employees,\u201d \u201cfailure to timely file IRS reports and documents,\u201d \u201cfailure to make timely payments on accounts after having withheld money from employee pay checks,\u201d \u201cmisappropriation of funds in making unauthorized and unapproved payments\u201d to herself, misrepresentation of her hours worked, insubordination by failing to follow the mayor\u2019s directives, dishonesty by lying to the mayor, neglect of duty in failing to make timely reports and payments, and violations of the city\u2019s computer policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On February 22, 2005, the city held the predisciplinary conference. The city ultimately fired Morgan. Morgan had indicated that she would file a civil or administrative action challenging her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 8} Nearly a year later, on February 17, 2006, Morgan, through counsel, requested access from the mayor and the city to all records relating to her discharge from employment, including those related to each of the city\u2019s 18 charges against her specified in the city\u2019s February 18, 2005 letter. More particularly, Morgan requested \u201c[a]ll records or documents which show or purport to show\u201d the misconduct alleged in the city\u2019s charges. For example, Morgan requested \u201c[a]ll records or documents which show or purport to show that prior to February 22, 2005, Ms. Morgan misappropriated any funds by making unauthorized or unapproved payments to herself\u2019 and \u201c[a]ll records or documents which show or purport to show that prior to February 22, 2005, Ms. Morgan failed to follow any directives of the Mayor concerning Ms. Morgan\u2019s use of overtime, including copies of the Mayor\u2019s alleged directives and copies of Ms. Morgan\u2019s timesheet(s) or payroll reeord(s) showing the alleged failure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 9} In addition to the records supporting the city\u2019s 18 charges against her, Morgan requested the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(20) All records or documents which show or purport to show that Ms. Morgan was advised of her right to have union representation at the February 22, 2005, pre-disciplinary \u2018conference.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(21) Ms. Morgan\u2019s entire personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(22) Any published City policies or rules of conduct for employees and any applicable provisions of any collective bargaining agreement which relate to employee conduct or discipline, including any policies, rules or collective bargaining agreement provisions relating to progressive discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">{\u00b6 13} Morgan\u2019s request noted that the records relating to the city\u2019s 18 charges against her had been \u201ccompiled or readily available to the City\u201d for her February 22, 2005 predisciplinary conference and assumed that the remaining records were \u201creadily available to the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">{\u00b6 14} By letter dated February 22, 2006, the city denied Morgan\u2019s request. The city noted that \u201cvirtually every document falling within the scope of the twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs of your letter has been turned over to the investigators who are handling the criminal investigation, and parallel the State Auditor\u2019s investigation.\u201d The city stated that based on the foregoing, the requested records were no longer in the city\u2019s physical possession, and they constituted exempt trial-preparation records and confidential law-enforcement investigatory records. The city further claimed that Morgan\u2019s records request was \u201cso broadly worded that it is defective on its face,\u201d that the city would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>able to \u201cperform \u2018research\u2019 \u201d for her, and that the file clerk could not make a judgment about which records she requested. The city requested that Morgan identify \u201cby date and author\u201d the records she sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 15} In Morgan\u2019s response, dated February 24, 2006, to the city\u2019s denial of her records request, she noted that she was merely \u201cseeking all public records utilized by New Lexington to support any of the charges against [her] as set forth in its letter of February 18, 2005.\u201d That is, Morgan emphasized that she was requesting only those \u201crecords which supposedly supported the charges; which were created, compiled or retained in the ordinary course of the City\u2019s business; and which existed prior to the time the City prepared its written charges.\u201d She was \u201cnot seeking any records that were specifically compiled in reasonable anticipation of litigation or were prepared by any law enforcement official as part of any investigation then under way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 16} On March 24, 2006, the State Auditor issued a draft report finding that the amount paid to Morgan during her employment with New Lexington exceeded the amount permissible under the city\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement with the employees\u2019 union and an ordinance salary schedule and that this excess amount was attributable to overtime paid to Morgan without proper preapproval. The State Auditor further determined that she had a leave-hour deficit of 110.71 hours, which she had improperly taken as leave. Based on the audit, the State Auditor issued findings of recovery against Morgan for over $10,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 17} At some unspecified time, all of the documents relating to Morgan that were in the possession of the city, including payroll and overtime records, canceled checks, and leave reports, had been turned over to the bureau and the State Auditor for their investigations, but they were returned to New Lexington on May 19, 2006. These records are in storage boxes and are being sorted and packaged for transfer to the Perry County Prosecuting Attorney for presentation to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 18} According to the city, as of early 2005, \u201cthere were no specific \u2018personnel files\u2019 for municipal employees that were ever designated by New Lexington as such,\u201d and as of early 2006, there were no published personnel policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 19} On April 10, 2006, Morgan filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel New Lexington to produce the requested records pursuant to R.C. 149.43, the Public Records Act. The city submitted an answer, and on June 21, 2006, we granted an alternative writ. <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1504, 2006-Ohio-2998, 849 N.E.2d 1026. The parties then filed evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">{\u00b6 20} This cause is now before the court for a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>{\u00b6 21} New Lexington claims that the court need not address the merits of Morgan\u2019s mandamus claim and that this case should be dismissed because Morgan\u2019s merit brief does not comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. VI(2)(B)(4). In original actions filed in this court, \u201c[a]ll merit briefs shall conform to the requirements set forth in S.CtPrac.R. VI and VIII, to the extent those rules are applicable.\u201d S.Ct.Prac.R. X(8). Under S.Ct.Prac.R. VI(2)(B)(4), Morgan\u2019s brief was required to contain \u201c[a]n argument, headed by the proposition of law that [relator] contends is applicable to the facts of the case and that could serve as a syllabus for the case if [relator] prevails. See <em>Drake v. Bucher </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 37, at 39 [34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182]. If several propositions of law are presented, the argument shall be divided with each proposition set forth as a subheading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 22} New Lexington contends that Morgan\u2019s brief contains no propositions of law and does not contain \u201canything remotely resembling that which could be used as this court\u2019s syllabus.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to present to the court in concise form the legal issues involved in the cause.\u201d <em>Drake v. Bucher, </em>5 Ohio St.2d at 39, 34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182. Although \u201ca substantial disregard of the whole body of these rules cannot be tolerated,\u201d \u201c[i]n order to promote justice, the court exercises a certain liberality in enforcing a strict attention to its rules, especially as to mere technical infractions.\u201d Id. at 40, 34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 23} Although Morgan did not specifically designate propositions of law in her merit brief, she included argument headings that served the purpose of organizing her argument, e.g., that she \u201cis entitled to access the records because they are not protected from disclosure by any exception to the Ohio Public Records Act\u201d and that her \u201cFebruary 21, 2006 [sic, February 17] letter to the city constituted a valid public records request.\u201d Her brief presented the legal issues in this case in a sufficient, concise manner. Therefore, Morgan did not substantially disregard S.Ct.Prac.R. VI(2)(B)(4). Those cases that we dismissed because of a failure to comply with our Rules of Practice are distinguishable. Cf. <em>Drake, </em>5 Ohio St.2d 37, 34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182 (pervasive failure to comply with rules); <em>State ex rel. Queen City Chapter of Soc. of Professional Journalists v. McGinnis </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 54, 10 OBR 316, 461 N.E.2d 307 (failure to file compliant brief after being ordered twice to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 24} Therefore, we deny New Lexington\u2019s request to dismiss this action. Morgan sufficiently complied with S.CtPrac.R. VI(2)(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Motion to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 25} New Lexington also requests that the propositions of law attached to Morgan\u2019s reply brief be stricken because otherwise, the city\u2019s \u201cdue process rights will be abridged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The determination of a motion to strike is vested within the broad discretion of the court. <em>State ex rel. Mora v. Wilkinson, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-0hio-1509, 824 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 9-10. Civ.R. 12(F) allows a court to strike any pleading or material determined to be insufficient, redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous. See S.Ct.Prac.R. X(2) (\u201cThe Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure shall supplement these rules unless clearly inapplicable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">{\u00b6 27} We deny the motion. Morgan\u2019s inclusion of propositions in her reply brief was neither insufficient, redundant, immaterial, impertinent, nor scandalous. These propositions of law did not prejudice New Lexington in preparing its merit brief, because they relate to the same arguments contained in Morgan\u2019s initial brief under argument headings. The city\u2019s due process rights to respond to Morgan\u2019s contentions have not been compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Mandamus: Proper Request for Records</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 28} The Public Records Act reflects the state\u2019s policy that \u201copen government serves the public interest and our democratic system.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-0hio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 20. We therefore construe R.C. 149.43 liberally in favor of broad access, with any doubt resolved in favor of disclosure of public records. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 29} New Lexington contends that Morgan is not entitled to access to the requested records relating to her discharge from employment because Morgan\u2019s request for those records failed to identify any records with reasonable clarity. \u201c[I]t is the responsibility of the person who wishes to inspect and/or copy records to identify with reasonable clarity the records at issue.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Tober </em>(Apr. 28, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1, affirmed in <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Tober </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 117, 623 N.E.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 30} Requests for information and requests that require the records custodian to create a new record by searching for selected information are improper requests under R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 425, 427, 687 N.E.2d 283 (claim for certain information, i.e., qualifications of agency members, rather than for specific records); <em>State ex rel. Kemer v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 273, 274, 695 N.E.2d 256 (no duty to create new record by searching for and compiling information from existing records).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 31} Admittedly, some of the language used by Morgan in her February 17, 2006 request might be construed to broadly request that the records custodian for New Lexington search existing records to find records that meet certain criteria, e.g., \u201c[a]ll records or documents which show or purport to show that prior to February 22, 2005, [she] misappropriated any funds.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 1438, 638 N.E.2d 1041, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>Fant, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (\u201crelator\u2019s request for mandamus relief is denied to the extent that his public records request broadly sought respondents to search for records containing selected information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 32} Nevertheless, these defects in Morgan\u2019s request are not fatal to her mandamus claim for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 33} First, unlike the request held to be improper in <em>Lanham, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 425, 687 N.E.2d 283, Morgan\u2019s request was not for information, but for the specific records that supported the city\u2019s discharge of her from employment. Morgan\u2019s request must be considered in the context of the circumstances surrounding it. Her request was structured to mirror the city\u2019s letter specifying 18 separate charges against her. The request merely sought the records verifying those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 34} Second, unlike the request we found to be improper in <em>Kerner, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 273, 695 N.E.2d 256, Morgan\u2019s request did not require the city to make a new record by compiling certain information from existing records.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 35} Third, in <em>Thomas, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 1438, 638 N.E.2d 1041, although we denied a writ of mandamus insofar as the records request broadly sought to have the custodian search for records containing selected information, we also held that the mandamus claim might have merit \u201cto the extent that relator\u2019s request specified particular persons who, because of their positions, would be likely to have and maintain the records requested.\u201d Morgan\u2019s February 17, 2006 request was addressed to a specific person, i.e., the mayor, who had general knowledge of the requested records relating to Morgan\u2019s discharge. Morgan\u2019s request was drafted to seek the records supporting the 18 separate charges specified in the mayor\u2019s February 18, 2005 letter to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 36} Fourth, New Lexington admitted in its response to Morgan\u2019s records request that it knew where the requested documents were. New Lexington asserted that \u201cvirtually every document falling within the scope\u201d of Morgan\u2019s request had been turned over to investigators, and these same records were back in the possession of the city on May 19, 2006. Therefore, the city could respond to Morgan\u2019s request without having to search for these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 37} Fifth, notwithstanding the city\u2019s implication to the contrary, we have never held that in order to constitute a viable request, the request must specify the author and date of the records requested. Although this may be helpful in identifying the requested records, the failure to do so does not automatically result in an improper request for public records, particularly where, as here, it is evident that the public office was aware of the specific records requested. We do not require perfection in public-records requests. <em>State ex rel. Cater v. N. Olmsted </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 315, 320, 631 N.E.2d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"ApF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Finally, Morgan specifically requested certain records, including mayoral directives, timesheets, personnel records, and city personnel policies. Morgan did not request a \u201ccomplete duplication\u201d of the city\u2019s files. See <em>State ex rel. Warren Newspapers, Inc. v. Hutson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 619, 624, 640 N.E.2d 174, citing <em>State ex rel. Zauderer v. Joseph </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 752, 756, 577 N.E.2d 444 (\u201cR.C. 149.43 does not contemplate that any individual has the right to a complete duplication of the voluminous files kept by government agencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, Morgan\u2019s records request was sufficiently specific for purposes of invoking the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Mandamus Is the Appropriate Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 40} New Lexington asserts that under R.C. 2731.05, Morgan must establish the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law in order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel access to the requested records. In most mandamus cases, the relator must prove the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law to 'be entitled to the writ. See R.C. 2731.05; <em>State ex rel. Vaughn Industries, L.L.C. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 482, 2006-Ohio-2994, 849 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 41} New Lexington\u2019s assertion, however, is incorrect. We have specifically held that \u201cthe requirement of the lack of an adequate legal remedy does not apply to public-records cases.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Gaydosh v. Twinsburg </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 576, 580, 757 N.E.2d 357; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Dist. 1199, Health Care &amp; Social Serv. Union, SEIU, AFL-CIO v. Lawrence Cty. Gen. Hosp. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 351, 354, 699 N.E.2d 1281 (\u201cpersons seeking public records under R.C. 149.43 need not establish the lack of an adequate remedy at law in order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 426-427, 639 N.E.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 42} New Lexington also suggests that we should recognize a civil analogue to <em>Steckman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 420, 639 N.E.2d 83, and hold that a civil litigant is relegated to discovery in the case and is not entitled to institute a mandamus action for the records in lieu of discovery. In <em>Steckman, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus, we held that in a criminal proceeding, \u201ca defendant may use only Crim.R. 16 to obtain discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 43} New Lexington\u2019s contention lacks merit. We have specifically rejected an expansion of the <em>Steckman </em>holding concerning Crim.R. 16 discovery to civil lawsuits. <em>Gilbert v. Summit Cty., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 660, 2004-Ohio-7108, 821 N.E.2d 564 (litigant may use the Public Records Act to request public records related to a pending civil lawsuit after the expiration of the discovery deadline in that lawsuit). We found any reliance on <em>Steckman </em>unavailing because a civil lawsuit does not raise the same concerns as a criminal proceeding:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>{\u00b6 44} \u201cOf particular concern in <em>Steckman </em>was that \u2018[i]n order to avoid the results of Crim.R. 16, some defendants (more and more we find) are resorting to the use of R.C. 149.43 to, we believe, obtain information to which they are not entitled under Crim.R. 16 <em>and </em>(and we emphasize) to bring about interminable delay in their criminal prosecutions.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) [70 Ohio St.3d] at 428, 639 N.E.2d 83. These concerns are not relevant here. Gilbert is an attorney representing a client in a civil lawsuit, who has requested documents to which any other member of the public would be entitled under the Public Records Act. Further, Gilbert is not seeking to delay the prosecution of a case against himself, or even against his client.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 45} Like Gilbert, Morgan merely seeks the records for use in a civil lawsuit and is not seeking to delay the prosecution of a case against herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 46} Therefore, the presence of alternate remedies to acquire the records, e.g., an action for discovery under R.C. 2317.48 or Civ.R. 34(D) before filing a civil case, does not preclude this mandamus action. Mandamus remains the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. McGowan v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 518, 520, 678 N.E.2d 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Exceptions to Disclosure: Confidential Law-Enforcement Investigatory Records</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 47} New Lexington contends that the requested records are excepted from disclosure because they are confidential law-enforcement investigatory records. In assessing the city\u2019s claim, \u201c[a]ny exceptions to disclosure under the Public Records Act must be strictly construed against the public-records custodian, and a records custodian bears the burden of establishing the applicability of an exception.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 28. R.C. 149.43 exempts \u201c[confidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d from the definition of \u201c[p]ublic record\u201d for purposes of the Public Records Act. R.C. 149.43(A)(2) defines \u201c[confidential law enforcement investigatory record\u201d as \u201cany record that pertains to a law enforcement matter of a criminal, quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature, but only to the extent that the release of the record would create a high probability of disclosure of\u2019 any of the types of information set forth in subsections (a) through (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cExempting records from release under R.C. 149.43(A)(2) involves a two-step analysis: (1) Is the record a confidential law enforcement record? and (2) Would release of the record create a high probability of disclosure of any of the four types of information specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(2)?\u201d <em>State ex rel. Yant v. Conrad </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 681, 684, 660 N.E.2d 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>{\u00b6 49} Under the first requirement, records are not confidential law-enforcement records if they relate to employment or personnel matters rather than directly to the enforcement of law. <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 143, 647 N.E.2d 1374; <em>State ex rel. Lorain Journal Co. v. Lorain </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 112, 115, 621 N.E.2d 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 50} In her February 24, 2006 letter, Morgan clarified that the records she sought related to general employment matters, e.g., timesheets, mayoral directives, and personnel records and policies, which preceded any investigation commenced by the New Lexington police, the bureau, or the State Auditor. In <em>State ex rel. Musial v. N. Olmsted, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, and <em>Yant, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 681, 660 N.E.2d 1211, the relators specifically requested records generated by a police or agency investigation into a violation of law, and the court found that the records thus constituted confidential law-enforcement records. See, e.g., <em>Musial, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-0hio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 20 (\u201cThese records were generated by the police investigation of alleged misconduct of Musial in his capacity as mayor and of his administrative assistant in securing favorable service and rental rates for a city-owned facility. Therefore, the records are confidential law-enforcement records\u201d); <em>Yant, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 684, 660 N.E.2d 1211 (investigative file constituted confidential law-enforcement record).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 51} Unlike the records held to be confidential law-enforcement records in <em>Musial </em>and <em>Yant, </em>the records here were not generated by the various investigations concerning Morgan. Instead, they were records made in the routine course of public employment before those investigations began. Therefore, the requested records are not confidential law-enforcement records and are not excepted from disclosure under the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 52} Consequently, New Lexington has not met its burden to establish that the requested records are excepted from disclosure under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Clean Hands</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 53} New Lexington argues that Morgan\u2019s misconduct prevents her from being entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. The clean-hands doctrine specifies that \u201che who seeks equity must do equity, and that he must come into court with clean hands.\u201d <em>Christman v. Christman </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 152, 154, 12 O.O.2d 172, 168 N.E.2d 153. On rare occasions, we have recognized that \u201cwhile mandamus is considered a legal remedy, equitable principles often govern its issuance, and it may be denied to those who do not come before the court with clean hands.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Albright v. Haber </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 551, 553, 23 O.O. 33, 41 N.E.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>{\u00b6 54} We will not deny the requested writ on this basis. Morgan has not yet been found guilty of criminal misconduct; no criminal proceeding is currently pending against her. More important, R.C. 149.43(C) allows any person who\u2014 like Morgan \u2014 is aggrieved by the failure of a public office to make a requested public record available for inspection and copying to commence a mandamus action to compel the public office to provide access to the record. There is no condition based on the moral quality of the person requesting the record. Nor is the purpose of the requester relevant to the propriety of the request. <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Enright </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 186, 610 N.E.2d 997, syllabus (\u201cA person may inspect and copy a \u2018public record,\u2019 as defined in R.C. 149.43(A), irrespective of his or her purpose for doing so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 55} Therefore, the \u201cclean hands\u201d doctrine does not bar Morgan\u2019s mandamus claim under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Nonexistent Records</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 56} The city contends that Morgan is not entitled to her personnel file or employee policies and rules of conduct because they did not exist at the time of her termination from employment. The city is correct that it has no duty to create new documents to satisfy Morgan\u2019s records request. <em>Norris v. Budgake </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 208, 209, 729 N.E.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">{\u00b6 57} Nevertheless, respondents have not established that these requested records do not exist. Regarding her personnel files, respondents\u2019 evidence stated only that \u201cas of early 2005, there were no specific \u2018personnel files\u2019 for municipal employees <em>that were ever designated by New Lexington </em>as such.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The implication of this affidavit statement is that personnel records for Morgan exist even though they might not be expressly designated as such by the city. That is, records that are the functional equivalent of personnel files exist and are in the custody of the city. For the requested personnel policies, the city did not introduce evidence that these policies did not exist at the time of Morgan\u2019s discharge. In fact, the city claimed that the expired collective-bargaining agreement governed the work rules, benefits, and conduct of its employees, but it did not provide Morgan copies of the collective-bargaining agreement in response to her records request.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">{\u00b6 58} Morgan also requests attorney fees. We deny Morgan\u2019s request because she has not established a sufficient <em>public </em>benefit. Like the city employee requesting records of a city investigation regarding a charge of misconduct against the employee in <em>State ex rel. Cranford v. Cleveland, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 196, 2004-Ohio-4884, 814 N.E.2d 1218, \u00b6 26, Morgan has requested records beneficial mostly to <em>her </em>for purposes of a potential civil action.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqIq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Bailey Cavalieri, L.L.C., Dennis D. Grant, and Sabrina C. Haurin, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ay\">Eugene Nevada, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Aem\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">{\u00b6 59} Based on the foregoing, Morgan has established her entitlement to the requested relief, and New Lexington has not established the applicability of any exception to disclosure under the Public Records Act. Therefore, we grant a writ of mandamus to compel New Lexington to provide access to the requested records. We also deny Morgan\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b202-7\">Resnick, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-15\">.

However, I would also award attorney fees to relator as the prevailing party in a mandamus action brought pursuant to R.C. 149.43. See <em>State ex rel. Highlander v. Rudduck, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 370, 2004-Ohio-4952, 816 N.E.2d 213, \u00b6 26 (Resnick, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. v.
