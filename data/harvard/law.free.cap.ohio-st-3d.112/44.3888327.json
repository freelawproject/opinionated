Because the complaint fails to state a potentially viable mandamus claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 2} In Hanan S. Rashada\u2019s appeal as of right, Rashada asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing her mandamus claim. Dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is appropriate if, after all factual allegations are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in Rashada\u2019s favor, it appears beyond doubt that she could prove no set of facts warranting the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Talwar v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 290, 2004-0hio-6410, 819 N.E.2d 654, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 3} This standard was satisfied here because mandamus will not lie to control judicial discretion, even if that discretion is abused. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Natl. City Bank v. Maloney, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 93, 2004-Ohio-4437, 814 N.E.2d 58, \u00b6 11; R.C. 2731.03. Consequently, mandamus will not issue to compel Judge Pianka to enter a specific judgment on Rashada\u2019s underlying counterclaim. Nor is extraordinary relief available to challenge Judge Pianka\u2019s discretionary rulings in that case. <em>Berthelot v. Dezso </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 257, 259, 714 N.E.2d 888 (\u201cgiven the discretionary authority vested in Judge Dezso in discovery matters * * *, an extraordinary writ will not issue to control her judicial discretion, even if that discretion is abused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">{\u00b6 4} Moreover, Rashada had an adequate remedy at law by appeal to challenge Judge Pianka\u2019s rulings on her counterclaim in the municipal court case. \u201cMandamus will not issue if there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mackey v. Blackwell, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-4789, 834 N.E.2d 346, \u00b6 21; R.C. 2731.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, Rashada\u2019s complaint failed to state a potentially viable mandamus claim, and the court of appeals correctly dismissed it. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b203-13\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Hanan S.
