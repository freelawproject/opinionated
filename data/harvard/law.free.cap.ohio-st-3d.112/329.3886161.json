Because appellant has now been released from prison, we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2005, the Summit County Court of Common Pleas convicted appellant, Charles E. Gordon, of cocaine possession, driving while under suspension, and a community-control violation, and the court sentenced him to an aggregate one-year prison term. Appellee, Judge James E. Murphy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>common pleas court, then issued an entry finding that Gordon was entitled to 42 days of jail-time credit. In December 2005, Gordon filed a motion for jail-time credit in which he claimed that Judge Murphy had incorrectly calculated the number of days that he had spent in custody on the charges before the date of sentencing.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZu\">J. Alex Morton, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b488-13\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S. Kasay, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 3} On July 3, 2006, Gordon filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Summit County for a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Murphy to rule on his motion for jail-time credit. Gordon claimed that with the additional jail-time credit to which he was entitled, \u201che would have been released on or about June 25, 2006, having fully served his one-year prison term.\u201d Judge Murphy filed a motion to dismiss, and the court of appeals dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 4} In his appeal as of right, Gordon asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition. Judge Murphy has filed a motion to dismiss this appeal because it is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 5} Gordon\u2019s mandamus claim lacked merit because the true objective of his claim was to compel Judge Murphy to credit him for jail-time served and to immediately release him from prison before his scheduled September 2006 release date. \u201cHabeas corpus, rather than mandamus, is the proper action to seek\u201d release from prison. <em>State ex rel. Rowe v. McCown, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 183, 2006-Ohio-548, 842 N.E.2d 51, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 6} More important, Gordon has been released. Therefore, his \u201cappeal is moot because his sentence has now expired and he has been released from prison.\u201d <em>Grase v. Bradshaw, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 212, 2006-Ohio-663, 842 N.E.2d 513, \u00b6 5. Furthermore, this claim is not \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Kemna </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43; <em>Larsen v. State </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 69, 70, 748 N.E.2d 72. Gordon concedes that there is no reasonable expectation that he will be subject to the same action again.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">{\u00b6 7} Based on the foregoing, we grant Judge Murphy\u2019s motion and dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
