Magazine affixed not detachable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">{\u00b6 2} Baskin moved to dismiss the charge, claiming that the ordinance is in conflict with the state statutes governing the possession of firearms. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>court granted the motion on October 23, 2003, finding that Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37 \u201cmak[es] something illegal, which * * * under State law would be permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 3} In a split decision, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In so doing, the court of appeals identified R.C. 2923.11(E) as \u201c[t]he Ohio statute upon which the disagreement turns in this case.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Baskin, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 539, 2004-Ohio-5055, 817 N.E.2d 433, at \u00b6 5. R.C. 2923.11(E) defines \u201cautomatic firearm,\u201d the possession of which is prohibited under R.C. 2923.17(A), to include \u201cany semi-automatic firearm designed or specifically adapted to fire more than thirty-one cartridges without reloading.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court of appeals determined that \u201cR.C. 2923.11 is a general law\u201d because it \u201caddresses conduct of the citizenry, rather than actions of a municipal legislative body.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10. Agreeing with Baskin that \u201cOhio allows its citizens to have a [semiautomatic] firearm that can fire up to 31 rounds,\u201d id. at \u00b6 6, the court of appeals concluded that \u201cthe municipal ordinance and the state statute differ with regard to the lawful number of rounds permitted by one possessing a semiautomatic firearm: the ordinance prohibits what the state permits. Therefore, * * * the municipal ordinance must give way to the state statute.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 4} The dissenting judge stated, \u201cI cannot agree that a definition is a general law. The majority holds that R.C. 2923.11(E) is a general law because it addresses the conduct of the citizenry. But when did defining a term become \u2018the conduct of the citizenry\u2019? Definitions have nothing to do with conduct.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. The dissenting judge opined, \u201c[E]ven if a definition were a general law, the [municipal and state] provisions do not conflict.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. In the dissent\u2019s view, prohibiting the possession of a semiautomatic firearm that holds more than 31 cartridges is not tantamount to allowing the possession of a semiautomatic firearm that holds up to 31 cartridges. Id. at \u00b6 19. Thus, according to the dissent, the ordinance does not prohibit what the statute permits. Id. at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is now before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 6} The issue for our consideration is whether Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37\u2019s prohibition against the possession of a semiautomatic rifle with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>magazine capacity of more than ten rounds is unenforceable as being in conflict with a general law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 7} Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, which is known as the home-rule provision, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9, the court summarized the test for determining whether a municipal ordinance is displaced by a state measure:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cA state statute takes precedence over a local ordinance when (1) the ordinance is in conflict with the statute, (2) the ordinance is an exercise of the police power, rather than of local self-government, and (3) the statute is a general law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 11} There is no dispute in this case that Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37 is an exercise of the police power, rather than of local self-government, and is therefore susceptible to displacement by conflicting general laws. In addressing the other two prongs of the test, however, both the parties and the court of appeals have complicated matters by making R.C. 2923.11(E) the focal point of their inquiry. As a result, they have embroiled themselves in a pointless theoretical debate as to whether a statutory definition constitutes a general law for purposes of home-rule analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 12} In determining whether the general-law requirement is met in this case, the court of appeals should have focused on R.C. 2923.17(A), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any dangerous ordnance.\u201d It is R.C. 2923.17(A), not R.C. 2923.11(E), that must qualify as a general law in this case. One who has a semiautomatic firearm with the qualities described in R.C. 2923.11(E) is guilty of unlawful possession of dangerous ordnance in violation of R.C. 2923.17(A). See R.C. 2923.17(D). For present purposes, R.C. 2923.17(A) essentially provides, \u201cNo person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any [semi-automatic firearm designed or specially adapted to fire more than thirty-one cartridges without reloading].\u201d Recognition of this fact would have obviated the amorphous controversy over the status of a definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 13} There is no question that R.C. 2923.17(A) is a general law. In <em>Canton, </em>supra, the court established a test to determine whether a provision of a state statute is a general law. \u201cTo constitute a general law for purposes of home-rule analysis, a statute must (1) be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>throughout the state, (3) set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d Id., 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-0hio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant, city of Cincinnati, concedes that \u201c[l]aws regulating possession of firearms meet the first three requirements.\u201d And since we have already determined that only R.C. 2923.17(A) must qualify as a general law, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that R.C. 2923.11(E) fails to satisfy the fourth requirement \u201cbecause this statute merely establishes a definitional standard for semiautomatic firearms.\u201d Clearly, R.C. 2923.17(A) prescribes a rule of conduct upon citizens generally, i.e., that no person shall knowingly possess any dangerous ordnance, including any semiautomatic firearm that is designed or modified to accommodate more than 31 cartridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant further argues, however, that even if R.C. 2923.11(E) and 2923.17(A) are construed together, the statute still fails as \u201ca regulation on the conduct of ordinary citizenry.\u201d According to appellant, if the General Assembly intended to prevent municipalities from \u201cregulating semiautomatic firearms capable of firing fewer than 31 cartridges, [it] would have overtly incorporated such preemption into the code\u2019s language, as it did in enacting the concealed carry legislation.\u201d Instead, by virtue of its \u201csilence on preempting the field of this restriction,\u201d the General Assembly \u201cimplicitly recognizes that some firearms are more dangerous in certain environments\u201d and that municipalities will continue \u201cto enact legislation [in this area] designed to meet the specific needs of their residents.\u201d Appellant concludes, therefore, that the statute \u201cis not a general law that preempts the City of Cincinnati from enacting legislation regulating semiautomatic firearms capable of firing fewer than 31 cartridges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 16} This argument basically summarizes appellant\u2019s position on the issue of conflict, but has no real bearing on whether R.C. 2923.17(A) is a general law. Essentially, appellant cites the absence of a preemption clause to support a construction of the statute that is compatible with the ordinance. The construction urged by appellant is that the statute merely prohibits the possession of semiautomatic firearms with capacities exceeding 31 cartridges; it does not permit or declare a right to the possession of semiautomatic firearms that hold up to 31 cartridges. Under this construction, there is no conflict between the local and state provisions because the statute commits the regulation of lower-capacity firearms to municipal control.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 17} In its attempt to apply a general-law analysis, however, appellant erroneously assumes that a statute must declare something to be a right in order to meet the rule-of-conduct requirement. But forbidding an act is just as much prescribing a rule of conduct as is permitting an act. Thus, even if appellant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>correct that the statute has no preclusive effect on a municipality\u2019s ability to regulate semiautomatic firearms capable of firing 31 or fewer cartridges, R.C. 2923.17(A) is still a general law for purposes of Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 18} This brings us to the crucial issue, which is whether Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37, to the extent that it prohibits the possession of any semiautomatic rifle with a magazine capacity of more than ten rounds, is in conflict with R.C. 2923.17(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 19} It has long been established that \u201c[i]n determining whether an ordinance is in \u2018conflict\u2019 with general laws, the test is whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa.\u201d <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, at paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Burnett </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 419, 431, 755 N.E.2d 857; <em>Middleburg Hts. v. Ohio Bd. of Bldg. Stds. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 510, 512, 605 N.E.2d 66. In other words, \u201c[n]o real conflict can exist unless the ordinance declares something to be right which the state law declares to be wrong, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Sokol, </em>108 Ohio St. at 268, 140 N.E. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 20} It is also well established that \u201cin order for such a conflict to arise, the state statute must positively permit what the ordinance prohibits, or vice versa, regardless of the extent of state regulation concerning the same object.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Hoffman </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 163, 169, 60 O.O.2d 117, 285 N.E.2d 714. See, also, <em>State ex rel. King v. Summit Cty. Council, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 172, 2003-Ohio-3050, 789 N.E.2d 1108, at \u00b6 39; <em>Cleveland v. Raffa </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 112, 114, 42 O.O.2d 329, 235 N.E.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 21} In applying this test to the present dispute, the court of appeals necessarily had to interpret the statute to not only prohibit the possession of any semiautomatic firearm that can fire more than 31 rounds without reloading, but to also imply a right to the possession of any semiautomatic firearm that can fire up to 31 rounds without reloading. Otherwise, it could not have found that the ordinance prohibits what the statute permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 22} We acknowledge that in <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn. v. Cleveland, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, this court recently held that the Cleveland ordinances were in conflict with the state measures because Cleveland had \u201cundertaken to regulate the making of a loan authorized by the General Assembly.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 23} The instant case is distinguishable, however, because Cincinnati has not undertaken to regulate or prohibit any conduct that the state has authorized. The relevant state statutes, i.e., R.C. 2923.11 and 2923.17, prohibit the possession of semiautomatic firearms that are designed or adapted to fire more than 31 cartridges without reloading. They do not, however, permit or authorize the possession of semiautomatic firearms that are capable of firing 31 or fewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>cartridges without reloading. There is nothing in the weapons-control measures in the criminal code that manifests an intent to prevent municipalities from regulating the possession of semiautomatic firearms that hold fewer than 32 rounds. There is no provision in the statute declaring or otherwise suggesting that the limitation upon firing capacity fixed therein is the only limitation controlling the possession of a semiautomatic firearm, that the limitation shall not be diminished or altered by municipal regulation, or that municipalities may not prohibit the possession of lower-capacity firearms than are prohibited by the statute. Nor is it entirely clear that the statute is even concerned with the regulation of semiautomatic firearms as a separate class of dangerous ordnance, other than to ensure that higher-capacity semiautomatic firearms are prohibited along with automatic firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 24} In the absence of any limiting provision or declaration to the contrary, we conclude that the General Assembly intended to allow municipalities to regulate the possession of lower-capacity semiautomatic firearms in accordance with local conditions, requiring only that under no condition shall municipalities allow the possession of any semiautomatic firearm that is capable of firing more than 31 cartridges without reloading. Thus, the ordinance does not prohibit what the statute permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, we hold that Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37, which prohibits the possession of any semiautomatic rifle with a magazine capacity of more than ten rounds, is not in conflict with R.C. 2923.17(A) for purposes of Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-9\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b442-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the syllabus and the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b442-11\">O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-17\">. {\u00b6 a} Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">{11b} \u201c(a) No person shall sell, deliver, rent, lease, offer, or display for sale, or transfer ownership of, acquire or possess a semiautomatic firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">{\u00b6 c} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">{\u00b6 d} \u201c(h) The term \u2018semiautomatic\u2019 means any firearm designed or specially adapted to fire a single cartridge and automatically chamber a succeeding cartridge and ready to fire, with a single function of the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-21\">{\u00b6 e} \u201c(i) For the purpose of this section, \u2018semiautomatic firearm\u2019 shall have the following meanings:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">{\u00b6 f} \u201c(1) Any semiautomatic rifle or carbine that was originally designed with or has a fixed magazine or detachable magazine with a capacity of more than ten rounds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">. {\u00b6 a} R.C. 2923.17(A) provides, \u201cNo person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any dangerous ordnance.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(K) defines \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d to mean, among other things, \u201c(1) [a]ny automatic * * * firearm.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 b} \u201c \u2018Automatic firearm\u2019 means any firearm designed or specifically adapted to fire a succession of cartridges with a single function of the trigger.

I conclude that the ordinance and the statute do not conflict, and therefore I concur in the judgment of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>General-Law Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 28} I agree with the majority that we should focus on R.C. 2923.17(A) when determining whether the ordinance conflicts with state law. I further believe, however, that the reason we must focus on that section is because neither the definitional section, R.C. 2923.11(E), nor the prohibitory section, R.C. 2923.17(A), could stand alone. R.C. 2923.11 defines various terms, including \u201cautomatic firearm\u201d and \u201cdangerous ordnance.\u201d The statute reads: \u201c \u2018Automatic firearm\u2019 * * * means any semi-automatic firearm designed or specially adapted to fire more than thirty-one cartridges without reloading * * *.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(E). It further defines \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d as \u201c[a]ny automatic or sawed-off firearm * * *.\u201d R.C. 2923.11(K)(1). These definitions by themselves are meaningless in the context of a general-law analysis. Similarly, the prohibition in R.C. 2923.17(A), which states that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any dangerous ordnance\u201d would be void for vagueness on its own. The statute bars knowingly possessing dangerous ordnance, but the statute by itself falls to define what \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d includes. Only when read in conjunction with R.C. 2923.11 does this statute create an interpretable prohibition. Accordingly, in deciding whether the general-law requirement is met in this case, the court of appeals should have focused on R.C. 2923.11(E) and (K) in conjunction with R.C. 2923.17(A), rather than focusing only on R.C. 2923.11(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 29} As there is no question that R.C. 2923.17(A), in conjunction with the definitions provided in R.C. 2923.11(E) and (K), qualifies as a general law under the test we set forth in <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-0hio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, I agree that the statutes, read together, qualify as general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Home Rule: Does the Ordinance Conflict with the Statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">{\u00b6 30} This brings me to the crucial issue, which is whether Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37, to the extent that it prohibits the possession of any semiautomatic rifle with a magazine capacity of more than ten rounds, conflicts with R.C. 2923.17(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">{\u00b6 31} The immense body of ease law regarding conflict analysis dispensed by this court over the past 90 years has proven increasingly complex, yet the basic rule of conflict has not changed: \u201cIn determining whether an ordinance is in \u2018conflict\u2019 with general laws, the test is whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa.\u201d <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Burnett </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 419, 431, 755 N.E.2d 857. In other words, \u201c[n]o real conflict can exist unless the ordinance declares something to be right which the state law declares to be wrong, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Sokol, </em>108 Ohio St. at 268, 140 N.E. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>1. Conflict by Implication</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 32} Although neither party used the term \u201cconflict by implication\u201d in its brief, both parties discussed whether the ordinance prohibits that which the statute implicitly permits. If this court were to adopt the concept of conflict purely by implication, we would essentially be holding that a statute\u2019s prohibiting one thing is the same as permitting everything else. For example, if the state were to pass legislation stating that fireworks could not be used between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., that statute would also implicitly grant citizens the right to use fireworks between 6:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. Accordingly, any ordinance that purported to prohibit the use of fireworks during different hours would conflict with the statute. Likewise, in this case, Baskin argues that because the state statute prohibits possession only of semiautomatic firearms with a capacity of more than 31 rounds, the legislature also granted the citizens of this state a right to possess any semiautomatic firearm with a capacity of 31 or fewer rounds. Thus, Baskin argues, the Cincinnati ordinance conflicts with the state statute by prohibiting that which the statute implicitly permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 33} Although this court recently discussed the concept of conflict by implication in <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn. v. Cleveland, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, this case requires a more expansive analysis of the concept. In <em>Am. Fin., </em>the legislature clearly indicated that it intended to occupy the field of loan regulation, so that any ordinance on that topic would conflict with the legislature\u2019s intent to provide uniform loan regulation. We did not need to consider whether a conflict could be purely by implication, because statutory language distinctly showed that a conflict existed. No such statutory language showing a conflict exists in this case, and we must therefore determine whether to recognize conflicts that arise purely by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 34} The Ohio constitutional provision rendering void any municipal ordinance in conflict with state statutes first appeared during the Constitutional Convention of 1912. Vaubel, Municipal Home Rule in Ohio (1978) 679. The original draft stated that the powers of local government were to be \u201csubject to general laws,\u201d but that section was altered to prohibit only municipal ordinances that conflicted with state statutes. Id. The original proposal further provided that \u201c \u2018no such regulations shall * * * be deemed in conflict therewith unless the general assembly, by general law, affecting the welfare of the state as a whole, shall specifically deny all municipalities the right to act thereon.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., quoting 2 Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Ohio (1913) 1313. The provision that voided only ordinances in actual conflict with state statutes was apparently \u201cintended to overturn previous law, which directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that even in the absence of an express state denial, a stricter municipal regulation was in conflict.\u201d (Footnote deleted.) Id. The change in the section\u2019s language during the Constitutional Convention shows that the delegates rejected the concept of conflict purely by implication. The delegates believed that as long as the state legislature did not indicate an intent to occupy the field or to prevent a stricter standard, a municipality could freely pass any ordinance stricter than state legislation, as long as the ordinance could coexist with state legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 35} Other states similarly interpret \u201cconflict\u201d when applying their home-rule laws:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA municipality may * * * enact ordinances related to subjects in which the state does not have an overriding interest which requires it to retain exclusive control. For instance, a state does not have an overriding state interest in gun control which requires it to retain exclusive control in order to prevent a home-rule unit from adopting an [sic] conflicting enactment; therefore, a municipality can exercise its police power to prohibit handguns. However, if a local ordinance permits what a statute forbids or prohibits what a statute authorizes, there is a conflict between the statute and ordinance and the ordinance is preempted; if both are prohibitory and the ordinance merely goes further in its prohibition, though not counter to the prohibition in the statute, there is no conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cAbsent a clear manifestation of legislative intent to preempt a field of regulation, a municipality may enact an ordinance which neither conflicts with the state legislation nor is itself unreasonable.\u201d 56 American Jurisprudence 2d (2000) 433-434, Municipal Corporations, Section 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, \u201c[t]he mere fact that the state, in the exercise of the police power, has made certain regulations does not prohibit a municipality from exacting additional requirements. * * * [A]n ordinance [that] enlarges upon the provisions of a statute by requiring more than the statute requires creates no conflict therewith unless the statute limits the requirement for all cases to its own prescription.\u201d 56 American Jurisprudence 2d (1971) 408-409, Municipal Corporations, Section 374. Instead, such an ordinance may stand when \u201c \u2018there is nothing contradictory between the provisions of the statute and the ordinance because of which they cannot coexist and be effective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Detroit v. Qualls </em>(1990), 434 Mich. 340, 362-363, 454 N.W.2d 374, quoting 56 American Jurisprudence 2d 409, Municipal Corporations, Section 374. See, also, <em>Savage v.

An ordinance creating a stricter prohibition, therefore, would appear to be valid using this interpretation of \u201cconflict,\u201d as long as the state legislature has not expressly or implicitly prohibited alteration of the proscription by a valid preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 40} Some states interpret \u201cconflict\u201d more broadly by recognizing what they often call \u201cimplied preemption\u201d of a field. For example, California has determined that preemption by implication arises in three situations. First, preemption may be implied when the particular area involved has been fully and completely covered by general law, indicating the intent that the area is one of exclusive state concern. <em>Morehart v. Cty. of Santa Barbara </em>(Cal.1994), 7 Cal.4th 725, 751, 29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143. Second, preemption is implied when the area of law involved is partially covered by general law with terms indicating that \u201c \u2018 \u201ca paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Deukmejian v. Mendocino Cty. </em>(1986), 36 Cal.3d 476, 485, 204 Cal.Rptr. 897, 683 P.2d 1150, quoting <em>In re Hubbard </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 119, 128, 41 CaLRptr. 393, 396 P.2d 809. Finally, preemption may be implied when the area of law is partially covered by general law and \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the municipality.\u201d\u2019\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 41} Courts in Michigan consider whether a state statute preempts an ordinance by considering four factors: (1) whether state law expressly preempts the area of law, (2) whether preemption should be implied based upon legislative history, (3) whether preemption may be implied based on the pervasiveness of a state regulatory scheme, and (4) whether the nature of the regulated subject matter demands exclusive state regulation to achieve the uniformity necessary to serve the state\u2019s purpose or interest. <em>State v. Llewellyn </em>(1977), 401 Mich. 314, 323-324, 257 N.W.2d 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 42} Washington courts recognize preemption by implication and consider on a case-by-case basis whether the state intended preemption or concurrent jurisdiction over a field. <em>Lend v. Seattle </em>(1964), 63 Wash.2d 664, 669-670, 388 P.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>{\u00b6 43} It is true that one might argue that our prior cases, including <em>Schneiderman v. Sesanstein </em>(1929), 121 Ohio St. 80, 167 N.E. 158; <em>Neil House Hotel Co. v. Columbus </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 248, 29 O.O. 403, 58 N.E.2d 665; and <em>Lorain v. Tomasic </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 1, 13 O.O.3d 1, 391 N.E.2d 726, recognized conflict purely by implication. Closer inspection of those cases, however, reveals that they involved statutory language requiring application of the implied conflict and preemption test laid out above. In <em>Schneiderman, </em>state law forbade municipalities to alter state speed-limit legislation, rendering any municipal ordinance purporting to do so in conflict with the intent of the legislature. Id. at 86-87,167 N.E. 158. The court in <em>Neil House </em>relied on statutory language allowing a liquor-premises licensee to sell alcohol until 2:30 a.m., which left no question that a municipality could not ban such sales by a licensee prior to that hour. Id. at 251-252, 29 O.O. 403, 58 N.E.2d 665. Finally, in <em>Tomasic, </em>the Ohio Constitution granted the state, and not municipalities, the power to regulate lotteries. Id. at 3, 13 O.O.3d 1, 391 N.E.2d 726. Further, we have applied this general rule in additional cases both in cases where conflict by implication applied<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and at least one in which it did not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 44} After considering the law from various states, as well as our own precedent, I would adopt the following test in regard to an alleged conflict between two prohibitory enactments. A court should first consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the legislation to determine whether the legislature intended to preempt the field. If preemption is either express or implied, the court should next determine whether the legislature validly exercised its legislative authority by preempting the field.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the area is validly preempted, any alteration by a municipality conflicts with the state statute. If, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>hand, the legislature has not validly preempted an area, a municipal ordinance does not conflict with a state statute if it merely enlarges upon the state statute, i.e., creates a stricter prohibition than the state statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">{\u00b645} Despite the fact that this court has never specifically adopted a preemption test in the area of conflict, I find the construct emphatically helpful in determining whether an ordinance conflicts with a state statute. The factors enumerated by California and Michigan, although not exclusive, are extremely helpful in this area. For example, preemption by implication may exist based upon language employed by the legislature, the extent of regulation in a field, or the need for uniformity within the field in order to protect the rights of the state\u2019s citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">2. Application to <em>Baskin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 46} In this case, the prohibition enacted by the city merely enlarges upon the prohibition created by the legislature. The two enactments can easily coexist, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>because if a person is in compliance with the city\u2019s ordinance, he is also in compliance with the statute (i.e., if a person does not possess a semiautomatic firearm with a magazine capacity more than ten rounds, then he does not possess a semiautomatic firearm with the capacity of more than 31 rounds). The two prohibitory enactments do not on their face conflict, and to infer that the legislature intended to grant citizens the right to possess a semiautomatic firearm capable of firing up to 31 rounds without reloading based merely on the language of the statute itself misreads the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 47} In an otherwise nonconflicting circumstance, a municipal ordinance may still conflict with state statutes, however, if the state has expressly indicated its intent to preempt, such as occurred in <em>Am. Fin., </em>or has by implication preempted the field. Unlike the majority of states,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ohio has not adopted statutory language indicating total preemption in regard to firearms, and no language within any of the state statutes regulating firearms indicates that the state intended to preempt the entire field of firearms regulation. The only preemption language relevant to the field of firearms regulation was passed by the legislature in conjunction with the concealed-firearm laws, but that language plainly preempts only an \u201cordinance or resolution that attempts to restrict the places where a person possessing a valid license to carry a concealed handgun may carry a handgun concealed.\u201d Section 9, H.B. No. 12, Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Legislative Service Annotated (Vol.l, 2004), L-60-61. But that law relates to where one may carry a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>concealed handgun, which in no way relates to whether one may possess a semiautomatic rifle, so it does not preempt the law in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 48} The legislative history behind the state firearms regulations likewise does not indicate any intent to preempt either the field of firearms regulation or the more limited area of possession of semiautomatic firearms. A brief look at the history of Ohio firearms regulations, and in particular semiautomatic-firearms regulations, might be helpful here. Brigadier General John T. Thompson developed the first handheld, military automatic machine gun, called the submachine gun or \u201cTommy gun,\u201d around 1920. Cramer, For the Defense of Themselves and the State: The Original Intent and Judicial Interpretation of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (1994) 184. It was initially intended for military use in World War I, but it was not ready for production until the war had ended. To appeal to the nonmilitary customer, Auto-Ordnance, a company that sold the weapon, was forced to alter its marketing strategy for the submachine gun and enthusiastically pronounced \u201c \u2018that the submachine gun was, in fact, good for anything. Especially anything hard to hit, or that needed to be killed in quantity, or thoroughly intimidated.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 184, quoting Helmer, The Gun That Made the Twenties Roar (1969) 75. Auto-Ordnance\u2019s claims \u201c \u2018could have been boiled down to a single slogan: Anything a gun can do, the Thompson can do better.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 49} Although Auto-Ordnance originally marketed the Tommy gun to police departments, the gun soon became a \u201cglamorous weapon for gang warfare\u201d in major cities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id. at 184-185. The submachine gun garnered much attention for its role in the 1929 St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, in which gangsters posing as policemen riddled the bodies of seven rival gangsters with fire from submachine guns. Henderson, Gun Control (2000) 15. Congress seized upon gun control as a national issue following an assassination attempt on newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Id. And likewise, in 1933, Ohio passed its first statute prohibiting a person from possessing, transporting, or using a machine gun, light machine gun, or submachine gun, unless the person first obtained a permit and paid a $5,000 bond. G.C. 12819-3 and 12819-4, H.B. No. 166, 115 Ohio Laws 189-190.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 50} In 1961, the legislature broadened its definition of \u201cmachine gun\u201d to include semiautomatic firearms capable of firing more than 18 rounds without reloading. The law exempted .22- or smaller-caliber weapons from the definition. Former R.C. 2923.03, Am.S.B. No. 351, 129 Ohio Laws 420. In 1972, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>legislature completely overhauled the criminal code in Ohio in an effort to \u201cprovide a compact yet complete substantive criminal code, easier to understand and apply, meeting modern needs, and providing the necessary foundation for effective crime prevention, law enforcement, and treatment of offenders.\u201d Legislative Service Commission Bill Analysis of 1972 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511 (law was effective in 1974). Although the legislature modified the previous statutes in order to ban possession, use, or transport of certain semiautomatic firearms it classified as \u201cdangerous ordnance,\u201d with only limited exceptions, the new code merely consolidated the firearms regulations without alteration. By 1986, the legislature had twice altered the definition of \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d to prohibit the possession of a growing class of semiautomatic firearms, including those with a capacity of 32 rounds or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">{\u00b6 51} In the 70 plus years since Ohio enacted its first limit on possession of automatic weapons, the state has made only slight changes to the definition that determines what type of weapons are included in this regulation. The only change relevant to this case is the round capacity of the semiautomatic firearm.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Throughout Ohio\u2019s history of semiautomatic-firearms regulation, the legislature has never indicated that its prohibition on certain semiautomatic firearms could not be made more stringent by municipalities. On the contrary, a memorandum by the Legislative Service Commission in regard to the specific question of whether the 1972 revamp of the criminal code would preempt local firearm legislation specifically states that the legislature intended no such preemption: \u201cThe gun control legislation portion of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511 of the 109th General Assembly, sections 2923.11 to 2923.24, does not pre-empt this field from municipal authorities.\u201d Memorandum from Hubert C. Dutro to Senator Gillmor (Mar. 21, 1973). This court, therefore, should not infer preemption of either the field of firearms regulation or the limited area of semiautomatic-firearms regulation based upon the legislative history of semiautomatic-firearms regulation in the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 52} Further, this court cannot infer preemption based upon some comprehensive regulatory enactment in the field. Ohio legislation currently touches on only a handful of areas in regard to firearms: Prohibition on ownership of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>items,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> prohibition on possession of firearms by certain classes of persons,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> limitations on the discharge and transport of firearms,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> limits on places where a firearm may be discharged or possessed,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> sentencing rules and specifications applied when a firearm is used or possessed during commission of a crime,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> limitations on interstate sales,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> concealed-firearm provisions,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and various laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>related to things such as immunity for firearm manufacturers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 53} Although this may appear to be a broad array of firearms regulation, in comparison to other states, Ohio has barely touched upon the subject of firearm possession, use, transfer, and ownership.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For example, although some municipalities have ordinances requiring that firearms dealers obtain and pay a fee for a local license,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> no state statute requires a firearms dealer to be registered or licensed with the state. Instead, federal law governing firearms dealers and transactions ensures that dealers are properly investigated and licensed in municipalities that opt not to pass a law requiring local licensure. See Section 922(a), Title 18, U.S.Code. Ohio also does not have a statute that requires a person to obtain a permit or license before obtaining a gun, and has no statute requiring a background check prior to the purchase or transfer of a firearm. Again, local law enforcement conducts background checks on firearm purchasers only because federal law mandates such a check, Section 922(t), Title 18, U.S.Code, and some municipalities have passed ordinances requiring a license or permit to transfer or own a firearm.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Municipalities have been left to fill in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>gaps left by Ohio law regarding possession, transfer, and use of firearms to such a degree that I cannot say that the legislature intended to occupy the field of firearms regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">{\u00b6 54} The strongest argument that Baskin makes to support his assertion that the state statute implicitly preempts the municipal ordinance is that allowing municipalities to bar specific weapons within the municipalities could create a patchwork of regulations that would leave the average citizen wondering whether he could legally possess his weapon when he travels around the state. As noted in oral argument before this court, a person could legally possess a weapon in Municipality A and be permitted to have that weapon in Municipality B, but could not travel directly between the two points with the firearm because Municipality C banned possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 55} This issue, however, is in part addressed by federal law: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited by [federal law] from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm * * Section 926A, Title 18, U.S.Code. The statute further requires that the firearm be transported unloaded and that neither the firearm nor its ammunition be readily accessible from the passenger compartment. If the vehicle does not have a compartment separate from the passenger\u2019s compartment, the firearm or ammunition must be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console. Id. As this statute makes it legal to transport a firearm through a place where possession alone would otherwise be illegal, and that federal statute expressly preempts anything in direct conflict with it, Section 927, Title 18 U.S.Code, Baskin\u2019s argument is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 56} A person should be familiar with the firearms laws governing the locality in which he principally keeps his firearms. He should also be familiar with the local and state firearms regulations for any area in which he intends to use that weapon. In addition, he has the right under federal law to transport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that firearm in a certain manner between those two places. Thus, allowing municipalities to pass more restrictive firearms regulations than the state does not, as some may fear, require Ohio residents to research a patchwork of regulations to avoid violating the law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, it only requires that a person know the laws of the jurisdiction where he keeps his gun and the laws where he would like to use his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 57} The only remaining issue is whether some statewide interest or concern should compel uniformity in the type of weapons that may lawfully be possessed throughout the state. The Ohio Constitution grants Ohio citizens the \u201cright to bear arms for their defense and security.\u201d Section 4, Article I, Ohio Constitution. The right, however, is not absolute and is subject to reasonable regulation. <em>Arnold, v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 616 N.E.2d 163, paragraph two of the syllabus. In fact, this court has previously upheld a city\u2019s firearms regulation that prohibited possession of firearms that were not prohibited by state law. Id. <em>Arnold </em>clearly explains the rationale behind allowing more stringent local firearms regulation as long as the regulation is not \u201c \u2018arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious or unreasonable and [bears] a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained, namely the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 46, 616 N.E.2d 163, quoting <em>Cincinnati v. Correll </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 535, 539, 26 O.O.116, 49 N.E.2d 412. I see no need to reiterate here the rationale expressed in Arnold for upholding Cleveland\u2019s regulation banning possession of any semiautomatic rifle that accepts a magazine with a capacity of 20 or more rounds, but it is equally applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 58} As noted above, Ohio is one of six states that lack a statute preempting regulation in the area of firearms regulations. The legislature has never made clear that it intends to preempt local ordinances concerning firearms, and as long as the local regulations are reasonable and are not in direct conflict with existing Ohio law, this court should not infer preemption. If the legislature intends to preempt any other area of firearms regulation beyond the concealed-firearm provision, it needs to do so explicitly. As the legislature has neither expressly nor implicitly preempted the area of firearms regulation and the local ordinance and state statute may coexist, I find that there is no conflict between Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37 and Ohio state law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">{\u00b6 59} I find that the General Assembly has never explicitly or implicitly preempted the field of gun regulation or the limited area of the class of firearms that may be possessed in Ohio. As the legislature and the nature of the legislation in no way indicate an intent to limit the power of municipalities to pass more restrictive firearms ordinances, I find that Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37 does not conflict either expressly or by implication with Ohio law, as both prohibitory enactments can coexist and the ordinance in no way prohibits what Ohio law specifically permits. Accordingly, I concur in the reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">.

Columbus </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 103, 146 N.E.2d 854 (finding that an ordinance that goes further than a statute by imposing penalties for a related act not penalized by the statute does not conflict with that statute). \u201cA statute defining a crime is only a prohibition; it permits nothing. Consequently, a broader definition of a crime as provided by an ordinance does not forbid what a statute permits, and therefore no conflict exists. If the courts had reached any other conclusion, the effect would have been highly destructive of municipal independence in the exercise of local police power over the definition of crimes. At the same time, the courts would have been thrust into an interpretative entanglement requiring them to resolve questions concerning how wide a range of acts could be said to be impliedly permitted by statutory prohibitions.\u201d Vaubel at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 bj For example, adoption of the concept of conflict purely by implication would deprive municipalities of the ability to ban conduct identical to that in a state statute because the ordinance could not legitimately include a sentence. The state specifically accords each crime a specific range of punishment, and, purely by implication, the municipality could not, therefore, impose anything beyond the state-allotted punishment. Our case law contradicts that idea. See <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 269, 140 N.E. 519 (\u201cthe punishment of an act defined as a crime under a state law does not preclude further punishment as a misdemeanor under a municipal ordinance\u201d). This court has struck down additional municipal punishment only when the municipality attempts to add a punishment to a state crime. <em>State v. Burnett </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 419, 431-432, 755 N.E.2d 857. Even in that case, this court reiterated that \u201ca municipal ordinance may proscribe the same conduct as a state criminal statute and impose a penalty greater than the state criminal code imposes.\u201d Id. at 431, 755 N.E.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 c} Another example of the problems with application of conflict by implication can be found in <em>Pentco, Inc. v. Moody </em>(S.D.Ohio 1978), 474 F.Supp. 1001, 1007-1008. In that case, private massage parlor owners argued that a state law banning public nudity implicitly allowed private nudity and that a local ordinance banning nudity in the private massage parlors conflicted with state law. The federal court rejected that analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">.

State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus. The consensus in the record before us is that the state legislation and local ordinance are police regulations that differ as to the definition of the term \u201csemiautomatic\u201d weapon. The ordinance, therefore, does involve a police regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 63} Both the state of Ohio and the city of Cincinnati are authorized to legislate against possession of semiautomatic weapons. The majority here holds that R.C. 2923.17(A) is a general law pursuant to the test we announced in <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus. There, we established a four-part test for determining whether an enactment of the General Assembly is a general law for home-rule analysis: \u201ca statute must (1) be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state, (3) set forth police, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d Id.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Avf\">Julia L. McNeil, City of Cincinnati Solicitor, Ernest F. McAdams, City of Cincinnati Prosecutor, and Charles A. Rubenstein, Chief Deputy Prosecutor, for appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Robert H. Lyons, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>{\u00b6 64} I agree with the majority that R.C. 2923.17(A), which provides, \u201cNo person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any dangerous ordnance,\u201d is a general law pursuant to <em>Canton. </em>That statute is a statewide police enactment, applies to all parts of the state, and prescribes a rule of conduct upon the citizens of Ohio. <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus. And in my view, Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37(a) is very similar. That ordinance provides, \u201cNo person shall sell, deliver, rent, lease, offer, or display for sale, or transfer ownership of, acquire or possess a semiautomatic firearm.\u201d Therefore, the statute and the ordinance regulate the same conduct: the acquisition and possession of a semiautomatic firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 65} The difference between these regulations results from the definition contained in R.C. 2923.11(K)(1), defining \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d as \u201c[a]ny automatic * * * firearm,\u201d which includes \u201cany semi-automatic firearm designed or specially adapted to fire more than <em>thirty-one </em>cartridges without reloading.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2923.11(E). Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37(h)(l) defines \u201csemiautomatic firearm\u201d as \u201c[a]ny semiautomatic rifle or carbine that was originally designed with or has a fixed magazine or detachable magazine with capacity of more than <em>ten </em>rounds.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The conflict, therefore, exists in the differing definitions of \u201csemiautomatic\u201d promulgated by the General Assembly and the city of Cincinnati; and with regard to the <em>Canton </em>test, the statutory definition of a semiautomatic weapon does not constitute a general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 66} First, a definition is not \u201cpart of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus. Second, while intended to \u201capply to all parts of the state alike\u201d as a \u201cpolice, sanitary, or similar regulation[ ],\u201d the definition of \u201csemiautomatic\u201d does not \u201cprescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d Id. Thus, a definition is not a general law, and no further conflict analysis is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 67} Accordingly, as Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37 is not in conflict with any general law, I concur in reversing the judgment of the court of appeals and remanding the matter for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
