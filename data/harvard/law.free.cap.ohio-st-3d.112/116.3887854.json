The township had Worrell undergo several medical tests as part of his preemployment physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>examination. On Worrell\u2019s October 2001 preemployment chest x-ray report, the cardiologist noted that Worrell is an ex-smoker and that \u201c[e]xam of the chest demonstrates suggests [sic] evidence of chronic lung disease with slight accentuation of the lung markings.\u201d An October 2001 pulmonary function report specified that Worrell \u201chad difficulty performing flow-volume loops properly.\u201d On October 8, 2001, a physician medically cleared Worrell to perform his job duties with the fire department. Worrell worked sporadically over the next month as a firefighter in Mifflin Township until early November 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 3} Worrell applied for disability-retirement benefits with appellee Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund in September 2002. Worrell listed the following disabling conditions in his application: left shoulder injury-sprain, neck sprain, concussion, and contusion of the face, scalp, and neck. Subsequent medical reports noted a respiratory impairment allegedly caused by two fires that he was ordered to fight without an oxygen mask when he was employed as a Mifflin Township firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 4} On March 29, 2005, appellee Board of Trustees of the Ohio Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund found that Worrell was not disabled and denied him disability-retirement benefits. Worrell then filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the fund and its board to vacate its findings of fact denying disability-retirement benefits and issue new findings of fact approving those benefits or, in the alternative, issue a new decision stating the reasons for denying Worrell\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 5} A court-appointed magistrate issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in November 2005 recommending that the court grant a limited writ of mandamus ordering the board to issue a decision either granting or denying Worrell\u2019s disability-retirement benefits, identifying the evidence upon which the board relied, and providing a reasonable explanation for the board\u2019s decision. The magistrate concluded that the limited writ was justified because \u201cthe board has failed to identify that evidence upon which it relied and failed to provide a reasonable explanation for its decision to deny [Worrell\u2019s] disability retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 6} Worrell then filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Worrell objected on the basis that \u201c[t]he magistrate erred in failing to address [his] argument that [the fund\u2019s] disregard of R.C. 742.38(D)(3) constituted a clear abuse of discretion and, accordingly, that a full writ of mandamus was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 7} The fund and the board also filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision. They asserted that the magistrate should have recommended affirming the board\u2019s denial of Worrell\u2019s application for disability-retirement benefits instead of in effect remanding the case to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>(\u00b6 8} On March 28, 2006, the court of appeals overruled the parties\u2019 objections and granted the limited writ of mandamus recommended by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before the court upon Worrell\u2019s appeal as of right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 10} Because the final board decision is not appealable, mandamus is available to correct an abuse of discretion by the board in denying disability-retirement benefits. See, generally, <em>State ex rel. Lecklider v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 271, 2004-Ohio-6586, 819 N.E.2d 289, \u00b6 18. See, also, <em>Kinsey v. Bd. of Trustees of Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund of Ohio </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 224, 225, 551 N.E.2d 989; <em>State ex rel. Chime v. Bd. of Trustees of Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund of Ohio </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 17, 19, 623 N.E.2d 32. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Stiles v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-2140, 807 N.E.2d 353, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 11} Worrell claims that the court of appeals erred in failing to find that the board abused its discretion by not applying the presumption set forth in R.C. 742.38(D)(3). Under this provision, \u201c[a] member of the fund who is disabled as a result of heart disease or any cardiovascular or respiratory disease of a chronic nature, which disease or any evidence of which disease was not revealed by the physical examination passed by the member on entry into the department, is presumed to have incurred the disease while performing the member\u2019s official duties, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 12} Consequently, Worrell would be entitled to the presumption that his claimed respiratory ailment was incurred while performing his duties as a firefighter for Mifflin Township if no evidence of the disease had been revealed by the physical examination passed by him on entry to the job. Once the statutory presumption arises, competent evidence may be introduced to rebut it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 13} As the court of appeals noted, the evidence before the board included a radiologist\u2019s preemployment report indicating that Worrell is an ex-smoker and that his chest x-ray demonstrated evidence of chronic lung disease. This constitutes sufficient evidence to prevent the applicability of the presumption set forth in R.C. 742.38(D)(3). The court of appeals therefore did not err in holding that the board did not abuse its discretion in failing to apply this statutory presumption. The board did not act in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner in so finding.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Charles Zamora, L.L.C., and Charles Zamora, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b277-8\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and John T. Williams, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals properly rejected Worrell\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. Appellees did not appeal the court\u2019s issuance of a limited writ, so we do not consider the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 holding that the board had a duty to issue a decision stating the basis for its denial. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 16-22 (no duty on the part of State Teachers Retirement System or State Teachers Retirement Board to state the basis for its denial of disability-retirement benefits; no statute or regulation requires it).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
