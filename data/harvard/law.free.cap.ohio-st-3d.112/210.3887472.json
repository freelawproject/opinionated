Johnson appeals from his convictions entered pursuant to jury verdicts finding him guilty of the aggravated murder of 13-year-old Daniel Bailey and the rape and aggravated robbery of Tina Bailey, Daniel\u2019s mother, and from the trial court\u2019s imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 2} Johnson raises 23 propositions of law; however, after review, we find that none are well taken, and pursuant to our independent review of the death sentence in accordance with R.C. 2929.05(A), we affirm these convictions and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">{\u00b6 3} The record reveals that Tina Bailey lived on Stewart Avenue in Cambridge, Ohio. Marvin Johnson first met her in 1998 or 1999, and he eventually began living with her on Stewart Avenue. Between 2000 and 2002, an Alabama court incarcerated him for violating parole in connection with a 1988 arson conviction in that state. Upon his release, however, Johnson returned to Ohio and resided with Tina until July 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">{\u00b6 4} During the time Johnson lived with Tina, his use of crack cocaine became problematic. Frequently, Johnson did not come home on payday but would instead disappear for a night or two to spend his paycheck on crack. And due to his drug habit, he only reluctantly contributed money to the household. He also had a strained relationship with Tina\u2019s two children, especially Daniel, because he resented Tina\u2019s generosity toward them.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">{\u00b6 5} Both Johnson and Tina were friends of Utelius \u201cEric\u201d Barnes. Johnson occasionally became jealous of Barnes, and he suspected that Tina and Barnes had a relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">{\u00b6 6} On July 3, 2003, after several weeks of tension in her relationship with Johnson, Tina told Johnson to leave. Though she later allowed him back into her house two or three times, she made it clear to him that he did not have permission to enter the house in her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">{\u00b6 7} Nevertheless, twice during the two or three weeks before August 15, 2003, Johnson entered her house while she was at work. On the second occasion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>she returned to find him there, and she ordered him to leave. Johnson refused, and he dared her to call the police. As they argued, according to Tina\u2019s trial testimony, Johnson \u201cpulled his arm back,\u201d as if to strike her, and he warned that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be surprised if [she] found [her] house in ashes.\u201d Eventually, he voluntarily left her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 8} Tina worked as a nurse at the Southeastern Ohio Regional Medical Center, a hospital in Cambridge, Ohio, and during the summer, she often worked the 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shift. Her son, Daniel, who would stay at home alone while Tina worked, customarily stayed up until 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. and would phone her at work to say goodnight before he went to bed. On the night of August 14, 2003, Tina worked the late shift while Daniel stayed at home alone, and, in keeping with his habit, he phoned his mother in the early morning hours of August 15 to say goodnight before he went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 9} That same evening, Johnson stayed at the home of Lisa Wilson, an acquaintance of his and a drug dealer. David Jones, another Wilson acquaintance, also spent the night at Wilson\u2019s home. At midnight, Wilson went on what she described as a \u201ccrack run,\u201d and she testified that she saw Johnson asleep on her couch when she left. When she returned at 3:00 a.m., she remembered seeing him in the same position, and at 3:30 a.m., when she left a second time, she also noticed him there.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 10} Around 5:30 a.m., when Wilson returned, she did not see Johnson but learned from David Jones that he had gotten up about 5:00. According to Wilson, Jones also told her that \u201cten minutes [sic] after [Wilson] had left at 3:30,\u201d he heard Johnson \u201crummaging through a bag in the kitchen\u201d before he left. The bag contained old shoes that Wilson had collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 11} Sometime after Daniel\u2019s phone call to his mother, saying goodnight, Johnson beat 13-year-old Daniel Bailey to death. The presence of blood spatters in the living room of the Bailey home established that the beating occurred there.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">{\u00b6 12} According to Dr. Charles Lee, the physician who performed the autopsy, Daniel suffered multiple skull fractures, bruising on his face, and two long lacerations on his head caused by five or six blows from a blunt instrument, possibly a two-by-four. The blows caused Daniel\u2019s brain to swell within the skull cavity until his breathing stopped. In such cases, according to Dr. Lee, death \u201ctypically takes anywhere from a couple to several minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">{\u00b6 13} After beating Daniel, Johnson gagged and hogtied him with shoelaces he had taken from the bag in Lisa Wilson\u2019s home. According to Dr. Lee, Daniel\u2019s head injuries occurred before Johnson tied his hands and feet. Dr. Lee also concluded that Daniel was still alive when he was tied up: \u201cYes, there\u2019s no question he was alive. * * * [T]he skin reaction, the red hyperemia next to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>bindings around his wrists shows that * * * the heart was still pumping while these tight bindings were around the wrists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">{\u00b6 14} After beating Daniel and tying him up, Johnson carried him to the basement of the Bailey home.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 15} Tina returned from work around 8:00 a.m. and spoke briefly with Utelius Barnes, as he prepared to start his second day of work on the remodeling project at her home. The two went inside and discussed the work for another 20 minutes. Tina then went upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 16} When she reached the top of the stairs, she saw Johnson coming out of the bathroom wearing an olive-colored T-shirt and carrying a knife in his hand. As Johnson held the knife up in front of her, Tina asked him to put it down, and said, \u201c[WJhere\u2019s Daniel, what did you do to Daniel [?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 17} Johnson walked Tina into her bedroom. When Tina began to hyperventilate, Johnson told her to \u201ccalm down\u201d and to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d because Barnes and another home-remodeler were nearby. According to Tina, Johnson warned that if she did not obey, \u201che couldn\u2019t guarantee that Daniel would be okay.\u201d She testified that Johnson told her that Daniel \u201cwould be okay,\u201d provided that she complied with three demands: first, Johnson wanted to watch Barnes and Tina have sex; second, he wanted to have sex with Tina \u201cone last time\u201d himself; and, third, he wanted $1,000. Tina asked Johnson why he was doing this, and he replied, \u201c[TJhis [is] the only way I know how to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">{\u00b6 18} She disrobed and performed oral sex on him, and he placed his fingers in her vagina. He continued to hold the knife during these acts. Tina testified that she would not have done this had she not been afraid for Daniel or if Johnson had not held the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">{\u00b6 19} Afterward, according to Tina, Johnson told her to \u201cget up and get dressed, we ha[ve] to go to the bank.\u201d She got dressed and walked out of the bedroom ahead of Johnson, who still held the knife. She again asked him to put it down, and he returned to the bedroom and placed the knife under the mattress on the bed. Police later recovered it there with Johnson\u2019s thumbprint on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">{\u00b6 20} Johnson persuaded Tina to drive him to her bank where, using the drive-through window, she withdrew $1,000 and handed it to him. Bank records and the teller\u2019s testimony reveal that this transaction occurred between 8:48 and 8:50 a.m. on August 15. Johnson then had Tina drive him to the parking lot of the local Elks Lodge, and he told her to go home and said he would call to tell her what he had done with Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">{\u00b6 21} Tina went home and found Daniel in the basement behind her washing machine, gagged, tied and lying face down in a blanket. She tried to remove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>gag and tried to revive him before she ran upstairs and asked one of the homeremodelers to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">{\u00b6 22} Meanwhile, Johnson went to the home of his friend, Matthew Heskett, where he took off his bloodstained shirt, left it on the floor, and borrowed a clean one from Heskett. He then called a taxi and left for Zanesville.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 23} While Johnson was en route to Zanesville, the Cambridge police learned of Johnson\u2019s departure and radioed the Zanesville police to look for the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 24} Patrolman Mike Choma of the Zanesville police spotted the cab and saw Johnson walking away from it. Choma and another officer approached Johnson and ordered him to the ground. However, Johnson fled to an abandoned park and hid the money that he had taken from Tina. The police later recovered both the money and the bank envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 25} The police also recovered Johnson\u2019s bloody shirt from the Haskett residence and sent it to the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) for analysis. BCI found the bloodstains on the shirt to be consistent with the DNA profile of Daniel Bailey. According to BCI, the chance of finding the same DNA profile in a random member of the population is one in more than 320 trillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 26} The Guernsey County Grand Jury indicted Johnson on two counts of aggravated murder: Count 1, pursuant to the felony-murder provision in R.C. 2903.01(B), and Count 2, pursuant to the \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d provision in R.C. 2903.01(A). Each aggravated-murder count carried a death-penalty specification charging Johnson as the principal offender in a felony murder, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The indictment also contained counts for kidnapping, rape, and aggravated robbery. The jury convicted him of all counts and all specifications, and, following the jury\u2019s recommendation, the trial judge sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">{\u00b6 27} On appeal, Johnson presents 23 propositions of law, which we shall consider by topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Erroneous-Specification Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">{\u00b6 28} In his 17th proposition of law, Johnson argues that his death sentence should be overturned because of an error in the verdict forms and an alleged error in the jury instructions, as well as alleged misstatements by the trial judge during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">{\u00b6 29} We begin by noting that no dispute exists with regard to Johnson\u2019s indictment. Count 2 charged him with violating R.C. 2903.01(A), aggravated murder by \u201cprior calculation and design,\u201d with a death-penalty specification, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), which contained the aggravating circumstance of felony murder with Johnson alleged to be the principal offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Johnson catalogs three alleged postindictment errors regarding the jury\u2019s consideration of the specifications attached to Counts 1 and 2. First, he complains that in the guilt phase of the trial, the jury received a verdict form for the specification under Count 2 that mistakenly omitted the \u201cprincipal offender\u201d language. Instead of this language, the specification for Count 2 charged that Johnson \u201ccommitted the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.\u201d Johnson contends that the erroneous substitution of \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d for \u201cprincipal offender\u201d in the verdict form invalidates his death sentence because the jury returned a verdict finding him guilty of a specification not contained in the indictment presented against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">{\u00b6 31} Had Johnson objected to the erroneous verdict form at trial, the court could have corrected it. Because he failed to object, however, he has waived all but plain error. Plain error is \u201cobvious,\u201d <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240, and \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d See <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 32} The error in this case did not determine the outcome of the trial, as <em>State v. Bonnell </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 179, 573 N.E.2d 1082, illustrates. In <em>Bonnell, </em>as in this case, the judge failed to instruct the jury on the principal-offender element of the felony-murder specification and failed to include it in the verdict form. In our opinion, we stated, \u201cThe evidence in this case does not reasonably suggest that [the] murder was committed by more than one offender. Thus, appellant was either the principal offender, or he committed no offense at all.\u201d Id. at 184, 573 N.E.2d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 33} Using similar analysis, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Mitchell v. Esparza </em>(2003), 540 U.S. 12, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263, held that omitting the principal-offender allegation from a felony-murder specification constituted harmless error in the context of a habeas corpus action, because the omission could not be considered outcome-determinative. \u201c[T]he jury verdict would surely have been the same had it been instructed to find as well that the respondent was a \u2018principal\u2019 in the offense. After all, he was the only defendant charged in the indictment. There was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store.\u201d Id. at 18, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 34} As in <em>Bonnell </em>and <em>Esparza^ </em>the indictment here named only Johnson as an offender, and no evidence presented at trial suggested involvement by anyone other than Johnson in the murder. Thus, in this case, as in <em>Esparza, </em>\u201cthe jury verdict would surely have been the same\u201d had the verdict form asked the jury to determine whether Johnson was the principal offender. The verdict form\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>substitution of the prior-calculation-and-design element for the principal-offender element of the specification does not alter this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">{\u00b6 35} Second, Johnson complains that the trial court referred repeatedly during voir dire to \u201ctwo specifications\u201d when \u2014 he claims \u2014 only one existed. However, during the voir dire examination, two specifications did exist, one on each of the separate counts of aggravated murder. Johnson did not object to the judge\u2019s statements, and we conclude that no error exists in them, let alone plain error. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 353, 744 N.E.2d 1163 (\u201cStatements made during voir dire cannot reasonably be thought to affect sentencing verdicts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 36} Similarly, Johnson contends that the trial court erroneously referred to \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d in the plural, while instructing the jury during the penalty phase. However, Johnson again waived the issue because he failed to raise a timely objection, and likewise, this does not constitute plain error. <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 332, 731 N.E.2d 645; <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 153, 689 N.E.2d 929. There were in fact two aggravating circumstances available for the jury to consider during the penalty phase. Only after the jury returned its penalty-phase verdicts recommending a death sentence for both Counts 1 and 2 did the prosecution ask the trial court to sentence Johnson for Count 2 only.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 37} Even if the jury improperly considered both aggravating circumstances when it recommended a death sentence on Count 2, our independent review, set forth below, cures the alleged error. See, generally, <em>Clemons v. Mississippi </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 738, 745-746, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725; <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 170, 555 N.E.2d 293; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 527, 605 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 38} Johnson\u2019s 17th proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">{\u00b6 39} In propositions of law 13 through 15, Johnson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions of kidnapping, rape, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, and the specification for Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">A. Kidnapping</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">{\u00b6 40} Johnson raises two issues in connection with his conviction for kidnapping Daniel. First, he argues that he could not have kidnapped Daniel, because Daniel died before Johnson hogtied him. Second, he argues that the kidnapping merged with the aggravated murder, and he cannot be convicted of both offenses. We reject these contentions for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 41} Regarding the first issue, the evidence does not support Johnson\u2019s contention that Daniel had died before being restrained. Dr. Lee testified that Daniel was still alive when Johnson tied his hands and feet, and this testimony-supports the jury\u2019s finding that Johnson restrained Daniel of his liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 42} Johnson also contends that during voir dire, the state conceded that Daniel had died before Johnson hogtied him. A review of the transcript reveals that the prosecutor stated, \u201cThe charges accuse Mr. Johnson of going into the home of Constantina Bailey when Daniel was there alone, beating him to death, tying him up and dragging him into the basement * * *.\u201d This statement is not a concession that Johnson killed Daniel before restraining and taking him to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 43} Accordingly, we reject Johnson\u2019s assertions that Daniel died before Johnson hogtied and carried him to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 44} Regarding the second kidnapping issue, Johnson argues that the kidnapping and murder are allied offenses of similar import and must be merged pursuant to R.C. 2941.25 and our decision in <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 45} R.C. 2941.25(B) provides that two similar offenses that are \u201ccommitted separately or with a separate animus as to each\u201d may be charged in the indictment and serve as the basis for two separate convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Logan, </em>we \u201crecognized that where the asportation or restraint \u2018subjects the victim to a substantial increase in risk of harm separate and apart from * * * the underlying crime, there exists a separate animus.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 90, quoting <em>Logan, </em>60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, at paragraph (b) of the syllabus. And \u201cwhere the restraint is prolonged, <em>the confinement is secretive, </em>or the movement is substantial so as to demonstrate a significance independent of the other offense, there exists a separate animus as to each offense sufficient to support separate convictions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Logan, </em>60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, paragraph (a) of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 47} Here, the record supports the conclusion that Johnson\u2019s kidnapping of Daniel had a significance and an animus independent of Daniel\u2019s murder. Tina testified that she found Daniel hogtied and lying in a blanket behind her washing machine in the basement of her home. Dr. Lee testified that Daniel lived for a time sufficient for his skin to react to the shoelaces. Even if Daniel had lived for only a few minutes after Johnson hogtied him, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that Johnson had intended to prevent Daniel from getting assistance for his injuries, had he regained consciousness. Moreover, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to infer that Johnson carried Daniel, while Daniel still lived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to the basement in order to confine him in secret and to prevent anyone from finding him and rendering aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">{\u00b6 48} Hence, the jury could reasonably conclude that when Johnson restrained Daniel and hid him in the basement, he committed an act that had significance independent of, and an animus separate from, murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 49} We overrule Johnson\u2019s 13th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">B. Aggravated Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 50} In his 14th proposition of law, Johnson contends that the state presented insufficient evidence on which to convict him of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), because he left the knife at the Bailey home when he and Tina drove to the bank and because he did not have the knife when Tina gave him the $1,000. The state counters that Johnson committed the offense when, while holding the knife, he demanded $1,000 from Tina and ordered her to take him to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 51} Having considered the parties\u2019 positions, we agree with the state. R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) provides, \u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense * * * shall do any of the following: * * * Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 52} The uncontroverted evidence in the record shows that Johnson held the knife to Tina when he demanded that she give him $1,000 and that she drive him to the bank. Thus, sufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s finding that Johnson violated R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) by having \u201ca deadly weapon on or about [his] person\u201d while \u201cattempting or committing a theft offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">C. Rape</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 53} Also, in his 14th proposition, Johnson contends that insufficient evidence exists to prove his rape conviction beyond a reasonable doubt because the state adduced no physical evidence, such as rape-kit evidence, to corroborate Tina\u2019s testimony. However, Tina\u2019s testimony satisfies the test established in <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (\u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Corroboration of victim testimony in rape cases is not required. See <em>State v. Sklenar </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 444, 447, 594 N.E.2d 88; <em>State v. Banks </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 214, 220, 593 N.E.2d 346; <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 624, 638, 591 N.E.2d 854; <em>State v. Gingell </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 364, 365, 7 OBR 464, 455 N.E.2d 1066. Johnson\u2019s 14th proposition is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>D. Felony Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">{\u00b6 54} In his 15th proposition of law, Johnson contends that the rape and aggravated robbery of Tina Bailey cannot be used to support the aggravated-murder charge based on felony murder or the felony-murder death specification, because Johnson did not commit the rape and aggravated robbery <em>\u201cwhile </em>committing\u201d the aggravated murder of Daniel Bailey. R.C. 2903.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 55} However, \u201cthe term Virile\u2019 does not indicate * * * that the lulling must occur at the same instant as the [predicate felony], or that the killing must have been caused by the [felony].\u201d <em>State v. Cooper </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 163, 179-180, 6 O.O.3d 377, 370 N.E.2d 725. Nor does it mean that the felony must have been the motive for the killing. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 577, 660 N.E.2d 724; <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 441, 700 N.E.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 56} Rather, \u201cwhile\u201d means that \u201cthe killing must be directly associated with the [felony] as part of one continuous occurrence * * *.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>52 Ohio St.2d at 179-180, 6 O.O.3d 377, 370 N.E.2d 725. See, also, <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 23, 544 N.E.2d 895. \u201c[T]he term \u2018while\u2019 means that the death must occur as part of acts leading up to, or occurring during, or immediately subsequent to the [relevant felony].\u201d <em>Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 577, 660 N.E.2d 724. \u201cThe sequence of events\u201d may be \u201cexamined in light of time, place, and causal connection\u201d to determine whether it \u201camounts to \u2018one continuous occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 441, 700 N.E.2d 596, quoting <em>Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 23, 544 N.E.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 57} The evidence presented in this case supports a finding that Daniel\u2019s murder occurred sometime between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m., on August 15, 2003. Dr. Janet Brockwell, the Guernsey County Coroner, observed the autopsy performed by Dr. Lee and estimated Daniel\u2019s time of death at between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. Johnson had been sleeping on Lisa Wilson\u2019s couch at 3:30 a.m., but had left by 5:30 a.m. Wilson testified that David Jones told her that \u201che had gotten up about 5:00, ten minutes [sic] after [Wilson] had left at 3:30.\u201d According to Wilson, Jones \u201csaid he heard him rummaging through a bag in the kitchen and then he left.\u201d Based on this information, the jury could have found that Johnson left Wilson\u2019s house shortly before the time of Daniel\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 58} The rape occurred sometime after 8:20 a.m. The aggravated robbery began at about the same time, when Johnson demanded $1,000 from Tina while threatening her with the knife. Thus, two to three hours elapsed between Daniel\u2019s kidnapping and death, and the rape and aggravated robbery of his mother, Tina.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 59} However, the relationship between the victims and the situs of the crimes connect these offenses. The aggravated murder, the kidnapping, the rape, and the beginning of the aggravated robbery all occurred at Tina\u2019s home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>where Johnson knew that Daniel would be alone and knew he could overpower and kill him. He did so and then waited for Tina to arrive home from work. He used Daniel\u2019s disappearance, in addition to the knife, as a means to commit the rape and the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 60} Thus, when viewed \u201cin light of time, place, and causal connection,\u201d <em>McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 441, 700 N.E.2d 596, the jury could have found that the aggravated murder \u201coccur[red] as part of acts leading up to\u201d the rape and aggravated robbery. <em>Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 577, 660 N.E.2d 724. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the kidnapping, the aggravated murder, the rape, and the aggravated robbery constitute one continuous occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 61} In proposition 15, Johnson also challenges the jury instructions for the felony-murder charge in Count 1 and the specification appended to Count 2. Both the charge and specification alleged that Johnson committed the murder \u201cwhile\u201d committing or \u201cwhile\u201d fleeing after committing other felonies. The trial court instructed the jury in this regard that the term \u201cwhile\u201d means that \u201cthe death must occur as part of acts leading up to or occurring during or immediately after the commission of kidnapping, rape, aggravated robbery and the death was directly associated with the commission of the kidnapping, rape <em>or </em>aggravated robbery or flight immediately after the commission of those crimes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 62} Because the court instructed the jury in the disjunctive, Johnson argues that it cannot be determined whether the jury found Daniel\u2019s murder to be directly associated not only with Daniel\u2019s kidnapping but also with the rape and robbery of Tina. For this reason, he urges the court to vacate his conviction of the felony-murder offense and specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 63} Our examination of the record, however, reveals that Johnson did not object to the instructions, and we therefore review his claim under the plain-error standard. We conclude that no plain error exists with regard to the instructions given to the jury on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 64} We rejected a similar argument in <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-0hio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 51-53, in which the trial court had instructed the jury on the five purposes listed in the kidnapping statute, R.C. 2905.01(A), but did not instruct the jury to reach a unanimous verdict as to which of those purposes was the basis for each of three kidnapping charges. Upon review, we determined that when the jury unanimously reaches a verdict, the individual jurors need not agree on which of the alternative bases support their individual findings. Id. at \u00b6 55, following <em>Schad v. Arizona </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 624, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 65} Similarly, in this case, we know that the jurors unanimously convicted Johnson of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated robbery, any one of which satisfies the necessary element for both felony murder and the specification. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>know \u2014 by virtue of the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on Count 1 and on the Count 2 specification \u2014 that the jury concluded that Johnson committed the murder while committing or while fleeing after committing at least one of those felony offenses. It was not necessary for the jurors to agree unanimously that the murder occurred while <em>all three </em>of those offenses were being committed or while Johnson was fleeing afterwards. We therefore conclude that no plain error occurred in the use of the word \u201cor\u201d in the instructions for the felony-murder count and the second specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">{\u00b6 66} Accordingly, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Righb-to-Counsel Issues</p>\n<p id=\"ADH\">A. Defendant\u2019s Request for New Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 67} At a pretrial hearing on March 10, 2004, Johnson asked the trial court to replace his appointed counsel. In his first proposition of law, Johnson contends that the trial court denied him the right to effective assistance of counsel by failing to inquire sufficiently into the basis for his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 68} In <em>State v. Deal </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 17, 46 O.O.2d 154, 244 N.E.2d 742, we held that a court has a duty to inquire into such a request: \u201cWhere, during the course of his trial for a serious crime, an indigent accused questions the effectiveness and adequacy of assigned counsel * * *, it is the duty of the trial judge to inquire into the complaint and make such inquiry a part of the record.\u201d Id., syllabus. However, as one Ohio appellate court has rightly explained, the \u201climited judicial duty arises only if the allegations are sufficiently specific; vague or general objections do not trigger the duty to investigate further.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 419, 423, 715 N.E.2d 223, citing <em>Deal, </em>17 Ohio St.2d at 19, 46 O.O.2d 154, 244 N.E.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 69} The record before us reveals the following in regard to Johnson\u2019s request for new counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 70} On February 11, 2004, Johnson\u2019s trial counsel referred during a pretrial hearing to an article in the Sunday, February 8, 2004, issue of the <em>Daily Jeffersonian, </em>which purported that Johnson, from jail, had asked Daniel\u2019s grandmother whether she would \u201clike to know what the little boy\u2019s last words were.\u201d Based on this report, and other related articles appearing in both the <em>Jeffersonian </em>and the <em>Zanesville Times Recorder, </em>defense counsel moved for a change of venue, which the court denied. The court did delay the starting date of the trial for several weeks, however, and also imposed a limited gag order on the news media.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 71} At a pretrial hearing on March 10, 2004, Johnson asked that his attorneys be removed from the case. He elaborated: \u201cI feel as though I\u2019m not being represented properly to the best of my [sic] ability. I can represent myself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>better than I\u2019m being represented. I have questions to address to the Court but I\u2019m not allowed to from my attorneys.\u201d The judge asked Johnson\u2019s counsel to respond. Johnson\u2019s lead counsel, Jack Blakeslee, stated that in his opinion, Johnson wanted new counsel because \u201cbasically he doesn\u2019t like to hear what we tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 72} The judge asked Johnson to speak, and Johnson responded, \u201cI have questions I would like to address [to] the Court but I\u2019m told I am \u2014 [.]\u201d The trial judge interrupted Johnson to caution that anything he said could be used against him at trial, then allowed him to resume. Johnson said: \u201cWhat I would like to say * * * is okay hopefully the newspaper is here today so they can actually print something I actually said in court \u2014 [.]\u201d Blakeslee interrupted: \u201cI\u2019m going to object to this. I\u2019m telling the defendant to keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 73} The trial judge cautioned Johnson to \u201cproceed with care\u201d and stated: \u201cIf you wish to address the Court you may * * * write a letter to the Judge.\u201d Johnson said he had been \u201ctold not to do that,\u201d and the judge said, \u201cWell, then you should follow the advice of your counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 74} Johnson said, \u201cI still would like to address the Court pertaining to questions \u2014 [.]\u201d The judge replied, \u201cYour attorney has objected to that and I\u2019m going to honor that objection at this time * * Johnson continued to insist on asking his questions. Blakeslee said, \u201cI\u2019m objecting to it\u2019s being [sic] going in the newspaper. * * * It\u2019s going to be out there.\u201d The defendant said, \u201cExactly. * * * The newspaper printed something I didn\u2019t say.\u201d The judge noted that he had taken care to guard against \u201can atmosphere of what was perceived to be prejudicial pretrial publicity to [Johnson].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 75} Johnson said, \u201c[Y]eah, but what I would like to know is how can the newspaper just print something I didn\u2019t say.\u201d The judge declined to answer that question, but said, \u201cIf you want to address these matters you may bring them to my attention in proper form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 76} At his next court appearance, on March 30, 2004, Johnson did not renew his request for new counsel. Instead, defense attorney Andrew Warhola stated: \u201cMr. Johnson has advised me that he will not be speaking during any of these proceedings, that he wants me to speak on his behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 77} The record does not support Johnson\u2019s claim that the court failed to inquire into his complaints. The court gave him an opportunity to present any complaints against counsel in open court, on the record, or in the form of a letter to the judge. The limited inquiry by the court afforded Johnson an opportunity to address his concern to the court regarding potential prejudice from pretrial publicity. When given the opportunity to speak, however, Johnson asked only, \u201c[H]ow can the newspaper just print something I didn\u2019t say[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 78} This complaint did not entitle Johnson to a change of counsel or to broader inquiry by the court. Accordingly, we overrule this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">B. Waiver of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 79} During a brief portion of the guilt phase of the trial, Johnson waived counsel and represented himself. In his 18th proposition of law, Johnson contends that because the trial court failed to advise him sufficiently of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, his waiver should be declared invalid as not having been knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 80} Two attorneys represented Johnson throughout the state\u2019s case-in-chief. When the state rested, Johnson\u2019s counsel also rested. At that point, however, contrary to counsel\u2019s advice, Johnson expressed a desire to testify on his own behalf, which caused defense counsel to ask the court to inquire into Johnson\u2019s competence to stand trial or make a statement. The court engaged in a colloquy with Johnson during which Johnson correctly recited the charges against him and affirmed his understanding that a death sentence could be imposed. Johnson then renewed his earlier request that his counsel be relieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 81} Upon reflection, Johnson decided not to testify, but announced his intent to call Tina Bailey as a defense witness during the guilt phase of the trial. One of Johnson\u2019s lawyers told the court that Johnson was calling Tina to testify against the lawyers\u2019 advice. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cQ. [trial judge] Mr. Johnson, will you be proceeding as your own\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cQ. You\u2019re proceeding pro se then?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">(\u00b6 85} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cQ. And you understand you will be subject to the same rules of procedure and evidence that would apply to any other person?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">{\u00b6 88} At that point in the proceedings, Johnson represented himself, but the trial judge, over Johnson\u2019s protests, designated his trial counsel as standby counsel. Johnson called Tina as a defense witness, questioned her, and then made a brief closing argument to the jury. However, defense counsel also continued to assist Johnson: they made motions for a mistrial and for a competency evaluation and discussed jury instructions with the trial judge and the prosecutor. The trial court also let defense counsel argue to the jury at the close of the guilt phase after Johnson did. Johnson\u2019s attorneys then resumed their full representation of him during the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">{\u00b6 89} A criminal defendant has the constitutional right to represent himself at trial. <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>However, \u201cthe Constitution * * * require[s] that any waiver of the right to counsel be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent * * * <em>Iowa v. Tovar </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 77, 87-88, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 158 L.Ed.2d 209. \u201cIn order to establish an effective waiver of [the] right to counsel, the trial court must make sufficient inquiry to determine whether defendant fully understands and intelligently relinquishes that right.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph two of the syllabus. And Crim.R. 44(A) provides that a defendant is entitled to counsel \u201cunless the defendant, after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his right to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 90} Johnson contends on appeal that the warnings the trial court gave him failed to comply with Crim.R. 44(A), as construed in <em>State v. Martin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227. There we held: \u201cIn the case of a \u2018serious offense\u2019 * * * when a criminal defendant elects to proceed pro se, the trial court must demonstrate substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44(A) by making a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant fully understood and intelligently relinquished his or her right to counsel.\u201d Id., paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 91} We said further in that case that the trial court \u201cdid not adequately explain the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments, possible defenses, mitigation, or other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 43, citing <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (plurality opinion). Johnson contends, likewise, that the trial court in this case failed to explain \u201cthe nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments, possible defenses, mitigation, or other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 92} In considering Johnson\u2019s contentions, we note that this case is factually distinguishable from <em>Martin. </em>First, the defendant in <em>Martin </em>conducted his entire defense by himself. Id. at \u00b6 19. Johnson, in contrast, had representation throughout his trial until he waived his right to counsel at the close of the state\u2019s case. Hence, \u201cit may be proper to presume that the defense counsel who represented [defendant] * * * had discussed all relevant aspects of the case with him.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Meachum </em>(C.A.1, 1976), 545 F.2d 273, 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 93} <em>United States ex rel. Konigsberg v. Vincent </em>(C.A.2, 1975), 526 F.2d 131, illustrates the importance of this distinction. After 12 days of trial, the defendant, \u201cno stranger to the federal courts,\u201d 526 F.2d at 132, fired his lawyer, waived counsel, and represented himself. The trial court directed that counsel sit at counsel table and assist, id. at 133, and the defendant \u201cconferred] repeatedly with his lawyers throughout the trial.\u201d Id. at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 94} Konigsberg argued that this constituted an invalid waiver of counsel \u201cbecause the [trial] judge failed to explore the consequences with him on the record.\u201d Id. However, the Second Circuit held \u201cthat the specific \u2018factual background\u2019 may in some instances excuse the judge\u2019s failure to give \u2018explicit warning and advice\u2019 regarding the waiver of counsel.\u201d Id., quoting <em>United States v. Rosenthal </em>(C.A.2, 1972), 470 F.2d 837, 845. The court noted, \u201cKonigsberg had been continuously represented prior to and during trial. He made his decision to represent himself with full knowledge of his right to counsel and of the importance of having counsel. Whatever might be the need in other situations, Konigsberg\u2019s involvement with the courts was such that there was no need for [the judge] to explain all this to him.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">{\u00b6 95} Here, as in <em>Konigsberg, </em>Johnson \u201chad been continuously represented prior to and during trial,\u201d and he had experience in the courts due to his prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 96} We also distinguish <em>Martin </em>because, in that case, we deemed the trial court\u2019s warnings inadequate due to Martin\u2019s confusion regarding self-representation and the trial court\u2019s failure to explain it to him. Martin <em>disclaimed </em>any desire to \u201cact as [his] own lawyer\u201d; rather, he wanted to be co-counsel. <em>Martin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 9. Under those circumstances, we held, the trial court should have advised him \u201cthat he had no right to be \u2018co-counsel\u2019 and that his only choices were to proceed pro se or with counsel.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 44. We held that absent such a warning, Martin did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 97} In contrast, Johnson displayed no confusion about what he wanted or what self-representation meant. Moreover, the record establishes that he knew the nature of the charges against him and that he was facing a potential death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 98} Based on the foregoing, the trial court made a sufficient inquiry to determine that Johnson knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, and, thereby, it substantially complied with Crim.R. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 99} We agree with Johnson that the court erred when it did not obtain a written waiver of counsel from him, as directed by Crim.R. 44(C). However, because the trial court substantially complied with Crim.R. 44, \u201cthe failure to file a written waiver is harmless error.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 100} Johnson also contends that the trial court insufficiently warned him of the dangers of self-representation, and we acknowledge that <em>Faretta </em>holds that a defendant electing to represent himself \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing.\u2019 \u201d 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>quoting <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">{\u00b6 101} However, the United States Supreme Court \u201cha[s] not * * * prescribed any formula or script to be read to a defendant who states that he elects to proceed without counsel. The information a defendant must possess in order to make an intelligent election * * * will depend on a range of case-specific factors, including the defendant\u2019s education or sophistication, the complex or easily grasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Tovar, </em>541 U.S. at 88, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 158 L.Ed.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">{\u00b6 102} The Sixth Amendment does not require extensive warnings in every case. In <em>Faretta, </em>for instance, the trial judge gave this warning: \u201cYou are going to follow the procedure. You are going to have to ask the questions right. If there is an objection to the form of the question and it is properly taken, it is going to be sustained. We are going to treat you like a gentleman. We are going to respect you. We are going to give you every chance, but you are going to play with the same ground rules that anybody plays. And you don\u2019t know those ground rules. You wouldn\u2019t know those ground rules any more than any other lawyer will know those ground rules until he gets out and tries a lot of cases. And you haven\u2019t done it.\u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 808, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 103} In <em>Faretta, </em>the Supreme Court held the foregoing warning sufficient and the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel valid: \u201cFaretta clearly and unequivocally declared to the trial judge that he wanted to represent himself and did not want counsel. The record affirmatively shows that Faretta was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will. The trial judge had warned Faretta that he thought it was a mistake not to accept the assistance of counsel, and that Faretta would be required to follow all the \u2018ground rules\u2019 of trial procedure.\u201d Id. at 835-836, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 104} Similarly, in this case, the trial court warned Johnson that he would be \u201csubject to the same rules of procedure and evidence that would apply to any other person.\u201d Johnson acknowledged that he understood that. Further, because Johnson had witnessed various pretrial hearings, the voir dire process, and four days of trial testimony before attempting to waive counsel, the court knew that Johnson understood \u201cthat there are technical rules governing the conduct of a trial, and that presenting a defense is not a simple matter of telling one\u2019s story.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>545 F.2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 105} Under these circumstances, the trial court reasonably determined that Johnson had sufficient understanding of the case and the consequences of self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>representation to make a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent choice to waive his right to counsel and represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">{\u00b6 106} We therefore overrule Johnson\u2019s 18th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">C. Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 107} In his fifth and 19th propositions of law, Johnson raises several issues regarding ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 108} In his fifth proposition of law, Johnson contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to challenge two veniremen, for cause, in response to their answers to defense counsel\u2019s questions regarding their ability to consider a life sentence as the penalty for the murder of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 109} In questioning Barbara Grant, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and the prospective juror:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cQ. [defense counsel] Would you have difficulty voting for a life sentence if you convicted a person of an intentional and deliberate murder of a child?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">{\u00b6 111} \u201cA. Deliberate? <em>No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cQ. So you could vote for a life sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cA. Not if he deliberately killed a child, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cQ. That\u2019s what I asked. Let me rephrase the question. * * * I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years and it\u2019s hard for me to get these questions out. So <em>would you have difficulty voting for a life sentence </em>if you convicted a person of an intentional and deliberate murder of a child?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">{\u00b6 115} \u201cA. <em>No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cQ. So you <em>could </em>vote for a life sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cA. <em>Yes, I could. Yes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">{\u00b6 118} Grant also said that she could consider mitigating factors, such as mental disease, drug use, child abuse, and parental abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-18\">{\u00b6 119} In order to establish that trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Grant constitutes ineffective assistance, Johnson must show (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">{\u00b6 120} Grant\u2019s responses during voir dire do not suggest or create an inference of bias such that Johnson may claim that trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Grant constitutes deficient performance. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Ohio St.3d 326, 350, 581 N.E.2d 1362. Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Grant does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">{\u00b6 121} The other venireman challenged here by Johnson, Sara Danadik, stated that the death penalty would be appropriate for the intentional, premeditated murder of a child. However, the record does not show that she said she would automatically vote for such a penalty. In fact, she said she could consider a life sentence in such a case \u201c[i]f the evidence and the circumstances warrant it.\u201d As with Grant, Danadik\u2019s voir dire responses do not support an inference of bias, and failure to challenge for cause does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 122} Accordingly, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 123} In his 19th proposition of law, Johnson contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance before trial, during voir dire, at the guilt phase of the trial, during the competency hearing, and during the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">A. Pretrial</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 124} Prior to trial, defense counsel requested a competency evaluation of Johnson. The court granted the request, but counsel withdrew it before the evaluation took place. Counsel explained that they requested an evaluation because Johnson refused to cooperate in his defense. But because Johnson changed his mind and decided to cooperate, counsel no longer questioned his competence to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 125} Johnson alleges that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by withdrawing the request, but he fails to explain why this constitutes deficient performance or how it became prejudicial. Thus, he fails to demonstrate ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">B. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 126} Johnson contends that counsel committed four errors during voir dire:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 127} First, Johnson alleges that counsel failed to object when the trial judge referred to the jury\u2019s death-penalty recommendation as a \u201crecommendation.\u201d However, as these references were accurate, they are not objectionable. See, e.g., <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 232-233, 690 N.E.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 128} Second, Johnson characterizes counsel\u2019s voir dire examination regarding mitigation as \u201csuperficial,\u201d but he does not explain his reasoning. A reviewing court generally will not second-guess counsel\u2019s judgments about what questions to ask on voir dire. See <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042; <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 129, 135, 707 N.E.2d 476. Johnson\u2019s allegation provides no basis for us to find ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 129} Third, Johnson contends that his counsel failed to object to repeated comments that the jury needed to convict Johnson of the death specification in order to reach the mitigation phase, but he does not explain why these comments were objectionable or prejudicial. They are neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 130} Fourth, Johnson claims that his counsel failed to object when the court read a list of all seven statutory mitigating factors to the prospective jurors during voir dire. Cf. <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 289, 528 N.E.2d 542. However, even assuming that <em>DePew </em>applies to voir dire, Johnson fails to explain how the alleged error prejudiced him, particularly at such an early stage in the proceedings and when no such error occurred later in his trial or sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">C. Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 131} Johnson alleges ineffective assistance, during the guilt phase, in seven instances:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 132} First, Johnson contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by conceding in opening statement that Johnson killed Daniel Bailey. Counsel stated the following to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 133} \u201cThere is an aggravated murder here. There was purposely, prior calculation and design. Marvin Johnson did kill Daniel Bailey. The issue is whether or not this was during the commission of a kidnapping or was there a kidnapping committed in this case. * * * There is an aggravated murder in this case but we contend there were no death penalty specifications that were involved here. Indeed, we contend there was not a rape. We contend there was not an aggravated robbery. But if you find that there was a rape, that there was an aggravated robbery we contend that that still does not make this a death penalty eligible case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 134} Conceding guilt in a capital case does not necessarily constitute deficient performance. <em>Florida v. Nixon </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 175, 190-191, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565; <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 338, 703 N.E.2d 1251. \u201cAttorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant\u2019s guilt is often clear. * * * In such cases, \u2018avoiding execution [may be] the best and only realistic result possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Florida v. Nixon, </em>543 U.S. at 191, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565, quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, Section 10.9.1, Commentary (Rev.Ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L.Rev. (2003) 913, 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 135} In this case, the record contains overwhelming evidence of Johnson\u2019s culpability for Daniel\u2019s murder, and Johnson at no point claimed innocence. We decline to second-guess trial counsel\u2019s decision to concede guilt on the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>charge but to dispute each of the other felonies that formed the basis for the death-penalty specifications. Moreover, in light of the evidence against him, Johnson cannot demonstrate how the concession caused him prejudice or might have altered the trial\u2019s outcome. See <em>Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 338, 703 N.E.2d 1251. Therefore, counsel\u2019s concession in opening does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 136} Second, Johnson contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by summarizing his criminal record during opening and by failing to object when Tina testified about his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 137} During opening, Johnson\u2019s counsel stated the following: \u201c[Tina] knew that Marvin had a criminal past. She knew that in 1989 in Alabama he had been convicted of arson. She also knew that he used illegal drugs such as crack cocaine but with all those short comings she still permitted him to become a part of her family.\u201d He then listed Johnson\u2019s convictions and stated that while he served various prison sentences for these convictions, \u201cTina continues to maintain contact with him by telephone or letter, they continue their relationship during those hard times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 138} Counsel connected Johnson\u2019s prior convictions with Tina\u2019s willingness to support him, to maintain a relationship and to take him back upon his release from prison. This does not objectively fall below a reasonable standard of representation, particularly if defense counsel expected the state to raise his prior convictions later in trial. See <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 709 N.E.2d 484. Moreover, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Johnson\u2019s guilt, he cannot show that these statements prejudiced him. Thus, he did not receive ineffective assistance in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 139} Third, Johnson complains that his counsel failed to object to Tina\u2019s testimony about Daniel\u2019s honor-student status and his hobbies, failed on three occasions to object to hearsay, and failed to object to testimony about Johnson\u2019s prior convictions. However, \u201cfailure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. To prevail on such a claim, a defendant must first show that there was a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to his client and, second, that he was materially prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u201d <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831. Johnson does not explain how these alleged failures constituted a violation of his counsel\u2019s duties or caused prejudice in light of the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 140} As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recently explained, \u201cexperienced trial counsel learn that objections to each potentially objectionable event could actually act to their party\u2019s detriment. * * * In light of this, any single failure to object usually cannot be said to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>been error unless the evidence sought is so prejudicial * * * that failure to object essentially defaults the case to the state. Otherwise, defense counsel must so consistently fail to use objections, despite numerous and clear reasons for doing so, that counsel\u2019s failure cannot reasonably have been said to have been part of a trial strategy or tactical choice.\u201d <em>Lundgren v. Mitchell </em>(C.A.6, 2006), 440 F.3d 754, 774. Accord <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 52-53, 630 N.E.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 141} Our review of the trial transcript reveals no such failure by Johnson\u2019s trial counsel, and we overrule his claim of ineffective assistance based on these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 142} Fourth, Johnson complains that when the state concluded direct examination of each witness, defense counsel failed to ask to review the witnesses\u2019 statements, pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g). \u201c[T]he burden of proving ineffectiveness is on the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 175, 555 N.E.2d 293, citing <em>State v. Smith </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 17 OBR 219, 477 N.E.2d 1128. However, Johnson fails to show prejudice because he does not explain whether any of the witness statements would have been discoverable or proven useful for impeachment during the trial. Hence, he fails to show ineffective assistance of counsel on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 143} Fifth, Johnson contends that his counsel indicated to the trial judge that Johnson could not be truthful. This allegation concerns Johnson\u2019s desire to testify during the guilt phase of his trial, and defense counsel\u2019s statement to the court \u2014 outside the presence of the jury \u2014 that ethically, he could not question Johnson on direct examination because he did not know what Johnson intended to say or whether Johnson\u2019s testimony would be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 144} Johnson claims prejudice from his counsel\u2019s statement because it implied that he intended to commit perjury. However, the record shows that counsel specifically disavowed knowing what Johnson intended to say and therefore represented to the court his reasons for not wishing to have Johnson testify. Johnson is unable to demonstrate ineffective assistance in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 145} Johnson also claims that his counsel violated the attorney-client privilege when he stated that he did not know what Johnson intended to say, but fads to cite authority for that proposition and gives no explanation of how the statement violated the privilege or amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 146} Sixth, Johnson contends that his counsel should have objected to an allegedly erroneous jury instruction defining \u201cpurposely\u201d for the two aggravated-murder charges and the rape charge. The trial court\u2019s instruction included both the specific-intention portion of the definition of purpose and the gist-of-the-offense portion of the definition from R.C. 2901.22(A). As we discuss in connection with his 12th proposition of law, however, no prejudice resulted from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>instruction, because the jury found that Johnson had killed Daniel with prior calculation and design, and the jury therefore necessarily found that he had acted with specific intent. As for the rape charge, \u201cthe act itself is all that must be intended.\u201d <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382, 386, 18 O.O.3d 528, 415 N.E.2d 303. No prejudicial error flowed from counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 147} Johnson also argues that counsel should have sought an instruction on the capital specification, the appropriate findings the jurors were to make, and an instruction defining the term \u201cwhile.\u201d As we discussed in the 15th proposition of law, the court did define the term \u201cwhile.\u201d For the remainder of the alleged errors, Johnson does not set forth what specific instructions counsel should have requested or how they caused him prejudice in light of the evidence against him. Our review does not reveal any ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">D. Competency Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 148} Johnson contends that when the trial court ordered a competency hearing after the guilt phase, defense counsel should have requested the appointment of a defense psychiatrist, pursuant to <em>Ake v. Oklahoma </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53. That failure, he claims, resulted in his inability to present evidence at that competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 149} Johnson\u2019s position is untenable for two reasons. First, though we agree with Johnson that <em>Ake </em>\u201crequires that a State provide access to a psychiatrist\u2019s assistance\u201d on the issue of his competence, id., 470 U.S. at 74, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53, <em>Ake </em>did not entitle Johnson to a psychiatrist of his choice. Id. at 83, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53. The trial court directed the Forensic Diagnostic Center to evaluate Johnson\u2019s competence, and a psychologist from that facility found Johnson to be competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 150} Second, the record reveals that defense counsel did request the appointment of a forensic psychologist by motion on October 6, 2003, and, in response to that motion, the court appointed Dr. Richard E. Jackson on October 20, 2003, more than six months before the competency hearing occurred. Because Johnson alleges nothing regarding Dr. Jackson\u2019s competence, and because Johnson stated on the record that he did not want to undergo the court-ordered competency evaluation at the close of the guilt phase, his defense counsel committed no error with regard to Johnson\u2019s rights under <em>Ake. </em>Therefore, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">E. Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 151} Johnson also contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during opening statements of the penalty phase of the trial. Counsel stated that the defense faced \u201can uphill battle\u201d and warned the jurors that they were \u201cgoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>to be emotionally affected\u201d by having seen photographs of the victim during the guilt phase. Johnson also complains that his counsel said, \u201cI\u2019m suppose[d] to know what I\u2019m doing and I think I do,\u201d and \u201cWe are going to try to be as honest with you as we can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">{\u00b6 152} These statements do not reflect deficient performance. Instead, they reflect counsel\u2019s attempt to build a rapport with the jury, and even \u201cdebatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 430, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 101, citing <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b645; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 339, 738 N.E.2d 1178. And \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 153} Finally, Johnson points to defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to an erroneous verdict form. However, as we discussed in connection with Johnson\u2019s 17th proposition, no prejudicial error resulted from this omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 154} Accordingly, as none of Johnson\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims have merit, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Inquiry into Defendant\u2019s Competence</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 155} In his second proposition of law, Johnson contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a timely hearing on his competence to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 156} Johnson contends that the trial court should have granted defense counsel\u2019s May 13, 2004 oral request for a competency evaluation in light of Johnson\u2019s actions leading up to and during the trial. He cites the following instances in support of the need to conduct a hearing: his attempt to fire his attorneys; his statements to the court regarding his belief that the newspapers misquoted him; his expression to the court of his desire to receive the death penalty; and his May 13 demand to testify and proceed pro se after defense counsel rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">{\u00b6 157} At that time, counsel moved for the competency hearing, and the court conducted its own examination of Johnson to determine his competence to stand trial. In response to the court\u2019s questions, Johnson accurately recited the charges against him and acknowledged the possibility of a death sentence, and he acknowledged that he understood the stage of the proceedings and that his testimony, argument, and questioning of witnesses would be governed by rules. Johnson also stated that he had spoken with his counsel and that he understood that his counsel had advised him against testifying or representing himself. Johnson nonetheless reaffirmed his desire to testify and to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>{\u00b6 158} Defense counsel moved again for a competency hearing, but the court concluded, \u201cI have no reason to believe that you are not proceeding competently. You may not be proceeding wisely but there is no requirement of that in the law. * * * The Court finds the defendant competent. If he wishes to testify in this matter that is also his constitutional right.\u201d The court then granted a recess for Johnson to confer with his counsel before proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 159} In <em>State v. Barton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 56, we stated, \u201cR.C. 2945.37(G) creates a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is competent to stand trial. \u2018This presumption remains valid under R.C. 2945.37(G) unless, \u201cafter a hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the defendant is not competent.\u2019 <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 74, quoting R.C. 2945.37(G). The \u2018decision as to whether to hold a competency hearing once trial has commenced is in the court\u2019s discretion.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 160} \u201cThe right to a hearing \u2018rises to the level of a constitutional guarantee where the record contains \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence,\u201d such that an inquiry * * * is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 156, quoting <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433, and citing <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103, and <em>Pate v. Robinson </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815. And \u201c[ijncompetency is defined in Ohio as the defendant\u2019s inability to understand \u2018 * * * the nature and objective of the proceedings against him or of presently assisting in his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 28 OBR 207, 502 N.E.2d 1016, quoting R.C. 2945.37(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 161} The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying counsel\u2019s May 13, 2004 motion for a competency evaluation, because the indicia of incompetence did not rise to a level that demanded a hearing or an evaluation. Johnson\u2019s anger regarding the newspaper articles, his refusal to heed his counsel\u2019s advice, and his abandoned request to fire his counsel did not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the charges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in his defense. Even Johnson\u2019s desire to receive the death penalty did not necessarily signal incompetency. See <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 29, 553 N.E.2d 576 (\u201ceven if a capital defendant waives mitigation completely because he wants to be executed, that waiver does not by itself call his competence into question\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 162} We view these alleged indicators in light of Johnson\u2019s responses to the court in which he expressed his understanding of the nature of the charges against him, the possibility of the death penalty for these charges, the ramifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tions of both testifying and representing himself, and the need to follow the rules. The court satisfied itself of Johnson\u2019s competence, and, in such matters, we defer to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">{\u00b6 163} We acknowledge that on May 13, defense counsel informed the court of Dr. Jackson\u2019s expected diagnosis that Johnson suffered \u201cparanoid personality disorder [and] reality contact problems.\u201d But the diagnosis said nothing of Johnson\u2019s competence. As we have previously held, \u201c[a] defendant may be emotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the charges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d <em>Bock, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 110, 28 OBR 207, 502 N.E.2d 1016. Moreover, at the time it denied the defense\u2019s May 13 motion for a competency evaluation, the trial court had before it only defense counsel\u2019s assertions regarding Dr. Jackson\u2019s diagnosis, not evidence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 164} As a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for a competency evaluation during trial on May 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 165} Four days later, the court did grant the defense\u2019s subsequent motion for a mental evaluation and a competency hearing. Johnson contends that the court abused its discretion by waiting until that point to order the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 166} On Monday, May 17, 2004, between the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, defense counsel informed the court that they had learned over the weekend that Dr. Jackson, the appointed defense psychologist, had \u201cfound symptoms consistent with severe mental illness.\u201d Counsel also related to the court that Johnson had called three times and had made statements that led counsel to question his competence. The defense renewed its motion for a mental evaluation of Johnson and a competency hearing, and the court granted it, ordering the Forensic Diagnostic Center to perform the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 167} At the competency hearing, held May 26, 2004, the parties stipulated to Dr. Denise Kohler\u2019s report, dated May 22, 2004, in which she found Johnson competent to stand trial, as he \u201cis capable of understanding the nature and the objectives of the proceedings against him and of assisting in his defense.\u201d The defense submitted no evidence at the hearing. Based on this report, the trial court deemed Johnson competent and continued with the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 168} Johnson argues that Dr. Kohler\u2019s evaluation occurred too late to detect his incompetency. He refers to Dr. Jackson\u2019s penalty-phase testimony that, under stress, his mental disorders could alter his perception of reality. Because such stress may not have existed at the time Dr. Kohler evaluated him, he argues, Dr. Kohler\u2019s evaluation inaccurately determined him competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 169} The record before us does not substantiate Johnson\u2019s claim. In his report, Dr. Jackson opined that in \u201cmoderate to high stress situations, anger, suspiciousness and distress/depression <em>can contribute </em>to extreme agitation and <em>possible </em>atypical perception.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, not only does this evidence fail to address Johnson\u2019s <em>competency, </em>the evidence fails to suggest what Johnson\u2019s competency <em>would have been </em>four days earlier, when Johnson believes he should have been evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 170} This situation is analogous to that in <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b6 55, in which we rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred by failing to order additional testing because \u201c[i]t is purely speculative whether additional testing would have made any difference in the outcome of [the defendant\u2019s] competency evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 171} Similarly, we reject Johnson\u2019s claim that an earlier evaluation would have revealed his incompetency, as it rests upon speculation and has no basis in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 172} The second proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Voir Dire Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">A. Interruptions by Trial Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">{\u00b6 173} In his third proposition of law, Johnson contends that the trial court disproportionately interrupted defense counsel during voir dire, suggesting to the veniremen that the judge thought the defense inept.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">{\u00b6 174} This argument lacks merit. The record reveals that during the week-long voir dire, the court interrupted defense counsel 29 times and the state 12 times. Of the former, the court interrupted several times to note something for the record, to ask questions of its own, or to clarify the law for a prospective juror. The trial judge did rephrase or clarify several defense questions, but the court\u2019s opinion regarding defense counsel\u2019s competence cannot be inferred from anything in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">{\u00b6 175} We distinguish this case from <em>United States v. Hickman </em>(C.A.6, 1979), 592 F.2d 931. There, the trial judge dominated a one-day trial with \u201cconstant interruptions,\u201d exhibited a consistently anti-defense tone, interfered with defense cross-examination, and attacked the credibility of defense witnesses. Id. at 934-936. In this case, the court\u2019s interruptions did not have the same character as in <em>Hickman, </em>and they occurred during the course of a week-long voir dire that generated around 900 pages of transcript. The interruptions \u201cdid not pervade the trial\u201d and \u201cprobably left little impression on the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 278, 750 N.E.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">{\u00b6 176} This proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>B. Limitation on Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 177} In the fourth proposition of law, Johnson contends that the court denied defense counsel the opportunity to \u201cconduct a thorough and searching voir dire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 178} During voir dire of the first group of veniremen, defense counsel asked them to identify their favorite television shows, their heroes, and their hobbies. The trial judge mistakenly thought that these questions had been asked on the questionnaires completed by each prospective juror, and he stated that, if they wished, they could refer counsel to their questionnaires for the answers. The questionnaires, however, did not inquire about television shows, heroes, or hobbies.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 179} Johnson fails to explain how the court\u2019s mistaken belief or counsel\u2019s inability to inquire into those topics prevented him from revisiting the topics upon learning that the information did not appear in the questionnaires. Moreover, information about prospective jurors\u2019 \u201cpersonal habits and activities\u201d is \u201cnot needed to compose a fair-minded jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Phibbs </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 999 F.2d 1053, 1071. See, also, <em>United States v. Serafim </em>(M.D.Pa.1999), 57 F.Supp.2d 108, 114 (such information has \u201cmarginal pertinence\u201d and \u201cno evident link with fairness\u201d); <em>United States v. McDade </em>(E.D.Pa.1996), 929 F.Supp. 815, 819 (such information \u201csheds no real light on\u201d juror bias). Due process confers no right \u201cto mold the jury in [such] a way that the jury will be receptive to counsel\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Padillar-Valenzuela </em>(D.Ariz.1995), 896 F.Supp. 968, 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 180} We overrule this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">C. Overruled Challenges for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 181} In his sixth proposition, Johnson contends that the trial court erred in overruling his challenges for cause of prospective jurors Craig, Kritz, and Bumgardner, which required him to excuse them by preemptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 182} Generally, the denial of a challenge for cause does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>Ross v. Oklahoma </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 81, 88-89, 108 S.Ct. 2273, 101 L.Ed.2d 80. However, because Johnson exhausted his peremptory challenges, we consider the merits of his claim. See <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 61; <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 564, 715 N.E.2d 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">{\u00b6 183} A trial court\u2019s resolution of a challenge for cause will be upheld on appeal unless the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 203. 211. 58 O.O.2d 409. 280 N.E.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>1. Craig</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 184} Prospective juror James Craig disclosed on voir dire that, in 1978, his sister had been charged with \u201ca crime with a lot of the same characteristics as this. * * * There was drugs involved, it was interracial, there was a kidnapping * * *.\u201d Asked if this background would bias him in favor of either party, Craig stated: \u201cIf I had to say I probably would be for the State of Ohio. * * * I feel I would try to be fair but I don\u2019t know * * * that I could be completely fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 185} Yet, in response to a query about how his sister\u2019s experience would affect his deliberations, Craig said: \u201c7 <em>will follow the law. </em>Whatever the Judge tells me I will do my very best to follow it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although he could not \u201cerase [his] memories\u201d of his sister\u2019s case, he pledged to \u201cdo [his] level best\u201d not to consider those memories in deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 186} The defense challenged Craig for cause, but the trial court overruled the challenge, noting that Craig had raised the issue himself and describing him as \u201cforthright in his answers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 187} The record supports the court\u2019s decision. \u201cProspective jurors represent a cross section of the community, and their education and experience vary widely. Also, unlike witnesses, prospective jurors have had no briefing by lawyers prior to taking the stand. Jurors thus cannot be expected invariably to express themselves carefully or even consistently. Every trial judge understands this, and under our system it is that judge who is best situated to determine competency to serve impartially.\u201d <em>Patton v. Yount </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 1025, 1039, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 188} We agree that due process entitles a defendant \u201cto a jury that will hear his case impartially, not one that tentatively promises to try.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Brigano </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 232 F.3d 499, 503. However, Craig did not promise to try to be impartial. He said: \u201cI will follow the law.\u201d He added that he would \u201cdo his very best\u201d and his \u201clevel best\u201d to disregard his sister\u2019s experience, which occurred 26 years prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 189} Thus, we distinguish this case from <em>Wolfe, </em>in which three prospective jurors offered \u201ctentative statements\u201d that they would \u201ctry to decide [the] case on the evidence presented at trial.\u201d 232 F.3d at 503. Moreover, as the trial court in this case noted, Craig raised the issue on his own initiative. On this record, the trial judge could reasonably conclude that Craig understood his obligation to disregard his sister\u2019s experience and render a verdict free of any prejudgment. The substantial testimony here supports the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">2. Kritz</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">{\u00b6 190} Prospective juror Phyllis Kritz initially said she thought she could recommend a life sentence if the aggravating circumstances did not outweigh the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>mitigating factors. Under defense examination, she said that the proper sentence should be death when the jury convicts a person of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design. She further stated that her views would substantially impair her ability to consider any punishment but death for premeditated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 191} However, Kritz later contradicted these statements when she affirmed that she would listen to the mitigating evidence and fairly consider it. The trial court also asked Kritz whether she could recommend a lesser sentence than death if aggravation failed to outweigh mitigation. Kritz replied, \u201cAfter thinking about it * * * I understand more and all and I could do that. * * * I would do that. Yes. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 192} The questioning reveals this prospective juror\u2019s greater understanding of her role as a juror and her willingness to follow the law as voir dire progressed. As we held in <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 468, 739 N.E.2d 749, \u201ceven if a juror shows a <em>predisposition </em>in favor of imposing the death penalty, the trial court does not abuse its discretion in overruling a challenge for cause if the juror later states that she will follow the law and the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 193} Based on our review of the record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying this challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">3. Bumgardner</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 194} Prospective juror Delbert Bumgardner, a prison guard, had been fired from his job and faced a misdemeanor charge based on the allegation that he had assaulted an inmate. However, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction later reinstated him to his position, and the state dropped the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 195} On voir dire, Bumgardner expressed a willingness to consider mitigating factors, but stated that such factors would have to outweigh the aggravating circumstances to justify a life sentence. The trial judge explained to Bumgardner, \u201c[I]f we get to the second phase, mitigation or sentencing phase, the jurors will be instructed * * * that they are to weigh all of the mitigating factors that have been presented and they must then make a determination if the <em>aggravating circumstances </em>* * * <em>outweigh </em>beyond a reasonable doubt any of <em>the mitigating factors.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Bumgardner promised to follow this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 196} The judge then asked: \u201c[W]ould you shift the burden of proof, to the defendant and make him prove that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d Bumgardner replied: \u201cI believe I said he would have to prove them but what I meant was \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to describe * * * \u2014 basically the prosecution has to prove everything to me and if they don\u2019t prove their case to me all the way through then I don\u2019t have a problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>giving Mr. Johnson life sentence or otherwise.\u201d He also answered \u201cYes, sir\u201d when the trial judge asked whether he understood that \u201cthe burden of proof is on the State of Ohio throughout this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 197} The defense challenged Bumgardner for cause on three grounds: first, his initial statement that mitigating factors would have to outweigh aggravating circumstances to justify a life sentence; second, a claim of personal hostility toward defense counsel; and third, an argument that there must be \u201csome evidence\u201d that Bumgardner had assaulted a prisoner or else he would not have been prosecuted or fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 198} The trial court overruled the challenge, specifically rejecting the assertion that Bumgardner had displayed hostility to counsel. The judge also determined that neither Bumgardner\u2019s employment nor the dismissed assault charge constituted cause to excuse him.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 199} On appeal, Johnson reasserts his three claims regarding Bumgardner. However, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision based on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 200} As with Craig, the transcript supports the court\u2019s conclusion that Bumgardner\u2019s responses do not exhibit bias or an inability to consider the evidence and apply the correct standards of law. Nothing in the record contradicts this conclusion. Similarly, other than defense counsel\u2019s statements to the court, the record does not reveal that Bumgardner exhibited hostility toward defense counsel. The court stood in the best position to observe Bumgardner and his behavior; it detected no hostility, and no evidence exists on which to dispute that finding. See <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 426, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (\u201cdeference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 201} Finally, no inference of bias or an inability to perform the duties of a juror arises from the fact that Bumgardner, a prison guard, faced a charge, later dropped by both the state and his employer, that he assaulted an inmate. The court stated, \u201cHe did answer he would follow the law and I carefully reviewed it with him again. * * * I do not find just because one is a corrections officer that it is basis to be excused and he advised the charges were dismissed against him. It may well be that he is also sympathetic to those who have had charges brought against them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 202} The record reveals nothing that contradicts the court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 203} As the evidence in the record supports the court\u2019s decisions, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the three challenges for cause, and we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Evidence Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">A. Evidence Relating to Victim</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 204} In his eighth proposition, Johnson contends that, during the guilt phase of the trial, the jury heard irrelevant and prejudicial testimony about Daniel. Specifically, Johnson objects to the state\u2019s description of Daniel and his activities during opening statements, to Tina\u2019s testimony about Daniel\u2019s hobbies and interests, and to the fact that Tina had a picture of Daniel with her while she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 205} The record shows that in its opening statement, the state mentioned the following about Daniel: his age, where he went to school, his grade level, his status as an honor-roll student, that he played football and video games, that he liked watching a variety of sports, that he had a paper route, that he was interested in cars, and that he had a younger sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 206} Tina\u2019s testimony consisted of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 207} \u201cQ: I want to ask you some questions, Tina, about Daniel.

He had produced his own flyers to include in the newspapers that he delivered and he actually had customers request his services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 228} Johnson argues that this testimony, and the relevant portion of the state\u2019s opening, constitute irrelevant, prejudicial character evidence. However, because he did not object, Johnson waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 325, 686 N.E.2d 245; <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 229} Having reviewed the record, we disagree with Johnson\u2019s contention that none of the statements had any relevance. For example, Tina\u2019s testimony about Daniel\u2019s interest in computers explained why he stayed up late at night while she worked and why he would call her around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, which in turn helped establish the time of death. See <em>State v. Noting, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 55-57. That she bought him a computer and helped him pick it out provided background for their relationship and helped to explain Johnson\u2019s resentment toward Daniel. The picture helped to identify Daniel. And as we observed in <em>Noting, </em>these types of evidence \u201csimply establish[ ] that the [victims] had been living persons, an element of the aggravated murder charge.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 230} In <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 107, 684 N.E.2d 668, we stated that \u201cproving the facts of a murder necessarily involves disclosure of details as to the victims and their lives. \u2018The victims cannot be separated from the crime.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 420, 613 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 231} Finally, as in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cthe references to the victims\u2019 background were minimal and relatively innocuous.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 107, 684 N.E.2d 668. The state did not dwell upon either Daniel\u2019s background or his picture, and neither the state nor Tina used inflammatory or emotional language to describe Daniel\u2019s background.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">{\u00b6 232} In other cases, we concluded that plain error did not occur, and we reach the same conclusion here. In light of the evidence against Johnson, any error with regard to character evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">{\u00b6 233} We overrule Johnson\u2019s eighth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>B. Jailhouse Informant</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 234} In his ninth proposition of law, Johnson contends that the state violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by assigning informant Mickey Alexander as his cellmate in the Guernsey County Jail in order to obtain statements from him after his right to counsel attached. Although the state did not introduce Johnson\u2019s statements at trial, Johnson claims that the statements he made to Alexander led to the discovery of the following three exhibits for the state: the $1,000 that Johnson hid in the park, the key to Tina\u2019s house in Johnson\u2019s wallet, and the shoes from Lisa Wilson. He argues that these items should be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 235} However, the record demonstrates that Johnson volunteered the information to the informant. In such cases, \u201ca defendant does not make out a violation of [the Sixth Amendment] right [to counsel] simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported his incriminating statements to the police. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks.\u201d <em>Kuhlmann v. Wilson </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 436, 459, 106 S.Ct. 2616, 91 L.Ed.2d 364; cf. <em>United States v. Henry </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 264, 271, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (right to counsel violated where informant \u201cwas not a passive listener\u201d but took \u201caffirmative steps to secure incriminating information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 236} The record does not support Johnson\u2019s claim. At a pretrial suppression hearing, Alexander testified that the police never asked him to question Johnson or initiate any conversations and that he never asked Johnson any questions about his case, but only listened to what Johnson volunteered. Alexander also testified that he came to be assigned to Johnson\u2019s cell because he and Johnson had known each other for several years, and Johnson requested that Alexander be assigned to his cell. Only Alexander testified at the suppression hearing, and nothing in the record contradicts his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 237} Because the record does not reveal that Alexander did anything but listen to what Johnson volunteered to him, the trial court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s suppression motion. Hence, we overrule Johnson\u2019s ninth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">C. In Camera Inspection of Police Report</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 238} In his 11th proposition of law, Johnson contends that, pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g), the trial court should have conducted an in camera inspection of the police reports prepared by Detective Brian Harbin, who testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">{\u00b6 239} As we held in <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 147, 689 N.E.2d 929, \u201cUnder Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g), after a witness\u2019s direct examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>opposing counsel may request an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the witness\u2019s \u2018written or recorded statement\u2019 to determine whether it is inconsistent with his testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 240} This case presents a situation identical to that in <em>Keenan: </em>Johnson failed to make Detective Harbin\u2019s report a part of the record, and he failed to object to its omission. As we wrote in <em>Keenan, </em>\u201c[rjeview of this issue is therefore impossible. * * * Consequently, he has waived this issue.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 226,15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Trial-Administration Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A3s\">A. Stun Device</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 241} During his trial, the court required Johnson to wear a security device known as a \u201cstun belt,\u201d though he wore it on his leg rather than his waist. The record does not reveal that the court heard evidence to justify the use of this restraint, and the court did not state its reasons for ordering Johnson to wear it. In his seventh proposition of law, Johnson contends that the trial court erred by requiring him to wear this device without first conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 242} He relies on State <em>v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, in which the defendant objected to the court\u2019s order to wear a stun belt and challenged the court\u2019s justification for the device. In considering that claim, we observed that \u201c[cjourts elsewhere have upheld the use of electronic stun belts when specifically justified\u201d and that \u201ccourts have reversed when stun belts have not been amply justified on the record.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 105. We implicitly agreed that stun-belt restraints must be justified, and our review of the record revealed that the trial court held a hearing on the need for a stun belt and that the evidence presented justified the court\u2019s order. Id. at \u00b6 106-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 243} We agree with Johnson that the trial court erred, pursuant to <em>Adams. </em>However, because Johnson neither objected to the court\u2019s order nor requested a hearing on the matter, <em>Adams </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 244} Generally, the failure to object waives the error and requires the aggrieved party to demonstrate prejudice. Other courts addressing this issue in the context of a stun-belt order have applied this type of review. For example, in <em>Adams, </em>at \u00b6 105, we cited both <em>Scieszka v. State </em>(2003), 259 Ga.App. 486, 578 S.E.2d 149, and <em>Simms v. State </em>(Tex.App.2004), 127 S.W.3d 924; in both cases, the courts rejected the defendants\u2019 claims because they failed to object and because the respective records contained no evidence of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 245} In <em>Hemandez-Reyes v. Lampert </em>(C.A.9, 2004), 105 Fed.Appx. 916, 917-918, 2004 WL 1687945, the Ninth Circuit rejected the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the use of a stun belt for two reasons: First, \u201cHernandez-Reyes\u2019 failure to object to the restraining device negates the presence of compulsion necessary to establish a due process violation\u201d and, second, \u201che has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that he was prejudiced by wearing the device during his trial. A defendant\u2019s restraint at trial is subject to harmless error analysis. * * * As such, we must determine whether the error had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Ghent v. Woodford </em>(C.A.9, 2002), 279 F.3d 1121, 1132 fn. 9. The court determined that the error had no effect. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 246} The Supreme Court of Illinois recently held the following in regard to a trial court\u2019s order for the defendant to wear a stun belt: \u201calthough the failure to conduct a * * * hearing under these circumstances is an error, defendant\u2019s failure to object and to carry his burden of persuasion amounts to forfeiture of the error, where he cannot establish that it prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.\u201d <em>People v. Allen </em>(2006), 222 Ill.2d 340, 305 Ill.Dec. 544, 856 N.E.2d 349, citing <em>Estelle v. Williams </em>(1976), 425 U.S. 501, 512-513, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 247} Therefore, in light of these decisions and our holding in <em>Adams, </em>we hold that although a trial court errs when it orders a defendant to wear a stun belt without sufficient justification in the record, the defendant waives the error by failing to object. Thus, we turn to the record in this case to determine whether Johnson suffered prejudice due to the stun belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 248} The record contains no evidence that indicates the jury could see or had any knowledge of the stun belt that Johnson wore on his leg. The court ordered Johnson to wear the stun belt under civilian clothing that defense counsel had purchased with court funds, and the court reminded counsel to buy pants large enough to accommodate it. The court noted that it could not see the device and that, during trial, the defendant sat behind an enclosed desk or table.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 249} The record does not reveal that the device caused Johnson any physical discomfort. When the trial judge asked, \u201cAre you able to wear that device?\u201d Johnson answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The record does not reveal that the stun belt increased any risk of injury to Johnson or that it caused him any nervousness or other psychological distress. Nothing in the record suggests that the device in any way inhibited Johnson\u2019s ability to consult with his counsel or assist in his defense. No evidence exists that the stun belt ever activated during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 250} We conclude that this record does not show prejudice in this regard. See, e.g., <em>United States v. McKissick </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 204 F.3d 1282, 1299 (no evidence that the jury knew about the device); <em>United States v. Joseph </em>(C.A.5, 2003), 333 F.3d 587, 591 (the jury could not see the device, and the device did not activate during trial); <em>Washington v. Florida Atty. Gen. </em>(Oct. 13, 2005), M.D. Florida No. 604CV1355ORC79KES, 2005 WL 2580686 (no evidence that the jury knew of the stun belt or that it caused the defendant physical discomfort); <em>Scieszka, </em>259 Ga.App. at 487, 578 S.E.2d 149 (same); <em>Simms, </em>127 S.W.3d at 928-929 (the jury could not see stun belt); <em>Allen, </em>222 I11.2d 340, 305 IlLDec. 544, 856 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>N.E.2d 349 (the trial court took care to prevent the jury from seeing the stun belt; no evidence of distress, nervousness, or that the device hindered the defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 251} In the absence of any evidence in the record that the stun belt prejudiced Johnson, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">B. Spectator Outburst</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 252} In his tenth proposition, Johnson contends that an emotional outburst by a spectator, Utelius Barnes, tainted his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 253} While representing himself, Johnson called Tina Bailey as a defense witness. In his final question, he asked her: \u201cDo you recall times after sex with me * * * that you would, after finished, you would get up and go to the window? * * * You remember that feeling? That\u2019s what it felt like to beat your son in the f* * *inghead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 254} Barnes, a spectator in the courtroom, shouted at Johnson, \u201cI\u2019ll kick your f* * *ing ass.\u201d The court ordered him removed, and it admonished the jury to \u201cjudge the credibility of the witness that has just testified and not the defendant who was asking the questions.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the court recessed for the day, but, before adjourning, it addressed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 255} \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I need to have your promise and commitment to me under your oath as jurors that you will judge this case fairly and impartially on the facts presented by the testimony of the witnesses and not by any questions that have been asked. Will you promise me that you will do that?\u201d The jurors promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">{\u00b6 256} Although the court did not, at that time, give a specific instruction to disregard Barnes\u2019s outburst, it did so when instructing the jury at the close of the guilt phase. On request of the defense, the court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">{\u00b6 257} \u201cDuring the trial we had a witness and an outburst as part of a spectator [Barnes], the witness who had testified in the trial briefly and was seated in the courtroom. The outburst is such that you are instructed to totally disregard what you heard or saw in the courtroom and decide this case only on the basis of the evidence adduced during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">{\u00b6 258} \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have your individual promises that you will do that by advising me affirmatively or negatively?</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">{\u00b6 259} \u201cJURORS: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">{\u00b6 260} When an emotional outburst takes place in court, the issue is whether the outburst \u201cdeprived the defendant of a fair trial by improperly influencing the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 44. This \u201cis a factual question to be resolved by the trial court, whose determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>will not be overturned absent clear, affirmative evidence of error.\u201d <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 440, 709 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 261} \u201cNormally, only the trial judge can make the necessary factual determinations on these questions. \u2018[H]is findings thereon will not be disturbed on review in the absence of evidence on the face of the record clearly and affirmatively showing that the jury was improperly affected * * \u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068, quoting <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 38, 41, 32 O.O.2d 21, 209 N.E.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">(\u00b6 262} The record does not \u201cclearly and affirmatively\u201d reveal that Barnes\u2019s outburst had any effect on the jury. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s admonitions focused the jury on the evidence and away from the outburst. Cf. <em>Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 48 (court cautioned jurors to \u201cfocus on the evidence and to disregard extrinsic matters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">(\u00b6 263} Furthermore, we reject Johnson\u2019s argument that, pursuant to <em>Remmer v. United States </em>(1954), 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654, the trial court should have conducted a hearing to determine the outburst\u2019s effect. A <em>Remmer </em>hearing must be held when the trial court learns of \u201cprivate communication, contact, or tampering * * * with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury.\u201d <em>Remmer, </em>347 U.S. at 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 264} However, \u201c[wjhere the communication is innocuous and initiated by a spectator in the form of an outburst, a hearing is not necessarily required.\u201d <em>White v. Smith </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 984 F.2d 163, 166. An in-court emotional outburst directed at the defendant, not the jury, \u201cis a situation quite unlike the private communication with the jury encountered in <em>Remmer. </em>The * * * outburst was not \u2018a purposeful intrusion into the sanctity of the juror\u2019s domain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitehead v. Cowan </em>(C.A.7, 2001), 263 F.3d 708, 724, quoting <em>Schaff v. Snyder </em>(C.A.7, 1999), 190 F.3d 513, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 265} We overrule the tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Jury Instructions A. Lesser Included Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">{\u00b6 266} In his 16th proposition of law, Johnson claims that the trial court should have instructed the jury on sexual battery, R.C. 2907.03(A)(1), a lesser included offense of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">{\u00b6 267} The state charged Johnson with rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d Sexual battery, as defined by R.C. 2907.03(A)(1), takes place when \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>offender knowingly coerces the other person to submit by any means that would prevent resistance by a person of ordinary resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 268} Rape requires the use of \u201cforce or threat of force\u201d to compel the victim\u2019s submission, while sexual battery requires only coercion. Because \u201cforce or threat of force always constitutes coercion,\u201d an offender cannot commit rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) without also committing sexual battery under R.C. 2907.03(A)(1). <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382, 386, 18 O.O.3d 528, 415 N.E.2d 303. However, the state need not prove force or the threat of force in order to prove sexual battery. Therefore, sexual battery, as defined by R.C. 2907.03(A)(1), constitutes a lesser included offense of rape as defined by R.C. 2907.02(A)(2). Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 269} An instruction regarding a lesser included offense must be given \u201conly where the evidence presented at trial would reasonably support both an acquittal on the crime charged and a conviction upon the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 216, 533 N.E.2d 286. Thus, the failure to instruct on the offense of sexual battery constitutes error only if the jury could reasonably have found that Johnson compelled Tina to submit by coercion, but not by force or the threat of force. Cf. <em>Keenan, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 139-140, 689 N.E.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 270} Johnson contends that his implied threat to harm Daniel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constituted coercion rather than \u201cthreat of force\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2907.02(A) because he did not threaten to harm <em>Tina. </em>Johnson further contends that the jury could have found that Tina had sex with him <em>solely </em>because he threatened Daniel and not because he held the knife. Therefore, he claims, the jury could have reasonably found that Tina submitted to his coercion (the threat to Daniel), rather than any threat of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 271} Johnson\u2019s argument presupposes that in a prosecution for rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a threat to harm a person other than the victim of the alleged rape cannot serve as the \u201cthreat of force\u201d needed to establish rape. Other courts have rejected that view. See <em>Crenshaw v. State </em>(1971), 13 Md.App. 361, 373, 283 A.2d 423 (threat to third person can serve as threat of force for rape); <em>Fitzpatrick v. State </em>(1977), 93 Nev. 21, 22, 558 P.2d 630 (same); 2 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law (2d Ed.2003) 627, Section 17.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 272} However, we need not decide today whether a threat of harm to a third party can constitute a \u201cthreat of force\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2907.02(A). Johnson had no right to a lesser-included-offense instruction on sexual battery because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>based on the record, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that Tina submitted solely because of the threat to Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 273} Tina testified specifically that she would not have performed oral sex on Johnson had he not held the knife to her. Her testimony that she also submitted because of her fear for Daniel does not contradict this. Thus, the record does not support Johnson\u2019s claim that Tina submitted <em>solely </em>because she feared for Daniel\u2019s safety or that Johnson\u2019s display of the knife had no impact upon her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 274} The record supports the conclusion that Tina submitted both because of the threat to Daniel <em>and </em>the threat to her own person. Therefore, no error occurred by the failure to instruct on the lesser included offense of sexual battery, and we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">B. Purpose Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 275} In his 12th proposition of law, Johnson claims that the trial court erroneously defined the term \u201cpurposely\u201d when defining the elements of aggravated murder. The trial court used the \u201cgist of the offense\u201d language found in R.C. 2901.22(A), which Johnson argues should not be given in an aggravated-murder case. See, generally, <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 393, 659 N.E.2d 292; 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1995) 58, Comment to Section 409.01(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 276} Johnson failed to object at trial to this instruction. Thus, he waived the alleged error unless it is plain error. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 56, citing <em>State v.

Plain error did not occur in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 277} In convicting Johnson on Count 2, the jury found that he killed Daniel with prior calculation and design. Such a finding necessarily implies that Johnson had a specific purpose to kill. Thus, had the alleged error not happened, the jury would still have found that Johnson purposely killed Daniel. This proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">{\u00b6 278} In his 20th proposition, Johnson argues that flaws in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">{\u00b6 279} Johnson argues that the trial court \u201cweighed a wholly different aggravating circumstance than the jury found in Count Two.\u201d The basis for this claim is the error in the verdict form for Count 2. As we previously discussed, Johnson waived that error by failing to object. Further, as we also discussed, nothing in the record suggests that the jury could have found someone else to be the principal offender, and in fact, the jury found Johnson to be the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>offender with regard to the specification to Count 1, for which the jury received an accurately drafted verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6280} Thus, the court did not commit prejudicial error by considering his principal-offender status when weighing the felony-murder specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 281} Johnson further contends that the trial court erroneously weighed two aggravating circumstances against his mitigation. The record supports Johnson\u2019s claim, as the trial court appears to have weighed the kidnapping and rape convictions as separate aggravating circumstances in its sentencing opinion. As we observed in <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 420, 692 N.E.2d 151, fn. 2, when a single R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification charges two or more predicate felonies, those felonies must be weighed together as a single aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 282} However, our independent review cures this error by the trial court. See, generally, <em>Clemons v. Mississippi </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 738, 745-746, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725; <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 170, 555 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 283} Johnson also complains that the sentencing opinion discussed the facts surrounding his offenses. But discussing these facts does not necessarily constitute error, as we held in <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 684-685, 687 N.E.2d 1358: \u201cWhile the trial court discussed the facts surrounding the crime * * * in its opinion, it did not weigh those facts as aggravating circumstances. Instead the court reviewed the nature and circumstances of the crime, as it was required to do pursuant to R.C. 2929.03.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 284} Here, the trial court did not weigh the facts as aggravating circumstances in contravention of <em>Reynolds. </em>Moreover, our independent review cures any error in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion. <em>State v. Noting, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-0hio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 125, citing <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 285} Finally, Johnson contends that the trial court improperly minimized the weight of the mitigating factors. However, \u201c[i]n imposing sentence, the assessment of and weight given to mitigating evidence are matters within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 76. Our independent review cures any error here, as well. <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 67, 706 N.E.2d 1231, citing <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 173, 555 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">{\u00b6 286} We overrule Johnson\u2019s 20th proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">{\u00b6 287} In his 21st proposition, Johnson claims that the cumulative effect of the errors alleged in his brief denied him a fair trial. He fails to support this proposition, however, and we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Constitutionality of Death Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6288} In his 23rd proposition, Johnson challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. This proposition is not well taken. See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus (\u201cWhen issues of law in capital cases have been considered and decided by this court and are raised anew in a subsequent capital case, it is proper to summarily dispose of such issues in the subsequent case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 289} In his 22nd proposition of law, Johnson challenges the appropriateness of his death sentence. Our responsibility is to conduct an independent review, as mandated by R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">A. Aggravating Circumstance</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 290} Although the jury convicted Johnson on both specifications in the indictment, he was sentenced by the trial court only on Count 2 and its one aggravating circumstance: that he committed the murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit the felonies of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated robbery. The evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">B. Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 291} Johnson introduced evidence of a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) that \u201cbecause of a mental disease or defect,\u201d he \u201clacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform [his] conduct to the requirements of the law\u201d when he killed Daniel. He also introduced evidence that he suffers from alcoholism and drug addiction and that he had consumed drugs and alcohol shortly before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 292} Marianna Williamson, a chemical-dependency counselor employed by Guernsey County, testified during the penalty phase that about a month before the murder, Johnson came to her office without an appointment, urgently seeking help for his drug- and alcohol-abuse problems. He reported increased tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, and according to Williamson, \u201che felt something terrible would happen if he didn\u2019t get help[.] * * * [H]e stated [he] may die or go crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">{\u00b6 293} Williamson diagnosed Johnson as dependent on alcohol, marijuana, and crack, and she scheduled Johnson for another appointment. He failed to keep it and could not be reached. Eventually, in August 2003, the county\u2019s chemical-dependency program dropped him for noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">{\u00b6 294} According to the records of Williamson\u2019s agency, Johnson sought help in 1992 and 1999 for chemical-dependency problems. She testified that Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>told her that previously he had been referred to an intensive outpatient program but that he never successfully completed counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 295} Dr. Mark Fettman, a psychiatrist who is board certified in addiction psychiatry, testified that he interviewed Johnson, consulted with the defense psychologist, Dr. Jackson, and reviewed the following: Dr. Jackson\u2019s report; the report of defense mitigation specialist, Marcia Heiden; and records of the Guernsey County Alcohol and Drug Services agency. Dr. Fettman diagnosed Johnson as addicted to crack cocaine and dependent on marijuana and alcohol. Fettman also testified that addiction by itself does not make a person want to commit murder or other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 296} Johnson told Dr. Fettman that between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. on the day of the murder, he consumed two 32-ounce containers of \u201cE &amp; J,\u201d which is \u201csome kind of hard liquor [or] * * * distilled wine.\u201d Johnson also claimed that he consumed $40 worth of crack cocaine and unspecified amounts of powdered cocaine and marijuana. According to Fettman, a person with bipolar disorder \u201cwould probably be experiencing mood swings\u201d if intoxicated with cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol. These would \u201c[a]ffect his view of reality and also * * * his judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 297} Dr. Richard E. Jackson, a clinical psychologist, interviewed Johnson in November 2003 and then again in January 2004, and he administered tests, including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (\u201cMMPI-2\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 298} Dr. Jackson found that Johnson had a bipolar disorder with probable psychotic characteristics and paranoid personality disorder. When in the manic phase of his bipolar disorder, Jackson testified, Johnson suffers from delusions. He also suffers from \u201cvariable reality contact,\u201d which means that \u201cfor very extended lengths of time * * * [Johnson\u2019s] reality awareness can be perfectly adequate.\u201d However, when \u201cstressors\u201d \u2014 especially unexpected ones \u2014 exist, Johnson has an increased likelihood of \u201coutbursts\u201d that are often associated with \u201can alteration of reality contact.\u201d This occurs \u201conly when stressors hit.\u201d \u201c[V]ery shortly thereafter, [Johnson] can be right back to having normal perceptions and interacting in a perfectly appropriate way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 299} In a written report admitted into evidence during the penalty phase, Dr. Jackson explained that he asked Johnson why he had tied Daniel up, and Johnson explained that he had been \u201cnervous [and] scared,\u201d \u201cseeing things and hearing things,\u201d but that \u201cit could of [sic] been shadows, and maybe what [he] was hearing there was a dog in the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">{\u00b6 300} When asked whether Johnson\u2019s mental disorders would deprive him of substantial capacity to conform to the law, Dr. Jackson testified: \u201cI think that whenever an individual is displaying severe mental illness that it is very likely that during a manic state that he would lack the substantial capacity to conform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d However, Dr. Jackson did not testify that Johnson suffered from a manic state at the time of the murder. And he conceded that many who suffer from the same type of problems as Johnson do not commit aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">{\u00b6 301} At trial, Johnson argued that the evidence supported the R.C. 2929.04(B)(2) mitigating factor, that is, that he committed the offense while under \u201cduress, coercion, or strong provocation.\u201d Although the trial court instructed on this mitigating factor, the record reveals no evidence of duress, coercion, or provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 302} The defense also called Bonnie George, a friend of Johnson\u2019s for ten to 13 years, to testify on his behalf. Johnson sometimes stayed at her house, but their relationship did not become romantic. George described Johnson as \u201creal polite\u201d and a \u201cgood guy\u201d who had \u201calways helped [her] out.\u201d She testified that Johnson had held various jobs over the years and that when he stayed with her, he helped by cooking, cleaning, and watching her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 303} George testified that she never saw Johnson take drugs or act violently. Asked about her reaction when hearing of the murder, she stated: \u201c[T]hat wasn\u2019t the Marvin I knew.\u201d However, she testified that, on the night of August 3-4, 2003, Johnson stole $775 from her and her granddaughter while he stayed at George\u2019s home. Johnson \u201chad never done anything like that to [George]\u201d before, and George never expected it. Despite this, George visited Johnson in jail, where they discussed the Bible and prayed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 304} George testified that Johnson sometimes spoke of his family in Alabama. He had a \u201creally close\u201d relationship with one of his sisters, George told the jury, and he had another sister to whom he had been close in his youth. George testified that Johnson did not have a close relationship with the rest of his family and had not visited them since George had known him.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 305} The evidence of mitigation does not outweigh that of aggravation. Voluntary intoxication generally deserves little weight as a mitigating factor. See, e.g., <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 436, 683 N.E.2d 1096; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 51, 765 N.E.2d 334. In addition, while Johnson may have had mood swings due to intoxication on August 15, 2003, there is no evidence in the record that he suffered a manic phase at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 306} Although stress may affect Johnson\u2019s ability to perceive reality, the record does not show that Johnson faced stressors at the time of the murder. Though we acknowledge Williamson\u2019s and Fettman\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of drug-withdrawal symptoms, no evidence shows that Johnson experienced withdrawal at the time of the murder. The lack of evidence regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>stressors has significance because, as Dr. Jackson testified, \u201cIt\u2019s <em>only </em>when stressors hit [that] you\u2019re likely to see outbursts.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHn\">Daniel G. Padden, Guernsey County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b411-15\">Buell &amp; Sipe Co., L.P.A., and Dennis L. Sipe; McGarry Law Office and Kathleen McGarry, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 307} Further, the record does not suggest that Johnson killed Daniel during either an \u201coutburst,\u201d a stress-caused \u201calteration of reality contact,\u201d or any other delusional moment. Rather, the record reveals that Johnson acted deliberately, with premeditation and advance planning. Moreover, the record demonstrates that Johnson wished to hurt Tina, as demonstrated by his statement during trial: \u201cDo you recall times after sex with me * * * that you would, after finished, you would get up and go to the window? * * * You remember that feeling? That\u2019s what it felt like to beat your son in the f* * *ing head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 308} Johnson\u2019s employment record, his history as an abused and neglected child, and his redeeming traits of spirituality, politeness, and helpfulness have little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 309} We conclude that the felony-murder aggravating circumstance in this case outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">C. Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">{\u00b6 310} The death sentence in this case is proportionate to sentences previously approved by this court in aggravated-murder cases with kidnapping, rape, or aggravated-robbery specifications. See, e.g., <em>State v. Twyford </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 368, 763 N.E.2d 122 (kidnapping); <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 306, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (kidnapping); <em>State v.

Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 264-265, 527 N.E.2d 844 (aggravated robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">{\u00b6 311} Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and death sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-13\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\">.
