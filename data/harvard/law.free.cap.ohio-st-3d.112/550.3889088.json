In 2000, we imposed a stayed 18-month suspension on respondent for his violation of DR 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting neglect of an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(2) (requiring a lawyer to carry out a contract of employment), 9-102(A)(2) (requiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>lawyer to maintain client funds in a separate, identifiable bank account), 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records and appropriate accounts), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring prompt payment of the client\u2019s funds or other properties in the lawyer\u2019s possession), as well as Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring lawyers to cooperate with and assist in any disciplinary investigation). <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Griffin </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 307, 737 N.E.2d 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">{\u00b6 2} On April 18, 2005, relator, Cuyahoga County Bar Association, filed a complaint charging respondent with additional professional misconduct. Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in June 2006. The panel then prepared written findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the board adopted, as well as a recommended sanction, which the board modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 3} The panel found that relator failed to present clear and convincing evidence to support the disciplinary violations alleged in Counts I, III, and IV of the complaint, and the panel therefore dismissed those counts under Gov.Bar R. V(6)(H). We now consider the evidence presented in support of the remaining allegations in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 4} Charles Dalton executed a durable power of attorney in November 2002 naming respondent as his attorney in fact. Respondent then signed Dalton\u2019s name to at least 13 checks drawn on Dalton\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">{\u00b6 5} In January 2003, the power of attorney was revoked by Dalton\u2019s sister, who was appointed guardian of Dalton by the Cuyahoga County Probate Court. The guardian\u2019s attorney repeatedly requested an accounting from respondent of the funds that had been disbursed from Dalton\u2019s account, but respondent failed to comply with those requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">{\u00b6 6} The guardian\u2019s attorney then asked the probate court to order respondent to turn over any documents related to Dalton\u2019s care and financial affairs. Respondent failed to appear at a court hearing on the guardian\u2019s motion for an accounting, and he also failed to appear for a deposition after the guardian filed an adversary proceeding alleging that respondent had concealed Dalton\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">{\u00b6 7} In October 2003, the probate court issued a judgment against respondent, finding that he had misused Dalton\u2019s assets and awarding a judgment against respondent in the amount of $5,722, plus interest and costs, including $1,000 for special-process and expert fees. The Clients\u2019 Security Fund paid $5,722 to Dalton\u2019s estate after he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(5) (barring conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 9} Relator recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. The panel recommended that respondent be suspended for two years, with the final 12 months of the suspension stayed on two specified conditions. The board issued the same recommendation but removed one of the conditions for the stayed portion of the suspension. Respondent has filed no objections to the board\u2019s findings or its recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 10} We have reviewed the board\u2019s report and the record, and we find that respondent violated all of the provisions as described above. We conclude, however, that a more severe sanction than the board recommended is warranted for respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">{\u00b6 11} In imposing a sanction for attorney misconduct, we consider the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The aggravating factors in this case include respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary offenses and his initial failure to cooperate with the disciplinary process. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">{\u00b6 12} One mitigating factor identified by the board in this case was respondent\u2019s difficulty in seeing due to the eye disease known as macular degeneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">{\u00b6 13} After weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case, we conclude that respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for two years. The Cuyahoga County Probate Court found that respondent had \u201cconcealed] or convey[ed] away assets\u201d belonging to Charles Dalton. Respondent compounded that misconduct by failing to account for the funds that he withdrew from Dalton\u2019s account and by failing to appear at a court hearing and a deposition related to his misconduct. Whether Dalton was in fact a client of respondent\u2019s or not, respondent certainly had a duty as a member of the bar to cooperate and provide all relevant information when Dalton\u2019s guardian questioned respondent\u2019s expenditure of Dalton\u2019s funds. Respondent\u2019s actions showed a lack of respect for the probate court, for other attorneys, and for the justice system as a whole. In light of the similarity between the misconduct in this case and some of the misconduct committed by respondent in his earlier disciplinary case, we conclude that a full two-year suspension for this latest misconduct is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">{\u00b6 14} We have imposed a similar sanction in other cases. See, e.g., <em>Muskingum Cty. Certified Grievance Commt. v. Greenberger, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 258, 2006-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Ohio-790, 842 N.E.2d 1042 (imposing a two-year suspension, with the final six months stayed, when an attorney who had no history of disciplinary problems failed to appear at a court hearing, neglected several legal matters, placed a client\u2019s funds in his office operating account, and failed to account for a client\u2019s funds); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. France </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 169, 753 N.E.2d 202 (attorney\u2019s mishandling of a client\u2019s trust-fund account warranted a two-year suspension from the practice of law).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Av_\">Ellen S.

Hardiman, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for two years. Respondent is also ordered to reimburse the Clients\u2019 Security Fund within 90 days of the date of this order for the money it paid to the estate of Charles Dalton. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b711-8\">Cupp, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
