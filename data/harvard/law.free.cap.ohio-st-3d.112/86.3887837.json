Washington\u2019s second request to increase his average weekly wage. Upon review, we agree that the issue is res judicata and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 2} Washington was industrially injured on October 21, 1993. Shortly after, his average weekly wage was set by a Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation claims examiner at $96.31. This amount was based on the standard calculation set forth in R.C. 4123.61 \u2014 Washington\u2019s earnings for the year prior to injury divided by 52 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 3} Ten years later, Washington moved to have his average weekly wage reset at $110. His motion was accompanied by Social Security documentation of income for 1992 and 1993 that established slightly higher earnings for the relevant period. A district hearing officer set Washington\u2019s average weekly wage at $107.88, and that order became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 4} In February 2004, Washington again asked to have his average weekly wage increased, this time to $530.24. With this motion, he submitted records of earnings from 1990 to 2002. Washington argued at the hearing that the \u201ctender years\u201d provision of R.C. 4123.62(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> supported the upward adjustment. The district hearing officer, however, held that Washington could have made that argument when he moved for an average weekly wage reset the previous year and hence res judicata barred an adjustment. She wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe injured worker\u2019s average weekly wage was previously adjudicated by District Hearing Officer order dated 06/05/2003 and Staff Hearing Officer order dated 07/10/2003. The injured worker\u2019s counsel did not raise the \u2018tender years\u2019 argument under the provisions of Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.62(A) at those prior adjudications. Injured worker\u2019s counsel indicated that the injured worker\u2019s Social Security Earnings records had not yet been obtained at the time of those adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cWhile the Hearing Officer notes the \u2018tender years\u2019 provision is a generally accepted exception to the doctrine of res judicata for average weekly wage purposes, the circumstances in this situation do not render it an exception for this claim. This claim does not present a situation where average weekly wage was calculated early in [the] claim and the injured worker in subsequent years demonstrated a substantial increase in earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cRather, the average weekly in this claim was formally adjudicated nearly ten years after the date of injury. The \u2018tender years\u2019 allegation should have been included in the previous adjudication. The absence of due diligence in obtaining a complete earnings history nearly <em>ten years </em>after the inception of this claim does not qualify as grounds for subverting the doctrine of res judicata.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 8} That order was administratively affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 9} Washington filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in denying his motion. The court of appeals denied the writ. Acknowledging that res judicata has limited application in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings, the court found that none of the prerequisites that permitted the commission to exercise its continuing jurisdiction existed. In so doing, the court specifically rejected Washington\u2019s claim that the wage evidence submitted with the second motion constituted new and changed circumstances sufficient to reopen the matter. To the contrary, \u201cthe Social Security Administration records of relator\u2019s income offered in support of relator\u2019s 2004 motion to modify his [average weekly wage] could readily have been obtained and presented in his 2003 application. Under the circumstances of this case, the commission was within its discretion to decline to exercise continuing jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Washington v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-18, 2005-Ohio-6470, 2005 WL 3304013, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 11} Res judicata bars \u201cthe relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 9, 10, 16 OBR 361, 475 N.E.2d 782. The doctrine applies to administrative proceedings. <em>Set Products, Inc. v. Bainbridge Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 260, 31 OBR 463, 510 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">{\u00b6 12} Res judicata demands \u201can identity of parties and issues in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Beatrice Foods Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 29, 35, 24 O.O.3d 68, 434 N.E.2d 727. That requisite identity exists here. The issue in the 2003 and 2004 motions was the same: to increase Washington\u2019s average weekly wage. The fact that Washington made a different argument in support of each motion does not change that fact. Washington\u2019s counsel could have raised the \u201ctender years\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>provision at the first hearing, but did not. There was nothing that prevented him from concurrently raising challenges based on both R.C. 4123.61 and 4123.62(A).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b247-11\">M. Blake Stone, L.P.A., Inc., and M.

B.O.C. Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 199, 569 N.E.2d 496. The commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to reopen a matter, however, is not unlimited. It hinges on the existence of one of five prerequisites: (1) new and changed circumstances, (2) fraud, (3) clear mistake of fact, (4) clear mistake of law, or (5) error by an inferior tribunal. <em>State ex rel. Nicholls v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 454, 459, 692 N.E.2d 188. Washington maintains that the wage information submitted with his second motion to recalculate the average weekly wage constituted new and changed circumstances. That argument did not persuade the commission or the court of appeals, and it remains unconvincing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 14} The court of appeals, in agreeing with the commission and its reasoning, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[T]he evidence presented to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the commission must be of new and changed circumstances, not merely newly acquired evidence. \u2018[W]e agree with the appellate court\u2019s observation that while the evidence * * * was newly acquired, such is not evidence that \u201cconditions have changed subsequent to the initial award.\u201d \u2019 <em>State ex rel. Keith v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 139, at 141-142 [580 N.E.2d 433].</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIn this case, the Social Security Administration records of relator\u2019s income offered in support of relator\u2019s 2004 motion to modify his [average weekly wage] could readily have been obtained and presented in his 2003 application. Under the circumstances of this case, the commission was within its discretion to decline to exercise continuing jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Washington, </em>2005-Ohio-6470, 2005 WL 3304013, at \u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 17} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\">. R.C. 4123.62(A) states: \u201cIf it is established that an injured or disabled employee was of such age and experience when injured or disabled as that under natural conditions an injured or disabled employee\u2019s wages would be expected to increase, the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation may consider that fact in arriving at an injured or disabled employee\u2019s average weekly wage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
