XVIII(6), we accepted three questions of state law certified by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 2} 1. \u201cWhether the demand by Pilkington North America for defense and indemnification, as asserted in this case, constitutes a chose in action, as that term is defined under Ohio law?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 3} 2. \u201cWhether the policies\u2019 \u2018anti-assignment\u2019 clauses bar acquisition by Pilkington North America of such chose in action?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">{\u00b6 4} 3. \u201cWhether by operation of law insurance benefits for transferred liabilities were conveyed, along with those liabilities, so that Pilkington North America may, notwithstanding the anti-assignment clauses, pursue insurance under the original LOF Glass\u2019s policies for the environmental liabilities at issue here, which arise out of the original LOF Glass\u2019s operations.\u201d 105 Ohio St.3d 1514, 2005-Ohio-1880, 826 N.E.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">{\u00b6 5} We answer the first question as follows: A chose in action arises under an occurrence-based insurance policy at the time the loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">{\u00b6 6} As to the second question, we answer that such a chose in action is transferable despite the existence of an anti-assignment provision contained in the policy as to the duty to indemnify. We are unable to answer definitively whether such a chose in action is transferable as to the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">{\u00b6 7} As to the third question, we answer that when a covered occurrence under an insurance policy occurs before liability is transferred to a successor corporation, coverage does not arise by operation of law when the liability was assumed by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">{\u00b6 8} The district court provides the following statement of facts, upon which we rely. The underlying suit is by a glass manufacturer (petitioner, Pilkington North America, Inc.), against various insurance companies that issued liability policies to Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company (\u201cLOF Glass\u201d) of Toledo. Pilkington purchased LOF Glass\u2019s glass-manufacturing business in 1986. Pilkington has subsequently become the target of environmental claims arising from LOF Glass\u2019s manufacturing operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>(\u00b6 9} Pilkington filed suit against the insurers, claiming that under the policies issued to LOF Glass, the defendants owe Pilkington duties of defense and indemnity for the underlying environmental losses and actions. It is undisputed that the defendant insurance companies issued liability policies to LOF Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">A. Corporate History</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 10} The underlying controversy involves the effect of the corporate history of LOF Glass on the insurers\u2019 responsibilities in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 11} In 1968, LOF Glass changed its name to Libbey-Owens-Ford Company to reflect its expansion into other activities not related to glass. In February 1986, Libbey-Owens-Ford Company, through a transfer and assumption agreement, placed the assets and liabilities of its glass-manufacturing division into a new, wholly owned corporate subsidiary, LOF Glass, Inc. Then in March 1986, Libbey-Owens-Ford Company entered into a share-exchange agreement with Pilkington Brothers P.L.C, a British glass manufacturer, and one of its subsidiaries, Pilkington Holdings, Inc. As a result, shares of the newly formed LOF Glass, Inc. became owned by these Pilkington entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 12} LOF Glass, Inc. manufactured glass under the name of Libbey-OwensFord Company from 1986 until July 2000, when it was renamed Pilkington North , America. The glass operations are ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">{\u00b6 13} Libbey-Owens-Ford Company, after selling the glass-manufacturing operations in 1986, remained in other lines of business and has since undergone several name changes. It has been known as Trinova Corporation and most recently as Aeroquip-Vickers, Inc. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Eaton Corporation. There has been no connection to the glass business since 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 14} Through the 1986 transfer and assumption agreement, Pilkington has obtained both the glass business and the environmental liabilities arising from the business, including those liabilities arising from conduct by the original LOF Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">B. Insurance Policy Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">{\u00b6 15} All parties agree that the insurance policies under which Pilkington is seeking coverage were not transferred to Pilkington and that Aeroquip-Vickers, Inc. is the current owner of these policies. As previously stated, the only present issue is Pilkington\u2019s claims to defense and indemnification for environmental liabilities arising from the glass operations of the original LOF Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">{\u00b6 16} Pilkington argues that such coverage arises under two theories of law. It first argues that it acquired a chose in action with regard to the losses as a result of the 1986 transfer and assumption agreement. Second, it contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>when it purchased the glass business of the original LOF Glass, the rights to defense and indemnity under the policies followed by operation of law for environmental liabilities arising from the prior operation of that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 17} The respondent insurers contend that the 1986 transfer and assumption agreement transferred no interest under the policy to Pilkington because of anti-assignment clauses in the policies in question. They also generally dispute the legal contention that coverage follows a successor legal entity as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Analysis as to Question One</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 18} The first question certified to us is whether Pilkington\u2019s demand for defense and indemnification constitutes a \u201cchose in action\u201d under Ohio law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 19} Generally speaking, a \u201cchose in action\u201d is a \u201cproprietary right in personam, such as a debt owed by another person, a share in a joint-stock company, or a claim for damages in tort.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 258. The term can also be defined as \u201c[t]he right to bring an action to recover a debt, money, or thing.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">{\u00b6 20} This court has recognized that the phrase applies to the right to bring an action in tort and in contract. In <em>Cincinnati v. Hafer </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 60, 65, 30 N.E. 197, we stated: \u201c[W]hile * * * a \u2018chose in action\u2019 is ordinarily understood [to be] a right of action for money arising under contract, the term is undoubtedly of much broader significance, and includes the right to recover pecuniary damages for a wrong inflicted either upon the person or property. It embraces demands arising out of a tort, as well as causes of action originating in the breach of a contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">{\u00b6 21} This court has never addressed the question of when a chose in action becomes an enforceable right. In the insurance context, the Sixth District Court of Appeals most recently addressed the issue in <em>In re Estate of Ray, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-02-049, 2003-Ohio-2001, 2003 WL 1904412. In <em>Ray, </em>the court characterized a decedent\u2019s claim against his insurer for insurance proceeds as a \u201cchose in action\u201d that arose when the damage occurred and that was still enforceable after the decedent\u2019s death. The Sixth District further noted that \u201c[a] chose in action is personalty which, unlike real property, passes on death to the holder\u2019s executor.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13 (citing <em>In re Wreede </em>(1958), 106 Ohio App. 324, 331-332, 7 O.O.2d 75, 154 N.E.2d 756). Accordingly, the Sixth District held that a casualty insurance claim arising from damage to the decedent\u2019s real estate was a chose in action that arises when the covered loss occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The insurers in this ease contend that the analysis of the California Supreme Court in <em>Henkel Corp. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>(2003), 29 Cal.4th 934, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69, should apply. In <em>Henkel, </em>the court, applying California precedent under circumstances nearly identical to those present in the instant matter, determined that no chose in action existed at the time of transfer because the claims for defense and indemnity \u201chad not been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due under the policy\u201d and because the insurers \u201chad not breached any duty to defend or indemnify\u201d the named insured, which in this case is the original LOF Glass. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">{\u00b6 23} We have \u201clong held that an insurance policy is a <em>contract </em>between the insurer and the insured.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Ohayon v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 474, 478, 747 N.E.2d 206. In fact, the \u201clong-standing principle\u201d has been that \u201cthe relationship between the insurer and the insured is purely contractual in nature.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marsh </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 15 OBR 261, 472 N.E.2d 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 24} The insurance policies in the instant case are \u201coccurrence\u201d policies, i.e., they provide coverage for claims resulting from injury or damage that is based upon an occurrence during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is made. <em>Mominee v. Scherbarth </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 270, 299, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717, fn. 24; <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 512, 2002-Ohio-2842, 769 N.E.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 25} The distinction between <em>Ray </em>and <em>Henkel </em>is that under <em>Ray, </em>the chose arises at the time of the loss, whereas in <em>Henkel, </em>the chose arises when the claim has been reduced to a sum of money owed. Our precedent has consistently recognized that the insurer\u2019s coverage obligation in an occurrence policy arises at the time of the occurrence. <em>Goodyear Tire, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 26} Indeed, the United States Supreme Court applied the same principles to a chose in action in <em>Cent. Tablet Mfg. Co. v. United States </em>(1974), 417 U.S. 673, 685, 94 S.Ct. 2516, 41 L.Ed.2d 398:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cWith a fire loss, the obligation to pay arises upon the fire. Unlike an executory contract to sell, the casualty cannot be rescinded. Details, including even the basic question of liability, may be contested, but the fundamental contractual obligation that precipitates the transformation from tangible property into a chose in action consisting of a claim for insurance proceeds is fixed by the fire.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 28} We adopt the same principle and hold that a chose in action arises under an occurrence-based insurance policy at the time of the covered loss. The distinction created in <em>Henkel </em>does not align with the obligations recognized in Ohio that the insured\u2019s right to recover arises automatically at the time of loss. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The lack of a specifically defined amount of recovery is not fatal to the determination that a chose exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Analysis as to Question Two</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 29} The recognition of a chose in action in the present case does not by itself mean that Pilkington is entitled to coverage under these insurance policies. A chose in action is merely a term (albeit a somewhat vague one) for the right established at the time of the loss. See 9 Corbin on Contracts (1979) 369, Section 859 (discussing why the author refuses to use the phrase \u201cchose in action\u201d \u201cwherever clear analysis is necessary,\u201d as the phrase simply means a right against another person). The right still must have been properly transferred, and the claim must not be barred under any of the terms of the insurance policies issued to the original LOF Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 30} We now address the second certified question: Whether the anti-assignment provisions in the insurance policies apply. All of the policies contain language prohibiting the assignment of any interest under the policy without the insurers\u2019 consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 31} The insurers contend that this prohibition contractually eliminates any possibility of a chose in action being passed to Pilkington. On its face, this would appear to be a correct statement of the law in Ohio. As discussed above, an insurance policy is a contract between an insured and the insurer. <em>Ohayon, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 478, 747 N.E.2d 206. We should not disturb the plain language of such a contract when the intent of the parties is evident. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 32} The policies proscribe an assignment of an \u201cinterest\u201d in the policy without the insurers\u2019 consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pilkington contends that the anti-assignment provisions do not apply to assignments after the loss has already occurred. The insurers contend that as an express contractual prohibition, the anti-assignment provisions should preclude any obligation under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 33} Pilkington is seeking to invoke two duties contained in each of the policies: the duty of indemnification and the duty to defend. Each duty is separate and distinct under a liability policy. 14 Russ <em>&amp; </em>Segalla, Couch on Insurance (3d Ed.2005), Section 200:3. The duty to defend is based on the allegations presented. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, paragraph one of the syllabus. The duty to indemnify arises from the conclusive facts and resulting judgment. 16 Couch on Insurance, Section 227:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Under an occurrence policy, an insurer is obligated to defend any claim arising out of wrongful conduct occurring during the coverage period. <em>Mominee, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 299, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717, fn. 24; 1 Leitner, Simpson and Bjorkman, Law and Practice of Insurance Coverage Litigation (2000) 4-13, Section 4.5. The duty to defend can be the most important coverage of a commercial general liability policy and comprises an increasingly significant part of the insurer\u2019s exposure. Hagglund, Weimer, Whitman &amp; Hillestad, CGL Policy Handbook (2001), Sections 13.04 and 13.05; see, also, <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 21-22, 540 N.E.2d 266 (holding that the duty to defend represents a \u201csubstantial right\u201d to both the insurer and the insured). In situations involving complex litigation, the cost of defense can often exceed the cost of indemnity. Rhodes, The Law of Commercial Insurance (1996), Section 1.3.2; <em>Sherwood v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>(1997), 347 Md. 32, 43, 698 A.2d 1078 (\u201cNot infrequently, that expense [for defense] may approximate or even exceed the amount of any judgment rendered in the action\u201d). The duty to defend gives the insurer the right to control the conduct of the litigation in order to safeguard its interests. 1 Leitner et al., Law and Practice of Insurance Coverage Litigation, Section 4.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 35} The duty of defense is much broader than the duty of indemnification and can be invoked even though no liability is ultimately established. 14 Couch, Section 200:3. In <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Trainor </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 41, 62 O.O.2d 402, 294 N.E.2d 874, this court held that under a liability insurance policy, it is the scope of the allegations against the insured that determines whether an insurance company has a duty to defend the insured. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. We held that \u201cwhere the complaint brings the action within the coverage of the policy the insurer is required to make defense, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the action or its liability to the insured.\u201d Id. The <em>Motorists </em>holding was expanded in <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 177, 179, 9 OBR 463, 459 N.E.2d 555, in which we stated that \u201cthe duty to defend need not arise solely from the allegations in the complaint but may arise at a point subsequent to the filing of the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 36} It is long-standing tradition in the common law that all contract rights may be assigned except under three conditions. 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981), Section 317(2). First, if there is clear contractual language prohibiting assignment, an assignment will not be enforced. Id., Section 317(2)(c); 29 Lord, Williston on Contracts (4th Ed.2003), Section 74:10; <em>Hybud Equip. Corp., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096 (holding that contracts will be enforced according to their terms); <em>Mettler-Toledo, Inc. v. Republic Powdered Metals, Inc. </em>(May 29, 1996), 9th Dist. No. 2500-M, 1996 WL 285368 (holding that assignment of a warranty contrary to contractual prohibitions was void). Second, an assignment must not materially change the duty of the obligor, materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>increase the insurer\u2019s burden or risk under the contract, materially impair the insurer\u2019s chance of securing a return on performance, or materially reduce the contract\u2019s value. 3 Restatement 2d, Contracts, Section 317(2)(a); 29 Williston on Contracts, Section 74:10. See, also, <em>Kitt v. Home Indemn. Co. </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 505, 509, 41 O.O. 511, 92 N.E.2d 685 (holding that an insurer may not avoid liability when a change in partners of an insured partnership did not increase the underlying risk); <em>Schofield v. Benton </em>(Aug. 20, 1992), 10th Dist. No. 92AP-161, 1992 WL 208924 (adopting the Restatement language). Third, the assignment will not be valid if it is forbidden by statute or by public policy. 3 Restatement of Contracts, Section 317(2)(b); <em>Robbins v. Hennessey </em>(1912), 86 Ohio St. 181, 99 N.E. 319 (discussing statutory prohibition of assignment of a contract for payment of funeral expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 37} In the insurance policies at issue, there is a contractual provision prohibiting the assignment of any interest under the policy. The anti-assignment provision has an important role in an insurance policy, as noted by the Ninth Circuit in <em>N. Ins. Co. of New York v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.9, 1992), 955 F.2d 1353:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cRisk characteristics of the insured determine whether the insurer will provide coverage, and at what rate. An assignment could alter drastically the insurer\u2019s exposure depending on the nature of the new insured. \u2018No assignment\u2019 clauses protect against any such unforeseen increase in risk.\u201d Id. at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 39} Any assignment of the rights after the losses would be, on its face, in direct contravention of this provision. It would seem that the analysis should end at this point under the plain-language approach of <em>Hybud Equip. Corp., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 40} Insurance contracts receive unique treatment post-loss, however. Insurance policies are generally construed such that assignment of an interest is valid <em>after </em>the occurrence of the loss insured against, and the assignment is then regarded as a transfer of the chose in action, even in the face of an anti-assignment provision. 2 Couch, Sections 34:2 and 34:25; 17 Williston on Contracts, Section 49:126; <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1975), 25 Ariz.App. 309, 311, 543 P.2d 147; <em>Fiorentino v. Lightning Rod Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 188, 192, 682 N.E.2d 1099 (holding that an insured under a commercial general liability policy may assign its claim under the policy to the injured party without contravening the anti-assignment provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 41} Only a few cases addressing the issue have involved an assignment of rights under a commercial general liability policy. See <em>Fiorentino, </em>supra. The issue of permitting assignment after loss in avoidance of the anti-assignment clause is an easier concept when dealing with life insurance or casualty insurance. The insured loss has already occurred, is clearly defined, and the insurer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>liability is fixed and established. Contrast this with a loss under a commercial general liability policy, especially under the facts of the instant case, where the loss may be over a period of indeterminate length and of an indeterminate magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 42} Much of the case law involving an anti-assignment clause in a commercial general liability policy is not on point. Almost all of these cases involve the active assignment of rights from the insured to a third party, usually the injured party. <em>Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Klickitat Cty. v. Internatl. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 124 Wash.2d 789, 881 P.2d 1020; <em>Elat, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(1995), 280 NJ.Super. 62, 66, 654 A.2d 503. Few cases involve the transfer of a chose in action to a successor corporate entity solely by virtue of the succession. Most involve some form of de facto merger or other circumstance in which the original corporation is no longer in existence. <em>Gopher Oil Co. v. Am. Hardware Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Minn.App.1999), 588 N.W.2d 756 (purchase by successor that subsumed predecessor); <em>Westoil Terminals Co. v. Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 73 Cal.App.4th 634, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 636 (de facto merger).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 43} As mentioned above, the commercial general liability policies Pilkington is seeking coverage under contain two contractual obligations: the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend. The duty to indemnify implicates both property damage and bodily injury. The losses are fixed at the time of the occurrence. We see no reason to deviate from the standard rule on this issue, and thus we hold that the chose in action as to the duty to indemnify is unaffected by the anti-assignment provision when the covered loss has already occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Analysis as to Question Three</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b6 44} Pilkington also argues that because the policies were transferred by operation of law, the anti-assignment provisions should not be enforced. There is again limited authority as to whether insurance coverage follows liability in cases involving anti-assignment clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">{\u00b6 45} The primary case cited for the proposition that insurance coverage for presale activities follows an asset purchaser by operation of law is <em>N. Ins., </em>955 F.2d 1353. In <em>N. Ins., </em>the Ninth Circuit held that an asset purchase transferred the duty to defend from the named insured to the purchaser as a matter of law when the liability giving rise to the policy claim arose before the purchase, even when the policy contained an anti-assignment clause. Id. at 1357-1358. In <em>N. Ins., </em>much of the decision was driven by the fact that liability for presale activities was itself imposed by law on the purchaser. Further, although this point was not explicitly discussed, the successor entity, as the sole party liable, is the only party capable of demanding a defense under the policies in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 46} <em>Henkel </em>declined to extend <em>N. Ins. </em>to circumstances in which the liabilities are voluntarily assumed by the asset purchaser by contract instead of imposed by operation of law. 29 Cal.4th at 941, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69. It highlighted the three circumstances under which a buyer of corporate assets may be liable by operation of law for the torts of its predecessor under California law and under which insurance coverage would follow by operation of law. Id. at 941-942, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69. Because the liability for which coverage was sought was contractually conveyed to the successor, and the insurance policy had an anti-assignment provision, the <em>Henkel </em>court held that coverage did not follow by operation of law. Further, the court noted that any attempt to transfer coverage to a successor must fail when the original insured still exists or can be revived to demand a defense \u2014 a distinction not addressed in <em>N. Ins. Henkel, </em>29 Cal.4th at 945, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 47} <em>N. Ins. </em>relied on the fact that California and Washington apply the rule of product-line successor liability. Under this theory, \u201ca purchaser of substantially all assets of a firm assumes, with some limitations, the obligation for product liability claims arising from the selling firm\u2019s presale activities. Liability is transferred irrespective of any clauses to the contrary in the asset purchase agreement.\u201d <em>N. Ins., </em>955 F.2d at 1357. The rationale for transferring insurance coverage for indemnification and defense by operation of law in such an instance is sound, since an unwary purchaser may be liable for significant bodily injury or property damage occurring before the sale, solely as a result of the purchase. The result also serves to ensure that the injured party receives recompense.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 48} Ohio does not follow the California product-line successor liability theory. Ohio has adopted the general rule of successor liability, which provides that the purchaser of a corporation\u2019s assets is not liable for the debts and obligations, including liability for tortious conduct, of the seller corporation. <em>Flaugher v. Cone Automatic Mach. Co. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 60, 30 OBR 165, 507 N.E.2d 331; <em>Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(C.A.1, 1974), 501 F.2d 1145, 1152; 15 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations (1999), Section 7122. There are four exceptions to this general rule, three of which impose liability without regard to contract. A successor corporation may be held liable when:</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(1) the buyer expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such liability;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(2) the transaction amounts to a <em>defacto </em>consolidation or merger;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(3) the buyer corporation is merely a continuation of the seller corporation; or</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(4) the transaction is entered into fraudulently for the purpose of escaping liability.\u201d <em>Flaugher, </em>30 Ohio St.3d at 62, 30 OBR 165, 507 N.E.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>{\u00b6 53} Additionally, some statutes, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Section 9601 et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code) have been construed as imposing liability on successor corporations without regard to contract. <em>SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co. </em>(C.A.3, 1996), 89 F.3d 154, 157; <em>Anspec Co., Inc. v. Johnson Controls, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 922 F.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 54} None of those instances in which liability is imposed without regard to contract are alleged to be present. Thus, liability is not being imposed on Pilkington by operation of law, and we do not reach the question as to whether coverage follows by operation of law in such a circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 55} Some courts have expanded <em>N. Ins. </em>to include successor-liability cases not based on the product-line theory. See, e.g., <em>Glidden Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 81782, 2004-Ohio-6922, 2004 WL 2931019, \u00b6 64. See, also, <em>B.S.B. Diversified Co., Inc. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co. </em>(W.D.Wash.1996), 947 F.Supp. 1476, 1481-1482; <em>Total Waste Mgt. Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>(D.N.H.1994), 857 F.Supp. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 56} There are a number of courts, in addition to <em>Henkel, </em>that have taken a different approach, holding that the contractual obligation defines the relationship between the parties when the liability arises as a matter of contract. <em>Red Arrow Prods. Co., Inc. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau </em>(App.2000), 233 Wis.2d 114, 132-134, 607 N.W.2d 294; <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Alameda Cty. Super. Court </em>(1997), 55 CaLApp. 4th 1444, 1454-1455, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 781; <em>Quemetco, Inc. v. Pacific Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 24 Cal.App.4th 494, 500-503, 29 Cal.Rptr.2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 57} The courts expanding the <em>N. Ins. </em>holding to cases in which the underlying liability is contractually assumed and does not arise as a matter of law do so under the simple rationale that coverage should follow liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">{\u00b6 58} This rationale is generally incorrect for cases in which liability is contractually assumed for the following reasons. First, as discussed, insurance is a contract between the insurer and the insured. <em>Ohayon, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 478, 747 N.E.2d 206. The parties specifically contract to control liability. Allowing indemnity to follow liability as a matter of law interferes with that control. If the parties fail to explicitly describe their rights under an insurance contract, they may have had their reasons, and requiring that coverage follow as a matter of law interferes in the contractual process.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">{\u00b6 59} A commercial general liability policy can cover a business that maintains several plants or several different lines of business. When selling one of those plants, or one of those lines of business, a contractual agreement to assign liability but not the underlying chose in action may be designed to preserve rights under the policy for the original insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>{\u00b6 60} Further, if coverage were to arise by operation of law and the original insured remains in operation, the limits of its coverage available under the policy may be reduced by any indemnity payments made on behalf of the additional insured. Additionally, and as discussed above, in certain cases, the insurer may be placed in the position of defending an additional insured where there was only one under the policy. The results of such complications are numerous under an \u201coperation of law\u201d theory that gives no consideration to whether the liabilities were assumed by contract or forced upon the successor by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 61} We therefore hold that when a covered occurrence under an insurance policy occurs before liability is transferred to a successor corporation, coverage does not arise by operation of law when the liability was assumed by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">So answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">As to Question One as answered:</p>\n<judges id=\"b651-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b651-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">As to Question Two, to the extent answered:</p>\n<judges id=\"b651-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b651-12\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., decline to answer Question Two.</judges>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">As to Question Three as answered:</p>\n<judges id=\"b651-14\">Moyer, C.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b651-15\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the answer.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ACb\">Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">Separate views of Moyer, C J., and O\u2019Connor, J., as to Question Two:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">{\u00b6 62} The duty to defend requires a different analysis. The second prohibition on assignment of contractual rights forbids assignment when there would be a material change in the duty of the obligor or a material increase of the burden or risk imposed on the obligor. Both of these possibilities are implicated in this case by the assignment of the duty of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">{\u00b6 63} The duty of defense is a more personal and individual right in the case of an assignment. There can be only one recovery for property damage or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>personal injury, but when, as here, another insured (Aeroquip-Vickers) has maintained the coverage once held by the original LOF Glass, while Pilkington is making a claim as an <em>additional </em>insured, there are now multiple potential parties to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">{\u00b6 64} In a commercial general liability situation, with an assignment of rights notwithstanding an anti-assignment clause, transfer of the right to demand a defense may constitute a material change in the duties of the insurer, who could be obligated to defend multiple parties. It may also constitute a material increase in the insurer\u2019s obligations, as the cost of defense in such a circumstance would now almost certainly be higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 65} This was precisely the concern in <em>Henkel:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cIf both assignor and assignee were to claim the right to defense, the insurer might effectively be forced to undertake the burden of defending both parties. In view of the potential for such increased burdens, it is reasonable to uphold the insurer\u2019s contractual assignment right to accept or reject an assignment.\u201d 29 Cal.4th at 945, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 67} There are, of course, other considerations. In <em>N. Ins. Co. of New York v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.9, 1992), 955 F.2d 1353, which involved the question of whether coverage followed liability by operation of law, the insurers contended that they had no duty to defend because of a substitution of one defendant for another. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that it was the \u201cnature of the risk,\u201d rather than the characteristics of the individual defendant, that mattered. Id. at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 68} The language of the preceding paragraphs is couched in potentials and possibilities, but so, ultimately, is the business of insurance. The insurer accepts the risk of providing coverage based on the representations made by the insured. Rhodes, The Law of Commercial Insurance (1996), 383, Section III.4.1. The insurance policy, by its terms, contemplates defending only the named insured. Being obligated to defend parties other than the named insured may materially increase that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 69} We note that this increased risk might not occur when the original insured corporation is no longer in existence and is incapable of being sued or of demanding a defense under the original commercial general liability policy. In such a circumstance, the insurer has incurred no increase in obligation, and the rationale for this rule falls away.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">{\u00b6 70} We therefore believe that, after the loss has occurred, an anti-assignment clause in an insurance policy does apply to a claim for defense when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>assignment places upon the insurer a materially changed duty or a materially increased risk.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\">. The court acknowledges with appreciation the briefs provided by amici curiae, United Policyholders and the Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\">. Although the language used may vary among the policies, any variance is insufficient to alter the analysis here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b653-4\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 71} A majority of this court today agrees that an insurance policy\u2019s indemnification coverage can be transferred post-loss regardless of any anti-assignment clause in the policy. There is a division within that majority as to whether coverage for the costs of a defense may also be so transferred. I would hold that coverage for the cost of a defense, as part of the chose in action, is always freely transferable post-loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 72} The majority\u2019s determination that a chose in action (including the rights to indemnity and defense) arises at the time of a covered loss is decisive. As Justice O\u2019Connor writes in her response to Question 2, \u201cinsurance policies are generally construed such that assignment of an interest is valid <em>after </em>the occurrence of the loss insured against, and the assignment is then regarded as a transfer of the chose in action, even in the face of an anti-assignment provision.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Once a loss has occurred that triggers rights under the policy, what is being transferred is not an interest in the policy, but rather something different, a chose in action. 2 Russ and Segalla, Couch on Insurance (3d Ed.2005), Section 34.25. A chose in action is a freely alienable property interest; thus, what is being transferred is an existing, intangible property right, not an interest in the policy. The policyholder is essentially transferring a cause of action based upon the policy rather than an interest in the policy. \u201c[Assignment before loss involves a transfer of a contractual relationship while the assignment after loss is the transfer of a right to a money claim.\u201d Id., Section 35:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 73} Since the predecessor here possessed a chose in action, the anti-assignment provisions of the policy are inapplicable. To a great extent, our answers to the questions posed in this case depend on how much we rely on the decision in <em>Henkel Corp. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>(2003), 29 Cal.4th 934, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69. In <em>Henkel, </em>the California Supreme Court determined that <em>no chose in action existed at the time of the transfer </em>because in that case the claims for defense and indemnity \u201chad not been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due under the policy\u201d and because the insurers \u201chad not breached any duty to defend or indemnify\u201d the named insured. Id. at 944, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69. That holding of no chose in action was elemental in the court\u2019s determination that the rights to indemnity and defense were not transferable. The court held that since those rights were <em>not </em>choses in action, they could not be assigned without the insurer\u2019s consent. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>{\u00b6 74} Here, this court correctly breaks with <em>Henkel </em>on the chose-in-action issue, holding that the rights to indemnity and defense are choses in action. That finding obviates the need for a consideration of the effect of the anti-assignment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 75} The negation of the anti-assignment clause does not produce an unjust result for the insurer. The idea that an insurer would have to defend both the transferor and the transferee for the same risk is not sound. If the right to a defense has been transferred to a successor, the transferor no longer has that right. The right cannot both be transferred and retained. If some other party asserts a right to a defense, the matter can be resolved through a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 76} That the successor entity was not a party to the original policy is a phantom problem. Even in the case of a company that has undergone no restructuring, the entity that avails itself of the policy could be much different from the one that purchased the policy. Personnel, management teams, and corporate focus can change in any company. In any case, the focus of the claim will be on the company as it was at the time of the triggering occurrence. As the court wrote in <em>N. Ins. Co. of New York v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.9, 1992), 955 F.2d 1353, 1358:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cThe nature of the risk, rather than the particular characteristics of the defendant, will have the greater effect on defense costs. The extent and character of the defense will turn on the nature of the product itself and the attributes of the firm that manufactured the product. Aspects of the successor firm could affect the defense, but the shape of the defense will be determined largely by the characteristics of the risk originally insured. Admittedly, defense costs could balloon if the successor firm failed to cooperate in the defense. Inasmuch as the successor firm was not a party to the original policy, the risk of noncooperation arguably increases. Yet, the insurer is protected against this risk because it is freed of the defense obligation if the successor firm does not fulfill its duty to aid in the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 78} Requiring courts to determine whether the transfer \u201cplaces upon the insurer a materially changed duty or a materially increased risk\u201d would protect insurers against a hypothetical problem and would impose an impractical and speculative test. Whether and how an insurer may be harmed is entirely more complex than the question the court should be considering in a fight over coverage: whether and to what extent the coverage was transferred. How will a court determine whether a risk is material or not? Will the court undergo the analysis even when no other potential insureds are seeking coverage? Is the relevant inquiry what the potential other insureds <em>might </em>do? Would a ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>percent increase in risk be considered material? Twenty-five percent? If there is an increase in risk, should the result be that no defense is provided at all?</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">{\u00b6 79} The better approach is for a court to determine what was transferred when the chose in action was transferred. If the transfer itself somehow causes an increased risk for the insurer \u2014 if the risk is more than was bargained for between the insurer and the original insured \u2014 then the insurer should not be responsible for that increased risk. However, it should remain liable for what it did bargain for \u2014 the full extent of the coverage that would have applied to the original insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 80} Separating indemnification from defense costs within the chose in action is inconsistent. Both aspects of the coverage are a part of the transferred chose in action. Further, practical injustices result from such an approach. If indemnification coverage is freely transferable, but the costs of defense are not, any defense provided by the successor ultimately inures to the benefit of the insurer. Not only would the insurer not provide a defense, it would benefit from the defense the successor provides for itself. On the other hand, from the insurer\u2019s perspective, even though the insurer remains liable for a large judgment through indemnity, it is powerless to direct the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 81} Ultimately, the most damaging aspect of this court\u2019s failure to find an absolute right to the transferability of a chose in action is its effect on economic activity. The continuity of liability coverage is especially important in manufacturing. Ohio is a manufacturing state, ranking second among the 50 states in total manufacturing jobs. As of 2004, over 780,000 Ohioans held jobs in manufacturing. U.S. Census Bureau, 2004 Annual Survey of Manufactures, Geographic Area Statistics, Statistics for All Manufacturing by State, available at http://factfinder.census.gov/servIet/IBQTable?_bm=y&amp;-_bm=y&amp;-ds_name= AM0431AS101. We still make things here; Ohioans do not spend their work hours selling insurance to each other. The manufacturing process can be dirty and dangerous, and our society\u2019s willingness to accept the negative by-products of the manufacturing process changes over time. A manufacturer must realize that the accepted practices it is engaged in today may become the basis of tort recovery or government-imposed cleanup later. An insurer also signs on for that. And the insurer\u2019s role in providing coverage for former wrongs is a very important one for long-term economic activity. The predictability of liability coverage is essential for businesses to move forward. The rule of post-loss assignment has played an important role in our economy:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 82} \u201c[A] major rationale for commercial insurance is to facilitate economic activity and growth by providing risk management protection for economic actors. * * * In the modern American economy, mergers, acquisitions, and sales are part of corporate life. For the most part, economists approve of this activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>because it allows the marketplace to allocate resources to their most profitable uses. To the extent that insurance protection (for past but possibly unknown losses) may be more freely assigned as part of corporate recombinations, this lowers transaction costs and facilitates economic activity and wealth enhancement. Consequently, the general rule permitting post-loss assignment is a good rule \u2014 -which is why the courts have crafted it over the years even though it appears to contradict the clear text of many insurance policies and the courts\u2019 expressed fidelity to contract language. The post-loss exception to the general rule of restricted insurance assignability is a venerable rule borne [sic] of experience and practicality.\u201d 1 Stempel, Law of Insurance Contract Disputes (2d Ed., 1999 Supp.2004), Section 3.15[d].</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">{\u00b6 83} We should not replace a \u201cvenerable rule\u201d born of \u201cexperience and practicality\u201d with a new rule born of speculation and impracticality. Ohio law should allow post-loss assignment of insurance benefits for both indemnity and defense costs. The right to a defense under an insurance policy is a crucial right, and this court\u2019s decision \u2014 or indecision \u2014 puts that right in doubt in countless cases where corporations have restructured, reorganized, or sold assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 84} As for Question 3: In this case, there was a valid, direct assignment of assets and liabilities to the successor entity. But corporate succession is often more labyrinthal or fractured. The third question posed herein asks whether the assignment of insurance benefits follows by operation of law whenever liabilities are transferred between entities. I would hold that \u201ca corporation which succeeds to liability for pre-acquisition operations of another entity acquires rights of coverage by operation of law.\u201d <em>Glidden Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81782, 2004-Ohio-6922, 2004 WL 2931019, \u00b6 64. My reasoning for that holding is more fully set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Glidden Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 470, 2006-Ohio-6553, 861 N.E.2d 109, 2006 WL 3743025.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b656-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-1\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 85} Because I disagree fundamentally with the lead opinion\u2019s analysis as to the first certified question, I respectfully dissent and would answer that question as follows: Pilkington\u2019s demand for defense and indemnification is not a chose in action.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 86} After accepting the characterization of Pilkington\u2019s demands for defense and indemnity as a \u201cchose in action\u201d and holding that the chose arises at the time of the \u201ccovered loss,\u201d the lead opinion holds that a nonparty to an insurance contract may avoid an anti-assignment clause and be indemnified and potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>defended under the policy. Such holdings that extend insurance coverage contrary to the contracting parties\u2019 express consent erode the freedom of contract and may have significant consequences for insurers and insureds alike. I would hold that a policyholder\u2019s right to defense and indemnity under a third-party liability insurance policy is not, by itself, a chose in action that may be transferred without insurer consent despite an anti-assignment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">{\u00b6 87} This is not a case of insurers who obtain a windfall through insurance forfeiture. No one disputes that Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company (\u201cLOF\u201d), now known as Aeroquip Vickers, Inc. (\u201cAeroquip\u201d) currently owns the general liability policies covering LOF\u2019s glass-manufacturing business before Pilkington\u2019s acquisition and that Aeroquip itself has pending claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for coverage under these policies. Nor is it disputed that anti-assignment clauses prevent the unilateral transfer of \u201cinterest\u201d in the policies and that Pilkington was not assigned the policies or added as a named insured. Yet despite being a nonparty to the contracts and unnamed as an insured, Pilkington seeks insurance defense and indemnity for environmental liabilities arising from LOF\u2019s previous activity. Pilkington argues that it has a chose in action or, in the alternative, that insurance coverage should transfer to it by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Chose in Action</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 88} A \u201cchose in action\u201d is defined generally as a \u201ca proprietary right in personam.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 258. We explained, in an early case allowing a judgment creditor to reach the debtor\u2019s unliquidated property-damage claim against a third party, that the term \u201cchose in action\u201d may apply to the right to bring an action in tort and in contract: \u201c[W]hile * * * a \u2018chose in action\u2019 is ordinarily understood [to be] <em>a right of action for money arising under contract, </em>the term is undoubtedly of much broader significance, and includes the right to recover pecuniary damages for a wrong inflicted either upon the person or property. It embraces demands arising out of a tort, as well as causes of action <em>originating in the breach of a contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Cincinnati v. Hafer </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 60, 65, 30 N.E. 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 89} This concept is misconstrued in the lead opinion when it tries to pinpoint when a chose in action becomes enforceable in the insurance context. A chose in action <em>is already </em>an accrued right, not a mere expectancy that later ripens or becomes enforceable. As expressed in <em>Hafer, </em>a chose in action arises when money is due under the contract or there is a breach of a contract leading to a cause of action. The lead opinion, however, states that a chose in action arises at the time of a covered loss and cites for this proposition a case involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>probate disposition of a contested but fixed sum of insurance proceeds due to a casualty loss. <em>In re Estate of Ray, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-02-049, 2003-Ohio-2001, 2003 WL 1904412. But <em>Ray </em>is distinguishable because the chose in action arose under the casualty policy upon the property damage when the owner had the right to receive insurance proceeds directly. In contrast, in the general commercial liability policies here, the insurers have agreed to defend and indemnify Aeroquip against claims brought by third parties for LOF\u2019s activities during a stated period of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 90} By asserting that a chose in action is created upon a \u201ccovered loss,\u201d the lead opinion allows Pilkington to avoid the anti-assignment clause and obtain the benefits of the insurance contracts. It relies on an exception to the general rule: \u201cWhile the general rule regards liability and indemnity policies as non-assignable personal contracts, assignment is valid following occurrence of the loss insured against and is then regarded as chose in action rather than transfer of actual policy.\u201d 2 Russ &amp; Segalla, Couch on Insurance (3d Ed.2005), Section 34:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 91} The cases in which assignment happens after the occurrence of \u201cthe loss insured against\u201d usually involve transfer of rights from the insured to an injured third party. For example, an insured employer, sued for intentional tort, who eventually settled and assigned its rights to collect the settlement amount under the company\u2019s policy to the injured employee, did so without contravening the anti-assignment provision because the court construed the clause as prohibiting assignment of the policy rather than an accrued claim. <em>Ficrentino v. Lightning Rod Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 188, 194-195, 682 N.E.2d 1099. The anti-assignment clauses here are broader and refer to an \u201cinterest,\u201d which includes a chose in action.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 92} To determine whether Pilkington\u2019s demand constitutes a chose in action, I would instead ask whether a sum is due or whether the insurer has breached its obligation to the insured, applying the reasoning of <em>Henkel Corp. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>(2003), 29 Cal.4th 934, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69. In <em>Henkel, </em>the California Supreme Court rejected a successor corporation\u2019s attempt to avoid a consent-to-assignment clause when the event giving rise to the liability occurred prior to the assignment. The court reasoned that at the time of the unilateral assignment, the insurers\u2019 duty to defend and indemnify had not accrued because the \u201cclaims had not been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due under the policy [and the insurers] had not breached any duty to defend or indemnify [the predecessor corporation].\u201d Id. at 944, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 62 P.3d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 93} Henkel\u2019s reasoning was later adopted in a case in which the acquiring company sought to avoid the consent-to-assignment provision because the loss (i.e., pollutants allegedly causing environmental damage being released on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>property) had already occurred. <em>Century Indemn. Co. v. Aero-Motive Co. </em>(W.D.Mich.2003), 318 F.Supp.2d 530, 539. The court also determined that at the time of the purported assignment, the selling company did not have a claim or accrued cause of action under the policies to assign, because even if a discharge of pollutants had occurred before the assignment, the damages associated with the environmental cleanup were not assessed until almost two decades later. Id. at 540. Because no claim had been made against the seller at the time of the transfer, the seller had no claim against its insurers for defense or indemnification under the policies. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 94} Similarly, when LOF transferred certain liabilities and assets to LOF Glass, Inc., which Pilkington voluntarily acquired when it purchased all the shares of LOF Glass, Inc. in 1986, LOF did not have any accrued rights against its insurers. LOF had no outstanding judgment that the insurers were required to pay on its behalf and had not been refused any defense. All LOF had were the policies themselves, which were not part of the transfer. Thus, a chose in action was never created by the time of the 1986 transfer because no sum was due, and the insurance companies had not breached any duty owed to LOF.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 95} Unless or until there is such a breach of the insurance contract, there is no accrued right under the policy, whether it be called \u201cchose in action\u201d or not. Accordingly, I would hold that Pilkington\u2019s demand does not constitute a chose in action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Anti-assignment Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 96} All of the policies contain language prohibiting the assignment of \u201cinterest\u201d under the policy without the insurers\u2019 consent. This prohibition appears simple enough. If there is no chose in action, there is nothing to assign. As the district court observed in its order of certification to this court, if the \u201canswer to [the first] question is \u2018no,\u2019 it is not necessary to answer Question Two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Transfer by \u201cOperation of Law\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">{\u00b6 97} The general rule of successor liability states that the purchaser of a corporation\u2019s assets is not liable for the torts of the seller corporation. <em>Flaugher v. Cone Automatic Mach. Co. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 60, 30 OBR 165, 507 N.E.2d 331. The exceptions to the rule are inapplicable here, and the lead opinion properly rejects the premise of <em>N. Ins. Co. of New York v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.9, 1992), 955 F.2d 1353, because Ohio does not accept the product-line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>successor liability theory.

Co. of Illinois </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 474, 478, 747 N.E.2d 206. In the context of an asset sale, terms of insurance coverage may be the subject of bargaining. For example, a seller may wish to preserve its insurance coverage limits entirely, a buyer may seek the insurer\u2019s consent to have coverage assigned, or the parties may enter into indemnification agreements. The parties may creatively agree to control their own liability. The insurers here contracted to insure a particular company, LOF, against environmental damage as a result of the glass-manufacturing operations. The contract specified that the insurers must consent before an \u201cinterest\u201d could be assigned. The parties\u2019 agreements should stand as negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 100} Therefore, I concur to the extent that the lead opinion holds that a transfer of insurance benefits does not arise by operation of law when liabilities are imposed voluntarily by contract.
