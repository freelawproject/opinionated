For the reasons that follow, we hold that a charge is not pending for purposes of calculating speedy-trial time pursuant to R.C. 2945.71(C) until the accused has been formally charged by a criminal complaint or indictment, is held pending the filing of charges, or is released on bail or recognizance. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant-appellee, Sandra Azbell, was arrested at a pharmacy on May 30, 2003, for deception to obtain dangerous drugs. Officers took Azbell to the police station, where police provided her with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, gave her an opportunity to make a statement, and then photographed, fingerprinted, and released her. No charges were filed at that time, and Azbell was later indicted in April 2004. Azbell was arrested on April 16, 2004, and was served with an indictment charging her with illegal possession of drug documents in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>R.C. 2925.23(B)(1) and deception to obtain a dangerous drug in violation of R.C. 2925.22(A), both felonies of the fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 3} Azbell filed a motion to discharge, claiming that she had not been brought to trial in accordance with the speedy-trial dictates of R.C. 2945.71. The trial court held a hearing, at which Azbell claimed that the time began to run, for speedy-trial purposes, when she was arrested in 2003, and the state argued that the time began when charges were filed against her in 2004. The trial court, from the bench, denied the motion to discharge based on speedy-trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 4} Azbell pleaded no contest to both charges and was found guilty. She appealed from the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion to discharge, and the Richland County Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 6} The right to a speedy public trial is established in the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10. \u201cIn any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof; to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to procure the attendance of witnesses in his behalf, and <em>a speedy public trial </em>by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2945.71 codifies a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial and provides the time within which a hearing or trial must be held for specific offenses. In general, subsection (A) addresses minor misdemeanors, subsection (B) addresses misdemeanors other than minor misdemeanors, subsection (C) addresses felonies, and subsection (D) addresses cases involving both misdemeanors and felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 8} Applicable to this case, subsection (C) provides: \u201cA person <em>against ivhom a charge of felony is pending </em>* * * [s]hall be brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after the person\u2019s arrest.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">{\u00b6 9} The crux of the issue in this case is when a charge is considered \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of calculating speedy-trial time pursuant to R.C. 2945.71(C). The defendant argues that the time begins to run on the date of a person\u2019s arrest. The state argues that a charge is not pending for speedy-trial purposes when a defendant is merely detained and released by law enforcement without being subject to the conditions of bond or being charged in a complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Although Ohio is free to offer more protections in our Constitution and statutes than the federal Constitution offers, we turn first to the United States Supreme Court for guidance on this issue. In <em>United States v. Manon </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468, the defendants moved to dismiss an indictment, claiming that their speedy-trial rights were violated because approximately three years had passed between the end of the criminal scheme charged and the return of the indictment. In holding that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment speedy trial provision has no application until the putative defendant in some way becomes an \u2018accused/ \u201d the court held that \u201c[t]hese provisions would seem to afford no protection to those not yet accused, nor would they seem to require the Government to discover, investigate, and accuse any person within any particular period of time.\u201d Id. at 313, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 11} Thus, \u201cit is either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engage the particular protections of the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 320, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. Moreover, \u201c[a] literal reading of the [Sixth] Amendment suggests that this right attaches only when a formal criminal charge is instituted and a criminal prosecution begins.\u201d <em>United States v. MacDonald </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 1, 6, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 12} The defendant states that dicta in <em>Doggett v. United States </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 647, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520, suggests that mere arrest triggers the speedy-trial clock for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. We quote with approval the resolution offered by the Tenth District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Weiser, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-95, 2003-Ohio-7034, 2003 WL 22999457, \u00b6 25-26:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[U]pon careful reading of <em>Doggett </em>and the forerunning cases of <em>MacDonald </em>and <em>Manon, </em>supra, it is clear the use of the term \u2018arrest\u2019 connotes more than an arrest without the filing of charges or posting of bond. Instead, it intimates an arrest that \u2018is the beginning of continuing restraints on defendant\u2019s liberty imposed in connection with the formal charge on which defendant is eventually tried.\u2019 <em>United State v. Stead </em>([C.A.8] 1984), 745 F.2d 1170, 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe policy reasons espoused by the <em>Doggett </em>court when it stated \u2018arrest\u2019 were the same as those discussed in <em>MacDonald </em>and <em>Manon </em>when the Supreme Court held speedy trial rights did not arise \u2018until charges are pending/ <em>MacDonald, </em>supra [456 U.S.] at 7 [102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.E.2d 696], or by \u2018either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge * * * \u2019 <em>Marion, </em>supra [404 U.S.] at 321 [92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468]. Specifically, the <em>Doggett </em>court stated, \u2018We have observed in prior cases that unreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial threatens to produce more than one sort of harm, including \u201coppressive pretrial incarceration,\u201d \u201canxiety and concern of the accused,\u201d and \u201cthe possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>that the [accused\u2019s] defense will be impaired\u201d by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.\u2019 <em>Doggett </em>[505 U.S.] at 654 [112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520] [quoting <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101]. As such, the <em>Doggett </em>court, as with previous decisions, continued to focus on the restraints upon an individual\u2019s liberty which accompanfy] a formal accusation. Therefore, while the <em>Doggett </em>court failed to explicitly state \u2018and held to answer,\u2019 the analysis makes clear this is the situation which must be present, and not mere arrest, to trigger speedy trial rights.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 15} Several prior cases from this court are relevant. In <em>Westlake v. Cougill </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 230, 234, 10 O.O.3d 382, 383 N.E.2d 599, we held that the speedy-trial statute was tolled during the time between a nolle prosequi of a misdemeanor charge and the service of summons of the second filing of a misdemeanor charge arising out of the same conduct, since no charge was pending against the defendant during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 16} Further, in <em>State v. Bonarrigo </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 7, 16 O.O.3d 4, 402 N.E.2d 530, we held that the speedy-trial statute was tolled after a misdemeanor charge was nolled until the felony indictment, based upon the same conduct, was issued. Quoting from <em>United States v. Hillegas </em>(C.A.2, 1978), 578 F.2d 453, 458, we noted, \u201c \u2018After the Government\u2019s dismissal of the complaint against him appellant * * * was no longer under any of the restraints associated with arrest and the pendency of criminal charges against him. He was free to come and go as he pleased. He was not subject to public obloquy, disruption of his employment or more stress than any citizen who might be under investigation but not charged with a crime. Unless and until a formal criminal charge was filed against him, neither he nor the public generally could have any legitimate interest in the prompt processing of a nonexistent case against him.\u2019 [Footnote omitted.]\u201d <em>Bonarrigo, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 11, 16 O.O.3d 4, 402 N.E.2d 530, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 17} In addition, in <em>State v. Broughton </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 253, 581 N.E.2d 541, we considered a case in which a defendant was indicted on November 17, 1988, the indictment was dismissed as defective on July 18, 1989, and the defendant was later indicted on October 18, 1989. Id. at 254, 581 N.E.2d 541. This court held, \u201cFor purposes of computing how much time has run against the state under R.C. 2945.71 <em>et seq., </em>the time period between the dismissal without prejudice of an original indictment and the filing of a subsequent indictment, premised upon the same facts as alleged in the original indictment, shall not be counted unless the defendant is held in jail or released on bail pursuant to Crim.R. 12(1).\u201d Id., paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 18} Finally, this court has held, \u201c \u2018The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy <em>incarceration </em>prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an <em>accused </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by <em>arrest </em>and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Triplett </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 566, 568, 679 N.E.2d 290, quoting <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 19} As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned in <em>United States v. Stead </em>(C.A.8, 1984), 745 F.2d 1170, 1172, \u201carrest triggers the speedy trial right only where it is the beginning of continuing restraints on defendant\u2019s liberty imposed in connection with the formal charge on which defendant is eventually tried. * * * [Thus], the protections of the Speedy Trial Act are not triggered by an arrest when the arrested person is immediately released without formal charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 20} In this case, although Azbell was arrested in May 2003, she was not \u201cheld to answer\u201d because she was immediately released after being photographed and fingerprinted at the police station. At the time of her arrest, she was not charged with any offense. Thus, she was never subject to \u201cactual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge.\u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. Her liberty was not in jeopardy, one of the overriding concerns of speedy-trial violations. See <em>United States v. Loud Hawk </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 302, 310-312, 106 S.Ct. 648, 88 L.Ed.2d 640. Because no charge was outstanding and she was not held pending the filing of charges or released on bail or recognizance, Azbell did not become a \u201cperson against whom a charge of felony is pending\u201d until she was arrested on the indictment in April 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, we hold that for purposes of calculating speedy-trial time pursuant to R.C. 2945.71(C), a charge is not pending until the accused has been formally charged by a criminal complaint or indictment, is held pending the filing of charges, or is released on bail or recognizance. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-8\">Resnicic and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b462-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b462-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-11\">. Although the state argues in its brief that Azbell was merely detained, not arrested, on May 30, 2003, when she was brought to the Ontario police station, the state conceded in oral argument that Azbell <em>was </em>under arrest at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b462-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7L\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">{\u00b6 22} In my view, resolution of this case involves a matter of statutory construction. In reviewing a statute, we are to accord the plain meaning to the words of the statute, absent any ambiguity. This statute is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2945.71 sets forth the statutory right to a speedy trial in Ohio and catalogs three classifications of persons against whom a charge is pending, dependent upon the degree of the offense with which the person is charged. Subdivision (A) pertains to \u201ca person against whom a charge is pending in a court not of record, or against whom a charge of <em>minor misdemeanor </em>is pending in a court of record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subdivision (B) pertains to \u201ca person against whom a charge of <em>misdemeanor, </em>other than a minor misdemeanor, is pending in a court of record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And, thirdly, insofar as is relevant here, subsection (C) specifies:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA person against whom a charge of <em>felony </em>is pending:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) Shall be brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after the person\u2019s arrest.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 27} Reading the statute in its entirety in order to discern the legislative intent, it is apparent to me that this statute applies only to persons against whom charges are pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 28} More relevant here is the fact that the only subsection of this statute that applies to this case is subsection (C), which has as its predicate that it applies only to a person against whom a charge of felony is pending. While the majority and dissenting opinions discuss which is the more preferable interpretation of this statute, the language used by the General Assembly does not refer to the circumstance confronting Sandra Azbell in this case: that of being arrested but not charged. No subsection of R.C. 2945.71 pertains to the circumstance in which a person has been arrested but not charged; nor does the statute require that upon arrest, a charge must be presented against that person within any stated time period. Rather, this statute applies only to those who have charges pending against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">{\u00b6 29} In my view, this case does not implicate Azbell\u2019s constitutional rights; the statutory definition of \u201cspeedy trial\u201d in Ohio is contained in R.C. 2945.71, and the plain language of that statute mandates that \u201c[a] person against whom a charge of felony is pending * * * (2) [sjhall be brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after the person\u2019s arrest.\u201d This statute does not specify any time within which the state must present charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">{\u00b6 30} Although the police arrested and questioned Azbell on May 30, 2003, they released her less than an hour later and presented no charge against her until nearly 11 months later. Accordingly, because R.C. 2945.71 applies only to those against whom a charge is pending, she cannot claim that the speedy-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>statute applied to her May 2003 arrest. It does not. For these reasons, I concur in the judgment reversing the decision to the contrary of the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-4\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 31} I respectfully dissent. A person has constitutional speedy-trial protections guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. \u201cIn Ohio, beginning with the year 1869, this constitutional right, described as of \u2018amorphous quality\u2019 in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 522 [92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101], has been the subject of legislative enactment designed to quantify the right to a speedy trial in a more specific time frame.\u201d <em>State v. Pachay </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 218, 219, 18 O.O.3d 427, 416 N.E.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 32} The speedy-trial statute, R.C. 2945.71, requires that a person charged with a felony be brought to trial within 270 days after the person\u2019s arrest. This is distinguished from the more \u201camorphous\u201d constitutional right. Under constitutional jurisprudence, the delay from accusation to trial becomes \u201c \u2018presumptively prejudicial\u2019 at least as it approaches one year.\u201d <em>Doggett v. United States </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 647, 652, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520, fn. 1; <em>State v. Triplett </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 566, 569, 679 N.E.2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 33} This case, then, becomes a question of statutory interpretation. The majority reads the statute to determine that arrest is modified by the charge pending \u2014 that is, a defendant\u2019s speedy-trial clock does not begin to run until after the indictment has been handed up and the person has been arrested. I believe this is a tortured reading of the statute and bad public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2945.71 establishes the time within which persons charged with different categories of crimes must be brought to trial. The first three subsections list the three major categories of criminal offenses: minor misdemeanors, misdemeanors other than minor misdemeanors, and felonies. These three categories tell the reader under which subsection the reader will find the appropriate time period in which the defendant must be brought to trial. Subsection (C) begins, \u201cA person against whom a charge of felony is pending.\u201d This clause means the person has already been indicted or subject to a bill of information when the motion to dismiss for a speedy trial violation is made. In this case, a felony of the fifth degree is currently pending against the defendant Azbell. Subsection (C)(2) requires that she \u201cbe brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after [her] arrest.\u201d It simply says \u201carrest\u201d; it does not say \u201carrest after indictment,\u201d or \u201carrest after a warrant is issued.\u201d Azbell was arrested on May 30, 2003. She was taken to the police station, given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>photographed, and fingerprinted. That is an arrest. Her freedom was curtailed. The plain language of the statute required that she be brought to trial no later than February 25, 2004. Our precedent also supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">{\u00b6 35} First, it is important to distinguish previous speedy-trial jurisprudence. Case-law precedent usually resolves an issue relating to the time period between the indictment and trial. Generally, preindictment delay has not been found to be a violation of the speedy-trial guarantee. <em>State v. Luck </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 15 OBR 296, 472 N.E.2d 1097. Under traditional analysis, the statute of limitations and the Due Process Clause protect criminal defendants from delay between the alleged criminal incident and indictment, and the speedy-trial provisions protect the criminal defendant from delay between indictment and trial. <em>United States v. Lovasco </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 783, 789, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752, quoting <em>United States v. Ewell </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 116, 122, 86 S.Ct. 773, 15 L.Ed.2d 627, and <em>United States v. Manon </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 307, 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (\u201cWe * * * note that statutes of limitations, which provide predictable, legislatively enacted limits on prosecutorial delay, provide \u2018 \u201cthe primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.\u201d \u2019 * * * But we * * * acknowledge that the \u2018statute of limitations does not fully define [defendants\u2019] rights with respect to the events occurring prior to indictment,\u2019 * * * and that the Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay\u201d); <em>State v. Bartnes </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 522, 525, 764 P.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 36} However, on at least one occasion, this court has looked at preindictment delay under a speedy-trial analysis. We have previously adopted the language of the North Carolina Supreme Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c \u2018The situation of one against whom a warrant has been issued but not served and that of \u201cthe potential defendant\u201d \u2014 the suspect who has not been formally charged \u2014 is practically the same. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c \u2018 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c We can see little, if any, difference in the dilemma which unreasonable delay creates for the suspect who was belatedly charged, the accused named in a warrant promptly issued but belatedly served, and the indicted defendant whose trial has been unduly postponed. The same considerations which impel prompt action in the one situation are equally critical in the others.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Meeker </em>(1971) 26 Ohio St.2d 9, 16, 55 O.O.2d 5, 268 N.E.2d 589, quoting <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1969), 275 N.C. 264, 271-272,167 S.E.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 40} And we held, \u201cConsidering the basic purposes of the constitutional right to a \u2018speedy trial,\u2019 we conclude that such constitutional guarantees are applicable to unjustifiable delays in commencing prosecution as well as to unjustifiable delays after indictment.\u201d Id. at 16-17, 55 O.O.2d 5, 268 N.E.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b6 41} More convincingly, in <em>Dillingham, v. United States </em>(1975), 423 U.S. 64, 96 S.Ct. 303, 46 L.Ed.2d 205, there was a 22-month delay from arrest until indictment. While Dillingham, unlike Azbell, was required to post bond prior to his release, <em>United States v. Palmer </em>(C.A.5, 1974), 502 F.2d 1233, 1234 (same case), he was not indicted until 22 months after his initial arrest. The court held that <em>United States v. Marion </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468, which had denied Sixth Amendment protections to preindictment delays, had been limited to \u201ccount[ing] a delay between the end of the criminal scheme charged and the indictment of a suspect not arrested or otherwise charged previous to the indictment.\u201d <em>Dillingham </em>at 64, 96 S.Ct. 303, 46 L.Ed.2d 205. In extending the speedy-trial guarantee to the period after an arrest, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c \u2018To legally arrest and detain, the Government must assert probable cause to believe the arrestee has committed a crime. Arrest is a public act that may seriously interfere with the defendant\u2019s liberty, whether he is free on bail or not, and that may disrupt his employment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in him, his family and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c \u2018Invocation of the speedy trial provision thus need not await indictment, information, or other formal charge.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 65, 96 S.Ct. 303, 46 L.Ed.2d 205, quoting <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320-321, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 44} When the police and prosecutor have all the necessary evidence to obtain an indictment or warrant, they should not be allowed to delay prosecution. I am not suggesting that the state be rushed into seeking an indictment before all possible evidence has been obtained. However, in the case at bar, Azbell was arrested while allegedly attempting to purchase a controlled substance with a fraudulent prescription, and she was later indicted for that offense. The state had in its possession all the evidence it needed to go forward at the time of her arrest. The state has presented no evidence, and there is nothing in the record to suggest, that the 11-month delay between arrest and indictment was based upon a lengthy and diligent search for additional evidence. When all evidence is in the hands of the police, the state must move forward. See <em>People v. Hryciuk </em>(1967), 36 I11.2d 500, 224 N.E.2d 250; see, also, <em>People v. Hartman </em>(1985), 170 Cal.App.3d 572, 216 CaLRptr. 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 45} For 11 months, Azbell lived under the threat of indictment, wondering whether the state was intending to prosecute her or whether her case had been dropped. Azbell was under no obligation to pressure the state to press charges, nor was she in a position to demand that the state move forward with its prosecution. See <em>Meeker, </em>26 Ohio St.2d at 18, 55 O.O.2d 5, 268 N.E.2d 589; <em>Johnson, </em>275 N.C. at 272,167 S.E.2d 274.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZ9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>James J. Mayer Jr., Richland County Prosecuting Attorney, and Kirsten L. Pscholka-Gartner, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b467-9\">David H. Bodiker, Ohio Public Defender, and J. Banning Jasiunas, Assistant State Public Defender, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 46} I am not suggesting that every preindictment delay warrants analysis under the speedy-trial provisions of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Rather, in cases such as this where the statute is arguably unclear, or open to different interpretations, our speedy-trial jurisprudence suggests that we should read the statute to benefit the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 47} I read the plain words of the statute to say that a person accused of a felony must be brought to trial within 270 days of her arrest. Azbell was arrested on May 30, 2003; that the state took 11 months to gain an indictment is not her fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 48} For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-7\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
