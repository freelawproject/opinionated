Upon impact he suffered severe spinal cord and other injuries. Unrebutted evidence established that the spinal cord injury rendered him a quadriplegic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> William never regained consciousness and died 90 minutes after the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">{\u00b6 2} His widow, appellant Sandra Moorehead, applied for death benefits. Pursuant to R.C. 4123.57(B), she also applied for scheduled loss compensation based on William\u2019s loss of use of both arms and legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">{\u00b6 3} The Industrial Commission denied the application for scheduled loss compensation, observing that scheduled loss benefits may be awarded only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>injured workers who both experience a physical and sustained loss of use and also consciously perceive and experience the physical suffering and hardship caused by the loss of use of a body part in the period between the injury and death. The commission stated that \u201cthe widow-claimant\u2019s application for such benefits must fail, as the decedent did not sustain the loss of his extremities, because he was comatose, and completely unaware of the extent of injuries, for the brief period between the accident and his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 4} The Court of Appeals for Franklin County denied appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus ordering the payment of scheduled loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals deferred to the commission\u2019s interpretation that \u201closs of use\u201d does not occur when an injured worker \u201csurvives an industrial injury in an unconscious state for only a brief period and never actually experiences the disabling effects of the injury.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 4123.57 provides that compensation is payable to an employee when the employee suffers the loss of a body part that is listed on a schedule set forth in the statute. R.C. 4123.57(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIn cases included in the following schedule the compensation payable per week to the employee is the statewide average weekly wage * * * and shall continue during the periods provided in the following schedule:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cFor the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cFor the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">{\u00b6 13} This court has held that \u201closs\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.57(B) is equivalent to \u201closs of use,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Gassmann v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 64, 70 O.O.2d 157, 322 N.E.2d 660 (construing the predecessor statute), and that compensation is payable for loss of a limb through amputation and for permanent and total loss of use due to paralysis, because such loss constitutes a loss \u201c \u2018[f]or all practical purposes * * * to the same effect and extent as if [the limb] had been amputated or otherwise physically removed,\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Walker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 402, 403-404, 12 O.O.3d 347, 390 N.E.2d 1190, quoting <em>Gassmann </em>at 67, 70 O.O.2d 157, 322 N.E.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">{\u00b6 14} The commission concluded that the decedent\u2019s loss of use \u201cwas contingent upon his survival.\u201d It further concluded that the \u201cdecedent did not survive.\u201d But Moorehead did survive the fall, albeit for only a short period, as it is undisputed that he did not die upon impact. R.C. 4123.57(B) does not specify a required length of time of survival after a loss-of-use injury before benefits pursuant to R.C. 4123.57(B) are payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>{\u00b6 15} We have long recognized that neither administrative agencies nor this court \u201cmay legislate to add a requirement to a statute enacted by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 24, 27-28, 53 O.O.2d 13, 263 N.E.2d 249. Rather, in interpreting statutes \u201cit is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 49 O.O.2d 445, 254 N.E.2d 8. We therefore cannot condone the commission\u2019s addition of a requirement that a worker survive for some extended period of time, left unspecified by the commission or the General Assembly, when considering the worker\u2019s entitlement to a scheduled loss benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 16} Similarly, there is no language in R.C. 4123.57(B) requiring that an injured worker be consciously aware of his paralysis in order to qualify for scheduled loss benefits. In an analogous case the Supreme Court of New Hampshire considered a scheduled loss application filed on behalf of a worker whose injury left him in an irreversible vegetative state. <em>Corson v. Brown Prods., Inc. </em>(1979), 119 N.H. 20, 397 A.2d 640. The application was denied administratively solely because Corson\u2019s vegetative state made him unaware of his loss. The New Hampshire Supreme Court vacated that decision and awarded scheduled loss compensation, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhat is of paramount importance in this case is that words such as \u2018awareness\u2019 or \u2018consciousness\u2019 cannot be added under the guise of legislative history to a statute which clearly states that \u2018[t]he scheduled awards under this section accrue to the injured employee simply by virtue of the loss or loss of the use of a member of the body.\u2019 * * * When the language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is not subject to modification by construction.\u201d Id., 119 N.H. at 23, 397 A.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 18} The same rule of statutory construction applies here. When \u201cthe meaning of the statute is unambiguous and definite, it must be applied as written and no further interpretation is necessary.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Savarese v. Buckeye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 543, 545, 660 N.E.2d 463. R.C. 4123.57(B) does not say that compensation is dependent upon a claimant\u2019s conscious awareness of his or her loss, whether resulting from amputation or paralysis. Rather, where the requisite physical loss has been sustained, the statute directs that scheduled loss compensation shall be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 19} This court should not graft duration-of-survival or cognizance requirements to R.C. 4123.57(B), because the statute has no text imposing them. Public-policy arguments relative to the requisites of scheduled loss benefits pursuant to R.C. 4123.57 are better directed to the General Assembly, including arguments that a specified time of survival should be mandated after a paralyzing injury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that a worker be cognizant of his or her loss before loss-of-use benefits are payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b620} The appellant proffered medical evidence establishing that William Moorehead sustained the physical loss of use of his limbs as a result of his fall. Consciousness of that loss during an extended period of survival is not required by R.C. 4123.57(B), and the commission therefore incorrectly applied the statute when it denied the appellant\u2019s application on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 21} We deem it appropriate that the commission determine in the first instance the amount of benefits due the appellant. That determination should be made in light of all relevant statutes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and precedent, including our recent decision in <em>State ex rel. Estate of McKenney v. Indus. Comm,., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-3562, 850 N.E.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 22} The writ is therefore allowed and the cause remanded for determination by the commission of the amount of scheduled loss benefits due the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-9\">Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aig\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-16\">.

It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">{V d} \u201cWhen an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee all unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the surviving spouse * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">{\u00b6 e} \u2018When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by severance, but no award has been made on account thereof prior to the employee\u2019s death, the administrator shall make an award in accordance with this division for the loss which shall be payable to the surviving spouse [or to dependents].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b188-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">{\u00b6 23} I concur in the holding that R.C. 4123.57(B) does not support the commission\u2019s reasons for denying Sandra Moorehead\u2019s application for scheduled loss benefits, and I agree with the decision to remand this cause for a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tion of the amount of benefits due Moorehead in light of <em>State ex rel. Estate of McKenney v. Indus. Comm., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-3562, 850 N.E.2d 694. However, because the courts below did not have the benefit of <em>McKenney, </em>I write separately to explain why I believe that it and the relevant statutory authority limit Moorehead\u2019s award to one week of scheduled loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 24} Sandra Moorehead was awarded death benefits under R.C. 4123.59, which authorizes payment of benefits to dependents of any employee who dies as a result of a workplace injury or occupational disease. These benefits are intended to compensate for the loss of wages and are calculated at a percentage of the average weekly wage. The award is paid from the employee\u2019s date of death until the death or remarriage of the dependent spouse. R.C. 4123.59(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 25} Scheduled loss benefits under R.C. 4123.57(B) are intended to compensate for an injured worker\u2019s presumed loss of earning capacity. <em>McKenney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-3562, 850 N.E.2d 694, \u00b6 16. A scheduled loss award conclusively presumes that the loss of a member has an effect on one\u2019s earning capacity. Id. at \u00b6 15. However, this presumption is rebutted when the worker dies, for there is no longer an earning capacity to be impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 4123.57(B) authorizes an award of scheduled loss benefits to the surviving spouse when an employee has sustained a loss but the employee dies before the award is made. R.C. 4123.60 authorizes a surviving spouse to apply for and receive, in addition to death benefits, an award for compensation that the decedent would have been lawfully entitled to apply for at the time of his death. The amount of the award, however, may not exceed the compensation that the decedent might have received for the period prior to the date of death. Thus, R.C. 4123.60 appears to limit the surviving spouse\u2019s recovery of benefits other than compensation for death to an amount not exceeding what the decedent might have received for the period prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 27} The difficulty in this case is the application of these statutes, i.e., whether R.C. 4123.57(B) contemplates a scheduled loss award when the injured worker survived his injuries only briefly, or whether the General Assembly intended death benefits to compensate the surviving dependents under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">{\u00b6 28} We addressed payment of scheduled loss benefits to a surviving spouse in <em>McKenney. </em>Patrick McKenney, a quadriplegic, had been awarded 850 weeks of scheduled loss benefits under R.C. 4123.57(B), payable in weekly installments. He died after six weeks of payment. His surviving spouse and sole dependent, Nancy, moved for a lump sum payment of the remaining 844 weeks of compensation. Nancy McKenney died one day later. Her estate pursued her motion, claiming that the entire amount of the scheduled loss award accrued to Nancy at Patrick\u2019s death.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Stocker Pitts Co., L.P.A., M. Scott Kidd, and Thomas R. Pitts, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b190-8\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and William J. McDonald, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b190-9\">Philip J. Fulton Law Office, Philip J. Fulton, and William A. Thorman III, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">{\u00b6 29} We did not agree that McKenney was entitled to the entire award upon Patrick\u2019s death. Scheduled loss benefits, like most other forms of workers\u2019 compensation, compensate for a loss of earning capacity. \u201cIt therefore follows that the loss of earning capacity that scheduled loss compensation was intended to ameliorate ceases upon the death of the injured worker \u2014 just as it does with all other forms of disability compensation.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. R.C. 4123.57(B) anticipates the payment of scheduled loss compensation in weekly installments, which may be commuted to a lump sum under certain circumstances and only if the injured worker applies. R.C. 4123.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">{\u00b6 30} Consequently, I believe that Moorehead may be entitled to one week of scheduled loss benefits under R.C. 4123.57(B) to compensate for her husband\u2019s period of survival.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue of consciousness is immaterial. But the presumed loss of earning capacity ceased upon William Moorehead\u2019s death. At that point, Sandra Moorehead became entitled to apply for death benefits under R.C. 4123.59. I do not believe that the General Assembly intended for duplicate awards under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, I believe that an award of scheduled loss benefits under these circumstances has potential long-term financial ramifications. A successful scheduled loss application, depending on the extent of injury, can generate huge sums of money costing the State Fund and self-insured employers millions of dollars. In this case, Moorehead seeks the full award of 850 weeks. If scheduled loss benefits are awarded no matter how short the employee\u2019s survival, this will likely encourage the dependent of any employee who dies in close proximity to an industrial injury to file for scheduled loss compensation. Such an award would have unintended results that would be financially devastating for the State Fund or a self-insured employer. I do not believe that the General Assembly intended R.C. 4123.57(B) to provide what would be the equivalent of an award of damages for personal injury.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-6\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Garvin &amp; Hickey, L.L.C., Preston J.
