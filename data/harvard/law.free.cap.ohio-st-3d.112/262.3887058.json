Specifically, we must determine whether landholders who own the property over which a roadway easement exists are \u201cowners\u201d of the roadway property pursuant to the statute when others seek annexation of the roadway to a municipality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that the landholders of the property at issue in this case are \u201cowners\u201d as defined in R.C. 709.02(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Overview of Current Annexation Laws</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">{\u00b6 2} Because annexation is strictly a statutory process, <em>In re Petition to Annex 320 Acres to S. Lebanon </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 597 N.E.2d 463, we must focus on the statutes that delineate the requirements for annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 3} With the passage of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 (\u201cSenate Bill 5\u201d) in 2001,149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 621, the General Assembly accomplished a comprehensive reform of Ohio\u2019s laws regarding annexation, principally through amendments to R.C. Chapter 709. One of the major innovations of Senate Bill 5 was the establishment of three new specific procedures that allow for expedited annexations when all the property owners within a parcel to be annexed sign an annexation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 4} Prior to Senate Bill 5, all annexations in Ohio initiated by private property owners followed a single basic procedure, with the requirement that \u201ca majority of the owners\u201d in a specific parcel sign the petition to initiate an annexation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See former R.C. 709.02. 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3313. There were no special procedures to expedite the process, and no special procedures existed to govern situations in which all property owners desired annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 5} The three additional, expedited procedures all apply only when \u201call of the owners of real estate\u201d within a particular territory request annexation by signing the petition. R.C. 709.021(A) and (B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first, established by R.C. 709.022, commonly called an expedited type-1 annexation, applies when \u201call parties,\u201d including the township and the municipality, agree to the annexation of property. The second, established by R.C. 709.023, is commonly called an expedited type-2 annexation and applies when the property to be annexed to the municipality will remain within the township despite the annexation. The third type of special annexation, established by R.C. 709.024, is commonly called an expedited type-3 annexation and applies when the property to be annexed has been certified as \u201ca significant economic development project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 6} Another significant change brought about by Senate Bill 5, which is critical to this appeal, is in the definition of \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cowners\u201d in R.C. 709.02(E) for purposes of establishing the number of owners who must sign an annexation petition. That statute provides: \u201c \u2018[OJwner\u2019 or \u2018owners\u2019 means any adult individual who is legally competent, the state or any political subdivision * * *, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>firm, trustee, or private corporation, any of which is seized of a freehold estate in land; except that easements and any railroad, utility, street, and highway rights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance are not included within those meanings * * *. [T]he state or any political subdivision shall not be considered an owner and shall not be included in determining the number of owners needed to sign a petition unless an authorized agent of the state or the political subdivision signs the petition.\u201d The R.C. 709.02(E) definition applies to all of the four types of annexation discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">{\u00b6 7} The annexation pursued in this case is an expedited type-2 annexation, which can occur only when the territory to be annexed \u201cdoes not exceed five hundred acres.\u201d R.C. 709.023(E)(3). According to R.C. 709.023(H), unless otherwise agreed, \u201cterritory annexed into a municipal corporation pursuant to this section shall not at any time be excluded from the township * * * and, thus, remains subject to the township\u2019s real property taxes.\u201d Therefore, when property is annexed to a municipality under R.C. 709.023, the residents of the territory become residents of both the township and the municipality, subject to. the taxes of both, and potentially able to receive services from either.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 8} An examination of Senate Bill 5 indicates that some of the overall goals of the bill \u2014 including those of the new expedited procedures \u2014 were to promote consistency in decision-making by putting in place firm standards to govern the consideration of annexation petitions, to improve the efficiency of annexations by creating the expedited processes, and to promote cooperation among local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 9} The facts of this case are not in dispute. On June 24, 2004, Waterwheel Farm, Inc., now represented by statutory agent respondent-appellant Catherine Cunningham (\u201cWaterwheel\u201d), filed an annexation petition under R.C. 709.023 with respondent the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners for the annexation of 79.840 acres from Butler Township to respondent-appellant the city of Union. In addition to property owned by Waterwheel, the petition acreage included a portion of Jackson Road (along with the berm, shoulder, and other incidentals of the right-of-way) that does not abut Waterwheel\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 10} On July 14, 2004, relator-appellee Butler Township Board of Trustees (\u201cButler Township\u201d) filed a resolution opposing the annexation as an objection with the board of county commissioners. See R.C. 709.023(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the bases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of Butler Township\u2019s objection was its contention that the annexation could not proceed because in its view, fewer than all of the property owners involved had signed the annexation petition. The property owners referred to in the objection were a number of landowners whose properties adjoin Jackson Road and who are the fee-simple owners (up to the centerline of the road) of the property over which the roadway passes, subject to an easement for the right of way. Except for the roadway and its supporting property, the property of these Butler Township landowners is not part of the territory covered by the annexation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 11} On July 22, 2004, Butler Township and some of the property owners referred to in the objection (\u201cthe excluded landholders\u201d) filed an action in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, seeking a writ of mandamus, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief, including a preliminary injunction. On August 2, 2004, the trial court denied a preliminary injunction, ruling that the board of county commissioners had to first act on the petition before the motion for preliminary injunction was ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 12} Because an objection was filed under R.C. 709.023(D), the board of county commissioners considered the petition under R.C. 709.023(E), to determine whether the conditions set forth in that statute were met.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 3, 2004, the board of county commissioners granted the petition, finding all relevant R.C. 709.023(E) conditions satisfied. See R.C. 709.023(F).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Included within the findings was that \u201c[t]he persons who signed the petition * * * constitute all of the owners of real estate\u201d in the territory proposed for annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 13} On August 5, 2004, Butler Township and the excluded landholders challenging the annexation petition again moved in the trial court for a prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>nary injunction and for other relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court overruled the motion on September 17, 2004, finding that the holders of the property over which the roadway easement passes \u201care not owners under R.C. 709.02(E). Therefore they have failed to establish that they have a legal right to be part of the annexation proceeding or to dismiss the annexation petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">{\u00b6 14} Butler Township and the relevant excluded landholders appealed to the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County. Upon remand for clarification of whether a final order was intended, the trial court issued an amended order stating that all issues in the complaint were resolved and that there was no just reason for delay. The court of appeals then reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. 162 Ohio App.3d 394, 2005-Ohio-3872, 833 N.E.2d 788. The court of appeals determined that R.C. 709.02(E) is ambiguous as to whether the excluded landholders must be counted in determining whether all of the owners had signed the annexation petition and concluded that they must be. Id. at \u00b6 18 and 30. The court of appeals ruled that the trial court had erred in not counting the excluded landholders and that it should have granted a preliminary injunction. Id. at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 15} The cause is now before this court pursuant to our acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 16} Although it is necessary to set forth the relevant annexation statutes in detail to put the issue and the parties\u2019 arguments in context, the issue is straightforward: Is it the intent of the General Assembly, as expressed within R.C. 709.02(E), that a landholder who owns in fee simple the property underlying a roadway over which a political subdivision holds an easement must be counted as an owner for purposes of determining the percentage of owners who have signed an annexation petition? If such a landholder is an \u201cowner\u201d as defined, then the annexation in this case does not comply with R.C. 709.023(E)(2), because fewer than all the owners have signed the petition, and it may not proceed as proposed. If such a landholder is not an \u201cowner\u201d as defined, then all owners have signed the petition and that condition is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">{\u00b6 17} We must first resolve whether the portion of R.C. 709.02(E) at issue is ambiguous. Tailored to the situation before us and stripped to its essentials, that statute provides: \u201c[Ojwner * * * means any adult individual who is legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>competent * * * [and] seized of a freehold estate in land; except that easements and any * * * street, and highway rights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance are not included within those meanings * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">{\u00b6 18} It is clear that were it not for the exception clause, the excluded landholders would be counted as \u201cowners.\u201d Consequently, we must determine whether that exception clause (amended by Senate Bill 5) removes them from the statutory group of \u201cowners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 19} Prior to Senate Bill 5, \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cowners\u201d was defined in the last paragraph of R.C. 709.02 as \u201cany adult individual seized of a freehold estate in land who is legally competent and any firm, trustee, or private corporation that is seized of a freehold estate in land; except that individuals, firms, and corporations holding easements are not included within such meanings * * *.\u201d 1978 Am.H.B. No. 732, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3313. Under that prior statute, the excluded landholders would have been counted as owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 20} Senate Bill 5 modified the exception clause (which formerly provided only that those holding easements are not owners), adding that \u201crights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance are not included within those meanings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 21} Appellees\u2019 position is that the exception clause is intended to remove only the holder (in this case the political subdivision) of a <em>lesser </em>interest from the definition of \u201cowners,\u201d in the same way that the statute excepts a holder of an easement, and that the phrase \u201crights-of-way\u201d in the clause refers to interests held by others than those in the position of the excluded landholders. According to appellees, because the excluded landholders own the land underlying the roadway easement in fee simple, they are owners of that property, and the exception clause does not refer to them. They argue that the addition to the exception clause of \u201crights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance\u201d applies mostly to the interests of political subdivisions and not to those of the excluded landholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The gist of appellants\u2019 position, on the other hand, is that the exception of \u201crights-of-way held in fee\u201d is meant to exclude <em>all </em>holders of <em>any </em>interests insofar as a right of way is concerned and to apply to a property owner who owns the land underlying a roadway over which a political subdivision holds an easement to maintain the roadway. Appellants contend that the exception clause is meant to remove the excluded landholders from the group of owners who must sign an annexation petition, because the clause\u2019s use of \u201crights-of-way\u201d does not describe an interest in land but refers to the land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 23} Furthermore, appellants urge that the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of R.C. 709.02(E) renders meaningless the language inserted into the exception clause by Senate Bill 5 regarding \u201crights-of-way.\u201d Because the exception clause (both before and after Senate Bill 5) separately already excludes the holders of easements from the definition of \u201cowners,\u201d appellants argue that the reference to \u201crights-of-way\u201d must be to something other than just a political subdivision\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals based its conclusion that R.C. 709.02(E) is ambiguous in large part on the observation that \u201cright-of-way\u201d can have two different meanings, reasoning that \u201cthe term \u2018right-of-way\u2019 may refer to either the land itself <em>or </em>the right to use the land for the purpose of a transportation right of way.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 162 Ohio App.3d 394, 2005-Ohio-3872, 833 N.E.2d 788, at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 25} We agree with the conclusion reached by the court of appeals that R.C. 709.02(E) is ambiguous. If the term \u201crights-of-way\u201d in the exception clause is meant to refer to the land itself, then the statute can be read to except the excluded landholders from the definition of \u201cowners.\u201d However, if the term \u201crights-of-way\u201d is meant to refer only to the right to use the land, then the statute would not except the excluded landholders. Our consideration of the language of R.C. 709.02(E) on its face does not eliminate either alternative as a plausible meaning. We therefore disagree with appellants\u2019 position that the statute clearly and unambiguously provides that the excluded landholders are not owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 26} Because we have determined that R.C. 709.02(E) is ambiguous as it relates to this case, we must consider what the intent of the General Assembly was in enacting the statute with the chosen wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 27} As did the court of appeals, we resort to R.C. 1.49 as an aid in statutory construction in an attempt to discern the General Assembly\u2019s intent. We consider:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(A) The object sought to be attained;</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted;</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201c(C) The legislative history;</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws regarding the same or similar subjects;</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(E) The consequences of a particular construction; and</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(F) The administrative construction of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 34} Our task in this regard is complicated by the fact that (as the court of appeals found and the parties agree) no legislative history is available to clarify the intent of the legislature on the point at issue. See 162 Ohio App.3d 394, 2005-Ohio-3872, 833 N.E.2d 788, at \u00b6 26. Therefore, we must look to other factors as the focus of our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 35} Many of the opposing parties\u2019 arguments going to the General Assembly\u2019s intent rely on public policy considerations in an attempt to convince us that a particular construction of the statute is more sound. These arguments, while valid for some purposes, seem to do very little in assisting us in discovering the General Assembly\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 36} For example, appellants and their supporting amici state that, in some situations, annexations have led to laterally segmented roadways, and in others, an annexation would sometimes result in a roadway being split down its center-line, so that different jurisdictions each might control one-half of the same section of roadway. Appellants also mention that there arose situations in which an annexation petition would intentionally exclude a roadway that should have been included, because of problems with obtaining approval for the roadway\u2019s annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 37} Appellants posit that a purpose of Senate Bill 5 was to eliminate the problems that have been associated in the past with piecemeal annexations of (or failures to include) roadways that often caused maintenance of those roadways to be split among several jurisdictions. Appellants argue that not counting the excluded landholders as owners will further that purpose by making it easier to annex roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 38} In response, appellees and their supporting amicus urge that the General Assembly dealt with the problem of fragmented roadways through R.C. 709.023(E)(7) by making road maintenance a consideration that the board of county commissioners must find has been satisfied before an expedited type-2 petition can be approved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees argue that there is no indication that the R.C. 709.02(E) definition of \u201cowner\u201d was also meant to accomplish that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Appellees also argue that the annexation at issue is a balloon-on-a-string annexation (with a long narrow stretch of roadway attached to a larger parcel of land) of the type this court disapproved in <em>Middletown, v. McGee </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 284, 530 N.E.2d 902, and that if this court adopts appellants\u2019 interpretation of R.C. 709.02(E), the principles underlying that case will be violated. Appellees further question the motives behind the roadway\u2019s annexation, contending that the proposed annexation would not have met the five percent contiguity requirement of R.C. 709.023(E)(4) without the inclusion of the portion of Jackson Road at issue in the annexation territory. Appellants in their reply briefs vigorously dispute both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 40} While we believe that segmentation of roadways and splits of roadway maintenance among jurisdictions are a significant concern, we discern very little indication that that problem is addressed in R.C. 709.02(E). Likewise, while we believe that balloon-on-a-string annexations can be a significant problem, we see little indication that the statutory definition of \u201cowners\u201d was meant to address that issue. In addition, the arguments going to the five percent contiguity requirement do not relate to the definition of \u201cowners\u201d and are beyond the scope of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 41} One feature of the statute that does seem significant is that the exception clause follows its mention of \u201crights-of-way\u201d with three different interests. Two of those are that the definition of \u201cowner\u201d does not include rights of way held \u201cby easement\u201d and rights of way held \u201cby dedication and acceptance.\u201d Those two interests are both ways in which political subdivisions typically use or acquire property over which a right of way passes. We think it likely that because those two concepts both refer to a political subdivision\u2019s interests, the interest \u201cheld in fee\u201d mentioned directly before in the exception clause may also refer (at least in part) to the interests of a political subdivision and not to all interests of all landholders of any rights of way. However, because the clause also refers to railroad and utility rights of way, and those interests are usually held by entities other than political subdivisions, it appears that this consideration is not determinative either.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 42} An argument raised by appellants is that because the excluded landholders exercise virtually no dominion and control over the roadway because of the easement, the excluded landholders are not, for all practical purposes, suffering a significant loss if they are not counted as owners. Appellants urge that this consideration is especially true in an expedited type-2 annexation, in which the annexed property remains in the township despite its annexation to the municipality. However, because the R.C. 709.02(E) definition of \u201cowners\u201d applies to all annexations \u2014 not just to those under R.C. 709.023 \u2014 a consideration specific to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>only one type of annexation is of little relevance to our overall interpretation of R.C. 709.02(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 43} A related consideration put forth by appellants is that when a political subdivision itself owns a roadway in fee (as is often the case with state highways, in which the roadway property may be owned in fee by the state), adjoining landowners are not owners of property under the roadway and therefore are not counted for purposes of a petition to annex the roadway.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants urge that the excluded landholders in the instant case are in essentially the same position as owners who abut a highway fully owned by the state, so that it is not inconsistent to treat the excluded landholders the same way (as not owners), particularly when they likewise exercise virtually no control over the roadway. However, as appellees repeatedly point out, the excluded landholders here do own a full fee interest (even if they can assert virtually no control over the roadway due to the easement over it). For that reason, there is a difference between them and the owners of property along a state highway when the state fully owns a roadway in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 44} We are unconvinced by any of the arguments going to the intent of the legislature in enacting the Senate Bill 5 amendments to R.C. 709.02(E). After considering the statute under the factors of R.C. 1.49, we believe that neither interpretation of the statute has emerged as significantly more likely than the other. For each point that one party makes, the other side has a corresponding response that seems to seriously undermine the value of the point attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 45} After considering all of the arguments raised by the parties and their amicus supporters, we determine that, in the absence of the emergence of a more clear perception of how to interpret the statute, the balance must fall on the side of the appellees in this case. Even though the excluded landholders have little say over the use of the roadway itself, it cannot be questioned that they own the property underlying the roadway and will be affected if the road that runs directly in front of their property is annexed into the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 46} We hold that the excluded landholders must be counted as \u201cowners\u201d under current R.C. 709.02(E) because not to count them would deprive them of one of the property rights that they would normally have as the holders of an undeniable and definite property ownership interest. Furthermore, the excluded landholders were \u201cowners\u201d under the former statute, and the ambiguous amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ment does not clearly indicate the General Assembly\u2019s intent to change that status. To define the excluded landholders as outside the ambit of \u201cowners\u201d strikes us as simply too great a leap to take, given the ambiguity of the statute.

In a situation in which the state or political subdivision fully owns the roadway but does not sign the petition, roadway property annexed into a municipality would have no \u201cowner\u201d under the definition of R.C. 709.02(E).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b430-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 48} Because I would hold that R.C. 709.02(E) excepts from the definition of \u201cowner\u201d all holders of property rights that fall within a right of way, I respectfully dissent. I believe that the majority ignores the history behind the passage of 2001 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 and the new definition of \u201cowner\u201d in R.C. 709.02(E), which was intended to remove the very problem that the majority\u2019s interpretation would perpetuate. If the majority\u2019s holding does not accurately define these property rights, I invite the General Assembly to revisit and clarify the meaning of \u201cowner\u201d within R.C. 709.02(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">{\u00b6 49} In amending R.C. 709.02, Am.Sub.S.B.

The critical question is whether \u201crights-of-way\u201d means merely the <em>interest </em>that establishes the right of way or whether it means the strip of <em>land </em>dedicated as the right of way. If it means the former, as the majority concludes, then a private person who owns a fee interest that underlies a public roadway is an owner for purposes of annexation, and he or she must consent before that portion of the road may be annexed to a municipality in a type-2 annexation. If it means the latter, then no holder of any property interest within a right of way is defined as an owner, and no consent is required to annex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>that portion of the road. The determination of this issue depends upon the meaning of \u201cowner\u201d as defined in R.C. 709.02(E). I believe that \u201cowner\u201d excludes from its definition all holders of property interests that fall within a right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I. THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF R.C. 709.02(E)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 50} A court\u2019s purpose in construing a statute is to determine the intent of the General Assembly. <em>State ex rel. Choices for South-Western City Schools v. Anthony, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, \u00b6 40. In determining intent, a court must first look to the language of the statute in question. <em>Carnes v. Kemp, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 629, 2004-Ohio-7107, 821 N.E.2d 180, \u00b6 16. \u201cIn reviewing a statute, a court cannot pick out one sentence and disassociate it from the context, but must look to the four corners of the enactment to determine the intent of the enacting body.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 334, 336, 673 N.E.2d 1347. Finally, statutory language \u201cshould not be construed to be redundant, nor should any words be ignored.\u201d <em>E. Ohio Gas Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 295, 299, 530 N.E.2d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 51} Former R.C. 709.02 essentially defined \u201cowners\u201d as certain entities and persons who were seized of a freehold estate, but excluded persons and certain entities that held easements and persons or entities that became owners for the purpose of affecting the number of owners required to sign the annexation petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Amended R.C. 709.02(E) added the state and political subdivisions as owners (but only if they sign an annexation petition). It also excluded from the definition of \u201cowner\u201d \u201cany railroad, utility, street, and highway rights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>{\u00b6 52} By adding \u201crights-of-way\u201d to the exclusion clause, I believe the General Assembly intended to exclude from the definition of \u201cowner\u201d more than just those who hold an interest that creates a right of way. Only the state and political subdivisions acquire rights of way to build public roads. A right of way for a public road is typically acquired through a fee interest or by an easement. See <em>Trotwood Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses v. Measel </em>(Feb. 4, 1993), 2d Dist. No. 13471, 1993 WL 26776, at *2. Under amended R.C. 709.02(E), the state and political subdivisions are not owners unless they sign a petition for annexation. Thus, the General Assembly has excluded from the definition of \u201cowner\u201d the governmental ownership interest in all public streets or highways. R.C. 709.02(E). What then does the street and highway rights of way exception mean? I believe that it must mean the land itself, i.e., the strip of land that is devoted to public travel. Any other interpretation would make the exclusion of government entities redundant and render the street and highway rights-of-way exception meaningless. This means that all property interests (including those that underlie a roadway easement) that fall within a street or highway right of way are excluded from the meaning of \u201cfreehold estate\u201d as that phrase is used in R.C. 709.02(E). In other words, the holder of a freehold estate of property is not an owner under R.C. 709.02(E) to the extent that the freehold estate is within the boundaries of a street or highway right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">II. ROAD SEGMENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 53} The history surrounding the passage of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 clearly indicates that the General Assembly amended R.C. 709.02(E) to exclude from the definition of \u201cowner\u201d all holders of interests within a right of way, primarily to eliminate road segmentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 54} Road segmentation is the unintended and unwanted jurisdictional fragmentation of roads between municipalities and townships resulting in a municipality being responsible for one portion of a road while a township is responsible for another. Road segmentation occurs only where the right of way is held by easement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Where property abuts a road held by easement, the owner of that property owns a fee interest to the centerline of the road. <em>Finlaw v. Hunter </em>(1949), 87 Ohio App. 543, 43 O.O. 355, 96 N.E.2d 319, paragraph four of the syllabus. The purpose of owning a fee interest in property subject to a right of way is to ensure access to the property should the state or political subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>vacate the road. See <em>Grabnic v. Doskocil, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-P-0116, 2005-Ohio-2887, 2005 WL 1383967.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 55} In order to avoid having to get consent from often multiple fee owners, annexation petitioners either avoided annexing the roads that bordered their properties or annexed only the portions of the roads that fronted their properties. The unintended result of this practice was jurisdictionally segmented roads having one section within the jurisdiction of a municipality and another section within the jurisdiction of a township. On other .occasions, a road might be split down the middle, with one lane within a municipality and the other within a township. These arbitrary segmentations resulted in conflicts between townships and municipalities regarding road maintenance, emergency services, or traffic-control devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 56} Appellants, the statutory agent of Waterwheel Farm, Inc., and the city of Union, as well as amici the County Commissioners Association of Ohio and the County Engineers Association of Ohio, claim that for years, various entities have lobbied the General Assembly to amend the annexation process to resolve various issues, including the road-segmentation problem. They further allege that the change in the definition of \u201cowner\u201d provides the solution to the segmentation problem. Specifically, they assert that \u201crights-of-way\u201d in the exclusion clause of R.C. 709.02(E) must mean the land itself, not the right to use the land for roadway purposes, because only this meaning addresses the road-segmentation problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 57} Both the majority and the court of appeals interpret \u201crights-of-way\u201d to mean the right to use the land for roadway purposes, not the land itself. Under this interpretation, persons who own a fee interest in property subject to a right of way continue to be within the definition of \u201cowners.\u201d This interpretation fails to address the road-segmentation problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 58} Alternatively, defining \u201crights-of-way\u201d to mean the land itself means that persons who own a fee interest in property subject to a right of way are no longer within the definition of \u201cowners\u201d in R.C. 709.02(E). This interpretation does address the road-segmentation problem because it requires no consent from the private entity or person who owns an underlying fee interest. Thus, petitioners can more easily annex uninterrupted portions of road, thereby avoiding segmentation of the road. Further, this definition of \u201crights-of-way\u201d is consistent with the language of the statute as read in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 59} The parties appear to agree that the general purpose of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 was, in the words of amicus Ohio Township Association, \u201cto enact a comprehensive annexation reform that promoted cooperation, efficiency and <em>orderly groiuth.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Resolving the road-segmentation problem promotes orderly growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>III. OTHER SEGMENTATION ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 60} Under a type-2 annexation, county commissioners must refuse an annexation if any of several criteria are not met. R.C. 709.023(F). One of the criteria is that if because of the annexation a road will be divided so as to \u201ccreate a road maintenance problem,\u201d the municipality \u201cto which annexation is proposed\u201d must agree to \u201cassume the maintenance of that street\u201d or \u201cotherwise correct the problem.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 61} I would find that this criterion is merely an additional tool to resolve road-maintenance issues that arise because of annexation and emphasizes that persons who own a fee interest within a right of way should not be within the definition of \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of annexation. R.C. 709.023(E)(7) does not alter the legal responsibility for the sections of road that are annexed. Further, R.C. 709.023(E)(7) does not address who has responsibility to provide emergency services, traffic control devices, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">IV. PROPERTY RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 62} The majority examines the arguments from all the parties as to the meaning of \u201cowner\u201d within R.C. 709.02(E) but finds none to be persuasive. Instead the majority finds that \u201c[e]ven though the excluded landholders have little say over the use of the roadway itself, it cannot be questioned that they own the property underlying the roadway.\u201d Similarly, the appellees argue that excluding the holder of a fee interest in property subject to a right of way from the definition of owner in R.C. 709.02(E) deprives that fee holder of his or her property rights. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 63} Eminent-domain law recognized that the owner of a fee interest in a road might be due compensation for a taking because of additional burdens placed on the right of way. See, e.g., <em>Donough v. Mansfield Tel. Co. </em>(App.1937), 8 O.O. 27, 32 N.E.2d 480. However, this is not an eminent-domain case. Upon annexation, the property owner\u2019s fee interest in the roadway is not taken from the property owner, but the land simply becomes part of a different political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 64} Further, annexation is solely a statutory process. R.C. Chapter 709. The \u201crights-of-way\u201d exclusion in R.C. 709.02(E) excepts from ownership only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>fee interest that is within the boundary of a right of way.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A fee interest that is subject to a right of way for a street or highway has no beneficial use to the fee holder because it is dedicated for use as a public road. See <em>Smedes v. Cincinnati Interterminal Ry. </em>(1906), 16 Ohio Dec. 743, 1906 WL 839. In fact, the fee interest in property subject to a right of way held by easement is virtually indistinguishable with regard to its beneficial use from a right of way held in fee. See <em>Ziegler v. Ohio Water Serv. Co. </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 101, 103, 47 O.O.2d 244, 247 N.E.2d 728. Thus, despite appellees\u2019 protestations to the contrary, I would find that appellees are not deprived of any property rights.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AuE\">Moots, Carter &amp; Hogan, Wanda L.

In doing so, it included within the property to be annexed certain portions of Jackson Road. Except for the portion of Jackson Road that abutted Waterwheel\u2019s property, the other portions to be annexed were subject to underlying fee interests owned by persons or entities other than the petitioner, Waterwheel. Under R.C. 709.02(E), the persons possessing these underlying fee interests are not owners under R.C. 709.02(E) for purposes of this annexation because the fee interests are within the right of way. Consequently, their consent is not needed for the annexation of the roadway. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.
