Chiofalo, D.C., DABCO,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and his employer, County Chiropractic Clinic of Orrville, had practiced law without a license when Chiofalo appeared before the Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201cIC\u201d) on behalf of a patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Respondents answered the complaint, admitting most of the allegations, but denying any unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 2} Chiofalo later conceded in an affidavit that he had practiced law without a license. Based on that affidavit and the affidavit of the employer\u2019s counsel who defended against the patient\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, relator moved for summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56. Respondents did not oppose the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 3} A panel of the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law ultimately granted summary judgment for relator, but not until the board had completed review on remand, as ordered in <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. CompManagement, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 168, 2004-Ohio-6506, 818 N.E.2d 1181. The panel held its ruling on the motion, per the board\u2019s instruction, to ensure consistency with the <em>CompManagement </em>standards establishing the extent to which nonlawyers may act in a representative capacity before the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) and the IC. The board ultimately adopted the panel\u2019s findings that respondents had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and recommendation that the unlawful conduct be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 4} In practicing chiropractic medicine for the County Chiropractic Clinic of Orrville, Chiofalo evaluates and treats injured workers who are or may be entitled to benefits under Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation laws. Chiofalo is not a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">{\u00b6 5} On May 9, 2002, Chiofalo attended an adjudicatory IC hearing, intending to appear as a witness to support his patient\u2019s claim for compensation against an industrial employer. The patient was at that time receiving assistance in his claim from a union representative. During his testimony, Chiofalo challenged the credibility of the defense\u2019s medical expert and admittedly \u201ccited, quoted, and argued definitions, meanings and application of legal terms from a legal text\u201d to support his patient\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">{\u00b6 6} The employer\u2019s counsel objected to Chiofalo\u2019s advocacy during the hearing, but the IC hearing officer overruled her objections. In her affidavit, defense counsel reported that respondent was permitted to continue asserting the validity of his patient\u2019s claim, even to the extent of making a closing statement on the injured workers\u2019 behalf. She recalled Chiofalo\u2019s argument that his patient\u2019s claim \u201cshould be allowed as an \u2018aggravation of a pre-existing condition,\u2019 which is a legal term of art in Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation law.\u201d That legal conclusion may entitle the claimant to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See <em>Swanton v. Stringer </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 356, 359-360, 71 O.O.2d 325, 328 N.E.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">{\u00b6 7} We possess the power to regulate, control, and define the practice of law in Ohio. Section 2(B)(1)(g), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; <em>CompManagement, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 168, 2004-Ohio-6506, 818 N.E.2d 1181, \u00b6 39. We have held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>practice of law \u201cincludes conducting cases in court, preparing and filing legal pleadings and other papers, appearing in court cases, and managing actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges, whether before courts or administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Coats, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 413, 2003-Ohio-1496, 786 N.E.2d 449, \u00b6 3. Indeed, engaging in such activity before an administrative agency generally constitutes the practice of law. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Smith, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 278, 2003-0hio-5751, 798 N.E.2d 592, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>CompManagement, </em>however, we clarified one of the exceptions to this rule. We held that nonlawyers who act in a representative capacity before the IC and BWC do not engage in the unauthorized practice of law as long as their conduct conforms to the standards in Industrial Commission Resolution No. R041-01. See <em>CompManagement, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 168, 2004-0hio-6506, 818 N.E.2d 1181, syllabus. Section (A) of the resolution specifies acts in which lay representatives may engage; Section (B) sets forth acts requiring the specialized skill of a licensed lawyer and that nonlawyers may not perform. To this end, Sections (B)(2), (3), and (4) state that a nonlawyer cannot \u201c[c]ite, file or interpret statutory or administrative provisions, administrative rulings or case law,\u201d \u201c[m]ake and give legal interpretations with respect to testimony, affidavits, medical evidence in the form of reports or testimony,\u201d or \u201c[cjomment upon or give opinions with respect to the evidence, credibility of witnesses, the nature and weight of the evidence, or the legal significance of the contents of the claims file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 9} By arguing statutory provisions and case law, construing the text to advance his patient\u2019s case, and interpreting the weight, significance, and credibility of evidence presented, Chiofalo acted well beyond the standards for nonlawyer representation during the underlying IC proceeding. The board therefore found that Chiofalo and, by virtue of his employment, County Chiropractic Clinic of Orrville had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and recommended that both be enjoined from this conduct in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 10} The board did not, however, recommend imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B). Citing two of the factors for determining the propriety of imposing a civil penalty, Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B)(1) and (2), the board found that Chiofalo had committed only one offense and that he had participated cooperatively in the board proceedings. That Chiofalo had not misrepresented himself as an attorney, plans to attend professional training as to the appropriate role of a chiropractor during IC and BWC hearings, and has promised never to repeat his transgressions also weighed against a civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 11} On review, we adopt the board\u2019s finding that respondents exceeded limits on the representation that a nonlawyer may provide in workers\u2019 compensation cases and that an injunction is appropriate. Respondents are therefore enjoined from violating Industrial Commission Resolution No. R04-1-01 (B)(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>(3), and (4) while testifying for claimants in proceedings before the IC or BWC and from engaging in any other act constituting the practice of law.
