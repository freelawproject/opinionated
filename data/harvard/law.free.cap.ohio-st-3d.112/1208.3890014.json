Schulman, Inc.\u2019s appeal. That motion rests on appellant\u2019s failure to file the notice of appeal with the BTA itself within the 30-day period for perfecting an appeal. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed with this court, but a copy of that notice was not filed with the BTA itself until 41 days after the BTA issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">{\u00b6 2} The relevant statutory provision states that an appeal from a BTA decision \u201cshall be taken within thirty days\u201d after the BTA journalizes its decision, and any such appeal is perfected \u201cby the filing by appellant of a notice of appeal with the court to which the appeal is taken and the board.\u201d R.C. 5717.04. As this court has said, that provision \u201crequires that a copy of the notice of appeal filed with this court also be filed with the BTA.\u201d <em>Mid-States Terminal, Inc. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 79, 82, 666 N.E.2d 1077. And \u201cthe appellant has thirty days to accomplish both filings; if he fails to do either, a mandatory jurisdictional requirement is omitted.\u201d <em>Ahms v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1970), 22 Ohio App.2d 179, 181, 51 O.O.2d 350, 259 N.E.2d 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">{\u00b6 3} This court\u2019s Rules of Practice reflect the statute and the cases that have applied it: \u201cA notice of appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals shall be filed with the Supreme Court <em>and the Board within 30 days </em>from the date of the entry of the decision of the Board.\u201d (Emphasis added.) S.Ct.Prac.R. II(3)(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">{\u00b6 4} Although appellant filed its notice of appeal with this court 27 days after the BTA issued its decision, appellant waited until 41 days after the BTA\u2019s decision to file the notice of appeal with the BTA itself. That latter filing fell well outside the 30-day requirement, and despite appellant\u2019s request that the statute be given a liberal construction, longstanding precedents from this and other Ohio courts indicate that the untimely filing deprives the court of jurisdiction to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>appellant\u2019s appeal. See <em>Kenney v. Evatt </em>(1945), 144 Ohio St. 369, 29 O.O. 541, 59 N.E.2d 47 (dismissing an appeal because although a notice of appeal was timely filed with the court, that notice was not filed with the BTA within 30 days after the BTA issued its decision); <em>Ahms, </em>22 Ohio App.2d at 181, 51 O.O.2d 350, 259 N.E.2d 518 (\u201cThe notice [of appeal] must be filed within the 30-day period and in two places: the court to which appeal is taken and with the board [of tax appeals]\u201d); id. (\u201cthe filing of notice with the board * * * within the time specified is * * * mandatory\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aov\">Leonard A. Carlson, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b737-11\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Barton A. Hubbard and Janyce C. Katz, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 5} We therefore grant the Tax Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s timely cross-appeal remains pending, however, and the Tax Commissioner shall proceed as the appellant in this case and shall file a merit brief pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. VI(2) within 40 days of the date of this entry. A. Schulman, Inc. shall proceed as the appellee, and the parties shall otherwise proceed to brief this case in accordance with S.Ct.Prac.R. VI.</p>\n<judges id=\"b737-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b737-7\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b737-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqUq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">{\u00b6 6} I continue to believe that a dual filing requirement such as that contained in R.C. 5717.04 should not be part of our rules. See <em>Olympic Steel, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1242, 2006-Ohio-4091, 852 N.E.2d 178, \u00b6 4-5 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). I believe this case should be heard on the merits. I dissent and would deny the motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
