See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rothermel </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 121, 15 OBR 272, 472 N.E.2d 1072. Respondent was eventually reinstated. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rothermel </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 1215, 716 N.E.2d 712. On December 15, 2004, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice again, this time for an indefinite period, for his failure to maintain the identity of client funds, his failure to keep complete records of client property in his possession, and his acts of fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation. See <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Rothermel, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 413, 2004-Ohio-6559, 819 N.E.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">{\u00b6 3} On October 10, 2005, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, charged respondent with additional counts of professional misconduct. Respondent was served the complaint but did not answer, and relator moved for default pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). A master commissioner appointed by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline granted the motion, making findings of misconduct and a recommendation, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">{\u00b6 4} The complaint charged respondent with three counts of misconduct, the third of which was recommended for dismissal because it was not supported by the sworn or certified documentary prima facie evidence required by Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F)(l)(b). On review, we adopt the recommendation to dismiss. Accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Dewey, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 418, 2003-Ohio-1495, 786 N.E.2d 453, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 5} Bradley Abrams retained respondent to sue a business associate sometime after June 10, 2000, the day on which Abrams was involved in an accident and suffered a traumatic brain injury. The injury left Abrams with permanent brain damage resulting in memory loss and periods of extreme agitation. Abrams paid respondent $5,000 in September 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">{\u00b6 6} On February 24, 2004, while still representing Abrams, respondent convinced his client to lend him $15,000, ostensibly to finance the expansion of his law practice. The note for the loan required payment of the entire debt on August 24, 2004. Respondent offered no collateral to secure the loan, and he did not repay the loan as promised. According to the March 8, 2006 affidavit of Abrams\u2019s mother, respondent has made only three payments, totaling $2,400, on the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 7} Abrams\u2019s case against his business associate was tried, apparently by respondent, before a magistrate on December 6, 2004. Respondent\u2019s license to practice law was indefinitely suspended on December 15, 2004, and the magistrate ruled against Abrams on January 25, 2005. Despite the continuing status of their professional relationship, including the possibility of an appeal, respondent failed to notify Abrams of his suspension as ordered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">{\u00b6 8} Despite his indefinite suspension on December 15, 2004, respondent also ignored this court\u2019s order by continuing to represent clients before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio. On January 5, 2005, according to the federal court\u2019s operations and personnel manager, respondent filed plans for Chapter 13 relief in that court on behalf of two clients. On January 11, 2005, for yet a third Chapter 13 client, respondent filed a motion to reinstate a case that had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">{\u00b6 9} By improperly borrowing money from Abrams and never fully repaying the loan, as alleged in Count I of the complaint, respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 5-104(A) (prohibiting a lawyer from entering a business transaction with a client if the lawyer and client have differing interests unless the client has given informed consent). We also agree with the board that respondent violated Gov.Bar R. V(6)(A)(1) by failing to notify Abrams of his indefinite suspension in accordance with our order. The board, relying on the master commissioner\u2019s report, further found respondent in violation of two related prohibitions \u2014 DR 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice); however, we do not find these violations, because they were not charged in relator\u2019s complaint. Accord <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Deaton, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 19, 2004-Ohio-1587, 806 N.E.2d 503, \u00b6 24, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 10} As to Count II, we agree with the board that respondent\u2019s continued representation in bankruptcy court violated DR 3 \u2014 101(B) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing in violation of jurisdictional regulations) and Gov.Bar R. V(6)(A)(1). We do not, however, adopt the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and Gov.Bar R. V(8)(E), again because these violations were not charged against respondent. <em>Deaton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 11} When imposing a sanction for attorney misconduct, \u201cwe consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b6 44. We have already identified the professional duties respondent violated, and his mental state is not in dispute. Moreover, the injury to his clients and the judicial system is obvious \u2014 respondent acted in his own interest, and to Abrams\u2019s detriment, in taking his client\u2019s money, and also disregarded a court order that had been issued for the public\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, all that is left is to weigh the aggravating and mitigating features of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 13} As the board found, the record contains no mitigation evidence that weighs in favor of leniency. In aggravation, we agree that respondent has a significant history of prior misconduct, has committed multiple offenses, has engaged in a pattern of misconduct, and has failed to participate in the disciplinary process. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), (c), (d), and (e). Weighing these factors in combination with his misconduct, relator, the master commissioner, and the board all recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">{\u00b6 14} We have repeatedly disbarred attorneys for practicing law while under suspension. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Henderson, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 447, 2006-Ohio-1336, 844 N.E.2d 348; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Jefferson </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 317, 699 N.E.2d 930; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Caywood </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 596, 660 N.E.2d 1148. Absent any mitigating circumstances, the penalty for ignoring orders of the court and continuing to practice law while under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>suspension is disbarment. Disbarment is warranted, and we accept the recommendation to disbar.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AoT\">Christopher R. Heekin and James K. Rice, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent is therefore permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b604-7\">Cupp, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
