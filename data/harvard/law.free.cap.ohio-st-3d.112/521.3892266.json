(\u201cG &amp; H\u201d). Britton was a Louisiana resident and filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Louisiana because he was injured in the course of employment with Ray Reich Trucking (\u201cRay Reich\u201d), a Louisiana company. Britton was awarded benefits for his injuries in accordance with Louisiana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Another Louisiana company, appellee American Interstate Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican Interstate\u201d), insured Ray Reich for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">{\u00b6 3} Britton and his wife filed a personal injury claim in Ohio against G &amp; H for injuries he received in the accident. American Interstate also filed a complaint in Ohio, asserting its right of subrogation pursuant to Louisiana law, to recover for expenses it incurred in paying Britton\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>benefits. The two cases were consolidated but were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">{\u00b6 4} American Interstate refiled its complaint in Ohio for subrogation against G &amp; H and Britton. Britton answered, challenging the insurance company\u2019s subrogation rights and asserting his own personal injury cross-claim against G &amp; H.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 5} G <em>&amp; </em>H and Britton filed motions for summary judgment, challenging American Interstate\u2019s subrogation claim. The trial court granted both motions, concluding that Louisiana\u2019s subrogation statutes were similar to an Ohio subrogation statute, former R.C. 4123.931, that had been declared unconstitutional by this court in <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111. American Interstate appealed to the Third District Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court\u2019s holding. The Third District held that Louisiana law rather than Ohio law applied, and because subrogation was lawful in Louisiana, the trial court had erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 6} In reaching its decision, the Third District applied Section 185 of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971) (\u201cRestatement\u201d), which governs choice of law regarding workers\u2019 compensation subrogation issues. We found that a conflict existed between the Third District\u2019s decision and the decision of the First District in <em>Beer v. Cincinnati Machines, Inc., </em>159 Ohio App.3d 715, 2005-0hio-901, 825 N.E.2d 221, which held that the choice of law in a similar workers\u2019 compensation subrogation action was determined by which state had a more significant relationship to the lawsuit. In <em>Beer, </em>the First District applied the same reasoning found in Sections 145 and 146 of the Restatement, sections dealing with conflict-of-law issues for general tort liability and personal injury torts respectively. We certified a conflict regarding the following question: \u201cWhere a conflicts of law issue exists in a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation claim, should sections 146 and 145, or section 185 of the Restatement of the Law of Conflicts govern?\u201d <em>Am. Interstate Ins. Co. v. G &amp; H Serv. Ctr., Inc., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1470, 2006-Ohio-665, 842 N.E.2d 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Restatement Section 185 or Sections 145 and 146</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 7} This court adopted the Restatement to govern choice-of-law analysis in <em>Morgan v. Biro Mfg. Co., Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 339, 341-342, 15 OBR 463, 474 N.E.2d 286. We must now determine whether Sections 145 and 146 or Section 185 of the Restatement applies to determine which state law controls American Interstate\u2019s complaint for subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 8} The <em>Morgan </em>court adopted the Restatement in its entirety. Id. However, because <em>Morgan </em>concerned a personal injury tort, we applied only Sections 145 and 146 of the Restatement, which relate exclusively to tort law. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Morgan, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 342, 15 OBR 463, 474 N.E.2d 286. Both sections establish a \u201csignificant relationship\u201d test to determine which state\u2019s law applies to a tort action in a choice-of-law situation. Section 146 of the Restatement relates specifically to personal injury torts and establishes a presumption that the law of the state where an injury occurred determines the rights of the parties. This presumption can be rebutted if another state is found to have a more significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in Section 6 of the Restatement. Section 145 addresses conflicts in tort actions generally and lists several factors for the court to consider when deciding which state law applies to a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">{\u00b6 9} By comparison, Section 185 of the Restatement determines which state\u2019s law controls in a third-party tort action after an employee has received workers\u2019 compensation. That section provides: \u201cThe local law of the state under whose workmen\u2019s compensation statute an employee has received an award for an injury determines what interest the person who paid the award has in any recovery for tort or wrongful death that the employee may obtain against a third person on account of the same injury.\u201d In such cases, the Restatement has eliminated the need to weigh states\u2019 interests in having their laws applied and has determined that when it comes to workers\u2019 compensation claims, the laws of the state in which the compensation was paid will always apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 10} We determine that with respect to a claim for subrogation brought by a workers\u2019 compensation insurer, Section 185 of the Restatement applies, and the laws of the state in which the workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid are controlling. This holding is consistent with precedent that recognizes that workers\u2019 compensation statutes represent \u201ca social bargain in which employers and employees exchange their respective common-law rights and duties for a more certain and uniform set of statutory benefits and obligations.\u201d <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 119, 748 N.E.2d 1111. Because they are a bargain codified in state law to ensure that both employers and employees receive the benefit of their bargain, the laws of the state in which compensation is paid must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 11} Britton received his workers\u2019 compensation award in Louisiana, pursuant to Louisiana law. Section 185 of the Restatement therefore dictates that Louisiana law applies to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s subrogation claim. Britton is a citizen of Louisiana, and his employer, Ray Reich, is a Louisiana corporation that was insured pursuant to Louisiana law by American Interstate, another Louisiana corporation. To apply Louisiana law in this case is consistent with the underlying goal of ensuring that all parties receive the benefit of their social bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 12} That Section 185 of the Restatement requires application of Louisiana law to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s subrogation claim does not mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Louisiana law applies to all issues in the case, however. Some lower courts have expressed reluctance to apply Section 185 of the Restatement, concerned that \u201cthe presence of workers\u2019 compensation * * * automatically causes the law from the state where the workers\u2019 compensation is granted to be applied as to all issues.\u201d <em>Glatkowski v. Grant Med. Ctr. </em>(Aug. 9, 1994), 10th Dist. No. 94APE04-466, 1994 WL 454715, * 2. Such concerns are unfounded, for Section 185 limits its choice-of-law mandate to questions involving workers\u2019 compensation; it has no impact on choice of law in other issues. For example, in a personal injury action in which workers\u2019 compensation has been paid, the significant-relationship test set forth in Sections 145 and 146 of the Restatement still applies to determine which state\u2019s law should govern the issue of tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 13} Although the Restatement requires that claims for subrogation be decided according to the laws of the state in which compensation was paid, this general rule is potentially limited, as Britton and G &amp; H correctly note, by Section 90 of the Restatement. That section creates an exception allowing a state to refuse to entertain a suit on the ground that the cause of action is contrary to a strong local public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Public-Policy Exception of Restatement Section 90</p>\n<p id=\"AhbU\">{\u00b6 14} Section 90 of the Restatement states: \u201cNo action will be entertained on a foreign cause of action the enforcement of which is contrary to the strong public policy of the forum.\u201d Thus in this case, even though the Restatement is clear that it is Louisiana law that should apply to the subrogation claim, it is still necessary to determine whether allowing American Interstate to assert its subrogation rights under Louisiana law would violate Ohio\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 15} The public-policy exception found in Section 90 of the Restatement is narrow and should be applied only in rare circumstances. The comments to Section 90 quote Judge Cardozo, stating that a court should not refuse to entertain a suit, unless to do so would \u201c \u2018violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of morals, [or] some deep-seated tradition of the commonweal [sic, common weal].\u2019 \u201d Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971), Section 90, Comment c, citing <em>Loucks v. Std. Oil Co. of New York </em>(1918), 224 N.Y. 99, 111, 120 N.E. 198. Other courts considering public-policy exceptions such as the one found in Section 90 of the Restatement have consistently applied them narrowly. They have required that the foreign right that a party seeks to enforce must be \u201ccontrary to good morals, or natural justice, or prejudicial to the best interests of the citizens of the forum state.\u201d <em>Jeffrey v. Whitworth College </em>(D.Wash.1955), 128 F.Supp. 219, 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 16} In applying a similar public-policy exception to determine whether application of foreign law, as opposed to entertainment of a foreign cause of action, would run counter to citizens\u2019 interests, courts have required that a state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>interest in, and relation to, an issue be significant enough that application of foreign law would threaten that policy. <em>Cooney v. Osgood Mach., Inc. </em>(1993), 81 N.Y.2d 66, 78-79, 595 N.Y.S.2d 919, 612 N.E.2d 277. Important considerations in determining a state\u2019s interest include the interests of the individual parties as well as that of the state. <em>Schultz v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc. </em>(1985), 65 N.Y.2d 189, 202, 491 N.Y.S.2d 90, 480 N.E.2d 679. Because the public-policy concerns are essentially the same whether the question is one of applying foreign law or bringing a foreign action, these considerations are equally relevant when considering Section 90\u2019s public-policy exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 17} Applying Louisiana law and allowing American Interstate to enforce its subrogation rights would not prejudice the interests of any Ohio citizens or undermine the state\u2019s public policy. The only parties with a substantive interest in the outcome of the subrogation issue are Britton, Ray Reich, and American Interstate, and all are Louisiana citizens. Although the tortfeasor G &amp; H is an Ohio party, it will be only marginally affected by the ultimate decision regarding American Interstate\u2019s subrogation claim because the relevant liability issues will be decided under Sections 145 and 146 of the Restatement. The subrogation action will determine only which party G &amp; H must pay if it is found liable in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 18} Britton and G <em>&amp; </em>H argue that even without an Ohio party with a substantive interest, enforcement of the Louisiana subrogation statute would be contrary to a strong Ohio public policy disfavoring subrogation claims against workers\u2019 compensation awards. To support that contention, they rely on <em>Hole-ton, </em>which held that Ohio\u2019s former workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute as written was unconstitutional per se. This reliance is misplaced, for the statute in question was declared unconstitutional because of its potential effect. Under the former statute, subrogation might have been possible regardless of whether double recovery occurred. <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 123, 748 N.E.2d 1111. The former statute also impermissibly distinguished between injured employees who tried their personal injury claims and those who instead settled their claims. Id. at 125-126, 748 N.E.2d 1111. We did not declare the idea of subrogation claims against workers\u2019 compensation awards to be generally unconstitutional or against public policy. In fact, we stated that \u201c[a]ny decision that would hold the mere concept of a subrogation or reimbursement statute <em>per se </em>invalid in the workers\u2019 compensation context would constitute a legal anomaly.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 120, 748 N.E.2d 1111. Although at the time of Britton\u2019s accident Ohio\u2019s subrogation statute had been declared unconstitutional, the General Assembly has since amended the subrogation statutes, retaining the right of subrogation in favor of a workers\u2019 compensation insurer. Sub.S.B. No. 227, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3716, 3733. This legislation demonstrates that Ohio does not disfavor subrogation claims as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Shumaker, Loop &amp; Kendrick, L.L.P., John J.

Nolan II, for appellant G <em>&amp; </em>H Service Center, Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">{\u00b6 19} There is no need to inquire further into the specific operation of Louisiana\u2019s subrogation statutes. Since no Ohio party or citizen has a substantive interest in the outcome of the subrogation claims, Ohio\u2019s interest in those issues is minimal. Protection of Ohio\u2019s public policy does not require any further analysis of the Louisiana workers\u2019 compensation subrogation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 20} The Restatement is clear: subrogation claims arising from workers\u2019 compensation payments are governed by the laws of the state in which compensation was paid. This conclusion is dictated by Section 185 of the Restatement, which governs choice of law in workers\u2019 compensation claims. Thus, Section 185 of the Restatement requires that Louisiana law apply to subrogation issues asserted by American Interstate, while Sections 145 and 146 of the Restatement must be used to determine which state\u2019s law applies to the remaining tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">{\u00b6 21} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-9\">Moyer, C.J., Grendell, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b684-10\">Diane V.
