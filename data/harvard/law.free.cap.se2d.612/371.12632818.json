Shearin (defendant) was convicted of possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and resisting, obstructing, and delaying a public\n   officer. He was sentenced to ten to twelve months in prison plus 180 days. Defendant assigns as error the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress, jury instructions on resisting arrest and possession of drug paraphernalia, denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, and entry of judgment as a Class 1 misdemeanor possession of marijuana. We find no error at trial but remand for imposition of judgment and sentencing as a Class 3 misdemeanor possession of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped by a sheriff's deputy on 3 September 2002 at approximately 10:45 p.m. because the license plate light was not working. The deputy smelled alcohol on the driver and began administering sobriety tests. Roanoke Rapids Police Officer Norton was patrolling in the area, saw the deputy's emergency lights, and drove up to assist the deputy. The vehicle was stopped in an area that was lit only by a single street light. Standing about twenty-five feet away from the stopped vehicle, Officer Norton used a flashlight to observe defendant, who remained in the passenger seat of the vehicle. Defendant asked Officer Norton if he could leave. Officer Norton told defendant to stay in the vehicle for a few more minutes. Defendant again asked Officer Norton whether he could leave, and Officer Norton approached the vehicle. Officer Norton testified that defendant \"was very agitated and appeared intoxicated at the time.\" Officer Norton smelled alcohol on defendant and saw a black plastic bag at defendant's feet, with what Officer Norton believed to be a beer bottle, sticking out of the bag. Officer Norton asked defendant what was in the bag, and defendant tried to push the bag under the seat with his foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Norton asked defendant to exit the vehicle. He then asked defendant if he had any weapons. Defendant did not respond. Officer Norton asked defendant three more times if defendant had any weapons. Defendant finally responded that he did not. Officer Norton testified that defendant was originally calm when first asked to exit the vehicle, but again became agitated and boisterous after being asked if he had any weapons. Defendant asked why he was being held. Officer Norton told defendant to move his hands away from his pockets so Officer Norton could frisk defendant. Defendant refused, and \"took off running.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Norton chased defendant into an enclosed parking lot. He told defendant to come out of hiding. Defendant complied and the officer ordered defendant onto the ground. Officer Norton handcuffed and patted down defendant. Officer Norton found marijuana, cocaine, scales for measuring drugs, and a pocket knife on defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State's evidence showed that defendant appeared agitated from the beginning of the stop. Defendant, however, asserts that he was fully compliant with the police and was not \"agitated\" until defendant realized that he was not free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant first assigns as error the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant asserts that his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures was violated. Defendant argues that the items found on his person, namely marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia, should have been suppressed as they were \"fruits of the poisonous tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The fundamental inquiry under the Fourth Amendment is whether the governmental intrusion into a private individual's liberty and property was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See Terry v.

When determining whether an officer had \"a reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop\" or had reason to believe that a defendant was armed and dangerous, trial courts must consider the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    State v. Willis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11869305\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/125/537/#p541\">\n    125 N.C.App. 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20S.E.2d%20407\">\n    481 S.E.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410 (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant argues that he was subjected to a stop and a frisk that exceeded the scope of what is permissible under\n   <em>\n    Terry.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, defendant argues that he was illegally detained because he repeatedly asked if he could leave and was told to remain where he was. Defendant also argues that he was illegally searched because Officer Norton did not have a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous. Defendant argues that while evidence suggested that defendant was being obnoxious to Officer Norton, there was no evidence that defendant was threatening Officer Norton, or otherwise indicating that he would be violent. Defendant also points to Officer Norton's testimony acknowledging that defendant was \"calm when he exited the vehicle\" and that Officer Norton had not observed any weapon or \"any type of bulge\" that might indicate that defendant had a weapon. Defendant further contends that he had told Officer Norton that he did not want to be searched and that he only ran away \"[w]hen it became obvious that [Officer Norton] was going to go through with the illegal frisk[.]\" Thus, defendant asserts that because he was illegally detained and illegally searched, the trial court erred in not granting his motion to suppress the items found on his person as a result of the search and seizure. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Our review of a motion to suppress is limited to a determination of whether the trial court's findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, and whether those findings are in turn supported by legally correct conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Willis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11869305\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/125/537/#p541\">\n    125 N.C.App. at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20S.E.2d%20407\">\n    481 S.E.2d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the trial court found the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   8. That the defendant became agitated when Officer Norton told him that he needed to remain in the car until Deputy Rooks completed his investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   9. That Officer Norton observed a strong odor of alcohol coming from the defendant who appeared to be intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   10. That while speaking with the [d]efendant Officer Norton noticed a beer bottle neck sticking out of a black plastic bag in the floorboard of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   11. That when Officer Norton questioned the defendant about the bag and its contents the defendant attempted to push the bag under the seat with his feet not responding to the officer's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   12. That Officer Norton asked the [d]efendant to exit the vehicle so that he could secure said bag [and] its contents as evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   13. That upon defendant exiting the vehicle Officer Norton had to ask the defendant three or four times if he had any weapons on him before he answered no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   14. That the defendant was standing with his hands at his pockets and would not move his hands away from his pockets despite officer's repeated requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   15. That during this time the defendant became increasingly agitated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   16. That up to this point Officer Norton had not touched the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   17. That upon Officer Norton telling the defendant he wanted to pat his pockets for weapons in order to assure both his and Deputy Rooks' safety the defendant refused and ran from Officer Norton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite defendant's contentions to the contrary, the State's evidence competently supports\n   these findings of fact which in turn support the trial court's conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1. That looking at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the search of the defendant Officer Norton had reasonable grounds to believe that criminal activity might be afoot, justifying his temporary detention of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   2. That during and after Officer Norton's detention of the defendant his personal observations confirmed his apprehension that criminal activity might be afoot and indicated that the defendant might have been armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3. That Officer Norton was entitled to frisk defendant as a matter of self-protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   4. That the defendant was searched only after he had run from Officer Norton who had informed the defendant that he was not free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In looking at the totality of the circumstances, it is reasonable for a police officer to suspect that someone is armed and dangerous when that person appears agitated, is reluctant to answer when asked whether he is armed, and not only refuses to be searched for weapons, but also flees when he is about to be searched. Officer Norton's search of defendant was thus reasonable as a means of protecting himself from being assaulted by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similarly, Officer Norton's detention of defendant at the scene was not unreasonable under the circumstances, and thus did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Defendant concedes that Officer Norton's suspicions might have been raised after the detention continued, but argues that the initial detention, when Officer Norton told defendant to \"stay seated for a few minutes\" after defendant asked if he could leave the scene, was unlawful. Defendant argues that at the time Officer Norton told defendant to remain in the car, Officer Norton \"did not have any suspicion that [defendant] had committed a crime[.]\" However, as defendant points out, the United States Supreme Court has held that a police officer may order a passenger to exit a vehicle, as a safety precaution, without any suspicion that the individual has committed a crime.\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. Wilson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595747\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/408/#p412\">\n    519 U.S. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595747\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/408/#p412\">\n    117 S.Ct. 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595747\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/408/#p412\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46-48 (1997).

The grand jury returned an indictment against\n   defendant on 31 March 2003, stating that defendant \"unlawfully and willfully did resist, delay and obstruct [a public officer], by running from the officer. At the time, the officer was discharging and attempting to discharge a duty of his office, attempting to search ... defendant for officer safety after a car stop.\" The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of resisting an officer and included as one of the elements \"that the [public officer] was attempting to make a lawful arrest.\" Defendant asserts that this instruction was in error because it did not comport with the evidence or the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant further asserts that he objected to this instruction at trial and that the issue is properly preserved. Defense counsel did object but stated only: \"in regard to the resisting arrest charge and [the trial court's] description of this being a lawful arrest, that pursuing a person after he was running was a lawful arrest. We would make an objection to that.\" Defendant did not present to the trial court his argument that the instruction was inconsistent with the theories in the indictment. To preserve an issue regarding jury instruction for appeal, a defendant must not only object to the instruction \"before the jury retires to consider its verdict,\" but must also state \"distinctly that to which he objects and the grounds of his objection[.]\" N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Defendant failed to distinctly state the grounds for his objection that he now argues on appeal. Though an issue not properly preserved at trial may be reviewed as plain error, N.C.R.App. P. 10(c)(4), defendant did not specifically allege plain error in his assignments of error and therefore waives his right to plain error review.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Defendant failed to object at trial and therefore did not properly preserve this issue. Defendant assigned as plain error the trial court's instruction on possessing drug paraphernalia, but he failed to argue plain error in his brief.

The indictment stated that defendant \"unlawfully,\n   willfully did knowingly possess with intent to use drug paraphernalia, SCALES FOR PACKAGING A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE, which it would be unlawful to possess[.]\" The trial court instructed the jury: \"that the defendant did [knowingly possess drug paraphernalia] with the intent to use said drug paraphernalia in order to possess a controlled substance which would be unlawful to possess.\" The subsequent mandate charged the jury to return a guilty verdict if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that \"defendant unlawfully and knowingly possessed with intent to use certain drug paraphernalia in order to unlawfully use marijuana or cocaine, both being controlled substances which would be unlawful to possess.\" The only substantial difference in the language of the indictment and the jury instruction is the description of the drug paraphernalia: \"scales for packaging a controlled substance.\" The underlying theory being presented to the jury is the same theory that supported the indictment for possession of drug paraphernalia. Contrary to what defendant appears to argue, \"packaging\" as used in the indictment is not a different theory of guilt. Even if defendant had properly argued plain error, there was no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant further argues that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of resisting an officer.

Even without concluding, as we did above, that Officer Norton's detention and search of defendant were reasonable under the circumstances and did not violate the Fourth Amendment, in considering the motion to dismiss, the State was entitled to every reasonable inference that could be drawn from the facts. Certainly, the facts of this case, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, support the inference that Officer Norton was discharging official duties by observing defendant, telling defendant to remain in the vehicle, and asking to search defendant after defendant reluctantly answered that defendant did not have any weapons. This evidence was sufficiently substantial to survive defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred in entering judgment on the crime of Class 1 misdemeanor possession of marijuana.

A Class 1 misdemeanor for possessing marijuana arises when an individual possesses more than one-half ounce but less than one and one-half ounces of marijuana. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(d)(4) (2003). Possession of less than one-half ounce of marijuana constitutes a Class 3 misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20S.E.2d%20114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The evidence presented at trial only supported a judgment for a Class 3 misdemeanor, and the trial court erred in entering judgment for a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While the State agrees that the evidence only supported a Class 3 misdemeanor\n   for the possession of marijuana conviction, the State argues it was a clerical error and that \"remand for imposition of judgment is unnecessary.\" The State argues that the trial court did not err in imposing the sentence because it had consolidated for sentencing the convictions of possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of drug paraphernalia is a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

As the State asserts, under our Structured Sentencing Act,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   when separate offenses of different class levels are consolidated for judgment, the trial judge is required to enter judgment containing a sentence for the conviction at the highest class. Accordingly, the trial judge is limited to the statutory sentencing guidelines, set out at N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1340.17(c), for the class level of the most serious offense, rather than any of the lesser offenses in that same consolidated judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State contends that since possession of drug paraphernalia is a Class 1 misdemeanor, when the trial court consolidated this conviction with the Class 3 misdemeanor possession of marijuana charge, the trial court had a duty to sentence defendant within the range established by our Structured Sentencing Act for a Class 1 misdemeanor. Defendant has a prior record level of III, for which, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.23(c), the appropriate sentencing range is 1-120 days. The trial court sentenced defendant to 120 days, and thus the State contends that the trial court did not err because the sentence imposed was consistent with the Structured Sentencing Act.

At the heart of the protections afforded by the fourth amendment is the requirement of individualized suspicion. Even in cases where obtaining a warrant based on probable cause is impractical, the police must have knowledge of sufficient facts to create a reasonable suspicion that the person in question has committed, or is about to commit, a crime. A showing of individualized suspicion is constitutionally required except in the rare case where the privacy interest implicated by the search or seizure is minimal and an important government interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion. The majority's abandonment of the individualized suspicion standard in this case is wholly unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The majority gratuitously asserts that the intrusion on the passenger's liberty is minimal because the car in which the passenger is traveling has already been stopped. In so ruling, however, the majority trivializes the liberty interest at stake in this case. The only encounter many citizens of this state will ever have with the police will be a routine traffic stop. Allowing police officers to arbitrarily detain passengers in vehicles stopped for traffic violations without any reason to believe the passenger has committed a crime or threatens the safety of the police officer ensures that this encounter will be annoying, frightening, and perhaps a humiliating experience. The thousands upon thousands of petty indignities legitimized by the majority opinion will have a substantial impact on the liberty and freedom of the citizens of this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is one of our most precious constitutional rights. The exercise of this right does not depend on the grace of law enforcement officials. This opinion trashes the protections of the fourth amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The majority fails to articulate any reason why a police officer would be safer if a passenger in a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation is detained at the scene rather than allowed to walk away. A police officer must have a reasonable suspicion that a passenger in a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation has committed or is about to commit a crime. This standard is more than sufficient to protect officer safety. It does no disservice to police officers to insist upon exercise of reasoned judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Those who cherish their right to be free from arbitrary invasions of privacy can only hope that a more enlightened court in a future case will restore our citizens' constitutional rights which this court has today taken away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20N.E.2d%20375\">\n    704 N.E.2d at 385-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted) (Heiple, J., Harrison, J., and Nickels, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   majority, to support its holding, noted \"a trend of decisions\" reaching similar results and cited several cases with similar holdings.

In fact, it may be even less of a privacy intrusion to order him back inside the car which is where he was prior to the stop. We cannot allow the officer's safety to depend on how fast the driver and passenger can get out of the vehicle after it has been stopped. Ordering the occupants back into the vehicle does no more than establish the status quo at the time of the stop. To hold otherwise could well lead to the unnecessary death of an officer, gunned down by those walking away who suddenly turn and fire or who circle behind the officer, either assaulting or killing him while he is talking to the driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Notably, however, as in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   majority of two was countered by a dissent, authored by the chief judge of the Court of Appeals of Arizona, Division Two, and stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Implicit in the court's ruling is the proposition that in every case in which police may stop a person, even for something as minor as driving with a broken taillight, they may seize anyone with the person stopped. Of course, any time a car is stopped everyone within it is stopped. It does not seem to me to follow, though, that those incidentally stopped are powerless to leave if they wish to and instead must remain involuntarily under police control until the police decide otherwise. Their detention is not supported by reasonable suspicion. The detention, if justified by considerations of officer safety, has to be premised on the notion that any stop creates a significant risk that those associated with the person stopped will attempt to harm the officer. That may be true when the reason for the stop is serious criminal activity. It cannot, it seems to me, be seriously argued that because danger exists sometimes, it must be assumed always to exist so as to justify the seizure of everyone present when anyone is stopped for whatever reason. No argument is made, specific to the facts of this case, that the officer felt the seizure was necessary for his safety. He testified otherwise. Instead it is justified on the broad rule that routine seizures may occur for officer safety regardless of the facts of the case. That rule, permitting wholesale seizures without individual justification, conflicts with the fourth amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1549797\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/170/372/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1549797\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/170/372/\">\n    at 374-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1549797\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/170/372/\">\n    824 P.2d at 770-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted) (Livermore, C.J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the third case cited by the majority here,\n   <em>\n    Rogala v.

Wilson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595747\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/408/#p412\">\n    519 U.S. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595747\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/408/#p412\">\n    117 S.Ct. 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595747\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/408/#p412\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (1997), the United States Supreme Court held that ordering a passenger in a stopped vehicle to step out of the vehicle was a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   intrusion because the passenger was already stopped and thus \"[t]he only change in [the passenger's] circumstances which will result from ordering [him/her] out of the car is that [he/she] will be outside of, rather than inside of, the stopped car.\" Here, in contrast, law enforcement is being empowered to dictate, at its discretion, not only the location of the passenger but also the detention and length of detention of the passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I agree with the majority that officer safety must be prioritized where safety concerns exist. In this case, such concerns did exist: The traffic stop occurred relatively late at night, in a poorly lit area, and Defendant\n   appeared agitated from the beginning. I agree with the majority that, under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the officer to decide that it was safer to have Defendant remain in the vehicle for the duration of the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   However, the existence of threats to officer safety in some cases, as in this one, does not warrant issuing to law enforcement a carte blanche for seizing anyone present when any vehicle is stopped for any reason. Requiring law enforcement to be able to articulate some objective rationale predicated on safety concerns for officers, vehicle occupants, or others to justify ordering a passenger to remain in a vehicle during a traffic stop erects a relatively low hurdle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once law enforcement meets this hurdle, I agree that the intrusion on passenger privacy is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   when balanced against safety concerns. And where the hurdle is not met, it protects North Carolinians from groundless seizures.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    I also note that both opinions cited for the second line of cases are straight concurrences.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Clearly, if law enforcement has reasonable suspicion that the passenger is engaged in criminal activity, an investigatory detention is constitutional.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
