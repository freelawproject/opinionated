After careful consideration, and for the reasons stated herein, we vacate the six judgments entered on convictions of first-degree sexual offense, reverse the remainder of the judgments entered against defendant, and remand for a new trial on the statutory rape and indecent liberties charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Evidentiary Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since application of the evidence presented by the State is crucial to our analysis of the issues presented, our discussion of the evidence presented against defendant is detailed. The State's evidence presented at trial tended to show that over a period of approximately eighteen months in 1999 and 2000, defendant engaged in a variety of sexual acts with the victim, L.D. (Lucy)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , beginning while Lucy was eleven years old. Defendant was living with, and later married to, Lucy's sister Sharlena during the period in which these acts occurred. Lucy resided with defendant and Sharlena after Lucy's mother died in August 2000, but spent many days and nights there prior to her mother's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Indecent Liberties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lucy testified that defendant's inappropriate conduct began in the summer of 1999, prior to the death of her mother, when she and defendant played a game in which defendant exposed himself to her and she lifted up her shirt for defendant. Lucy testified that later that summer, while spending the night with defendant and Sharlena in their home, she was lying on the sofa in the living room when defendant told her to lay down, got on top of her, pulled down his shorts, moved her nightgown and underwear to the side, and \"tried to stick his private part into [her].\" Lucy testified that no penetration occurred on this occasion because \"[she] kept scooting up the couch so he wouldn't.\" Lucy testified that she did not tell anyone about either of these incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lucy also testified that on one occasion during the summer of 1999, she and her younger sister D.D. (Debbie), then eight years old, were about to go swimming when defendant called them into his bedroom. Defendant, who was sitting on the bed with a towel wrapped around his waist, kissed Lucy and Debbie while masturbating. Defendant then laid down on the bed, removed the towel, and told Lucy to sit on top of him. She complied, and they simulated having sex, although defendant did not move Lucy's bathing suit out of the way. Debbie testified at trial and corroborated Lucy's testimony regarding this incident, as well as testifying that she once witnessed defendant put his hand up Lucy's shirt while they were watching a pornographic movie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Rape\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lucy further testified that she and defendant had sexual intercourse a total of thirty-two times. The first incident of possible penetration happened in the living room during an evening in December 1999 when Lucy was staying with defendant and Sharlena because her mother was in the hospital. Sharlena was not at home that evening and at the time defendant was twenty-four years old while Lucy had just turned twelve. Lucy said that while her younger brother and sister were in another room,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [defendant] told me to lay down. And I was at the edge of the couch and he told me to lay down and he tried it again. And as he was trying he stuck it-he almost\n   did, and it was hurting so I was scooting on the couch and then I ran out of the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following this incident in the living room, and later the same evening, defendant came into Lucy's room that she shared with Debbie and Sharlena's three-year-old son C.D. (Caleb). All three children were now asleep, but defendant awakened Lucy and told her to lay down on the couch in Caleb's room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LUCY: [A]nd he did it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   STATE: And what do you mean when you say \"he did it\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   LUCY: He had sex with me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   STATE: Did any of his body ever enter any of your body?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   LUCY: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   STATE: Please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury when you say he had sex with you, what do you mean? What did he do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   LUCY: He stuck his private part into mine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   STATE: Into your private part?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   LUCY: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   STATE: And that was the first time y'all actually had sex; is that right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   LUCY: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lucy testified that the next time she remembered that she had sex with defendant it took place in the living room, and that about half the time the two engaged in sex, \"about fifteen times,\" it occurred in the living room, when Sharlena was \"usually in her room asleep or gone to work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   STATE: Tell-please tell the jury anything you remember about having sex with [defendant] in the living room. Do you remember where in the living room it was?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   LUCY: Most of the time it was on the couch and then sometimes on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   STATE: Most of the time on the couch?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   LUCY: (Nodded affirmatively.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   STATE: Do you remember any of the times that were on the couch specifically?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   LUCY: Just one time I can remember.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   STATE: That you remember specifically?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   LUCY: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   STATE: Okay. Why do you remember that time?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   LUCY: (Shrugged shoulders.) I don't know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   STATE: You just do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LUCY: Yes sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   STATE: Were there any other times that you all had sex on the couch in the living room?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   LUCY: Not that I can remember.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   STATE: Do you remember having sex in the living room any other times at all?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   LUCY: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Lucy also testified that immediately following a sex act involving a screwdriver, she and defendant had intercourse. Further, she testified of one specific incident of sex with defendant on the floor of the room she shared with Caleb. This incident was distinctive in part due to the fact that Sharlena nearly saw them in the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Sexual Offense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Lucy testified to four separate occasions in which defendant penetrated her vagina with a broom, a cucumber, a hairbrush, and a screwdriver, respectively. Each of these incidents occurred on different days, each while Lucy was twelve. She said defendant inserted the broom because \"[h]e said he wanted to see how far it would go[;]\" that he inserted the hairbrush \"[t]o make him hard[;]\" and that defendant \"told [her] to play with [her]self\" with the screwdriver. Lucy testified that almost every time they had sex fellatio was also involved, and that on one occasion defendant partially inserted his penis into her anus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   STATE: Other than the times that you have described that [defendant] had sex with you, put his private in your private or put his penis in your vagina the times that you have described, did he ever put his penis in any other part of your body?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   LUCY: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   STATE: What other parts of you body did he put his penis is [sic]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LUCY: My mouth and my butt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   STATE: Do you remember how many times he put his penis in your butt?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   LUCY: Only once but it wasn't the whole thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   STATE: When did he-do you recall how many times he put his penis in your mouth?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   LUCY: Almost every time we had sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   COURT: Say it again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   LUCY: Almost all the time we had sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On 5 January 2001, Lucy's neighbor T.B. (Taylor), then twelve, spent the night with Lucy, who had been living with defendant and Sharlena since her mother's death in August 2000. Lucy testified that she fell asleep while watching television on the couch in the living room with defendant and Taylor. Lucy said that at some point she was awakened by \"sucking noises\" and became upset because she thought defendant was making \"[Taylor] suck him like he did [Lucy].\" Taylor testified at trial, and denied performing oral sex on defendant at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Lucy then went to the home of her aunt, Jannis King, who the next day overheard her talking to defendant on the telephone and crying. Ms. King suspected that defendant had been \"messing\" with Lucy and shared her suspicions with Lucy's father, who together with Ms. King, took Lucy to Nash General Hospital to be examined on 7 January 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At Nash General Hospital, Lucy spoke to a nurse, a police officer, and a victim's advocate. She denied having sex with defendant to each of them. When questioned as to the denials, Lucy testified that she did this because she was scared of defendant, and also because she loved defendant and did not want him to go to jail. Lucy told the victim's advocate that her father had touched her inappropriately when she was eight years old, and she told the police officer that she had had sex before, although she did not specify with whom. The findings from Lucy's physical examination were consistent with someone who had engaged in consensual sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At trial, three personnel from Lucy's school testified as well as the officer who investigated her case. A written statement by Lucy made during the officer's investigation was introduced. The statement was materially consistent with her trial testimony, although there was some discrepancy as to whether she and defendant began having intercourse in the summer of 1999, when Lucy was eleven, or after she turned twelve in December 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant presented evidence at trial, although he did not testify. Defendant's wife Sharlena testified that she never worked at night, that defendant took her to work every day before going to work himself, and that as a result, defendant was never alone with Lucy in their home. Sharlena testified that the walls in their home were very thin and that she was a very light sleeper, such that defendant and Lucy could not have had sex in their home without her being aware of it. Sharlena also testified that the couch, on which Lucy testified she and defendant first had intercourse, had been removed from Caleb's bedroom by December 1999. Defendant presented four other witnesses who each testified that Lucy told them she had never had sex with defendant, as well as Lucy's friend Taylor, who testified that defendant did not touch her on 5 January 2001, the night she slept at defendant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Result at Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After deliberations, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all charges. The trial court then found as an aggravating factor that defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit these offenses and sentenced defendant to consecutive sentences\n   from the aggravated range on each offense, for a total of a minimum of 3360 and a maximum of 4131 months imprisonment, or 280 to just over 344 years. From the judgments entered upon these convictions, defendant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   By his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the judgments entered on each of defendant's six first-degree sexual offense convictions must be vacated due to a fatal variance between the offense alleged in each indictment and the evidence presented at trial, along with the jury instructions. The State concedes that under controlling precedent these judgments must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The crime of first-degree sexual offense is set forth, in pertinent part, in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.4 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (a) A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the first degree if the person engages in a sexual act:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (1) With a victim who is a child under the age of 13 years and the defendant is at least 12 years old and is at least four years older than the victim; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (2) With another person by force and against the will of the other person ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.4(a) (2003). Defendant was indicted on six counts of first-degree sexual offense, with each indictment being identical, save the case number, and all bearing the dates of \"May 1, 1999 thru December 6, 2000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The jurors for the State upon their oath present that on or about the date of the offense shown and in the county named above the defendant named above unlawfully, willfully and feloniously did engage in a sex offense with [Lucy],\n   <em>\n    by force and against the victim's will.\n   </em>\n   This act was in violation of [N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.4(a)].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Each of the six indictments for first-degree sexual offense utilized the short-form indictment language authorized by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15-144.2(a) to charge defendant with first degree sexual offense, on the theory that the alleged sexual offenses were committed by force and against the victim's will. None of the six indictments for first degree sexual offense utilized the short-form indictment language authorized by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15-144.2(b) to charge defendant with first degree sexual offense pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.4(a)(1), on the theory that the alleged sexual offenses were committed against a victim under the age of thirteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Further, our review of the record indicates that the trial court instructed the jury regarding the first degree sexual offense charges on the theory that Lucy was under the age of thirteen at the time of the alleged offenses, not on the theory that the alleged offenses were forcible. Moreover, the State did not present any evidence that the alleged offenses were forcible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"`It has long been the law of this State that a defendant must be convicted, if convicted at all, of the particular offense charged in the warrant or bill of indictment.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Without some guidance from the trial court in its instructions, we are not convinced that the jury will not decide defendant is guilty of two \"counts\" of indecent liberties, sexual fondling and pornographic pictures, when only one offense was committed with two alternative acts forming the element of an immoral act. Likewise, if the number of clearly separate incidents of indecent liberties presented by the State is six, but the jury is given four identical verdict sheets with no specification of which sheet relates to which incident, then a unanimity issue arises.

Likewise, the verdict forms were all identical, all without any indication as to which offense, other than the case number, the verdict form related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, the jury instructions do not reveal any guidance offered by the trial court regarding the jury's need to unanimously agree on which three incidents of indecent liberties and which five incidents of rape served the basis of their eight verdicts.

Indeed, there was: 1) the incident where defendant exposed himself, 2) the incident on the couch in the living room where defendant pushed aside Lucy's nightgown and tried to have sex with her, and 3) the incident in which defendant simulated having sex with Lucy while she was wearing a bathing suit. Prior to deliberations, the State made no election that these three incidents were the basis of defendant's three charges, but on appeal argue as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We do not disagree that these incidents do support the charges, but cannot also overlook the fact that there was evidence of numerous incidents of rape as well as multiple incidents of sexual offense in the first degree. There was also evidence of at least one additional isolated incident of an immoral act standing by itself: Debbie's testimony that defendant stuck his hand up Lucy's shirt while they were watching a pornographic film. If several jurors in voting guilty to three counts of indecent liberties were relying on one, two, or even more incidents where rape or sexual offense occurred, while others focused on the three incidents the State suggests or some combination altogether different, all of the incidents would have supported a finding of guilty but potentially none of the jurors were unanimous in which incidents supported which verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999162\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/165/548/\">\n    165 N.C.App. at 561-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%2087\">\n    599 S.E.2d at 97-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Further, there is no way to tell that the jury did not incorrectly decide that alternative acts during one sexual incident supported multiple counts of the crime charged. The incident of simulated sex on the bed where both girls were wearing their bathing suits contained potentially three immoral acts: defendant's masturbating in front of Lucy, his kissing her under the circumstances, and the simulated sex itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   With no instruction from the trial court or election by the State, we are not convinced that the risk of a nonunanimous verdict was avoided in this case. According to our appellate decisions, during the eighteen month span that the State presented evidence on, the jury could have found defendant guilty of more than fifteen counts of indecent liberties with a minor.

On appeal, the State argues that there were five incidents of rape: 1) one of partial penetration on the couch in the living room, and 2) another incident of penetration following that night on the couch in Casper's room; 3) an additional specific incident of sex on the couch in the living room; 4) sex after the incident with the screwdriver; and 5) one incident of sex on the floor in Caleb's room, the incident which Sharlena almost witnessed. Again, we do not disagree with these incidents supporting five counts of rape; but there is still ambiguity in which incidents support which verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   First, the State overlooks the fact that Lucy testified she and defendant had intercourse thirty-two times. Without more, this testimony does not support thirty-two counts but indeed does support one count of rape, under the theory of generic testimony.\n   <em>\n    See supra,\n   </em>\n   n. 5. Further, the jury was not told that they could find only one count from this testimony. Some of the jurors may have relied on this testimony in determining the number of incidents of rape, some may not have. Second, despite testimony that the dates in Lucy's written statement were inaccurate, her statement placed the first incident of sex at an earlier date, summer of 1999, rather than the first descriptive incident in December 1999. As such, the jury may have found Lucy's statement supported evidence of a separate count of rape not included in the State's calculations. Third, at trial, while the State offered no indication as to which incidents of rape supported the five counts, it did reference the occasion defendant had intercourse with Lucy on the couch in Caleb's room as \"the first time [the two] actually had sex.\" If the State represented to the jury that that incident was first, on appeal it is now argued as the\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   incident the two had intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   By any calculation the risk of a nonunanimous verdict arises. Adding the generic testimony of intercourse occurring thirty-two times and the potential reliance on Lucy's statement into the State's contention on appeal provides the jury with the ability to find defendant guilty of seven counts of rape. Following the State's argument at trial may actually give rise to five counts of rape, but only if the generic testimony is included as one and the characterized \"partial penetration\" on the couch in the living room and statement that sex occurred in summer of 1999 are not. It remains evident, however,\n   that absent any additional instruction, we cannot be assured there was no ambiguity or nonunanimity in the verdict.\n   <em>\n    See Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999162\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/165/548/\">\n    165 N.C.App. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%2087\">\n    599 S.E.2d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Wiggins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8959393\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/583/\">\n    161 N.C.App. at 592-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 S.E.2d at 408-09. As such, we reverse defendant's remaining convictions of rape: 01 CRS 09516, 01 CRS 09517, 01 CRS 09518, 01 CRS 09520, and 01 CRS 51631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendant was charged with six counts of first-degree sexual offense, five counts of first-degree rape, and three counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor.

We also reviewed the indictments, instructions, evidence, and verdict sheets in defendant's remaining charges for rape and indecent liberties. Since no jury instruction, indictment, or verdict sheet distinguished which incidents of the respective crimes the jury was finding defendant guilty of,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   there was evidence of more incidents presented than the respective charges, the risk of a nonunanimous jury verdict arose.

The gravamen of the indecent liberties statute (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-202.1) is to criminalize the performance of a sexual act with a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The evil the legislature sought to prevent in this context was the defendant's performance of any immoral, improper, or indecent act in the presence of a child `for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire.' Defendant's purpose for committing such act is the gravamen of this offense; the particular act performed is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    Hartness,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5306007\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/326/561/#p565\">\n    326 N.C. at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=391%20S.E.2d%20177\">\n    391 S.E.2d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the particular act or conduct is not the gravamen of the offense, but only one of several alternative ways to establish a single wrong. The indecent liberties statute proscribes \"any immoral, improper or indecent liberties.\" Therefore, \"even if some jurors found that the defendant engaged in one kind of sexual misconduct, while others found that he engaged in another, `the jury as a whole would unanimously find that there occurred sexual conduct within the ambit of any immoral, improper, or indecent liberties.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Lyons\n   </em>\n   at 305-06, 412 S.E.2d at 313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In the instant case defendant was charged and convicted by a jury of\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   three counts of Taking Indecent Liberties with a Minor. At trial the victim testified to three specific acts which constituted Taking Indecent Liberties with a Minor: (1) \"the game\" where defendant exposed his private parts and victim lifted her shirt; (2) where defendant touched his private part to the victim's private part; and (3) where defendant masturbated in front of victim and her sister. The three acts testified to by the victim were the three acts the jury relied upon in reaching their guilty verdicts as to Taking Indecent Liberties. While it is not readily apparent from the record, the majority opinion mentions that some jurors\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have relied upon a fourth act-defendant's hand under the victim's shirt-as a basis for their verdict. Regardless, such reliance does not present a unanimity problem. As our case law clearly holds, where the jury found sexual conduct which constitutes an immoral, improper or indecent act, such is sufficient for a unanimous verdict of the whole jury.\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   at 305-06, 412 S.E.2d at 313. Therefore, with respect to the convictions of Taking Indecent Liberties, as in\n   <em>\n    Hartness,\n   </em>\n   I would find \"[t]he risk of a nonunanimous verdict does not arise in cases such as the one at bar because the statute proscribing indecent liberties does not list, as elements of the offense, discrete criminal activities in the disjunctive....\"\n   <em>\n    Hartness,\n   </em>\n   326 N.C. at 567,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=391%20S.E.2d%20177\">\n    391 S.E.2d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The majority also states that because there were multiple incidences of rape, the jury could have used such incidences to support a conviction of indecent liberties, and then further states that because there was \"no instruction from the trial court or election by the State [they, (the majority) were] not\n   convinced that the risk of a nonunanimous verdict was avoided in this case.\" This type of analysis the majority puts forth\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   on appeal is troubling because it extends the concept of unanimity far beyond what the law requires and beyond what is reasonable for child sexual abuse cases in North Carolina. No election by the state nor further instruction by the trial court is required under our law. Therefore, failure to further instruct the jury or to have the state elect which incidences to use to support the charges of Taking Indecent Liberties is not error, and cannot serve as the basis for overturning a unanimous jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    First Degree Statutory Rape\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The disjunctive analysis used in first degree sexual offense and taking indecent liberties cases does not apply to rape cases. Here, the majority says there is ambiguity as to which incidents support which verdicts of rape. At trial the victim testified, describing five very specific instances of rape: (1) partial penetration on the couch; (2) penetration on couch in Casper's room; (3) penetration on couch in living room; (4) penetration following incident with screwdriver; (5) penetration on floor in Casper's room. After hearing all the testimony, five separate verdict sheets as to the rape offenses were presented to the jury\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the jury returned verdicts of guilty on five counts of rape. Based on\n   <em>\n    State v. Wiggins,\n   </em>\n   this, without more, is sufficient to defeat a unanimity argument. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Wiggins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8959393\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/583/\">\n    161 N.C.App. 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=589%20S.E.2d%20402\">\n    589 S.E.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (holding where the number of qualifying incidents testified to by the victim at trial was the same as the number of qualifying incidents on the verdict sheets submitted, there was no danger of lack of unanimity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Moreover, defendant in the instant case raises the unanimity argument out of thin air. There was no objection at trial because nothing objectionable occurred. The evidence was presented. The jury was instructed on all issues, including unanimity\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   . There were no questions or other indications from the jury to suggest any confusion as to their duty in the trial. The jury deliberated and reached a decision on all counts submitted to them in less than 1 and 1/2 hours. Upon return of the verdicts, all jurors indicated assent to their verdict. In fact, all jurors were polled individually, the charges read to them using the applicable CRS number, and each juror affirmed their unanimous verdict in open court, as to each charge submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Clearly, the verdicts in this case do not raise a danger of lack of unanimity. Is there any rational basis upon which the jury could have found defendant committed one act of rape but not another? The defendant's defense was simply \"I did not do it.\" In the instant case, where nothing occurred during the course of trial nor during jury deliberations to raise a concern, where is the showing of error in the court's instructions or a lack of unanimity?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The courts properly presume that jurors pay close attention to the instructions of the trial judge in criminal cases and that they \"undertake to understand, comprehend, and follow the instructions as given.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There must be more than a \"possibility of a non-unanimous verdict\" to overturn a unanimous jury verdict. We cannot decide cases based on speculation of what might have been. Perhaps the greatest danger posed by the majority opinion is that it would allow a convicted defendant to speculate on appeal, as to what a jury might have done during the course of deliberations at trial and with no indication the jury struggled with unanimity issues, grant defendant a new trial based on speculation. The burden is on defendant to show prejudicial error in order to have his conviction reversed and a new trial granted. Here, the evidence of record shows the jury was instructed on the law by the trial court, the jury was presented with a total of 14 separate verdicts sheets as to three specific types of sexual crimes, the jury had no questions or concerns during the course of deliberations, and in a fairly short time the jury convicted defendant in unanimous verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In my opinion, this defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error as to his convictions of Taking Indecent Liberties with a Minor and First Degree Statutory Rape rendered by a unanimous jury in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   ---------------\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <a href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fr2-2\" name=\"fr2-2\">\n    7.\n   </a>\n   \"I instruct you that a verdict is not a verdict until all twelve jurors agree unanimously as to what your decision shall be ...
