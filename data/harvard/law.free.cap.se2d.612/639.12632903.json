(D.O.B. 1 November 1996), J.S.L. (D.O.B. 18 February 1998), C.L.L. (D.O.B. 23 December 2000) based on the grounds of neglect, willfully leaving the children in foster care for more than twelve months without a showing of reasonable progress, and willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 15 August 2001, Guilford County Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a petition alleging that the three children were neglected. The matter came for non-secure custody hearing and a \"7-Day\" hearing on 16 August 2001 and 30 August 2001, respectively. The children were in the care of their maternal grandparents at the time of the hearings; and the district court ordered care to be continued with the grandparents and for legal custody to remain with DSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The neglect adjudication and disposition hearing was held on 4 October 2001, and an order was filed on 2 January 2002, finding the children remained neglected. No further review hearings were held until 10 January 2002, at which time a permanency planning review hearing was held. The district court ordered care to be continued with the grandparents, basing its order on the recommendations of the guardian ad litem and social workers involved in the case. A second permanency planning review hearing was held on 7 March 2002, at which time the district court rendered an order finding that it would be in the best interest of the children for the respondent's parental rights to be terminated. The district court continued care of the children with the maternal grandparents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 6 May 2002, DSS filed a petition seeking the termination of respondent's parental rights based on the grounds of neglect, willfully leaving the children in foster care for more than twelve months without a showing of reasonable progress, and willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care. This matter came for hearing at the 19 and 22 August 2002 session of Guilford County District Court with the Honorable Wendy M. Enochs presiding. The district court terminated respondent's parental rights, based on the grounds alleged, by order filed 7 October 2002. Respondent gave notice of appeal in open court and written notice of appeal on 7 October 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondent presents several issues on appeal including whether: (I) the district court's adjudication and disposition order must be vacated because the order was filed more than 30 days following the date of hearing; (II) the district court's decision must be reversed because it failed to appoint a guardian ad litem for the children; (III) the district court's order should be reversed because DSS failed to accord any respect to the Native American heritage of the children in violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act; (IV) the district court's order must be reversed because the TPR petition did not allege the ground of neglect, and the findings were not based upon clear, cogent and convincing evidence; and (V) the district court's order must be reversed because it was not in the best interest of the children to terminate respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Respondent first argues the district court's adjudication and disposition order must be\n   vacated because the order was filed more than 30 days following the date of hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   N.C.

Specifically, the petition alleged that respondent-mother and father did not follow through with all the components of their case plan with DSS. The respondent-mother and father submitted to drug tests on 16 August 2001 and both tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. With regard to employment, the respondent-mother failed to hold a job since the children were placed in custody, and the father failed to go to work although he was employed. Respondent-mother and father failed to obtain and maintain stable housing and take the appropriate steps towards reunification. Moreover, their visits were sporadic and they failed to pay child support while the children have been in DSS custody.

The Court finds pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(1), the Respondents have neglected their Children. The Children were adjudicated neglected and dependent on or about October 4, 2001. The conditions which led to the adjudication of neglect and dependency and DSS custody of the children are as follows: the parents' unstable living conditions, the parents' continued drug use and the extensive DSS history on the family relating back to 1997 involving the same issues. The parents entered into a service agreement on 8/16/01. In this agreement the parents agreed to:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1) Obtain an ADS assessment and comply with recommendations in order to live a drug free lifestyle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2) Submit to random drug tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3) Cooperate with DSS by contacting their Social Worker at least twice a month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   4) Locate and maintain employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   5) Apply at least 3 places a week for employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   6) Locate and maintain stable housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   7) Attend parenting classes and demonstrate their skills learned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Neither parent complied with the terms of this service agreement or its updated versions on March 15, 2002 and June 20, 2002.... Overall neither parent has made significant effort to correct or improve the conditions which led to DSS custody of the children and therefore the Respondents continue to neglect the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2. Incorporating the finding of fact in Paragraph 1, above, the Court finds pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2), the Respondent has willfully left the Children in the foster care placement outside of the home\n   for more than 12 months without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under the circumstances has been made within 12 months in correcting those conditions which left to the removal of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   3. The Court finds pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(3), the Children have been placed in the custody of DSS and the Respondents have for a continuous period of six months next preceding the filing of the Petition, willfully failed for such period to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for the Children although physically and financially able to do so....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   4. The Court finds that it is in the best interest of the Children that the parental rights of [B.J.L.] and [J.L.] be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   5. The Court finds that this Petition to Terminate Parental Rights was not filed to circumvent the provisions of Chapter 50A of the North Carolina General Statutes, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, and the Court would have jurisdiction to make a Child custody determination pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 50A-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   From these findings, the district court concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (1) The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (2) The grounds alleged in the Petition to Terminate Parental Rights filed on or about May 6, 2002 and as set forth herein, have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (3) It is the best interest of the Children that the parental rights of the Respondents [B.J.L.] and [J.L.] be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In reviewing the evidence, we find the evidence competent to support termination of respondent's parental rights pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2). The district court made sufficient findings regarding respondent's progress or lack thereof. The children were adjudicated neglected and dependent on 4 October 2001. The TPR petitions were filed on 7 October 2002. Prior to that date, the record reflects that the children resided with their grandparents and great grandparents for six months without the parents providing any support; the parents had been using drugs; and respondent and her family had a history of involvement with DSS going back to 1997. Moreover, respondent failed to comply with the service agreement entered into on 16 August 2001. Respondent attempted to justify her non-compliance due to lack of transportation. However, she acknowledged that she could have taken the bus to look for employment and make her appointments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We hold that the evidence is sufficient to establish that respondent willfully left her children in foster care without making reasonable progress under the circumstances to correct the conditions which led to removal of the children pursuant to N.C.
