The relevant facts are fully reported in the opinion of the Supreme Court and will not be restated here. See id., 739-40. It has been determined that the unused underground gasoline storage tanks, once used by an automobile service station, constitute an \u201cexisting facility\u201d that has been \u201ctemporarily out-of-service\u201d since 1944. Id., 744; see also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (a). Accordingly, \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (f) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, concerning the reporting and transfer of a \u201cnew or existing facility,\u201d applies. Thus, we must now consider the remaining issues previously raised. See <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>27 Conn. App. 353, 355, 606 A.2d 1001 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The plaintiff sought to rescind the sale of the property. \u201c[T]he decision to award a remedy for rescission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>for breach of contract always depends upon a showing of what justice requires in the particular circumstances, and thus necessarily rests in the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Burt\u2019s Spirit Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>215 Conn. 355, 361, 576 A.2d 1267 (1990). In the present case, the trial court properly awarded the plaintiff rescission of the real estate conveyance. Rescission was appropriate because of the defendants\u2019 \u201cnegligent concealment\u201d and failure to follow the regulation of the department of environmental protection mandating disclosure of the existence of the tanks to a transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The plaintiff also sought to recover the value of improvements made to the property in question. The trial court found that the plaintiff\u2019s property presumptively had historic value and that the plaintiff had presented no evidence of an increase in the value of the property by virtue of his improvements. Absent clear error, the trier\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed. <em>Season-All Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>R. J. Grosso, Inc., </em>213 Conn. 486, 498, 569 A.2d 32 (1990); <em>Wilcox Trucking, Inc. v.Mansour Builders, Inc., </em>20 Conn. App. 420, 425, 567 A.2d 1250 (1989), cert. denied, 214 Conn. 804, 573 A.2d 318 (1990). Accordingly, the trial court properly held that the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof and could not recover for claimed improvements on the theory of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
