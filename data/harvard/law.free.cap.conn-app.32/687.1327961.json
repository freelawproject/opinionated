Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 598, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990). When a defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to charge as requested, \u201cwe must adopt the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, the following facts can be found. On July 29,1991, shortly before midnight, the defendant and two friends, Eugene McCallum and Crystal Copeland, left the defendant\u2019s apartment to buy cigarettes and food at a local service station and convenience store in Danbury. The defendant had permission to use his cousin\u2019s van. Because the defendant did not have a driver\u2019s license, he asked McCallum to drive. When they arrived at the service station, the defendant and Copeland entered the store, made their purchases and returned to the van. The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>seated behind the driver\u2019s seat and Copeland was seated in the passenger seat. A car pulled up as the defendant and his friends were preparing to leave the service station. The victim and three others emerged from the car and the victim approached the driver\u2019s side of the van, demanding that the van be turned over to him in payment for a debt he claimed the defendant\u2019s cousin owed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">When the defendant stated he did not know about the debt and refused to relinquish the van, the victim reached into the van and began slapping and punching the defendant in the face and head. McCallum started to drive away, but the victim hung on to the driver\u2019s open window, causing McCallum to stop the van. At that point, the victim resumed striking the defendant despite the defendant\u2019s pleas for the victim to stop. The defendant could not dodge the blows because the back of the van was cluttered with what the defendant referred to as junk, tool boxes, a bicycle and clothes. The defendant tried to tell the victim that he was willing to contact his cousin to determine whether the victim was entitled to the van. After the victim threatened to kill him, the defendant grabbed a loaded .22 caliber pistol that was kept in the van, asked the victim to leave him alone, and shot him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant then instructed McCallum to drive back to his apartment. En route, the defendant continuously denied shooting the victim when McCallum stated that he had. Approximately two hours later, at the Danbury hospital, the victim died from the gunshot wound. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>defendant testified that he was afraid because of the victim\u2019s assault on him and because he was having difficulty breathing due to his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The victim was eighteen years old. The autopsy report revealed that he was about five feet nine inches tall and weighed 150 pounds. The defendant, in contrast, was fifty-five years old, five feet six inches tall and 118 pounds on the day of the shooting. He was taking medication on that day for shortness of breath, pneumonia and pain. He suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema and had been diagnosed with the AIDS<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> virus.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">A person is entitled to a proper jury instruction on the elements of every defense the legislature has created so that the jury may determine whether the state has sustained its burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>supra. \u201cIf the defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction. . . . [A] defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 597. \u201cThe primary purpose of the charge to the jury is to assist them in applying the law correctly to the facts which they find to be established. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 603; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>30 Conn. App. 406, 412, 620 A.2d 817, cert. granted, 225 Conn. 916, 625 A.2d 1026 (1993). We find that the charge given performed this function. Instead of giving the requested charge, the trial court instructed the jury pursuant to \u00a7 53a-19 (a) that the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>of deadly physical force is justified if the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The defendant\u2019s requested instruction on the use of deadly physical force in defense of robbery first defined robbery and larceny. It then stated: \u201cRobbery, under our law, is a crime of violence. Under our self-defense statute and under the Common Law, the use of deadly physical force is justified when the defendant reasonably believes he is being robbed. I have defined robbery for you. The class of crimes in prevention of which a man may, if necessary, exercise his natural right to repel force by force to the taking of the life of the aggressor, are felonies which are committed by violence and surprise, and include robbery. Therefore, if you find from the evidence that a reasonable person in [the defendant\u2019s] position on July 30, 1991, in the [service station] would have felt that [the victim] was attempting to rob him, then you will find that the use of deadly physical force was justified and you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\u201cA request to charge which is relevant to the issues of the case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given. A refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance. ... If omission of an instruction was improper, our review is limited to whether, as a result, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.\u201d (Citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>216 Conn. 647, 663, 583 A.2d 915 (1990); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>supra. The trial court properly declined to instruct the jury in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request because it is an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">A person is not permitted to use deadly physical force in self-defense just because that person reasonably believed that the victim was attempting to rob that person. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-19 and 53a-21.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-21 explicitly states that deadly physical force, such as that used by the defendant, may be used only in defense of person as provided by \u00a7 53a-19. Therefore, the crux of the inquiry is not whether the defendant reasonably believed he was being robbed, but whether the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was using or about to use deadly physical force or was inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a). Because the requested instruction on the use of deadly physical force omitted reference to the criteria set out in \u00a7 53a-19, it would have essentially allowed the jury to acquit the defendant of the crimes charged merely on the basis of the perceived threat of robbery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the defendant\u2019s request to charge was not an accurate statement of the law, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims relating to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court failed to cure properly its incorrect instruction that self-defense was inapplicable to the lesser included offenses of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The defense of self-defense is applicable to the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3), manslaughter in the second degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56, and criminally negligent homicide, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 584-86, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 467, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Prior to the charge on the law of self-defense, the court explained the elements of the crime of murder. After charging the jury on self-defense, the court defined the law on the lesser included offenses of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The defendant took exception to the trial court\u2019s charge, contending that it did not clearly state that self-defense applies to the lesser included offenses. The court then called the jury back to the courtroom and charged in pertinent part: \u201cSo, if you find the murder, you\u2019d stop right there. If you don\u2019t find the murder, and you don\u2019t find self-defense, you go to intentional manslaughter, then to reckless manslaughter if you don\u2019t find intentional manslaughter, then to reckless manslaughter in the second degree if you don\u2019t find it in the first degree, if you don\u2019t find second degree manslaughter, then you\u2019ll go on to criminally negligent homicide.\u201d The jury was excused, but later returned asking the court to \u201cClarify order of issues we need to deliberate. For example, intent to kill, self-defense, etcetera, then written description of law and charges.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to what the question meant, the forewoman said, \u201cI think what we mean is the \u2014 do you have to establish this intent to \u2014 to kill someone before you establish that it was self-defense?\u201d A second juror said, \u201cYour Honor, you gave us a sequence, I believe, for how we should proceed in our deliberations.\u201d The court repeated its earlier instructions and added, \u201cSo the only thing self-defense applies to is the question of murder \u2014 the issue of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The next morning, the trial court corrected this instruction by telling the jury that \u201cif you find self-defense in this case, then you cannot find Mr. Harrison guilty of anything.\u201d Later, in response to the jury\u2019s request for reinstruction on both subsections of manslaughter in the first degree, the court stated, \u201cself-defense applies to manslaughter in the first degree, both subsections.\u201d After further deliberation, the jury requested an instruction on reckless manslaughter in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), and the trial court read the charge but did not restate that self-defense applied to this offense. The defendant took exception to the court\u2019s failure to state explicitly that self-defense applies to the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">According to the defendant, these instructions were insufficient to cure the court\u2019s incorrect instructions because the trial court\u2019s curative instructions conflicted with the original instructions. The state agrees that the trial court\u2019s statements on the inapplicability of the defense of self-defense to the lesser included offenses were improper, but argues that the court\u2019s curative instructions removed from the minds of the jurors any misleading impression as to the applicability of self-defense to the lesser included offenses. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">While it is true that \u201c \u2018an instruction containing a misstatement of the law is more likely to be prejudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>cial than an instruction that contains an omission or an incomplete statement of the law\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>supra, 664, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 198, 502 A.2d 858 (1985); an incorrect instruction to the jury may be cured by a later correct instruction that may be made when the jury is called back or returns for further instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>169 Conn. 256, 262, 362 A.2d 983 (1975). We note again that when we review individual instructions we do not read each instruction in artificial isolation from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The trial court\u2019s two curative instructions on the applicability of self-defense removed from the minds of the jury any confusion as to the applicability of self-defense to the lesser included offenses. The failure of the trial court to discuss self-defense in connection with the lesser included offenses of murder is harmless error where, as in the present case, the trial court states that if the defendant acted in self-defense, the jury must find the defendant not guilty. Id., 588; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 467. We have found harmful error where the trial court failed to instruct the jury that self-defense applied to the lesser included offenses of intentional homicide and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on a lesser included offense on which the jury was not permitted to consider the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>24 Conn. App. 586, 590-91, 590 A.2d 490, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 912, 573 A.2d 136 (1991). Here, the jury specifically requested reinstruction on both subsections and the jury convicted the defendant of reckless manslaughter in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The jury, therefore, convicted the defendant of a lesser included offense to which it had been explicitly instructed to apply the law of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The defendant also asserts that the court\u2019s failure to instruct on self-defense in its reinstruction on man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>slaughter in the first degree was improper. We disagree because the court specifically stated that self-defense applies to manslaughter in the first and second degrees and the jury requested only the \u201cdescription\u201d of reckless manslaughter in the first degree, not self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim involving the charge on self-defense is that the trial court failed to instruct properly on the subjective perspective of the defendant in defining the degree of force available to a defendant claiming self-defense. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly defined the degree of force available to a defendant asserting self-defense because the court, on three occasions, told the jury that \u201c [reasonable force is the amount of force that would be used by an average person of ordinary intelligence acting under the same circumstances.\u201d The defendant asserts that the trial court should have directed the jury to consider the amount of force that would be used by a terminally ill geriatric patient who had one half of the average person\u2019s normal lung capacity and who was being struck by a healthy young man.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">\u201cOur case law interpreting General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 requires . . . that the test for the degree of force in self-defense is a subjective-objective one. The jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. . . . [\u00b6] owe ver . . . the defendant\u2019s belief ultimately must be found to be reasonable. . . . The starting point of the jury\u2019s inquiry into whether reasonable force was used by a defendant is whether the defendant believed that deadly force was necessary to repel the attack. . . . Next the jury\u2019s inquiry should focus on the question of whether that belief was reasonable. . . . This statutory emphasis on the defendant. . . demonstrates the function of the jury in their evaluation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the self-defense claim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Reading the instruction as a whole, we find that in each instance, just before giving the challenged instruction the trial court clearly and properly reiterated the instruction on the subjective/objective test. The trial court stated that \u201c[a] person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself from <em>what he believes reasonably, </em>to be the imminent use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Additionally, the trial court emphasized that the jury must view the danger from the defendant\u2019s standpoint at the time of the attack. Finally, the trial court stated that in determining whether the amount of force used in this case was reasonable, the jury could consider \u201csuch factors such as the physical attributes of the parties involved including age, sex, height, weight . . . [and] the type of injuries inflicted by each party, if any, and the degree of severity of those injuries.\u201d The trial court sufficiently apprised the jury of the law relating to the test for the degree of force that may be used justifiably in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In his final claim relating to the charge on self-defense, the defendant maintains that the trial court failed to instruct the jury sufficiently that the state, in disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, was required to prove that the defendant had actual knowledge of his ability to retreat in complete safety. Section 53a-19 (b) (1) states that a person is not justified in using deadly physical force if the person claiming the defense of justification knew that the necessity of using such force could be avoided with complete safety by retreating. The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s initial charge that \u201cin most circumstances, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>person must retreat from the perceived harm if he is able to do so with complete safety.\u201d This statement is the very charge our Supreme Court found to be improper because it replaced the subjective/objective standard set out in \u00a7 53a-19. <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 46, 547 A.2d 534 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Although the challenged instruction is improper, the jury was not misled since the court later cured this incorrect statement of the law on retreat. In its principal charge, the trial court stated that \u201ca person is never justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating.\u201d Furthermore, when the defendant excepted to the challenged instruction, the court recalled the jury and reinstructed as follows: \u201cWith respect to retreat . . . the state has to prove that the person who is alleging self-defense could have retreated; secondly, he should know that he could retreat with safety. That goes back again to the subjective standard.\u201d The court sufficiently explained that the state carried the burden of proving the defendant had actual knowledge of his ability to retreat safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s supplementary instructions did not adequately inform the jury that the state carries the burden of proving that the defendant knew he could avoid the necessity of using such force by retreating is also without merit. The trial court repeatedly stated that the state bore the burden of disproving the defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that several improper evidentiary rulings had the cumulative effect of denying him his fundamental constitutional right to present a defense. He argues that the trial court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>(1) refused to admit into evidence the defendant\u2019s medical records from Danbury Hospital, (2) excluded testimony by the defendant of knowledge of his life expectancy, and (3) failed to admit evidence of specific acts of violence committed by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\u201cFew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973). In exercising this right, the defendant \u201cmust comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 375-76, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978). The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution does not authorize a defendant to present every piece of evidence the defendant desires to present, although exclusionary rules of evidence cannot be applied \u201cmechanistically\u201d to deprive the defendant of his rights. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 376. If, however, the evidence submitted is not relevant, the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not affected and the evidence should be excluded. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra; <em>In re Adalberto S., </em>27 Conn. App. 49, 57, 604 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1328 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 167, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 225, 506 A.2d 125 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 658-59, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). Its evidentiary rulings will be set aside only where there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliman, </em>214 Conn. 38, 50, 570 A.2d 680 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>supra, 167-68; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra; <em>In re Adalberto S., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>supra, 57. \u201cAs a general principle, evidence is relevant if it has a tendency to establish the existence of a material fact. One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>163 Conn. 241, 243, 304 A.2d 36 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>supra, 517; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>3 Conn. App. 374, 383, 489 A.2d 386, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 803, 492 A.2d 1239 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 376; <em>State </em>v. <em>James L., </em>26 Conn. App. 81, 83, 598 A.2d 663 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The defendant contends that his medical history and his own knowledge of his life expectancy were relevant to substantiate his \u201cstate of mind\u201d at the time of the shooting. The trial court found that the proffered evidence was irrelevant because the defendant failed to offer any testimony that his medical condition or the knowledge of his life expectancy had influenced his assessment of the need to use deadly physical force against the victim. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court improperly excluded evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence. The defendant claims that evidence of a number of unprovoked and mindless acts of violence committed by the victim on prior occasions established the victim\u2019s propensity for violence. He contends that the proffered evidence demonstrates that he was subject to an extreme level of aggression by the victim, justifying his use of a deadly weapon in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">A victim\u2019s violent character may be proven by reputation, testimony or opinion evidence, or by evidence of the deceased\u2019s convictions of crimes of violence. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>v. <em>Miranda, </em>176 Conn. 107, 114, 405 A.2d 622 (1978). It may not, however, be proven by evidence of other specific acts. Id., 112-13; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>31 Conn. App. 58, 66, 623 A.2d 506 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>29 Conn. App. 704, 713-14, 618 A.2d 43, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 904, 621 A.2d 287, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 3057, 125 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webley, </em>17 Conn. App. 200, 206, 551 A.2d 428 (1988). \u201cSpecific acts of violence, other than convictions, may not be introduced to show a victim\u2019s violent character because such evidence has the potential to surprise, to arouse prejudice, to multiply the issues and confuse the jury, and to prolong the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 112 .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 18, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>supra, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In an offer of proof, the defendant attempted to introduce the victim\u2019s youthful offender adjudications for assault in two separate incidents as records of convictions under <em>Miranda. </em>Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-76k, \u201cno youth shall be denominated a criminal by reason of such determination [of youthful offender status], nor shall such determination be deemed a conviction.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Reiser, </em>196 Conn. 122, 128, 491 A.2d 382 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 668, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987) (youthful offender \u201ctreatment\u201d is not a \u201ccrime\u201d or \u201ca criminal conviction\u201d in Connecticut); <em>State </em>v. <em>Eric T., </em>8 Conn. App. 607, 615, 513 A.2d 1273 (1986) (adjudication as a youthful offender is a determination of status, rather than a conviction for the underlying offenses or charges). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding these prior violent acts because they were not convictions. Further, the defendant\u2019s right to prove the victim\u2019s violent character was protected by the trial court\u2019s admission of the victim\u2019s prior conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>assault in the third degree, and by testimony from numerous witnesses that the victim had a reputation for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Finally, the cumulative impact of these rulings did not deny the defendant his constitutional right to present a defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>28 Conn. App. 833, 849, 614 A.2d 438, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 227 Conn. 518, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...

This evidence is significant as the defendant contends that the shot was fired at close range whereas the state claims that the shot was fired from a distance greater than three feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> The trial court charged, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cA defendant claiming a justification of self defense is permitted to use deadly force only in two broad circumstances. He may justifiably use deadly force only when he reasonably believed that the other person was using or about to use deadly physical force, or two, inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.
