Dalbec, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Michael Dearington, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Philip Scarpellino, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellant (state).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-6\"><em>Barry N.

The state claims that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal because he had already commenced serving his sentence. The state further claims that even if the court had jurisdiction, it improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The defendant was charged in a two count information with operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c) and reckless driving in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222. On March 31, 1991, the defendant was found guilty by a jury on both counts. The trial court sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of one year, execution suspended after nine months, with two years probation, 200 hours of community service and a $750 f\u00edne on the operating under suspension count. On the reckless driving count, the defendant was sentenced to a term of thirty days, consecutive to the operating under suspension sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>and a $300 fine, for a total effective sentence of one year and thirty days imprisonment, execution suspended after ten months, with two years probation, 200 hours of community service and $1050 in fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The execution of the defendant\u2019s sentence was stayed until April 7,1992, at which time the trial court heard and subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s posttrial motions, including a motion for judgment of acquittal. Shortly thereafter, the defendant began serving his sentence. On May 19,1992, nearly six weeks into that sentence, the defendant filed a motion to reargue his previously denied motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court granted reargument and, following a hearing on May 22, 1992, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on the operating under suspension conviction only.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The state first claims that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal after he had commenced service of the sentence. The defendant counters by claiming that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 934<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided the trial court with the necessary jurisdiction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cIn a criminal case the imposition of sentence is the judgment of the court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 463, 262 A.2d 166 (1969). \u201c \u2018When the sentence is put into effect and the prisoner is taken in execution, custody is transferred from the court to the custodian of the penal institution. At this point jurisdiction of the court over the prisoner terminates. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 424-25, 545 A.2d 559 (1988). Once jurisdiction over the prisoner terminates, the sentencing \u201ccourt may no longer take any action affecting the sentence unless it has been expressly authorized to act.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuszynski, </em>23 Conn. App. 201, 206, 579 A.2d 1100 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 123, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>Kohlfuss </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>149 Conn. 692, 695-96,183 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 928, 83 S. Ct. 298, 9 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1962). The legislature has conferred on trial courts continuing jurisdiction to act on their judgments after the commencement of sentence under a limited number of circumstances. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-29 through 53a-34 (permitting the trial court to modify terms of probation after sentence is imposed); General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 (granting jurisdiction to trial court to hear a petition for a new trial after execution of original sentence has commenced); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 (allowing the trial court to modify sentences of less than three years provided a hearing is held and good cause shown).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">On reargument, the defendant cited, with the trial court\u2019s approval, Practice Book \u00a7 6<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the source of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant his motion for acquittal. In an apparent abandonment of that argument, however, the defendant now contends that General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-39,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the sentence modification statute, confers such jurisdiction. The defendant\u2019s position is unavailing in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The court\u2019s reliance on Practice Book \u00a7 6 was misplaced because \u201cPractice Book rules do not ordinarily define subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 307, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992). Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a), which authorizes judges of the Superior Court to promulgate rules \u201cregulating pleading, practice and procedure in judicial proceedings,\u201d explicitly states that \u201c[s]uch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right nor the <em>jurisdiction </em>of any courts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The defendant is similarly mistaken in his claim that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 confers the necessary jurisdiction. Section 53a-39 grants authority to a sentencing court to reduce sentences of less than three years, provided a hearing is held and good cause is shown. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>supra, 430. It is inapplicable in the present case because the defendant did not seek modification of his <em>sentence. </em>What the defendant sought was an acquittal or nullification of his <em>conviction </em>based on an insufficiency of the evidence claim. Nothing in \u00a7 53a-39 nor any other statute confers on a trial court the jurisdiction to entertain a motion for acquittal after service of a sentence has commenced. The defendant\u2019s remedy was by way of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">We therefore hold that the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion of acquittal after the start of his sentence violated the common law rule that a court is without jurisdiction to modify its judgment in the absence of appropriate enabling legislation. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>our discussion of the first claim is dispositive of the appeal, we do not reach the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The judgment of acquittal is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment reinstating the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the superior court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the supreme court or to the appellate court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\"> The defendant claimed in his motion for reargument that his discovery after trial of previously unknown case law justified an acquittal on the operating under suspension conviction. The state contests this claim but because our decision on the jurisdictional question is dispositive of the appeal, we do not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 provides: \u201cAt any time during the period of a definite sentence of three years or less, the sentencing court or judge may, after hearing and for good cause shown, reduce the sentence, order the defendant discharged, or order the defendant discharged on probation or conditional discharge for a period not to exceed that to which he could have been originally sentenced.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b23-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 934 includes the same provisions as General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 except that it refers to the \u201cjudicial authority\u201d instead of the \u201csentencing court or judge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b24-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 6 provides: \u201cThe design of these rules being to facilitate business and advance justice, they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work suprise or injustice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> See footnote 3, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
