Connelly, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Corinne Klatt, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b876-14\">Foti, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\">This appeal is a remand from our Supreme Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993). The relevant facts are fully reported in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>29 Conn. App. 68, 614 A.2d 471 (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>reversed, 227 Conn. 566, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993). The sole issue to be determined is the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The defendant was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The defendant claims that the elements that distinguish the degrees of manslaughter were not defined meaningfully by the legislature, and that the trial court did not adequately distinguish between manslaughter in the first and second degrees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the jury instructions. He claims that no actual distinction exists between simple reckless conduct, as proscribed by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1), and reckless conduct aggravated by \u201cextreme indifference to human life,\u201d as proscribed by \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The defendant acknowledges that this claim was not preserved at the trial court. The defendant seeks review under Evans-Golding,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that he was deprived of a fundamental constitutional right, and as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>to raise the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) at trial, or to object to the instruction given, leaves the record inadequate for a fair consideration of whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>218 Conn. 483, 485, 590 A.2d 434 (1991). Without an adequate record, review is precluded. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 240, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">As part of this claim, the defendant alleges that the jury was not instructed properly on the distinction between the two degrees of manslaughter. In the absence of a properly preserved claim, \u201creversal is warranted only if the charge failed to provide the jury with the essential elements of the offense on which the conviction rests or the case must invoke plain error requiring such result in the interests of justice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>23 Conn. App. 615, 623, 583 A.2d 639 (1990). The defendant acknowledges that the essential elements of each lesser included offense were given properly. \u201c[Wjhere the defendant fails to object to an instruction, \u2018the appellate claim that the same issue clearly deprived the defendant of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosby, </em>[6 Conn. App. 164, 172, 504 A.2d 1071 (1986)]; is seriously undercut. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>[186 Conn. 555, 567, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982)].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>10 Conn. App. 330, 338, 523 A.2d 906, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>21 Conn. App. 654, 660-61, 575 A.2d 704, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 803, 577 A.2d 716 (1990). Review of the claim on this basis is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Nor is the defendant\u2019s claim reviewable as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Plain error review \u201c \u2018is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 591, 583 A.2d 896 (1990). The claimed error here is not so egregious or obvious as to merit such review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>18 Conn. App. 694, 712, 561 A.2d 129, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 805, 567 A.2d 835 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...
