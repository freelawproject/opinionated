We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant was incarcerated in the segregation unit of the Somers correctional institution. On the morning of January 11, 1991, correction employees Moses Williams, John Pearson, Stewart Felton and Michael Rutkowski were on duty when the defendant returned to his cell unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">When he reentered the segregation unit, the defendant proceeded to cell number seventy-eight where another inmate, Francis Anderson, was incarcerated. Anderson was a particularly dangerous inmate. While correction employees were attempting to cuff Anderson\u2019s hands behind his back and shackle his feet, the defendant yelled \u201cpop seventy-eight,\u201d a term used to request a correction employee to open a cell. In response, a prison employee mistakenly heeded the defendant\u2019s request. Anderson emerged from the cell unrestrained and proceeded toward a staircase. He ignored repeated orders to return to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Pearson sought to restrain the defendant, but the defendant was unwilling to cooperate and obey orders. Pearson was concerned that the defendant posed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>greater threat than did Anderson. As the defendant began to walk away, he asked Anderson to assault a correction employee in exchange for $200 in cash.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Anderson agreed and punched Pearson in the jaw. Anderson tried to strike Pearson again while several other employees attempted to restrain him. In the course of the scuffle, Anderson threw Williams from his back and struck Rutkowski. As a result of Anderson\u2019s punch, Rutkowski sustained an injury to his forehead. Finally, with the help of the defendant, the officers regained control of Anderson and returned him to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to strike the state\u2019s substitute information or, alternatively, to grant the defendant a continuance. The defendant\u2019s argument is predicated on the assertion that by bringing additional charges immediately before jury selection, the state prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">On May 7,1991, the state charged the defendant with four criminal offenses: two counts of conspiracy to assault a correction employee and two counts of conspiracy to commit second degree assault. On October 28, 1991, the day before jury selection,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>filed a substitute information that set forth three new charges: accessory to assault of a correction employee, accessory to second degree assault, and rioting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Before jury selection, the defendant objected to the additional charges and sought a continuance. While defense counsel stated to the court that the added counts would affect his questioning of potential jurors, he did not specify at any time how the new charges would affect the voir dire. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and noted an exception to the ruling. The state called its first witness seven days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u201c[F]or purposes of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 623 and 624, a criminal trial begins with the voir dire of the prospective jurors.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>8 Conn. App. 545, 551-52, 513 A.2d 752 (1986). Before the commencement of a criminal trial, \u00a7 623 controls the alteration of charges brought against a criminal defendant. This section provides that \u201c[i]f the trial has not commenced, the prosecuting authority may amend the information, or add additional counts, or file a substitute information. Upon motion of the defendant, the judicial authority, <em>in [its] discretion, </em>may strike the amendment or added counts or substitute information, if the trial or the cause would be unduly delayed or the substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In this case, it is undisputed that the substitute information was filed prior to the commencement of the voir dire. Consequently, \u00a7 623 governed the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>analysis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>supra. The critical question therefore is whether the substitute information prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights to the extent that the trial court abused its discretion when it chose not to strike the added counts or to grant the defendant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>10 Conn. App. 330, 523 A.2d 906, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523 (1987), this court considered a similar issue in a virtually identical context. In <em>Huff </em>the state originally charged the defendant with robbery in the first degree. Id., 344. Immediately prior to the voir dire, however, the state filed a substitute information and added the charge of assault in the second degree. The defendant moved to strike the added count or, alternatively, for a one week continuance. The trial court denied both motions, and the presentation of evidence began two days later. Id., 346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The issue before this court in <em>Huff was </em>whether the added charge prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. Id., 345. We held that it did not, reasoning that (1) the additional count involved the same \u201cfactual matrix\u201d as the first count, (2) the defendant was able to prepare sufficiently for the trial on the basis of his access to police reports in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s file, and (3) the defendant did not dispute the commission of the crime, but rather claimed that he was not involved. Id., 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s ruling is fully consistent with our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, 344-47. Clearly, the added counts of accessorial liability and rioting arose out of the same factual matrix as the initial charges. Further, because the defendant at all times knew of the alleged facts underlying the added crimes and because he had notice of the added charges a full week prior to the commencement of the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>case, we are convinced that the defendant had ample opportunity to prepare for trial. Moreover, the defendant never claimed that Anderson did not commit the assault of the correction employee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, he claimed that he was not involved with the commission of the crime. We conclude that the sound reasoning of <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, is equally applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision impeded his ability to conduct a meaningful voir dire, especially since the new counts subjected him to significantly greater sentencing exposure. We reject this contention for several reasons. First, the defendant never explained to the trial court how the added counts would alter his questioning of the potential jurors. We noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>7 Conn. App. 326, 334-35, 509 A.2d 518, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 807, 512 A.2d 231 (1986), that the defendant must make a specific showing of prejudice to establish a violation of due process. Here, the defendant\u2019s bare assertion of prejudice was not enough to establish a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Second, while it is true that the state did not officially apprise the defendant of the added charges until shortly before voir dire, the defendant had an opportunity to question the potential jurors on matters pertaining to the added charges during the voir dire. Additionally, we are aware that the state has broad authority to amend its charge prior to voir dire. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>supra, 550. Indeed, \u00a7 623 of our rules of practice offers the state a vehicle through which to expose a defendant to greater criminal liability, provided that the state does not prejudice the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>We conclude that, in light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, the added criminal charges did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. The trial court acted within its discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>28 Conn. App. 483, 487, 611 A.2d 440 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The defendant claims that his arraignment in the presence of the jury violated his constitutional right not to be compelled to testify against himself. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">On November 5, 1992, the trial court arraigned the defendant on the substitute information. First, the trial court swore in the jury. Then, the court clerk read each of the five counts of the substitute information. In the presence of the jury, the defendant indicated that he was pleading not guilty as to each count. The defendant now claims that this procedure violated his fifth amendment right not to be compelled to testify against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">As a threshold matter, we note that the defendant never raised this claim with the trial court. He now seeks to bypass this deficiency via the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In order to prevail on a claim of constitutional error that has not been adequately preserved at trial, the defendant must meet all of the following conditions: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 239-40; <em>State </em>v. <em>Plud, </em>30 Conn. App. 527, 536-37, 621 A.2d 1342 (1993). <em>\u201cWe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>may, however, dispose of the claim by focusing on the condition that appears most relevant under the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>supra, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s invocation of the fifth amendment, the defendant\u2019s claim does not implicate a clear constitutional right. The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides that no person \u201cshall be <em>compelled </em>in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In this case, the record is devoid of any indication that the defendant was compelled to enter a plea of not guilty in the presence of the jury. With the advice of counsel, the defendant could well have chosen not to answer the question or asked his attorney to enter the plea of not guilty on his behalf. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty in this fashion may have served a tactical purpose in allowing the jury to observe him deny the commission of the crimes. While we do not approve of the plea process at issue in this case, we conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed cross-examination that was irrelevant and beyond the scope of direct examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Robert Carra, an inmate account supervisor at the Somers correctional institution, testified as a witness for the defense. On direct examination, he explained that in 1991, the defendant had not transferred any funds to Anderson. Further, according to Carra, the defendant\u2019s account did not exceed $117.78 in that year. Carra also testified that, within the correctional facility, cash is considered contraband and accordingly is subject to confiscation.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>On cross-examination, the state elicited testimony regarding other forms of contraband at the prison. For example, Carra testified that drugs, liquor and weapons are considered contraband and are present at the prison. The defendant objected to this line of inquiry as beyond the scope of direct examination and immaterial to the issues at trial. In response, the state argued that it was attempting to rebut the suggestion on direct examination that the defendant did not have the means to pay Anderson for the assault. The trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We initially note that our review of a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is limited. \u201c \u2018Evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 306, 579 A.2d 515 (1990). In considering whether the trial court abused its discretion, \u201cthe unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness . . . .\u201d <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 263, 413 A.2d 854 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">It is well settled that the scope of cross-examination is limited to matters covered in the direct examination, except as they involve credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>218 Conn. 447, 590 A.2d 106 (1991). \u201cThe court has wide discretion to determine the scope of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>224 Conn. 196, 208, 618 A.2d 494 (1992). A question is within the scope of the direct examination if it is intended to \u201crebut, impeach, modify or explain any of the defendant\u2019s direct testimony . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>173 Conn. 189, 196, 377 A.2d 275 (1977). \u201cGenerally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>questions the witness on the same subject.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In the present case, the trial court reasonably concluded that the state\u2019s cross-examination of Carra was appropriate. Defense counsel elicited from Carra evidence that the defendant did not have sufficient funds in his account to pay Anderson for the assault. Carra\u2019s testimony further established that prison officials regarded cash in the possession of inmates as contraband. Through cross-examination, the state sought to rebut the effect of this evidence by eliciting evidence that inmates possessed other forms of contraband. This evidence was offered for the purpose of creating the inference that the defendant could have offered cash or other forms of contraband to Anderson in lieu of a payment from his account. We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in allowing the state to pursue this line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The defendant next claims that his punishment for assault of an employee of the department of correction and second degree assault violates the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The defendant did not raise his claim of double jeopardy with the trial court, but seeks this court\u2019s review under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has held that double jeopardy claims arising in the course of a single trial and raised for the first time on appeal are re viewable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 705, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>(1991). Accordingly, we consider whether the convictions at issue are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d The fifth amendment thus prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense in the same trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 34-35, 561 A.2d-897 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>30 Conn. App. 606, 608-609, 621 A.2d 755 (1993); see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">When a defendant alleges multiple punishment for the same offense, he bears the burden of demonstrating (1) that the charges arise out of the same act or transaction and (2) that the crimes are the same offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 52, 536 A.2d 936 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>supra, 609. The defendant must satisfy both of these conditions. Because there is no dispute in this case that the charges arose out of the same transaction, the sole issue is whether the crimes constitute the same offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Our courts have repeatedly invoked the test in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), to decide whether two offenses constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>supra, 706-707; <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nita, </em>27 Conn. App. 103, 114-15, 604 A.2d 1322, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1329 (1992). The inquiry under <em>Blockburger </em>involves a comparison of the elements of the two offenses. If the comparison reveals that each crime contains an element not found in the other, the defendant may be convicted of both crimes arising out of the same criminal incident. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 291, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>579 A.2d 84 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 615, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nita, </em>supra, 115. \u201cWe determine whether each crime contains an element not found in the other by examining only the relevant statute, the information and the bill of particulars, and not the evidence presented at trial. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nita, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In the present case, each of the crimes of assault of a department of correction employee and assault in the second degree contains an element that the other does not. A comparison of the intent elements of these crimes reveals a critical difference between the two statutes. An assault of an employee of the department of correction under \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) occurs when (1) a person intends to prevent a reasonably identifiable employee of the department of correction from performing his duty and (2) the person causes physical injury to a correction employee. <em>Intent to cause physical injury </em>is not a prerequisite to culpability under this statute. Thus, for example, if a person restrains a reasonably identifiable correction employee and intends to interfere with the performance of the employee\u2019s duty, any resulting injury to that employee, whether intentional or otherwise, would give rise to a violation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">By contrast, assault in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5) occurs when a person <em>\u201cwith intent to cause physical injury </em>to an employee of the department of correction . . . causes physical injury to such employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under this statute, if a person restrains a correction employee, any resulting injury to that employee will not give rise to criminal liability <em>unless </em>the person intended to cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In short, \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) requires intent to interfere with a correction employee, while \u00a7 53a-60a (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>does not. At the same time, \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5) requires intent to cause physical injury, an element not incorporated into \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1). It is clear that each crime contains an element not found in the other. We therefore presume that the legislature intended the two crimes to warrant distinct punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Relying by analogy on <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>14 Conn. App. 10, 539 A.2d 1005, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 891, 109 S. Ct. 226, 102 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1988), the defendant argues that we cannot presume that the legislature intended to treat assault of a correction employee and assault in the second degree as separate offenses under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. In <em>Flynn, </em>we held that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167a (a) and 53a-167c (a) (1) and (2) are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. The court reasoned that \u201ca person could not commit the greater offense of assault on a peace officer without having committed the lesser offense of interfering with a peace officer.\u201d Id., 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In this case, we are presented with an entirely different scenario. A person can commit assault of a correction employee, the greater offense, without committing assault in the second degree, the lesser offense. For example, a person is guilty under \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) if he intends to prevent a reasonably identifiable correction employee from performing his duty and, in doing so, causes injury to the employee. Under the same circumstances, however, the person may not be in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5) <em>unless </em>he intended to cause the injury. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u201cOur analysis does not end here, however. The <em>Block-burger </em>test is a rule of statutory construction and its application does not result in a conclusive presumption.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>25 Conn. App. 243, 251, 594 A.2d 1000, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 911, 597 A.2d 338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>(1991). <em>Clear </em>legislative intent may indicate that the two crimes are to be treated as one for double jeopardy purposes and thereby rebut the presumption under <em>Blockburger. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In this case, the intricate historical discussion offered by the defendant is ultimately inconclusive with regard to the intent of the legislature. The defendant relies on the following legislative history. Prior to 1971, General Statutes \u00a7 53-16a made it an offense to assault a correction employee. In 1971, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1971, No. 871, \u00a7 18, which was codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1973) \u00a7 53a-60 and which superseded \u00a7 53-16a. In its original form, \u00a7 53a-60 set forth two provisions for penalizing acts by inmates that result in injuries to correction employees. First, under subdivision (3), a person was guilty of assault in the second degree when with the intent to prevent a peace officer from performing his duty, that person caused physical injury to the peace officer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, under subdivision (6), a person committed second degree assault when he intentionally injured a correction employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In 1973, the legislature deleted subdivision (3) and incorporated its language into a new statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1). See Public Acts 1973, No. 73-639, \u00a7 19. In doing so, the legislature upgraded the offense from a class D to a class C felony. The legislature, however, did not eliminate subdivision (6) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1973) \u00a7 53a-60. This subdivision instead became subdivision (5) when subdivision (3) was deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In 1990, the legislature brought \u00a7 53a-167c to its current form. It added \u201cemployee of the department of correction\u201d and subsection (b) to the statute. Subsection (b) requires, \u201c[i]f any person who is confined in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>institution or facility of the department of correction is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for assault of an employee of the department of correction under this section, such term shall run consecutively to the term for which the person was serving at the time of the assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendant argues that in light of the history underlying \u00a7\u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5) and 53a-167c (a) (1), the legislature clearly intended to upgrade <em>all </em>prisoner assaults on correction employees to class C felonies and to mandate consecutive sentences. Thus, the legislature intended to treat the two offenses as one for double jeopardy purposes. This argument is tantamount to claiming that the legislature\u2019s failure to delete \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (6) in 1973 was an oversight \u2014 a proposition that we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The legislature created \u00a7 53a-167c using language from the 1973 version of \u00a7 53a-60. The legislature enacted \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1), knowing full well that \u00a7 53a-60 (6) would exist as a separate provision for assault of a correction employee. It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature acts with full knowledge of existing statutes and that it intends to create one body of law. <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 65, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Olesen, </em>31 Conn. App. 359, 365, 624 A.2d 920 (1993). That rule is particularly applicable where, as here, one statute is derivative of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s historical analysis has not established a clear legislative intent to treat \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) and 53a-60 (5) as one offense for double jeopardy purposes. Having failed to rebut the presumption under <em>Blockburger, </em>the defendant cannot prevail on his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Y</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court, in its instructions to the jury, failed to explain the constitutional requirements of concurrency and unanimity. This claim is directed to the counts of assault of a correction employee and assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court was required to instruct the jury on concurrency. The issue is whether \u00a7\u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5) and 53a-167c (a) (1) require the actual victim to be the object of the defendant\u2019s intent. The defendant never raised this claim with the trial court. Nevertheless, even when reviewed under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, the defendant\u2019s claim does not withstand analysis because it is clear that the argument rests on a faulty premise \u2014 -a misinterpretation of these two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">A defendant commits the offenses of assault of a correction employee and assault in the second degree when, with the intent to prevent an employee from performing his duties or with the intent to injure an employee, the defendant causes injury to <em>such employee. </em>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) and 53a-60 (a) (5). Relying on the legislature\u2019s use of \u201csuch,\u201d the defendant argues that these statutes impose criminal liability only if the victim is the <em>specific person </em>with whom the defendant intended to interfere or injure. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The legislature\u2019s use of \u201csuch\u201d in a given statute does not necessarily parallel the dictionary definition of this word; instead we construe the word \u201csuch\u201d to effectuate the intent of the legislature. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 197, 550 A.2d 309 (1988); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221 n.7, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 556, 295 A.2d 547 (1972). Here, it is obvious from the language of both statutes that the legislature has sought to circumscribe punishment for an inmate who inflicts harm on a correction employee when the inmate intended either to prevent a correction employee from performing his duty, \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1), or to injure a correction employee, \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5). Therefore, the legislature\u2019s use of \u201csuch\u201d refers to the requirement that the victim be a correction employee, but not necessarily the specific employee to whom the defendant directed his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Under the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) and 53a-60 (a) (5), an inmate who attempts to injure one correction employee but instead harms another employee has not violated either statute. This result would entirely undercut the clear intent of the legislature. Under the foregoing scenario, the inmate has performed an act that the legislature sought to proscribe through \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) and 53a-60 (a) (5), namely, the injury of a correction employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We hold that the use of \u201csuch\u201d in \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) does not relieve a defendant of criminal liability if, with the intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable correction employee from performing his duty, the defendant causes physical injury to a correction employee. Similarly, under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (5), a person is guilty of assault in the second degree if that person, with the intent to injure a correction employee, injures a correction employee. It follows that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury in accordance with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of these statutes was not improper. To hold otherwise would be to allow a defendant to escape liability because fortuitously he injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>one correction employee and not another, even though he possessed the requisite intent under each statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In a related claim, the defendant asserts that the trial court did not adequately instruct the jury on the requirement of unanimity. The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated on his concern that the jury may not have agreed on (1) which officer the defendant intended Anderson to assault and (2) whether the victim of the assault was the specific correction employee that the defendant intended Anderson to assault. According to the defendant, an adequate jury instruction explaining the requirements of unanimity would have alleviated this purported constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In instructing the jury, the trial court repeatedly explained that the jury\u2019s verdict had to be unanimous. For example, the court stated, \u201c[Y]our verdict must be unanimous and you must all agree and you must be unanimous and that is the requirement of the law. . . . I now instruct you that your verdict must be unanimous.\u201d When the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts, the court clerk asked, \u201cLadies and gentleman, and each of you do say <em>unanimously </em>that the accused is guilty of the crime of assault on a corrections officer, second count; this is your verdict say you <em>allT\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) The jurors responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The jury responded similarly to the court clerk\u2019s question regarding the guilty verdict for assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We initially note that the defendant neither filed a request to charge nor objected to the court\u2019s instructions with respect to the issue of unanimity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant, however, asserts that his claim is renewable under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because it calls into question the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In recent years, our Supreme Court has delineated a test for determining the necessity of a unanimity charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 453-54, 619 A.2d 453 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619-20, 595 A.2d 306 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Conn. 18, 35, 557 A.2d 917 (1989). \u201cWe first review the instruction that was given to determine whether the trial court has sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. <em>If such an instruction has not been given, that ends the matter. </em>Even if the instructions at trial can be read to have sanctioned such a nonunanimous verdict, however, we will remand for a new trial only if (1) there is a conceptual distinction between the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged, and (2) the state has presented evidence to support each alternative act with which the defendant has been charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In the present case, the jury instructions are devoid of any indication that the trial court expressly sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict \u2014 quite the contrary. The jury charge is replete with statements underscoring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>requirement that the jury return a unanimous verdict. While the trial court never specifically required the jurors to agree on whom the defendant intended Anderson to assault or whether the victims were the objects of the defendant\u2019s intent, we cannot interpret the court\u2019s silence as sanctioning a nonunanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Having determined that the court never expressly sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict, our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim does not proceed further. \u201c[T]he court must inquire into the conceptual distinction between the alternative acts charged, and whether the state had presented evidence to support each alternative act, <em>only if </em>the trial court <em>expressly </em>sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 454, citing, <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions were not fundamentally unfair to the defendant and that the defendant accordingly cannot prevail under the bypass of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The defendant also claims that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment of conviction of rioting at a correctional institution. The thrust of the defendant\u2019s position is that because only two persons were involved in the assault of the correction employees, the defendant could not be convicted under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179b. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Having failed to raise this claim with the trial court, the defendant seeks appellate review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that \u201c|w]hen the record substantiates the fact that the state has not proved every element of the crime with which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>has been charged, <em>Evansf-Golding] </em>review is warranted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aleksiewicz, </em>20 Conn. App. 643, 645 n.1, 569 A.2d 567 (1990). We thus consider whether the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant violated \u00a7 53a-179b.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-179b, a \u201cperson is guilty of rioting at a correctional institution when he incites, instigates, organizes, connives at, causes, aids, abets, assists or takes part in any disorder, disturbance, strike, riot or other organized disobedience to the rules and regulations of such institution.\u201d \u201cIn order for a defendant to be found guilty of rioting at a correctional institution, he must plan or lead, or take part in the disturbance at the correctional institution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>30 Conn. App. 224, 232, 619 A.2d 1146 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In this case, the defendant seeks to engraft upon the statute the common law definition of rioting. Relying on 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796), pp. 339-40, the defendant argues that our modern rioting statute should be construed as requiring a minimum of three participants. By its express terms, however, our statute is <em>not </em>limited to the defendant\u2019s proposed construction. Instead, \u00a7 53a-179b subjects to criminal punishment a person who plans or leads a disturbance, disorder or riot at a correctional facility, irrespective of the number of participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In developing Connecticut\u2019s criminal code, the legislature has promulgated provisions with numerical prerequisites to liability. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-175 (first degree riot); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-176 (second degree riot); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-177 (unlawful assembly). Section 53a-179b, however, does not include a requirement of this kind. As previously stated, the legislature is presumed to act with knowledge of other statutory provisions, particularly those related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>to the statute in question. <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Olesen, </em>supra. The absence of a numerical requirement in \u00a7 53a-179b thus reveals the legislature\u2019s intent not to restrict the offense of rioting at a correctional institution by specifying a particular number of participants. We conclude that the record substantiates the judgment of conviction under \u00a7 53a-179b, despite the state\u2019s failure to offer evidence indicating a third participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The defendant also claims that \u201corganized disobedience with the rules and regulations of [the] correctional institution\u201d is an element of the offense under \u00a7 53a-179b. According to the defendant, the state failed to offer evidence establishing this purported element of the crime, thereby failing to prove a violation of the statute. This argument assumes that the phrase \u201cother organized disobedience to the rules and regulations of [the correctional] institution\u201d modifies \u201cdisorder,\u201d \u201cdisturbance,\u201d \u201cstrike\u201d and \u201criot.\u201d The language of the statute, however, does not support the defendant\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">A person is guilty of rioting at a correctional institution if he or she leads, plans or participates in a \u201cdisorder, disturbance, strike, riot <em>or </em>other organized disobedience to the rules and regulations of such institution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179b. Phrased in the disjunctive, the statute proscribes <em>alternatively </em>organized disobedience to the rules of the correctional institution. The statute does <em>not </em>require disobedience of the rules as an element of the offense in all instances. We therefore conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>because the record substantiates the fact that the state has proved every element of \u00a7 53a-179b.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the offense of riot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>ing at a correctional institution. In challenging the trial court\u2019s instructions, the defendant points to the court\u2019s failure to explain adequately (1) the definition of disorder and disturbance and (2) the meaning of specific intent. The defendant\u2019s arguments in this regard are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The defendant again seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, claiming that the failure to charge on an essential element of a crime is a constitutional defect.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 510-11, 594 A.2d 906 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>30 Conn. App. 68, 74, 618 A.2d 1372, cert. granted, 225 Conn. 910, 621 A.2d 290 (1993). In deciding if the defendant can prevail under <em>Golding, </em>\u201cthe test is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 50, 547 A.2d 534 (1988). \u201cWe do not evaluate a contested portion of an instruction in artificial isolation from the overall charge. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra]. Instead, we examine the charge in its entirety. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>222 Conn. 117, 130, 609 A.2d 236 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 204, 562 A.2d 481 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Channer, </em>28 Conn. App. 161, 171-72, 612 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 921, 614 A.2d 826 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error with respect to the definition of disorder or disturbance is predicated on the same argument that we rejected in part VI of this opinion, namely, that rioting under \u00a7 53a-179b requires a minimum of three participants. For the reasons stated in part VI of this opinion, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the trial court\u2019s discussion of disorder and disturbance misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We also reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court failed to instruct the jury adequately that specific intent to cause a disorder or disturbance is an essential element of \u00a7 53a-179b. In deciding whether a criminal statute requires general or specific intent, our Supreme Court regularly has invoked the following distinction. \u201cWhen the elements of a crime consist of a description of a particular act and a mental element not specific in nature, the only issue is whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. If he did so intend, he has the requisite <em>general intent </em>for culpability. When the elements of a crime include a defendant\u2019s intent to achieve some result additional to the act, the additional language distinguishes the crime from those of general intent and makes it one requiring a <em>specific intent. State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>193 Conn. 632, 638, 479 A.2d 218 (1984), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 5, 291 A.2d 240 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pascucci, </em>164 Conn. 69, 74, 316 A.2d 750 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Husser, </em>161 Conn. 513, 515, 290 A.2d 336 (1971); 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law, \u00a7\u00a789 through 91.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 240, 541 A.2d 96 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pascucci, </em>supra, our Supreme Court considered whether inciting to riot at a correctional institution is a specific intent crime. The statute at issue in <em>Pascucci, </em>General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-167a, punished \u201cany person who incites, instigates, organizes, connives at, causes, aids, abets or takes part in any disorder, disturbance or other organized disobedience to the rules and regulations of the institution.\u201d This statute was the predecessor to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179c (inciting to riot at a correctional institution) and contains essentially the same language as the rioting statute at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The court in <em>Pascucci </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that inciting to riot at a correctional institution is a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>cific intent crime. Id., 73-75. The court first noted that the statute made no reference to a specific intent requirement. Id., 73. From a policy standpoint, the court reasoned that \u201c[t]he dangers which the statute seeks to obviate could arise from acts which, although in no way intended to produce danger, readily could give rise to disorder, disturbance, strike or riot . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Applied to the present case, the decision in <em>Pascucci </em>militates against the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error. The statute at issue in <em>Pascucci </em>is essentially the same as the statute now in question. The offense of rioting at a correctional institution does not expressly provide for any particular scienter requirement. Moreover, the same policy rationale articulated in <em>Pascucci </em>applies to \u00a7 53a-179b. In light <em>o\u00ed Pascucci, </em>it is clear that rioting at a correctional institution is not a specific intent crime. We conclude that it was not reasonably possible that any failure by the trial court to explain the meaning of specific intent misled the jury. The defendant accordingly cannot prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167e (a) (1) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault of a . . . employee of the department of correction when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable . . . employee of the department of correction from performing his duty, and while such . . . employee is acting in the performance of his duties, (1) he causes physical injury to such . . . employee . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ...

Defense counsel stated in closing argument that \u201cthere\u2019s really no question, there\u2019s really not an issue as to whether Mr. Anderson hit Officer Pearson and there\u2019s no question that he hit Rutkowski.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\"> We assume without deciding that the defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty before the jury was testimonial in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> See discussion in part I of this opinion regarding the analysis under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> When General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 was originally enacted, \u201cpeace officer\u201d was defined to include correction employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> We further note that our interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) and 53a-60 (a) (5) mirrors the doctrine of transferred intent, a doctrine applicable to both civil and criminal cases. <em>Altieri </em>v. <em>Colasso, </em>168 Conn. 329, 334 n.4, 362 A.2d 798 (1975); see also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-4 (providing that criminal code does not displace other principles of criminal law not statutorily circumscribed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> After the trial court\u2019s initial charge to the jury, the defendant requested the trial court to emphasize that the verdict be unanimous. The trial court had in fact instructed on unanimity generally, but neither the trial court nor the parties could recall the court\u2019s doing so. The defendant never mentioned the claims that it now asserts, namely, that the trial court must specifically instruct on unanimity to ensure concurrency. The trial court, therefore, called the jury back to the courtroom and instructed it to return a unanimous verdict. It is clear, that the defendant has not preserved the claims he now raises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> See discussion in part I of this opinion regarding the analysis under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> See discussion in part I of this opinion regarding the analysis under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\"> See discussion in part I of this opinion regarding the analysis under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
