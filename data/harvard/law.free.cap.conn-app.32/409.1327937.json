Dworak appeals from the decision of the trial court sustaining the appeal of the plaintiff and reversing a decision of the defendant East Haddam planning and zoning commission (commission) which approved her application for site plan review. Dworak claims that the trial court improperly concluded that her application failed to meet the requirements of the applicable zoning regulations. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Dworak applied to the East Haddam planning and zoning commission for site plan approval to build a single-family house on a nonconforming parcel of land in East Haddam. After several public hearings and consideration of numerous exhibits, the commission approved the application with stipulations not relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff, who owns land that abuts the subject property, appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. The trial court sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the appeal, concluding that the commission improperly-approved the application because Dworak (1) failed to submit either a variance or a finding from the zoning enforcement officer regarding her nonconforming lot, as required by \u00a7 14A.4.B of the East Haddam zoning regulations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) failed to submit a written report of the town sanitarian, as required by \u00a7 14A.2.B.2 of the zoning regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After we granted Dworak\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201cIn ruling upon a site plan application, the planning commission acts in its ministerial capacity, rather than its quasi-judicial or legislative capacity. It is given no independent discretion beyond determining whether the plan complies with the applicable regulations. <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>[177 Conn. 420, 426-27, 418 A.2d 66 (1979)]. The board is under a mandate to apply the requirements of the regulations as written. Tf the plan submitted conforms to these regulations, the council has no discretion or choice but to approve it.\u2019 <em>RK Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>156 Conn. 369, 375-76, 242 A.2d 781 (1968); <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>155 Conn. 669, 674-75, 236 A.2d 917 (1967).\u201d <em>Allied Plywood, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>2 Conn. App. 506, 512, 480 A.2d 584, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 808, 483 A.2d 612 (1984). While a commission \u201chas limited discretion when acting in an administrative capacity . . . it does have discretion to resolve debatable questions of fact, and on appeal the issue is whether the agency\u2019s decision on factual questions is reasonably supported by the record, in which case the court should not substitute its judgment for that of the commission.\u201d R. Fuller, Land Use Law and Practice \u00a7 33.3, p. 568; <em>Westport </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>167 Conn. 151, 161, 355 A.2d 25 (1974). We now turn to an examination of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Dworak\u2019s site plan application failed to conform to the East Haddam zoning regulations in two respects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The trial court first concluded that Dworak\u2019s site plan application did not contain the necessary documentation required for a nonconforming lot. It is undisputed that, due to its small size, the Dworak property is a nonconforming lot. Section 8.1.2 of the East Haddam zoning regulations provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he construction of a permitted building or structure . . . on a non-conforming lot or parcel may be allowed by the Commission, following Site Plan Approval in accordance with Section 14A of these regulations . . . .\u201d With respect to any nonconformity, \u00a7 14A.4.B requires that \u201cthe Zoning Enforcement Officer [issue] a finding that the nonconformance is a legal, preexisting nonconformity in accordance with Section 8 of these Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Dworak first posits, in her brief, that \u201c[t]he requirement in Section 14A.4.B for a variance or a finding of pre-existing nonconformity makes sense <em>except </em>in the case of a Section 8.1.2 application, where the <em>sole </em>basis of the application is that the subject lot is nonconforming.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Dworak therefore argues that because \u00a7 8 expressly permits construction on a nonconforming lot, the provisions of \u00a7 14A regarding nonconformity with the zoning regulations do not apply to her site plan application. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">A zoning regulation \u201cmust be interpreted in light of our ordinary rule that '[w]here the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, the courts cannot, by construction, read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u2019 <em>Point O\u2019 Woods Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>178 Conn. 364, 366, 423 A.2d 90 (1979). \u2018A zoning ordinance is a local legislative enactment, and in its interpretation the question is the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tion of the legislative body as found from the words employed in the ordinance. . . . The words employed are to be interpreted in their natural and usual meaning.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 509, 511, 264 A.2d 552 (1969).\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>194 Conn. 187, 193-94, 479 A.2d 808 (1984); <em>Weigel </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 239, 246, 278 A.2d 766 (1971). While \u00a7 8.1.2 does permit the construction of a building on a nonconforming lot, it expressly allows such construction <em>foHoming </em>site plan approval in accordance with \u00a7 14A. The plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 8.1.2, which applies only to nonconforming lots, requires compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 14A, which necessarily includes \u00a7 14A.4.B. Dworak\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8.1.2 would require us to ignore its reference to \u00a7 14A and would require us to read into that regulation an exception that is not clearly stated. This we cannot do. <em>Point O\u2019 Woods Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Dworak further argues that the trial court improperly concluded that her site plan application did not meet the requirement of \u00a7 14A.4.B. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Several times during the public hearings on Dworak\u2019s application, the issue of the nonconforming status of the lot was discussed by witnesses, the zoning enforcement officer and members of the commission. A member of the public questioned whether Dworak could properly claim that her lot was a legal, preexisting nonconformity under the local zoning regulations. The commission then expressed interest in receiving an opinion on the issue from its attorney, Mark K. Branse. At the next hearing on the Dworak application, the zoning enforcement officer read into evidence and submitted a copy of Branse\u2019s letter on the subject. That letter con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>eluded that the concerns raised at the prior hearings were unfounded. Additionally, immediately prior to the commission\u2019s vote on the application, the zoning enforcement officer informed the commission that Dworak\u2019s site plan \u201cmeets all the zoning requirements.\u201d Under these circumstances, the trial court improperly concluded that the zoning enforcement officer had not \u201cissued a finding that the nonconformance is a legal, pre-existing nonconformity,\u201d as required by \u00a7 14A.4.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The trial court also concluded that the commission\u2019s decision was illegal, arbitrary and an abuse of discretion because the commission did not have before it a report from the town sanitarian. Section 14A.2.B.2 of the East Haddam zoning regulations specifies additional requirements for site plans where \u201cthe existing soils in the immediate area of the site designated for sanitary waste disposal are classified as having \u2018severe\u2019 limitations for on-site sewerage treatment,\u201d as defined elsewhere in the regulations. There is no dispute that this provision applies to Dworak\u2019s application for site plan approval. Among the additional subsurface sewerage disposal plan requirements set forth in \u00a7 14A.2.B.2 is a requirement that the plan \u201cshall be accompanied by a written report of the Town Sanitarian or his representative certifying that the plan will resolve the limitations of the soils, and will pose no significant risk to the public health or safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The regulation in issue requires a report but does not specify the precise form of the written report from the town sanitarian. Here, the town sanitarian indicated his approval of the proposed site plan by writing \u201cthis design is approved\u201d on the plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>mission had before it a copy of a February 8, 1991 report from Robert W. Scully, a supervising environmental sanitarian in the on-site sewage disposal section of the Connecticut department of health services. The department of health services is the ultimate arbiter of septic system compliance, authorized to review proposed sewerage disposal plans. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 19a-36; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-B103e. Scully\u2019s report was addressed to the town sanitarian and contained a review of the site plan\u2019s sewerage disposal plan. In that report, Scully recommended \u201capproval\u201d of the plan and commented that the plan was \u201cvery thorough.\u201d That report contrasted sharply with Scully\u2019s October 9,1990 report on a prior site plan for the Dworak property, in which Scully recommended denial of the plan and noted several deficiencies in the proposed sewerage disposal plans that needed to be addressed. The prior site plan and Scully\u2019s report on that plan were both before the commission when it considered Dworak\u2019s second application for site plan approval. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Dworak\u2019s site plan application was accompanied by what for all intents and purposes amounted to \u201ca written report of the Town Sanitarian or his representative certifying that the plan will resolve the limitations of the soils, and will pose no significant risk to the public health or safety,\u201d as required by \u00a7 14A.2.B.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-5\"> Section 14A.4.B of the East Haddam zoning regulations provides: \u201cThe application shall conform in all respects with these Regulations, unless a certified copy of a variance from any such provision is submitted with the application, or <em>the Zoning Enforcement Officer has issued a finding that the nonconformance is a legal, pre-existing nonconformity </em>in accordance with Section 8 of these Regulations. Further, the application shall conform to the East Haddam Subdivision Regulations; the East Haddam Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations, as evidenced by the submission of an Inland Wetlands Permit issued by the East Haddam Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission; the Public Health Code, as evidenced by a report of the Health Director [or] his authorized designee; and all relevant provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes, whether or not cited in these Regulations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\"> Section 14A.2.B.2 of the East Haddam zoning regulations provides: \u201cIf any existing soils in the immediate area of the site designated for sanitary waste disposal are classified as having \u2018severe\u2019 limitations for on-site sewerage treatment (as set forth in Section 4.3 (1) (a) the East Haddam Subdivision Regulations), in accordance with the current soils map of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, then a subsurface sewerage disposal plan shall be presented to the Commission. Said plan shall specifically address the methods utilized to overcome the limitations identified in the soils of the site; shall be prepared by a licensed Connecticut Professional Engineer, and <em>shall be accompanied by a written report of the Town Sanitarian or his representative certifying that the plan will resolve the limitations of the soils, and will pose no significant risk </em>to <em>the public health or safety. </em>All sanitary waste disposal systems to be located in the immediate area of soils with \u2018severe\u2019 limitations, as set forth above, shall have 100% replacement leaching fields at least equal in size to the original leaching fields, and the location of both the original and replacement leaching fields shall be designated on the site plan. Both the original and replacement fields shall be located so as to contain the percolation and deep test pits.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-5\"> Because we conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that Dworak\u2019s site plan application failed to conform to the East Haddam zoning regulations, we need not consider Dworak\u2019s third claim on appeal, namely, that \u201c[i]t is not illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of the Commission\u2019s discretion for the Planning and Zoning Commission to overlook a procedural irregularity that was not raised as an issue during the hearings provided the Commission acts in reasonable compliance with the substance and spirit of the Regulations and in so doing does not prejudice any party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> This language was read into the record by the zoning enforcement officer at two hearings before the commission. The zoning enforcement officer was apparently reading the sanitarian\u2019s written approval from the site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>plan. The copy of the site plan in the return of the record, however, contains no such inscription by the town sanitarian. Neither party points this out, and the trial court seems to have addressed this claim under the assumption that the sanitarian did write his approval on the site plan. We will therefore address this issue on the theory on which it was tried and decided in the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>29 Conn.
