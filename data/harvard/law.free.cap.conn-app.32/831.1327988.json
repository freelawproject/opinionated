The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury by charging that the elements of that crime were the same as those of the crime of being an accessory to the sale of narcotics except for the addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tional element that the person employed must be under eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On May 15,1990, the Bristol police department conducted an undercover police operation on Davis Drive. The operation was aimed at arresting drug dealers in the Cambridge Park area of Bristol. The police employed a \u201ccop in a box operation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the evening of May 15, 1990, the police used two informants, one as a passenger and the other to drive a pickup truck into the Cambridge Park area with an officer concealed inside a box in the bed of the truck. The defendant, Anthony Harris, flagged down the vehicle. He approached the vehicle and asked the driver what she wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The driver stated that she wanted \u201crock\u201d or \u201cpowder.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant walked away from the vehicle. He returned with his uncle, John Gains. Gains, at the time of this incident, was sixteen years of age and the defendant was twenty. The defendant then instructed Gains to \u201cserve her.\u201d The defendant walked away and Gains produced a Newport cigarette pack from which he removed a small blue bag containing white powder. He handed it to the driver, who handed it to the passenger. The passenger then yelled \u201ctwo.\u201d Gains produced another bag of white powder and the informants gave Gains $40. The powder later tested positive for cocaine. The police arrested both the defendant and Gains on June 22, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The defendant first asserts that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct. The defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly placed the burden on him of proving that extrinsic evidence <em>actually </em>prejudiced the defendant. Further, the defendant claims that the decision by the trial court was clearly erroneous. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The consideration of certain additional facts is necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. The record discloses that on October 18, 1991, the jury found the defendant guilty. On January 3, 1992, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The motion claimed that after the verdict alternate juror Eva Michaud approached defense counsel and revealed that she had conducted an \u201cexperiment\u201d at home to assess the degree to which a person could see through a quarter size hole in a cardboard box. The motion also claimed that the juror discussed this experiment with other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The trial court held a full evidentiary hearing on February 6, 1992. At the hearing, defense counsel called several jurors to testify. Michaud testified that she did perform a \u201ccop in a box\u201d type experiment during the trial. She further testified that she did not talk with the other jurors about the experiment. Juror Mer-rimon Hunt testified that a male juror did tell the jury, in the jury room, that he performed a \u201ccop in a box\u201d experiment. Next, juror Nancy Tinker testified that a juror named Sal told the jury that he had performed an experiment outside the jury room regarding the cop in a box theory. Tinker did state, however, that the information did not affect her decision in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Juror Saivadore Larosa then testified that he never performed a cop in a box experiment nor did he discuss any experiments with any of the jurors. Juror Joseph Primich also testified that no juror had discussed a cop in a box experiment performed outside the jury room. Juror Robert Tatters testified that no discussions transpired about a cop in a box experiment. After a full hearing, the trial court found that the defense had presented no credible evidence that any demonstration was performed by any of the regular jurors that had \u201cinterfered with, or participated in, or aided, or assisted the jury in coming to [its] decision on the merits of the case.\u201d Further, the trial court stated: \u201cThe court makes a factual determination that there is no evidence, based on the witnesses that the court heard, that the jury at any time took into consideration any concept of a demonstration of the claimed position by the defendant, that one of the jurors set up a box and sat inside of it and looked out to see what he could see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The trial court correctly placed the burden on the defendant to prove actual prejudice. \u201c[T]he right to a jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial indifferent jurors. <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1369, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>28 Conn. App. 388, 395, 611 A.2d 422 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>32 Conn. App. 21, 28, 628 A.2d 11 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>31 Conn. App. 178, 194, 623 A.2d 1052, cert. granted, 226 Conn. 912, 628 A.2d 985 (1993). \u201cA necessary component of the right to an impartial jury is the right to have the jury decide the case \u2018solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given them in the adversary arena after proper instruction on the law by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra, quoting State v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>554 A.2d 1080 (1992). Consideration by the jury of extrinsic evidence can violate the constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 80, 444 A.2d 896 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The trial court must conduct a hearing to determine whether jury misconduct occurred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 28-29; <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra. The hearing allows the trial court to assess the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>supra, 195. Once the trial court finds that consideration of extrinsic evidence occurred, the court must then determine whether the misconduct actually prejudiced the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 442, 521 A.2d 578 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra, 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The trial court followed the proper procedure for determining the motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. It first held a hearing to determine whether juror misconduct occurred. The trial court then found that juror misconduct did not actually prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The determination that the misconduct did not actually prejudice the defendant is not clearly erroneous. \u201c[T]he trial court enjoys broad discretion in determining whether jury misconduct occurred, and, if so, whether such misconduct prejudiced the defendant . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra, 395; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>supra, 77. \u201cThe trial judge is in the best position and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>is uniquely qualified to appraise the probable effect of information on the jury, the materiality of the extraneous material, and its prejudicial nature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>supra. This court will reverse the trial court only if it determines that the factual findings were clearly erroneous. Id. \u201c \u2018A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . .\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019(Citationsomitted.) Dalia v. Lawrence, </em>226 Conn. 51, 71, 627 A.2d 392 (1993); <em>Central Connecticut Teachers Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>27 Conn. App. 435, 437-38, 606 A.2d 729 (1992). On the basis of the record, we are unable to conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of no actual prejudice is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the elements of the crime of using or employing a person under the age of eighteen to sell cocaine in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (c) were identical to the elements of being an accessory to the sale of cocaine in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 2 la-278 (b) except for the additional element that the person used or employed must have been under the age of eighteen. The defendant admits that this claim was not properly preserved in the trial court, but contends that it is nonetheless reviewable under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">\u201c \u2018Our standard of review in cases when the defendant claims that the instructions violate constitutional due process protections is whether the jury instructions were so deficient that it was reasonably possible that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>the jury was misled.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Conn. App. 81, 84, 611 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 920, 614 A.2d 826 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 661, 626 A.2d 287 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>29 Conn. App. 524, 530, 616 A.2d 1143 (1992). A conviction will be reversed only if, considering the charge as a whole, this court determines that there is a \u201creasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 408, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S.

Ed. 2d 512 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>202 Conn. 18, 28, 519 A.2d 607 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Therefore, we must determine if the instructions given by the trial court \u201cwere so deficient as to implicate the constitutional right of the defendant to a fair trial. A jury instruction conforms with constitutional requirements if it provides jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present. . . . An instruction that fails to satisfy these requirements [violates] the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>223 Conn. 595, 602-603, 613 A.2d 731 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>30 Conn.

App. 84, 105, 628 A.2d 1318, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 924, 632 A.2d 702 (1993), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>218 Conn. 458, 465, 590 A.2d 112 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The trial court instructed the jury that the only difference between General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278a (c) and 53a-8 is the age of the person used or employed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>instruction creates a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled. The resolution of this issue requires an analysis of the relationship between the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\u201cThe legislature is presumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them.\u201d <em>Windham First Taxing District v. Windham, </em>208 Conn. 543, 554, 546 A.2d 226 (1988). In addition, \u201cthe court must use common sense in construing statutes and must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended by the promulgating legislature.\u201d Id., 553; <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 589, 590 A.2d 447 (1991). Further, we must presume that when the legislature uses different language, the legislature intends a different meaning of one statute from the other. See <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>144 Conn. 241, 247, 129 A.2d 606, appeal dismissed, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S. Ct. 36, 2 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1957). When we interpret penal statutes, they \u201c \u2018are to be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create liability which no language of the act purports to create.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>216 Conn. 402, 406, 581 A.2d 1045 (1990), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The language of the two statutes is different. Section 21a-278a (c) is violated where a defendant \u201cemploys, hires, uses, persuades, induces, entices or coerces,\u201d whereas \u00a7 53a-8 is violated where a defendant \u201csolicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids. . . .\u201d It is obvious from the words used that the statutes are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>\u201c \u2018In the absence of ambiguity, statutory language should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vachon </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corporation, </em>29 Conn.

The two statutes are distinct and require the jury to find each element of the two statutes beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The instruction by the trial court that the two statutes are the same except for the requirement of age is not a correct statement of the law. The instruction neither provided the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged nor afforded them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.
