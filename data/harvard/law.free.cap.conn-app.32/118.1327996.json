J.</author>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">The primary issue presented by this appeal is whether a prejudgment attachment may be obtained by a subcontractor against property owned by the issuer of a construction performance bond pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied the plaintiff subcontractor\u2019s application for a prejudgment attachment because no evidence had been presented that the surety was in financial difficulty, and, consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s ability to obtain payment for its work was adequately protected by the bond. We conclude that because a subcontractor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>a direct right of action under General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a) against a surety upon a contractor\u2019s refusal to pay a subcontractor, a subcontractor may obtain a prejudgment attachment against property owned by a surety if two conditions are present. First, the subcontractor must make the requisite showing that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the subcontractor\u2019s claim, and, second, the subcontractor must demonstrate that it does not have adequate security in the bond for the ultimate judgment that will likely be obtained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, the court failed to consider evidence relevant to the issue of whether probable cause existed to uphold the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim because it determined that the subcontractor had adequate security in the bond. We, therefore, affirm the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy on the particular facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. In January, 1983, the defendant El Constructors, Inc., entered into a contract with the defendant city of Waterbury to construct a water treatment plant. As required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-41,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> El furnished Waterbury with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>a bond, issued by the defendant Aetna Insurance Company<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the amount of $21 million to ensure that subcontractors supplying labor and materials for the project would be paid by EL</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The plaintiff, Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc., subsequently entered into a subcontract with El to perform part of the work on the treatment plant. Pursuant to the terms of the preprinted subcontract, the plaintiff was to bill El and be paid monthly. The subcontract also stated that El\u2019s payments to the plaintiff were \u201cconditioned on\u201d payment from Waterbury to EI.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the subcontract contained a rider stating that El promised to pay the plaintiff within three business days after receiving payment from the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The plaintiff commenced work on the project sometime in the spring, 1984, but on September 14, 1984, the city terminated its contract with El, and El ordered the plaintiff to cease all work on the project. Meanwhile, the plaintiff had sent invoices to El requesting payment in accord with the terms of the subcontract, but El refused to pay the invoices. The plaintiff then gave notice to Aetna of its claims, but Aetna similarly refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The plaintiff commenced this action against El, Aetna and the city on November 30,1984, seeking payment of its invoices, incidental expenses caused by the alleged breach of the subcontract and interest costs. In its answer, Aetna claimed as a special defense that the plaintiff had no right to immediate payment against it because payment to the plaintiff was conditioned on El\u2019s receipt of payment from Waterbury, which has never occurred. Aetna also claimed that some of the plaintiff\u2019s claims are not covered by the terms of the bond. Subsequently, this action was informally stayed pending the outcome of concurrent litigation in federal court that had been commenced on November 19,1984, by El against the city for wrongful termination of the prime contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On December 5,1991, seven years after the proceedings had been stayed, the plaintiff applied for a prejudgment attachment in the amount of $1.8 million against Aetna to secure payment of the judgment that the plaintiff expected to recover.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Aetna moved to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the plaintiffs application, arguing that a prejudgment attachment was improper because the plaintiffs claim for payment is already secured by the performance bond, and that the plaintiffs right to collect on its claim is conditioned upon the receipt of payment by El from the city, a condition that has not yet occurred. Aetna amplified its position and alleged additional facts in an offer of proof filed simultaneously with its motion to dismiss. Aetna alleged that the plaintiff had received partial payment for its work, and that any claims by the plaintiff for payment for extra work performed had been denied by the city, thereby precluding recovery for those claims. The parties also submitted a joint stipulation of facts stating that Aetna had received a financial rating of Aa3 from Moody\u2019s Investors Rating Report of January 1, 1992, and that the amount of the bond issued by Aetna is $21,274,000. The plaintiff does not assert that the amount of the bond is insufficient to pay its claim because the total amount of all potential claims that may be made against the bond by all of the protected subcontractors would not exceed the face amount of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The court held a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application on February 18, 1992. At the hearing, the court indicated that it would not grant an attachment against Aetna unless there was some evidence that its bond could not be honored, and it denied the application without comment on the same day. The court did not receive evidence on any of the issues raised by either the plaintiff in its application, or by Aetna in its objection and offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Upon the request of the plaintiff, the court subsequently issued an articulation of its decision, wherein it stated: \u201cNo evidence was offered that Aetna . . . is or was in financial difficulty, so as to afford a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s fears that Aetna is in danger of finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>cial collapse. At the present time, the plaintiff is more than adequately protected. Accordingly, the court denied the request for a prejudgment remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The plaintiff argues that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278b, a prejudgment remedy is generally available in any action at law or in equity, and that the specific prejudgment remedy of attachment is generally available in any action where the applicant seeks money damages. General Statutes \u00a7 52-279. The plaintiff contends that nothing in either statute prohibits a subcontractor from obtaining a prejudgment attachment against property of a surety in a suit brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-42. The plaintiff further argues that had the legislature intended to prohibit the use of prejudgment attachments against performance bond sureties, it would have done so expressly, citing <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmor Building </em>Corporation, 28 Conn. App. 809, 818, 614 A.2d 456 (1992). The plaintiff concludes that it is entitled to a prejudgment remedy of attachment against Aetna upon a showing that there is probable cause that judgment will be rendered in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The plaintiff also posits that it is entitled to a prejudgment attachment upon a showing that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of its claim, and that it is not required to show that Aetna would not have sufficient assets to satisfy the judgment. Finally, the plaintiff claims that the trial court committed clear error by improperly failing to consider and resolve the issue of whether the \u201cpay when paid\u201d clause in the subcontract was valid because that issue is central to whether the plaintiff has sustained its burden of demonstrating probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In response, Aetna maintains that our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application is limited to determining whether that decision con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>stituted \u201cclear error,\u201d citing <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 364, 493 A.2d 193 (1985). Aetna claims that the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was adequately secured is not clearly erroneous because Aetna, as surety to El, issued a payment bond for the benefit of El\u2019s subcontractors in the amount of $21 million. This argument is premised on Aetna\u2019s assertion that the plaintiff\u2019s claim arises from its contract with El, and that Aetna\u2019s liability to the plaintiff, if any, arises solely by virtue of Aetna\u2019s status as surety for EL</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Aetna also argues that the scope of the prejudgment remedy statutes is not as broad as the plaintiff contends. Aetna claims that Connecticut case law does not permit a party to seek additional security for a claim that is already adequately secured, and that General Statutes \u00a7 52-304<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> et seq. codifies a policy that surety bonds are adequate security, thereby facilitating the free alienation of property. Lastly, Aetna argues that it was unnecessary for the court to conduct a probable cause hearing or to resolve the \u201cpay when paid\u201d issue once it properly determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to a prejudgment attachment because its claim was adequately secured by Aetna\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The remedy of a plaintiff\u2019s attaching and securing a defendant\u2019s property to satisfy any potential judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor was unknown to the common law and has its genesis in our statutory law. <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 582, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). Additionally, because such a remedy can be harsh in its operation, its application has been confined to the limits set by statute. Id., 584-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Under General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c, any person desiring to secure a prejudgment remedy must make application to the court and include, inter alia, \u201c[a]n affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or any competent affiant setting forth a statement of facts sufficient to show that there is probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d After service of the application1 and supporting papers, the defendant has the right to appear and be heard at a hearing on the application. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d (a). Section 52-278d (a) specifically provides that this \u201chearing shall be limited to a determination of whether or not there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs claim.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u201cPursuant to our prejudgment remedy statutes . . . the trial court\u2019s function is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a judgment will be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in a trial on the merits. . . . The hearing in probable cause for the issuance of a prejudgment remedy is not contemplated to be a full scale trial on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The plaintiff does not have to establish that he will prevail, only that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim. . . . The court\u2019s role in such a hearing is to determine probable success by weighing probabilities. . . . Moreover, this weighing process applies to both legal and factual issues. . . . It is the trial court that must determine, in light of its assessment of the legal issues and the credibility of the witnesses, whether a plaintiff has sustained the burden of showing probable cause to sustain the validity of its claim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>220 Conn. 152, 156-57, 595 A.2d 872 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On appeal, our review of a trial court\u2019s denial of an application for a prejudgment remedy is limited to \u201cwhether the determination of the trial court con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>stituted clear error.\u201d Id., 157. Aetna argues that we should sustain the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff is not entitled to an attachment as a matter of law and because the performance bond provides adequate security for its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Before reaching the issue of whether the plaintiff in this case has sustained its burden of demonstrating that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of its claim, we first consider the more general proposition of whether a subcontractor may properly obtain a prejudgment attachment against property of a performance bond issuer.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 49-42, any subcontractor who has not been paid by the general contractor within ninety days after a claim for payment is made, \u201cmay enforce his right to payment under the [performance] bond by serving a notice of claim ... on the surety that issued the bond .... Within ninety days after service of the notice of claim, the surety shall make payment under the bond and satisfy the claim, or any portion of the claim which is not subject to a good faith dispute, and shall serve a notice on the claimant denying liability for any unpaid portion of the claim. . . . If the surety denies liability on the claim, or any portion thereof, the claimant may bring action upon the payment bond in the superior court for such sums and prosecute the action to final execution and judgment. . . .\u2019\u2019The statute thus gives a subcontractor a direct right of action against the surety for payment if the enumerated conditions are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Upon refusal of a contractor to pay a subcontractor for work and material furnished to a municipal project, the subcontractor has two options. The subcontractor may either bring suit against the general contractor in accord with the provisions of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u00a7 49-41a<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or, alternatively, may bring an action directly against the surety pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-42. Although both of these remedies may be pursued jointly in a single action against both the general contractor and the surety, these two statutory rights are separate and distinct, designed by the legislature to accomplish separate and distinct ends. <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 477, 542 A.2d 692 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The subcontractor has a right to sue the surety directly upon fulfillment of the stated prerequisites. There is nothing in the statutes or case law to suggest that a subcontractor may not also obtain a prejudgment remedy against the surety. As the plaintiff points out, prejudgment remedies \u201cshall be available to a person in any action at law or equity . . . [who] has complied with the provisions of sections 52-278a to 52-278g, inclusive . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also <em>England </em>v. <em>England, </em>184 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Conn. 85, 89, 440 A.2d 790 (1981). Moreover, attachments \u201cmay be granted upon all complaints containing a money demand against the estate of the defendant, both real and personal,\u201d except that such a remedy may not be pursued against any of the defendants specifically enumerated in the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 52-279.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Our decision in <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmor Building Corporation, </em>supra, illuminates this point. In <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>the defendant corporation executed a promissory note in favor of the plaintiff. The note was secured by a mortgage on property of the corporation and by an individual guarantee signed by the corporation\u2019s president. Upon default under the terms of the note, the plaintiff brought suit against the corporation and guarantor. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint sought a foreclosure of the mortgage and a deficiency judgment against the corporation and the individual guarantor. The plaintiff also sought a prejudgment attachment against other property of the corporation to secure payment of the anticipated deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In concluding that the plaintiff in <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>was entitled to a prejudgment attachment, we noted: \u201cThe first sentence of General Statutes \u00a7 52-279 authorizes the granting of attachments \u2018upon all complaints containing a money demand against the estate of the defendant, both real and personal.\u2019 The statute then details specific instances when such attachments are not permitted. None of the enumerated exceptions proscribes the use of attachments in foreclosure actions. It is a well established maxim of statutory construction that when a statute enumerates exceptions to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>stated general proposition, anything not excepted is conclusively included. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u201cThere is also no exception for foreclosure actions in the general prejudgment remedy statute. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a through \u00a7 52-278h. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278b provides for prejudgment remedies in \u2018any action at law or equity.\u2019 Thus, neither the attachment statute nor the prejudgment remedy statute specifically prohibits the granting of a prejudgment attachment in a foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u201cSimilarly, there is nothing in those statutes that specifically prohibits the granting of a prejudgment attachment to secure the payment of a deficiency judgment. If the legislature intended to prevent the use of prejudgment attachments to secure the payment of deficiency judgments in foreclosure cases, then presumably it would have done so. It has not.\u201d <em>People's Bank </em>v. <em>Bil-mor Building Corporation, </em>supra, 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The reasoning of <em>People's Bank </em>is equally applicable here. As in <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>the plaintiff is \u201csimply attempting] to avail itself of a commonly used procedural device in order to improve its chances to receive full recovery of a debt owed to it.\u201d Id., 822. Had the legislature intended to prevent or limit the use of prejudgment remedies in suits brought under General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 it presumably would have done so. We thus conclude that, as a general proposition, a subcontractor who has brought suit against a surety pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 may also obtain a prejudgment remedy if it can demonstrate the requisite probable cause and the need for the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In this case, the trial court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to a prejudgment attachment because no evidence was offered by the plaintiff that Aetna was financially unstable or that the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>not adequately secured. Attachments prior to judgment are a procedural device designed to improve a plaintiffs chances for a full recovery after prevailing at a trial on the merits, and are premised on the contingency that a defendant may not be able to satisfy the eventual award of damages to a plaintiff. In the usual case, where one party sues another and no security has been posted to ensure payment of the probable ultimate judgment, a trial court need determine only whether there is probable cause to sustain the validity of a plaintiff\u2019s claim, and, if so, set a dollar amount for the attachment that will provide the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">In cases where some security exists for the payment of the debt, however, as in mortgage foreclosure actions, the question for a trial court is enlarged. In such cases, the court not only must determine what the amount of the judgment will probably be, but what additional security, beyond the security the plaintiff has already, will be necessary to equal that probable judgment. See <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmor Building Corporation, </em>supra. A plaintiff is not required to exhaust the collateral securing a debt before it attempts to reach other assets of a defendant by way of attachment, but the collateral must be taken into account in establishing the amount of the attachment necessary as a supplement. <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>supra. Thus, a plaintiff may be entitled to a prejudgment remedy because it has demonstrated the requisite probable cause, but it may still be denied the remedy if its interest is already adequately secured. The plaintiff in this case does not argue that the amount of the bond was insufficient to cover his claim or that his claim is inadequately secured by the bond because other subcontractors had already exhausted or could exhaust the amount of the bond, so that he needs additional security as in <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>or <em>Schlesinger. </em>His argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ment is, rather, that he needs the simultaneous security of a prejudgment remedy because the bond may not be paid because of the possible precarious financial condition of Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The trial court did not consider whether the plaintiff had established probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim; it merely determined that the plaintiff was adequately protected by the performance bond, and thus denied the application for prejudgment attachment. We hold, as a matter of law, that a subcontractor protected by \u00a7 49-42 (a) is entitled, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278c and 52-278d, to a probable cause hearing during which it may prove that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of its claim and probable cause to prove entitlement to security in addition to the bond provided by General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In this case, however, even if the plaintiff could sustain the validity of its claim because it was owed sums by El that were secured by the bond and because the \u201cpay when paid\u201d clause did not exonerate Aetna from paying the plaintiff, the plaintiff did not show or make an offer of proof that it needed additional security to safeguard its probable judgment. Because that is so, it would make no difference if the plaintiff could have sustained the validity of the debt owed to it by El and the right to collect that amount from Aetna on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The judgment denying the application for a prejudgment remedy is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under the provisions of section 49-41 and who has not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which the claim is made, may enforce his right to payment under the bond by serving a notice of claim within one hundred eighty days after the date on which he performed the last of the labor or furnished the last of the material for which the claim is made, on the surety that issued the bond and a copy of the notice on the contractor named as principal in the bond. . . .Within ninety days after service of the notice of claim, the surety shall make payment under the bond and satisfy the claim, or any portion of the claim which is not subject to a good faith dispute, and shall serve a notice on the claimant denying liability for any unpaid portion of the claim. ...

Aetna failed to respond to this offer, and, thus, under \u00a7 52-192a, the plaintiff will be entitled to prejudgment interest on the entire amount of the judgment from the date the action was commenced if it recovers an amount in excess of $300,000 after trial. See <em>Lutynski </em>v. <em>B.B. &amp; J. Trucking, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 806, 628 A.2d 1 (1993).
