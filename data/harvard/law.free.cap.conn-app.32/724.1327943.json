The defendant makes no claim challenging the conviction of possession of a pistol. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) found that he did not show substantial evidence of drug dependency, and (2) denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of criminal impersonation. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On May 21, 1991, Officers Ramano Ratti, Clarence Willoughby and Thomas Trocchio of the New Haven police department were on patrol at approximately 6:30 p.m. in the area of 68-70 Sylvan Avenue in New Haven.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As they approached 68-70 Sylvan Avenue, Ratti observed what appeared to be the handle of a revolver protruding from the waistband of the defendant, who was standing on the sidewalk. Ratti and Willoughby jumped out of their vehicle, pursued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>defendant for several blocks, and apprehended him in the area of 66 Orchard Street. A search of the defendant revealed twenty-six glassine bags, each containing a white powdery substance, later identified as cocaine, and $491 in cash. An operable Colt Python .357 magnum revolver was seized from the defendant, for which he did not have a permit. When arrested, the defendant identified himself as John Williams. It was subsequently determined from fingerprints that the person who identified himself as John Williams is also known as Glen Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">At a hearing before the trial court, the defendant offered testimony from Sonya Cherry that she has known the defendant for one year, that she saw him use drugs on a daily basis, that he free-based cocaine three or four times a day, and that drug use affected his behavior such that he would act moody when he was not under the influence of drugs. She further testified that she was his girlfriend and that she free-based cocaine and smoked marijuana with the defendant every now and then.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The trial judge ruled at the end of the witness\u2019 testimony that the defendant had not made a threshold showing of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the defendant was a drug-dependent person at the time of his arrest. The trial court then allowed a substitute information that deleted all language dealing with drug dependency in the counts alleging violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 21a-278a (b). At the trial, there was no evidence presented by the state to show that the defendant intended to impersonate a real person in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-130 other than that the defendant told the arresting officers that his name was John Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">We review the defendant\u2019s second claim first because the state concedes error and, upon review, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Section 53a-130 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal impersonation when he: (1) Impersonates another and does an act in such assumed character with intent to obtain a benefit or to injure or defraud another . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 479 A.2d 814 (1984), our Supreme Court held that because \u00a7 53a-130 (a) prohibits impersonating \u201canother,\u201d it does not prohibit merely giving a false name. The plain meaning of \u201canother\u201d is \u201csome other real person.\u201d Therefore, giving a false name is not impersonation unless the name given is that of a real person. Id., 220-22. For this reason, the state must adduce evidence at trial that the name a defendant gives belongs to a real person. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In this case, when the defendant was arrested, he gave his name to the police as John Williams. The defendant had given this name to the police in the past, and, at the time of his arrest, they knew him by this name. Fingerprint analysis subsequently established that the defendant was Glen Jackson. Although the state introduced evidence of the defendant\u2019s real name and the false name he gave, the state did not produce any evidence that John Williams is a real person. Thus, the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the basis of insufficiency of evidence. We reverse the judgment of conviction of criminal impersonation and direct a judgment of acquittal on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Next, we take up the defendant\u2019s claim that because he presented substantial evidence of drug dependency, the trial court should have instructed the jury on that issue. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The trial court, in its ruling on substantial evidence of drug dependency, said: \u201cAs far as the court is concerned, the defendant \u2014 the burden that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>bears initially is to show substantial evidence. The only testimony in this case was the testimony that ... we heard yesterday from Sonya Cherry. Sonya Cherry is certainly \u2014 she is not a medical person; she is not a doctor; she is not an expert and the only thing I heard in this court was that in fact she is aware of or was aware of the fact that the defendant had imbibed in the consumption of freebasing coke and smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\u201cThe statute also talks in terms of who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person. Of course that time would have to refer to May 21, 1991. I really \u2014 I don\u2019t recall hearing anything specifically testified to about his use of any drugs concerning that particular date.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cThe court does not feel that the testimony that was elicited yesterday in court is sufficient or does not amount to, as far as this court is concerned, to substantial evidence. One might then say how would a person go about proving such a thing? Well, there [are] several different ways. The defendant could testify about it but I only heard the one person and, as I say, the court does not feel that produced substantial evidence to turn this thing the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\u201cAnd as far as the defendant is concerned, he has the choice whether he wishes to testify or not testify and that\u2019s a matter solely within his own discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">\u201cSo my ruling on this matter is that the defendant has not produced substantial evidence to turn this thing the other way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The judge\u2019s ruling on substantial evidence and the verdict took place prior to our Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). The sentencing in this case took place subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>quent to the publication of <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>supra. We conclude that under the <em>Hart </em>standard, the trial court\u2019s ruling was improper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The jury verdict convicting the defendant was reached on February 21,1992. On April 10,1992, the defendant was sentenced. Our Supreme Court released its opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>supra, on April 7, 1992. \u201cIn a criminal proceeding, there is no final judgment until the imposition of a sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>202 Conn. 86, 89, 519 A.2d 1201 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grot-ton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 339, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992). The holding in <em>Hart </em>became the law of this state before the judgment of the trial court became an appealable final judgment. Because final judgment was not rendered in this case until after <em>Hart </em>was decided by our Supreme Court, a retroactive application <em>of Hart </em>is not involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The <em>Hart </em>court made two significant holdings. First, in a departure from the burden shifting scenario set out in the earlier cases, the court held that \u201c[General Statutes] \u00a7 21a-269<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> assigns to the defendant the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>den of persuading the jury by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is drug-dependent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>supra, 610-11. Second, and more significant to the circumstances of this case, the court stated: \u201cIn the future, the trial court should instruct the jury concerning the issue of drug dependency and the defendant\u2019s burden of proof if it determines that there is <em>any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible </em>.... <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 613. <em>Hart </em>significantly lowers the standard of what constitutes sufficient evidence, produced by the defendant, to send the issue of drug dependency to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">We conclude, applying the <em>Hart </em>standard, that the testimony of Cherry regarding the defendant\u2019s asserted drug dependency was clearly a \u201cfoundation in the evidence\u201d sufficient to require the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of drug dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the charges of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent, possession of a narcotic substance within 1000 feet of a school by a person who is not drug-dependent and criminal impersonation, and the case is remanded for a new trial on the two narcotics charges, and with direction to render a judgment of acquittal on the charge of criminal impersonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>21 Conn. App. 519, 574 A.2d 1314, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 807, 580 A.2d 64 (1990), we held that the trial court, in assessing substantial evidence, is limited to determining whether the defendant has introduced sufficient evidence, if credited by the jury, to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not drug-dependent. It is the trial court\u2019s duty to weigh all the evidence and to determine whether that evidence, if believed by the jury, would permit a reasonable jury to entertain a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not drug-dependent at the time of the alleged crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>23 Conn. App. 592, 593, 583 A.2d 931 (1990), cert. denied, 217 Conn. 807, 584 A.2d 1192 (1991). In <em>State </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>supra, we defined substantial evidence of drug dependency by analogy to insanity cases. \u201cIt is not the trial court\u2019s function to determine the credibility of the insanity evidence; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>213 Conn. 243, 256, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989) (credibility is within the province of the jury); but only to assure that the burden of proving sanity is not put on the state where there has been only a tangential, casual, or frivolous mention of the defendant\u2019s possible lack of sanity. By analogy, therefore, in a drug prosecution the trial court is limited to determining whether the defendant has introduced sufficient evidence, if credited by the jury, to raise a reasonable doubt as to non-drug-dependency.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>supra, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Prior to <em>Hart, </em>the state had the right in the first instance to rely on the presumption that the defendant was not drug-dependent. Once the defendant introduced some substantial evidence tending to prove his drug dependency, however, drug dependency became an issue in the case, the presumption lost its effect, and the state then bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not drug-dependent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 169, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In this case, even under the <em>preHart </em>substantial evidence standard, the trial court improperly determined that the defendant failed to present substantial evidence of drug dependency. During its oral ruling on the issue of drug dependency, the trial court implied that the evidence presented was insufficient because there was no medical testimony. The trial court said: \u201cSonya Cherry is certainly \u2014 -she is not a medical person; she is not a doctor; she is not an expert and the only thing I heard in this court was that in fact she is aware of or was aware of the fact that the defendant had imbibed in the consumption of freebasing coke and smoking marijuana.\u201d As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 601, <em>\u201cMcNeil </em>does not require testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>mony of a medical expert; all that is necessary is substantial evidence of drug dependency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS0\">In this case, the defendant presented evidence, through the testimony of his girlfriend, Sonya Cherry, to prove that he was a drug-dependent person on May 21,1991. She testified that he smoked cocaine on a daily basis and that the drugs affeeted his behavior. The state argues that the evidence presented did not amount to substantial evidence of drug dependency because the evidence was not of the type and quantity presented by the defendants in <em>McNeil, Rivera </em>and <em>Hart. </em>In those cases, the state argues, psychic or physical dependence upon a drug was established through a variety of substantive testimony, including consistent long-term use, the awareness by the defendant or the defendant\u2019s friends or family of the substance abuse, physical or social problems related to drug use, or existence of the dependence at the time the offense was committed. Those cases, however, did not establish a minimum standard for the quantity of evidence that must be presented, nor did they stipulate the type of evidence that must be-offered. The earlier cases require only that substantial evidence be presented that, if believed by the jury, could lead the jury to conclude that there, is a reasonable doubt that the defendant is not drug-dependent. We conclude that evidence, presented by someone purportedly close to the defendant, that the defendant free-based cocaine on a daily basis over a long period of time, and experienced mood swings when he was not using drugs, could lead a reasonable jury to determine that a reasonable doubt exists as to whether the defendant is not drug-dependent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> Had the <em>Hart </em>opinion not been issued before final judgment was rendered in this case, we would nevertheless be bound to apply <em>Hart </em>retroactively. \u201cAs a rule, judicial decisions apply retroactively. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Neil, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>409 U.S. 505, 507-508, 93 S. Ct. 876, 35 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1973). Indeed, a legal system based on precedent has a built-in presumption of retroactivity. <em>Solem v. Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 642, 104 S. Ct. 1338, 79 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1984). If a new constitutional doctrine is truly right, we should not reverse lower courts which have accepted it; nor should we affirm those which have rejected the very arguments we have embraced. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 555, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982), quoting Desist v. <em>United </em>States, 394 U.S. 244, 259, 89 S. Ct. 1030, 22 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 339, 514 A.2d 337 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u201cThe fundamental basis for testing whether a decision should be given retrospective effect is whether the rule which it lays down goes \u2018to the fairness of the trial \u2014 the very integrity of the fact-finding process.\u2019 <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 639, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601 [1965].\u201d <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>155 Conn. 591, 601, 236 A.2d 909 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The <em>Hart </em>holdings clearly go to the issues of fairness and integrity of the factfinding process. Under <em>Hart, </em>a defendant merely has to present some evidence, even weak or incredible evidence, and the issue of drug dependency will remain in the case and be sent to the jury. The <em>Hart </em>holdings'on the one hand make it easier for the defendant to get the issue of drug dependency to the jury, while, on the other hand, require the defendant to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, drug dependency. In this case the issue of drug dependency was not presented to the jury, but it should have been presented under the <em>Hart </em>rule. Furthermore, if the case goes forward on the presumption that the defendant is not drug-dependent, the defendant is subject to conviction under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 and 21a-278a, which apply to persons who are not drug-dependent and carry severe mandatory minimum sentences, rather than under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277, which does not carry mandatory minimum sentences. The enhanced penalties provided under \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 and 21a-278a for a defendant who was not drug-dependent affect the length of the defendant\u2019s potential incarceration. Because fairness and the integrity of the factfinding process are implicated by <em>Hart, </em>we would be bound to apply it retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-269 provides: \u201cIn any complaint, information or indictment, and in any action or proceeding brought for the enforcement of any provision of this part, it shall not be necessary to negative any exception, excuse, provisto or exemption contained in said section, and the burden of proof of any such exception, excuse, proviso or exemption shall be upon the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
