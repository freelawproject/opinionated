On December 21, 1987, the permit was granted subject to the developer\u2019s obtaining all necessary zoning permits and meeting various other conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>owner of a condominium unit located on adjoining property, appealed to the trial court from the decision granting the permit. That appeal was dismissed on May 5, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On April 11, 1988, Georgetown applied to the New London planning and zoning commission for a site plan approval and a coastal site plan approval for a fifty unit residential condominium project. On June 29, 1988, after extensive hearings, that application was approved. The plaintiff in this case also appealed to the trial court from the decision granting the site plan approvals. Judgment in that case was rendered on February 15, 1990, for the defendant. The trial court found that there was ample evidence in the record to justify the site plan approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>In December, 1988, the commission granted the defendant Georgetown a one year extension of the inland wetlands permit. On November 13,1989, prior to the expiration of the permit, Georgetown sought an additional one year extension by letter. The commission did not act on the reply until January 8,1990, when it granted the extension retroactive to December 22, 1989, the date on which the first extension expired. This appeal is taken by the plaintiff from the granting of the second extension. Subsequent to the commission\u2019s decision granting the second extension, Georgetown conveyed the subject property to the defendant Saybrook Bank and Trust Company (Saybrook Bank). The trial court granted Saybrook Bank\u2019s motion to be made a defendant and, after hearing the case, found in favor of the commission and Saybrook Bank. In December, 1991, after the trial court\u2019s decision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) became the receiver of Saybrook Bank. The FDIC\u2019s motion to be made a substitute defendant was granted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">We hold (1) that the permit to conduct a regulated activity runs with the land and not with the applicant, and (2) that, on the facts of this case, in which a valid permit was issued to conduct a regulated activity within a specified time period and appeals from the granting of the necessary permits to conduct that activity were not resolved within the time period during which the activity was required to begin, that time period is tolled until all litigation is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The plaintiff argues that an inland wetlands permit is a personal permit attached to the individual applicant that does not attach to the land and follow the title. We disagree. A review of the applicable statutes shows that the permit process is concerned with the property and not the applicant. In enacting ordinances and regulations and in granting, denying or limiting any per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>mit for a regulated activity, an inland wetlands agency is required to consider those factors set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-41, 22a-42a (d) and 22a-42e.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>A permit is issued or denied on the basis of conditions relating to the land such as the topography, soil type, and the nature, extent, and effect of the proposed activity on the land. The factors in the statutes that can be considered by the inland wetlands agencies pertain only to the land and not to the applicants or owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Our Supreme Court has recognized the legal principle that a zoning variance runs with the land and not with the property owner. In <em>Garibaldi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>163 Conn. 235, 239, 303 A.2d 743 (1972), the court said: \u201cBy its very definition, a variance is granted with respect to a particular piece of property; it can be enjoyed not only by the present owner but by all subsequent owners. 2 Anderson, American Law of Zoning \u00a7 14.29, p. 662.\u201d See T. Tondro, Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>cut Land Use Regulation (2d Ed. 1992), p. 124. Courts in other jurisdictions have recognized that conditional use permits run with the land and not with the owner. See <em>County of Imperial </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>19 Cal. 3d 505, 564 P.2d 14, 138 Cal. Rptr. 472 (1977); <em>Northpointe Plaza </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>457 N.W.2d 398, 401 (Minn. App. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We hold that an inland wetlands permit is concerned solely with the property to be regulated, and that the change of ownership does not affect the validity of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the permit has expired by the passage of time and that the commission had no authority to grant the second extension from which this appeal arises. Georgetown first applied for the inland wetlands permit, and it was granted, in December, 1987, and the plaintiff appealed. The wetlands permit was granted subject to zoning approval. In April, 1988, Georgetown applied simultaneously for zoning site plan approval and coastal area management site plan approval, which the New London planning and zoning commission granted. The plaintiff immediately appealed from that decision also. In December, 1988, the commission granted a one year extension of the wetlands permit, and, in January, 1990, the commission granted a second extension retroactive to December, 1989, from which the present appeal was taken. The appeal from the granting of the inland wetlands permit was dismissed in May, 1988, and the appeal from the site plan approvals was dismissed on February 15, 1990. The defendants have been involved with the present application for an inland wetlands permit since 1987 because of the appeals brought by a single plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The plaintiff argues that since there was no stay in effect, the defendant Georgetown, and its successors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>could have begun construction. We, however, agree with the court in <em>McGavin </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>26 Conn. Sup. 251, 255, 217 A.2d 229 (1965), that to have begun construction during the pendency of the appeal might have been considered \u201creckless conduct\u201d on the part of the landowner. This is especially true in this case because the wetlands permit was conditioned on obtaining the necessary zoning permits, and there were two appeals from the initial granting of the permits. If the defendant applicants had disturbed the wetlands and either of the appeals were lost so as to void the wetlands permit, they would have had to restore the wetlands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The plaintiff further argues that the regulation in effect at the time of the original granting of the permit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> controls, allowing only one extension, rather than the one that went into effect on June 15, 1990,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>allows unlimited extensions. He bases his claim on General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42e. See footnote 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The obvious remedy is to toll the one year duration of the permit until all appeals are decided. See T. Ton-dro, supra, p. 521. \u201cCases from other states hold that an appeal from the granting of an issuance or permit is a defense to the fact that the successful applicant did not use the permit or variance within the time period otherwise provided by law.\u201d R. Fuller, Land Use Law and Practice (1993) \u00a7 24.10, p. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\u201cThe Massachusetts Supreme Court in <em>Belfer </em>v. <em>Building Commissioner of Boston </em>[363 Mass. 439, 294 N.E.2d 857 (1973)] held that where zoning variances were granted and could not as a practical matter be used during the pendency of an appeal by persons challenging the granting of the variances, that the filing of the appeal from the granting of the variance tolled the running of the two-year period during which variances had to be used and building permits had to be issued. The court concluded that such a rule was essential, stating: \u2018Otherwise a variance which was lawfully awarded can be frustrated by the delay inherent in an appeal. Unless an appeal tolls the time period, many variances would be meaningless.\u2019 [Id.]\u201d R. Fuller, supra; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals, </em>366 Mass. 197, 316 N.E.2d 501 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">In <em>Tantimonaco </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Johnston, </em>102 R.I. 594, 599-600, 232 A.2d 385 (1967), the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>of Rhode Island rejected a contention by adjacent landowners that the time for commencing construction under a building permit should continue to run after they initiated an appeal that challenged the zoning permit allowing the construction of a gas station. The court said: \u201cAs heretofore noted, petitioners challenged the validity of that permit by seeking a review of the board\u2019s decision with the filing of their petition for cer-tiorari on June 8, 1965. Although the filing of such a petition does not act as a stay, G. L. 1956, \u00a7 45-24-20, common prudence understandably acts as a brake against incurring obligations, the benefits of which would be cancelled by an adverse decision of this court. Apart from the question as it may be affected by a change in the zoning regulations, we think it clear that the requirement of activating a permit set forth in an ordinance does not apply during such time as the legality of a permit is open to question by reason of litigation amounting to an appeal from the issuance thereof.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In <em>Cranston </em>v. <em>Carpionato, </em>115 R.I. 63, 340 A.2d 134 (1975), an individual challenged the validity of certain building permits, and on appeal contended that the permits were revoked by a zoning ordinance that required that construction be commenced within ninety days of the date of the permit. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island rejected this argument, stating: \u201cAlthough we agree with the city that <em>Tantimonaco </em>v. <em>Zoning Board [of Johnston], </em>supra, is factually distinguishable from this case, we remain unconvinced that its reasoning is inapplicable here. In that case, we recognized the unlikelihood that a man of common prudence would incur obligations the benefits of which might be can-celled by an adverse decision of this court, and we consequently concluded that an ordinance requiring the activation of a building permit within a fixed period ought not to apply \u2018. . . during such time as the legal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ity of a permit is open to question by reason of litigation amounting to an appeal from the issuance thereof. [Id., 600].\u2019 \u201d <em>Cranston </em>v. <em>Carpionato, </em>supra, 67. The Rhode Island Supreme Court reasoned that since the validity of the building permits would be uncertain during the period of litigation, that time should be excluded in computing the time period within which construction was to commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>In Presault v. Wheel, </em>132 Vt. 247, 253-54, 315 A.2d 244 (1974), the Vermont Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe conclude that the more soundly reasoned cases from other jurisdictions support the proposition that where a valid permit is issued for a specified period, and where actual construction is delayed by litigation, involving parties who have standing to oppose construction, past that time, a permittee otherwise proceeding in good faith is entitled to reissuance of that permit, even where the zoning was meanwhile changed so that the project is nonconforming.\u201d \u201cFor this Court to hold that a developer, proceeding as expeditiously as possible, must be denied reissuance of the permit he first applied for and received solely because his application for a second essential permit resulted in litigation of more than a year\u2019s duration would go beyond the desired and worthwhile goal of controlling development. Such a holding would make development a pure gamble; success would depend on the whim of adversaries to litigate or not. This result would contravene our announced policy that a good faith developer should be able to proceed with assurance.\u201d Id., 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The plaintiff argues that we should adopt the reasoning of the trial court in <em>ASL Associates </em>v. <em>Proch, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 370080 (December 12, 1990), which rejected the tolling of the time limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>on permits saying that General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 8-8<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides for a restraining order, and that, had good cause been shown, an order tolling the nine month period could have been issued. Id., 30. We reject this reasoning because there is a myriad of agencies from which many property owners must obtain approval, and, in many instances, one permit is dependent on another, as in this case. We note, for example, that permits or approval are needed with regard to zone changes, special permits, variances, inland wetlands, historic districts, site plans, coastal area management, subdivisions, and water protection ordinances. In the last six years, the method of appeal under the Inland Wetlands Act has changed three times.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">There is no legislative history to \u00a7 8-8 as originally passed in 1925 before the advent of the myriad of land use regulatory bodies that exist today. We hold that the statute provides in cases covered by \u00a7 8-8 a means for an appellant to stay any action on the approved application until the appeal is decided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since there is a void in the statutory scheme for the protection of the appellee developer in this case, we hold that on the facts of this case the time limitations on the permit are tolled until this litigation is terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>In this case, the defendant Georgetown and its successors, the Saybrook Bank and the FDIC, complied with all the applicable regulations in obtaining their permits, and the plaintiff exercised his legal right opposing the granting of the permits before the appropriate boards and the courts. The defendant Georgetown and its successors prevailed both before the regulating agencies and in the courts. Yet, six years later, the plaintiff is before this court arguing that because of the passage of time the inland wetlands permit has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The regulatory process is not designed to be a spider\u2019s web, snaring one who follows all the regulations and statutes, obtains all the necessary permits, and successfully defends a series of appeals, but then loses his right to proceed because the passage of time has caused the permits to expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-10\"> The defendant Saybrook Bank and Trust Company is the successor in title of Saybrook Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the receiver of the defendant Georgetown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\"> The conditions on which the permit was granted in December, 1987, were listed in a letter, dated December 22, 1987, from James R.
