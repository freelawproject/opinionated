(RKO) in Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City. Renewal of the Boston license was denied because of a finding that RKO lacked the requisite char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>acter to be a licensee of that station. The denial of license renewals in Los Angeles and New York City followed from the Commission\u2019s earlier determination that the Boston finding would be <em>res judicata </em>in those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">RKO is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Tire &amp; Rubber Company (General Tire).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Tire, by its own admission, has engaged in a staggering variety of corporate misconduct. During the Boston proceeding, RKO withheld evidence of General Tire\u2019s conduct from the FCC, either because RKO sought to protect its parent or because the parent withheld information from the subsidiary in order to protect itself. The Commission, in turn, has disqualified RKO after years of delay in an opinion that is multifarious at best. We reject most of the grounds that the FCC used to justify its denial of RKO\u2019s license renewals. We affirm the Commission\u2019s decision that RKO lacked candor, but on a quite narrow ground that cannot automatically be applied to any other proceeding. Accordingly, although we uphold denial of the Boston license renewal, the proceedings in Los An-geles and New York City must be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The need for a remand and further action by the Commission is discomfiting in a fifteen-year-old case, but this extended proceeding has hardly been a model for the administrative process. We admonish all parties to get on with the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AFo\">Extraordinary as it may seem, this case had its beginning in 1965, when RKO petitioned to renew its license for KHJ-TV in Los Angeles. The petition was opposed by a competing applicant on a variety of grounds, including the allegation that RKO had engaged in reciprocal trade practices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A comparative hearing on the two applications led to a Commission finding in 1973 in favor of RKO,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> subject to further findings on the reciprocity issue<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the Boston proceeding discussed below. A fuller history of these events may be found in <em>Fidelity Television, Inc. v. FCC, </em>515 F.2d 684 (D.C.Cir.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>423 U.S. 926, 96 S.Ct. 271, 46 L.Ed.2d 253 (1975), which affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">In the meantime, other competing applicants had challenged RKO\u2019s license renewal application for WNAC-TV in Boston. <em>RKO General, Inc. (WNAC), </em>20 F.C.C.2d 846 (1969). The FCC also designated a reci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>procity issue in the Boston proceeding, and authorized that official notice be taken of the KHJ-TV record. Similarly, when RKO sought renewal of WOR-TV in New York City in 1974, the FCC determined that RKO\u2019s application would be bound by the record in the Boston proceeding then underway.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">With renewals in New York and Los An-geles conditioned upon its outcome, the Boston proceeding took on special importance. An Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision in that proceeding on June 21, 1974, granting renewal to RKO despite affirmative findings as to RKO\u2019s reciprocal trade practices.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Exceptions and reply pleadings were then filed before the Commission in response to that initial decision. Before the FCC could act on these administrative appeals, however, RKO\u2019s parent corporation found itself enmeshed in an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would greatly impact RKO\u2019s petitions to the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In a series of civil actions brought in 1974 and 1975, the SEC had charged that questionable domestic and foreign payments by American corporations and falsification of corporate financial records to conceal such payments violated the federal securities laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One of the SEC\u2019s targets was General Tire, and RKO\u2019s competing applicants in the Boston proceeding sought to take advantage of that fact. On December 10, 1975, Community Broadcasting of Boston, Inc. (Community) filed a petition to reopen the record for a hearing on \u201cillegal and improper conduct\u201d by General Tire in the United States and foreign countries, including bribery of officials, creation of secret accounts, misappropriation of foreign corporate funds, and deliberate concealment of these matters by General Tire and RKO.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">RKO opposed this move in a series of pleadings. On January 21, 1976, it urged that there was \u201cno factual or legal foundation\u201d for these charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In June 1977, well after the SEC had filed a complaint and obtained a consent decree against General Tire,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> RKO continued to oppose the petition to reopen the record in oral argument before the Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The consent decree required General Tire to conduct a review of its operations and prepare a Special Report, however. This report, which was released on July 1, 1977,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> admitted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>plethora of corporate misconduct, and documented inadequacies in RKO records for certain reports previously filed with the FCC. Nevertheless, RKO continued to oppose the need for further proceedings, claiming that all \u201cessential facts\u201d concerning its operation of WNAC were before the Commission, and that because resolution of Community\u2019s claims \u201cturns on inferences and legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts, the Commission would be well within its authority in deciding this case without holding a further evidentiary hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">For reasons that may be partially attributable to strategic maneuvering among two of the many RKO competitors,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the FCC did not act on Community\u2019s petition to reopen the Boston proceeding until June 21, 1979. A week later, the Commission directed the parties to file summaries of their positions and present oral argument on the following questions:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azq\">(1) Is the record in this proceeding sufficient for the Commission to make a judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">(a) that RKO is qualified to remain the licensee of Station WNAC-TV, Boston, Massachusetts; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(b) that RKO is not qualified to remain the licensee of Station WNAC-TV, Boston, Massachusetts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">(2) In the event that the record is sufficient to make either of the above judgments, what should that judgment be?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Oral argument was held before the Commission en banc shortly thereafter. The FCC concluded that it could answer the first question: RKO could not be found qualified to remain a licensee on the existing record. It decided to seek further information before answering the other questions, however.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Two days later, the FCC reopened the record to accept the Special Report into evidence, and urged that RKO \u201cmake a particularized proffer of specific evidence that it would introduce, if given the opportunity, to mitigate the findings\u201d of that report.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> RKO proffered evidence and affidavits in September 1979. RKO also now contended that it deserved additional hearings before the Commission could find it not qualified.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">On June 6, 1980, the FCC issued three companion orders resolving the WNAC proceeding and the two other license renewals that had been conditioned upon it.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>WNAC decision (Decision) focused on four specific areas of misconduct by RKO and General Tire: reciprocal trade practices by RKO and General Tire during the 1960s, <em>id. </em>at HH 58-92; General Tire\u2019s misconduct in a variety of nonbroadcast fields, <em>id. </em>at HH 93-162; inaccurate financial reports filed by RKO with the FCC, <em>id. </em>at HH 163-195; and RKO\u2019s general lack of candor during the course of the Boston proceeding, <em>id. </em>at HH 196-221. The Decision concluded that nothing in RKO\u2019s broadcast history mitigated these findings, <em>id. </em>at HH 222-32, and that absolute disqualification of RKO as a broadcast licensee was the only appropriate remedy, <em>id. </em>at HH 233-49. The companion orders accordingly disqualified RKO as a licensee of WOR-TV (New York) and KHJ-TV (Los Angeles).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Of the four grounds for disqualification, only reciprocal practices had been the subject of formal notice and hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. The FCC\u2019s findings as to General Tire\u2019s nonbroadcast misconduct and RKO\u2019s financial misrepresentations relied heavily on the Special Report. The findings concerning RKO\u2019s lack of candor rested on RKO\u2019s failure to make timely submission of the information contained in the Special Report, as reflected by RKO\u2019s earlier pleadings before the Commission. On each of these three points, the Decision rejected RKO\u2019s argument that it could not be disqualified without formal notice and hearing. <em>Id. </em>at HH 144-61 (General Tire\u2019s nonbroadcast misconduct); <em>id. </em>at HH 193-95 (financial inaccuracies); <em>id. </em>at HH 219-221 (lack of candor).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">RKO appealed from all three orders denying license renewal, and the appeals were consolidated by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">II. INVALID BASES OF THE FCC DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">At the outset, we hold that the FCC has stated at least three independent grounds for its ultimate finding that RKO should be disqualified as a broadcast licensee in Boston.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Decision states that RKO\u2019s reciprocal dealings \u201calone\u201d require disqualification, <em>id. </em>at H 92, that RKO\u2019s \u201cwillful and repeated [financial] misrepresentation warrants disqualification by itself,\u201d <em>id. </em>at H164, and that \u201cperhaps of greatest importance, RKO has demonstrated a persistent lack of candor with the Commission in these proceedings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at H 55(a). Our conclusion also follows from the structure and organization of the FCC Decision, which distinctly sets out findings of fact for each of these grounds and treats each of them as entirely separate. We must note that the FCC continues to struggle with the difficult art of drafting its opinions. In <em>Leflore Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>636 F.2d 454 (D.C.Cir.1980), for example, we emphasized that the Commission has some burden to express the basis for its actions carefully:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">Where several violations are found, the Commission should set forth the role each plays in the assessment of penalty. Rarely should the agency be permitted to take a \u201cgestalt\u201d approach, one based upon a reaction to the \u201coverall\u201d situation rather than to each violation one at a time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYFW\"><em>Id. </em>at 463. Nevertheless, although we may not supply a reasoned basis for agency action that the agency itself has not given, courts \u201cwill uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285-86, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442-43, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <em>WAIT Radio v. FCC, </em>418 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C.Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1027, 93 S.Ct. 461, 34 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972). A fair reading of the Decision compels the conclusion that these three grounds are independent, and that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the FCC\u2019s view each one by itself required the disqualification of RKO as a licensee.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">This preliminary observation is important because we have grave doubts about the sufficiency of two of these grounds to support the FCC\u2019s action. The Commission\u2019s findings on reciprocal trading display a disconcerting willingness to judge the behavior of broadcast applicants by standards that had not been clearly enunciated when that behavior occurred. The finding that RKO knowingly submitted inaccurate financial reports and thereby intended to mislead the Commission raises extremely troublesome questions because of the FCC\u2019s failure to give RKO notice and a hearing on that issue. Moreover, we agree with the Commission that General Tire\u2019s nonbroadcast practices, the fourth focus of the FCC Decision, are \u201cnot disqualifying by themselves.\u201d Decision H 140. The remand on the other two license renewals is occasioned at least in part by the rejection of these decisional grounds, to whose inadequacies we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">A. <em>Reciprocal Trade Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">There are several reasons to doubt that reciprocal trade practices during the early 1960s can justify outright disqualification of RKO as a broadcast licensee in 1980. First and foremost, the conduct of RKO at issue has been found to be clearly improper only in retrospect. Although it has been understood since the 1930s that \u201ccoercive\u201d reciprocity was anticompetitive,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> it was not until the late 1960s that a series of judicial decisions began to cast increasing doubt on the legality and propriety of unleveraged \u201cmutual patronage\u201d agreements.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Even then, however, questions remained.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>late as 1979, the FCC itself recognized that a <em>per se </em>rule was probably inappropriate because \u201cit is still somewhat uncertain whether a non-coercive unleveraged reciprocal agreement . . . necessarily and in every case is anticompetitive and a Sherman \u00a7 1 violation.\u201d <em>Domestic Public Message Services, </em>73 F.C.C.2d 151, 161 (1979). As a result, although we are not in absolute agreement with RKO that the challenged conduct was \u201cundertaken in good faith,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the FCC\u2019s conclusion rests not on a fair reading of the contemporaneous law but upon a \u201cgreater appreciation now for the adverse impact of reciprocal trade practices on the broadcast industry and thus on the public interest.\u201d Decision 186 n.156. The FCC unquestionably has the authority and even the duty to change its mind as to the degree of anticompetitive practices that are not in the public interest. <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert., denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). Such a finding may not be applied retroactively, however, to conduct that ceased almost fifteen years ago. <em>Securities Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We are particularly concerned that in retroactively applying its \u201cgreater appreciation\u201d for the adverse effects of reciprocal trading, the FCC has abruptly reversed its decision to the contrary in <em>RKO General, Inc. (KHJ-TV), </em>44 F.C.C.2d 149 (1969), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Fidelity Television, Inc. v. FCC, </em>515 F.2d 684. That case held that essentially the same conduct was neither disqualifying nor ground even for a comparative demerit.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Failure to explain the reversal of directly controlling precedent is unlawful. <em>See, e.g., Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, </em>454 F.2d 1018, 1026 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>Melody Music, Inc. v. FCC, </em>345 F.2d 730, 732 (D.C.Cir.1965). \u201cAlthough an administrative agency is not bound to rigid adherence to its precedents, it is equally essential that when it decides to reverse its course, it must give notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the standard is being changed . . . and apply the changed standard only to those actions taken by parties after the new standard has been proclaimed as in effect.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. v. FPC, </em>557 F.2d 845, 849 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Towns of Norwood, Concord and Wellesley, Mass. v. Boston Edison Co., </em>434 U.S. 956, 98 S.Ct. 482, 54 L.Ed.2d 314 (1977). Although the FCC conditioned its first decision on RKO\u2019s reciprocal dealings on the possibility that significant new evidence might be introduced in the subsequent WNAC proceeding, such evidence never appeared. Additional evidence of reciprocal trading was heard in that second proceeding, but the bulk related to nonbroadcast activities by General Tire rather than RKO, and the remainder was merely cumulative of evidence in the first proceeding.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Finally, we doubt the Commission\u2019s claim that it can predict RKO\u2019s future character and performance from evidence concerning conduct that took place between 1961 and 1964.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Only the unusual nature of these proceedings allows the FCC to argue that such evidence is at all relevant. FCC precedents consider a licensee\u2019s behavior during the preceding license term relevant to renewal requests for the following term. <em>Central Florida Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>598 F.2d 37, 43 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>441 U.S. 957, 99 S.Ct. 2189, 60 L.Ed.2d 1062 (1979); <em>Citizens Communications Center v. FCC, </em>447 F.2d 1201, 1208 (D.C.Cir.1971). RKO sought renewal of WNAC for the 1969-1972 term, and the FCC has failed to allege acts of reciprocity during the earlier term from 1966 to 1969. But RKO\u2019s renewal application for KHJ concerned the 1965-1968 term, thereby giving the FCC an excuse for claiming that conduct from 1962 to 1965 \u201cis precisely the conduct at issue.\u201d Brief for Appellee FCC (FCC Brief) at 36 n.59. Even so, the FCC acknowledges that the recency of misconduct is an important factor for purposes of character evaluation. Decision 155(c); <em>see Miami Valley Broadcasting Corp., </em>78 F.C.C.2d 684, 738-39 (1980). The Commission has not paid sufficient heed to that principle here.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Nothing in our opinion diminishes the force of the FCC\u2019s now clear statement that reciprocity by broadcast licensees is a prohibited practice. The Commission has laid down the rule that those who induce others to advertise on their stations for reasons unrelated to the station\u2019s programming or audience will do so at their peril. We agree that the purposes of the Communications Act are best served by leaving stations to obtain advertising and customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>on the basis of their rates and audience, and that even unleveraged reciprocal trading distorts the normal free market process in the broadcast industry by which the demand for advertising time helps ensure that radio and television programming is responsive to public desires. <em>See </em>Decision 111 66-74. Competition in the broadcast industry means that a broadcaster should \u201csurvive or succumb according to his ability to make his programs attractive to the public,\u201d <em>FCC v. Sanders Bros., </em>309 U.S. 470, 475, 60 S.Ct. 693, 697, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940), and reciprocity injects an extrinsic factor that breaks the link between program quality and revenues. This rule has now been articulated forcefully, and future violations should be treated with the firmness expressed by the FCC in this case. Nevertheless, this ground cannot justify disqualification of RKO for nonlev-eraged, mutual patronage agreements during the early 1960s.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">B. <em>Financial Misrepresentations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Commission\u2019s finding that RKO submitted intentionally false financial reports is equally insufficient to support RKO\u2019s disqualification. The Decision states that \u201cRKO knowingly certified to the Commission that certain financial reports were complete and accurate when RKO knew otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 164. The FCC\u2019s conclusion presumes that RKO\u2019s inaccuracies were either deliberate and intentionally deceptive, <em>Big Valley Cablevision, Inc., </em>75 F.C.C.2d 702, 714 (1980); <em>Kaye-Smith Enterprises, </em>71 F.C.C.2d 1402, 1415 (1979), or that RKO\u2019s reports were made with such \u201cwanton, gross, and callous\u201d disregard for their truth as to reflect the equivalent of such an \u201caffirmative and deliberate intent.\u201d <em>Golden Broadcasting Systems, Inc., </em>68 F.C.C.2d 1099, 1106 (1978); <em>see Leflore Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>636 F.2d at 462. Despite the fact that RKO had consistently denied acting with such intent or disregard, the FCC brushed aside proffered RKO affidavits to that effect and drew adverse inferences without allowing RKO to defend itself in a hearing. Such a procedure was not lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The FCC justifies its finding on the basis of the Special Report, which included numerous corporate admissions that RKO\u2019s recordkeeping had been sloppy and inaccurate. Specifically, General Tire conceded in the Special Report that RKO\u2019s accounting for trades and barters<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> had been incomplete for the previous five years. The FCC seized on the repeated attempts by RKO\u2019s controller to improve the recording of such information to infer that he \u201chad to know that RKO\u2019s barter information was inaccurate\u201d as early as 1972. Decision f179. This inference was unwarranted. RKO\u2019s objections to such summary factfinding are well taken, because the admitted inaccuracy of the reports still left issues as to RKO\u2019s motive and intent that could only have been determined in what the FCC itself has called \u201cthe crucible of an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Walton Broadcasting, Inc., </em>78 F.C.C.2d 857, 877 (1980). It is absurd to claim that \u201cRKO\u2019s underlying motives were not decisionally significant, and thus any supposed factual issue as to motivation was immaterial,\u201d FCC Brief at 111, when the issue is not whether the reports were inaccurate but whether they were <em>knowingly </em>so. Given RKO\u2019s sworn statements that it made no willful misrepresentations, it was error to deny RKO the timely opportunity to present live witness testimony with the bald statement that RKO\u2019s affidavits were \u201cnot credible.\u201d Decision f 182. The FCC\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ing turned on RKO\u2019s intent, \u201cand thus demands that the decision-maker weigh witness credibility.\u201d <em>Nasem v. Brown, </em>595 F.2d 801, 807 (D.C.Cir.1979). Moreover, had the FCC formally designated this charge and given RKO a hearing in which to rebut it, the Commission would have had the opportunity to explore what possible reason RKO might have had for intentionally misreporting information that is apparently considered of minor significance by the FCC itself.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The Special Report does demonstrate a pervasive failure to maintain adequate records at RKO stations, a failure that does nothing to recommend RKO as a broadcast licensee. But it is a far leap from this to the finding that RKO intentionally or knowingly misrepresented financial information to the Commission. Section 309 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1976), requires the Commission to hold a hearing in cases where \u201ca substantial and material question of fact is presented,\u201d and to specify \u201cwith particularity the matters and things in issue but not including issues or requirements phrased generally.\u201d Whether RKO submitted inaccurate reports knowingly and with intent to mislead the Commission remains an unresolved and material question of fact, and it was therefore error for the Commission to disqualify RKO without following the procedures outlined by the statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">C. <em>General Tire\u2019s Nonbroadcast Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The FCC found it unnecessary to reach the question of whether RKO would have been disqualified had the only adverse character evidence been that relating to General Tire\u2019s nonbroadcast misconduct. Decision H140. Instead, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>found that General Tire\u2019s misconduct had \u201can adverse effect on RKO\u2019s qualifications\u201d and lent \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to the Commission\u2019s decision to disqualify RKO on each of the other grounds. <em>Id. </em>at Till 93,140. We find nothing unlawful in this approach, although it raises other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">As General Tire\u2019s own admissions in the Special Report illustrate, its conduct in nonbroadcast fields hardly enhances RKO\u2019s character assessment. General Tire\u2019s misconduct, ranging from bribery and fraud abroad to the maintenance of secret cash funds for political contributions at home, inevitably casts a shadow on the character of its wholly owned subsidiary. We have, no reason to doubt that \u201cGeneral Tire is institutionally inclined to sacrifice obedience to law and proper business ethics in pursuit of corporate revenue and political influence.\u201d Decision H 2(f). Were RKO\u2019s owner a single individual as opposed to a corporation, it appears that a far lesser showing of character flaws would support disqualification. <em>See, e.g., Wadeco, Inc. v. FCC, </em>628 F.2d 122, 128 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Star Stations of Indiana, Inc., </em>51 F.C.C.2d 95 (1975). For reasons that are far from clear, however, the FCC seems to distinguish between misconduct by individual owners and misconduct by corporate entities. <em>See, e.g., Katy Communications, Inc., </em>87 F.C.C.2d 764, 766-67 (1981); <em>Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>82 F.C.C.2d 322, 327 (1980); <em>Cowles Florida Broadcasting, Inc., </em>60 F.C.C.2d 372, 406 (1976), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Central Florida Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>598 F.2d 37 (D.C.Cir.1978), ce<em>rt. dismissed, </em>441 U.S. 957, 99 S.Ct. 2189, 60 L.Ed.2d 1062 (1979); <em>Kaiser Broadcasting Corp., </em>46 F.C.C.2d 589, 598 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">It is difficult to discern any legitimacy for such differential treatment of individual as opposed to corporate owners.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is to be hoped that pending FCC efforts to clarify the character standards to be applied in comparative hearings will cast more light on this point. <em>See Policy Regarding Character Qualifications in Broadcast Licensing: Notice of Inquiry, </em>87 F.C.C.2d 836 (1981). In any event, the FCC has not tried in this appeal to increase the significance attached to corporate misconduct in nonbroadcast areas, <em>see </em>FCC Brief at 92 n.207, 132, nor could it have done so without first serving notice that its policy had changed. <em>See Doubleday Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>655 F.2d 417, 423 (D.C.Cir.1981) (\u201cThe Commission may not decide a case one way today and a substantially similar one another way tomorrow, without a more reasonable explanation than is offered here.\u201d). The nonbroadcast misconduct of General Tire, egregious as it has been, has small practical significance in the FCC\u2019s decision to disqualify RKO. The importance of this corporate misconduct has not been inflated, and although the Commission appropriately weighed it against RKO, that misconduct has not been offered as a foundation for the denial of RKO\u2019s license renewals.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">In short, three of the four areas on which the FCC focused in its Decision will not serve as a basis for RKO\u2019s outright disqualification, at least on this record. It is not necessary to underscore our criticism too pointedly, however. We uphold the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mission\u2019s disqualification of RKO in the Boston proceeding because we conclude that the Decision\u2019s ultimate basis, RKO\u2019s lack of candor before the FCC, fully and independently supports that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">III. RKO\u2019S LACK OF CANDOR</p>\n<p id=\"AmO\">The Commission found that three instances demonstrated RKO\u2019s lack of candor before the agency during a period from 1975 to 1977. First, RKO failed to inform the FCC that there was a factual basis to the allegations first made against General Tire by Community in late 1975. Decision 1HI 197-205. Second, RKO failed to report the initiation of a formal SEC investigation of General Tire in February 1976. <em>Id. </em>at HU 206-12. Finally, RKO failed to concede that it had inaccurately reported trade and barter revenues when pressed to do so by Community in April 1977, despite the indication in General Tire\u2019s 1976 Annual Report that there might be some problems with these accounts. <em>Id. </em>at HU 213-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">A. <em>The Merits of the FCC\u2019s Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATl\">The record fully supports the Commission\u2019s finding that RKO did not display full candor before the Commission during the period from late 1975 to July 1976. Uncon-troverted documentary evidence shows that General Tire responded to the initial phase of the SEC\u2019s inquiry regarding overseas operations in May 1975. Special Report at 30, J.A. 1270. As the SEC investigation progressed, RKO\u2019s competitors began pressing the FCC to reopen the Boston proceeding, alleging facts that were similar or identical to the admissions later made by General Tire in the consent decree and its Special Report.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> RKO\u2019s first response was to seek an extension of time in which to respond, citing the need to consult with \u201cpersons who may have knowledge of the pertinent facts.\u201d RKO Motion for Extension of Time, December 12, 1975, J.A. 582-83. More than a month later, in January 1976, RKO clearly decided to stonewall the opposition and the FCC. This seems the only explanation for RKO\u2019s decision to file a document opposing the suggestion that the Boston proceeding be reopened on the ground that \u201cthere is no factual or legal foundation for this pyramid of charges,\u201d that \u201cthe charges, as we show below, are groundless,\u201d and that other charges were \u201cessentially unsupported.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">RKO contends that these statements were technically correct.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Brief for Appellant RKO (RKO Brief) at 33. It adds that because the burden lay on Community to establish grounds for reopening the proceeding,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> RKO\u2019s pleadings \u201cin context\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>merely claimed that this burden had not been met. Both arguments are irrelevant, because the question before the FCC was not so much what RKO said as what it had failed to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Section 1.65 of the Commission\u2019s Rules requires applicants to inform the Commission within thirty days whenever \u201cthere has been a substantial change\u201d regarding. any matter that may be \u201cof decisional significance in a Commission proceeding involving the pending application.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.65 (1979). This requires that an applicant inform the Commission \u201cof <em>all </em>facts, whether requested in [renewal] Form 303 or not, that may be of decisional significance so that the Commission can make a realistic decision based on all relevant factors.\u201d <em>Southern Broadcasting Co., </em>38 F.C.C.2d 461, 464 (Rev.Bd.1972) (emphasis in original). Unlike a private party haled into court, or a corporation such as General Tire facing an investigation by the SEC, RKO had an affirmative obligation to inform the Commission of the facts the FCC needed in order to license broadcasters in the public interest. As a licensing authority, the Commission is not expected to \u201cplay procedural games with those who come before it in order to ascertain the truth,\u201d FCC Brief at 60, and license applicants may not indulge in common-law pleading strategies of their own devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The Decision and the record on which it is based demonstrate irrefutably that RKO did not meet these standards, and that RKO\u2019s conduct thus threatened \u201cthe integrity of the Commission\u2019s processes.\u201d <em>RKO General, Inc., </em>82 F.C.C.2d 291, 306 (1980). In spite of an SEC investigation that was-rapidly gathering steam, and in spite of the fact that its qualifications as a licensee were at issue before the FCC, RKO failed to come forward with a candid statement of relevant facts. RKO did not inform the FCC that the SEC had issued a formal order of investigation in February 1976, even though this suggested the seriousness of the charges against General Tire.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> RKO did not advise the FCC of the SEC\u2019s preliminary findings until May 14, 1976, despite the fact that General Tire had advised its stockholders of these preliminary findings in February when it released its 1975 Annual Report.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> RKO did not advise the FCC until May 1976 that General Tire\u2019s own internal investigation demonstrated that many of the SEC concerns were valid, even though Community had submitted General Tire\u2019s 10-K Report the previous March.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> RKO never once at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tempted to amend or supplement its earlier pleadings with the FCC, despite a growing awareness of the facts that General Tire would later admit in its Special Report. These instances involve a lack of candor through omission. Whether or not RKO would have had an obligation to come forward with these facts under other circumstances,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> it could not have doubted their relevance once the filings and petitions of the intervenors put these questions before the Commission. We need not decide whether RKO\u2019s pleadings were affirmatively misleading \u2014 it is enough to find that they did not state the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The record suggests that RKO had ample motive for its failure to act with total candor during this period. There are numerous indications that General Tire initially decided to oppose the SEC investigation<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and did not begin to cooperate with that agency until sometime in the spring of 1976. Clearly, it would have been pointless for General Tire to resist the SEC inquiry at one level while RKO came forward with damaging evidence against General Tire before the Commission. <em>See </em>Decision H 202. But such conjecture is not relevant, because the documents speak for themselves. It is also unnecessary to show that RKO officials had actual knowledge in early 1976 of the improprieties and illegalities to which General Tire later admitted, or that RKO officials willfully intended to misrepresent these facts to the FCC. Whether RKO sought to protect its parent, or whether the parent withheld information from the subsidiary in order to protect itself, the result is the same. We cannot improve on the language of FCC counsel: \u201cIt is obvious that where a complete disclosure of facts will militate against the interests of this organization, the Commission will be deprived of that information. It is irrelevant where in the RKO-General Tire organizational structure this breakdown in candor first occurs. In the end, RKO, as the public trustee, is responsible for the reliability of the information and representations furnished by it to the Commission.\u201d FCC Brief at 70; <em>see </em>Decision 1 122 n.248.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">B. <em>RKO\u2019s Defenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">RKO objects to the FCC\u2019s finding on a variety of grounds. First, it contends that \u201cthere is not a shred of evidence that . . . the Commission was in fact \u2018misled\u2019 \u201d by RKO. RKO Brief at 33. Such an argument has no pertinence to this appeal, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the Supreme Court observed forty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">The fact of concealment may be more significant than the facts concealed. The willingness to deceive a regulatory body may be disclosed by immaterial and useless deceptions as well as by material and persuasive ones. We do not think it is an answer to say that the deception was \u25a0 unnecessary and served no purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>FCC v. WOKO, Inc., </em>329 U.S. 223, 227, 67 S.Ct. 213, 215, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946). As the Commission correctly emphasizes, it must rely on the applicants who come before it for the truth of their representations; it cannot countenance willingness to mislead simply because there is no evidence that the Commission was in fact misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Equally unpersuasive is RKO\u2019s objection that its decision not to inform the Commission of the SEC investigation was made on advice of counsel. RKO Brief at 38 &amp; n.102. It is true that reliance on counsel may render a severe sanction such as disqualification too harsh in some circumstances. <em>See Asheboro Broadcasting Co., </em>20 F.C.C.2d 1, 3 (1969); <em>cf. WEBR, Inc. v. FCC, </em>420 F.2d 158, 167-68 (D.C.Cir.1969). But \u201cadvice of counsel cannot excuse a clear breach of duty by a licensee.\u201d <em>Asheboro, </em>20 F.C.C.2d at 3. The client becomes fully responsible at some point, and that point is reached more quickly in practice before the FCC than in courts of law. <em>E.g., Wadeco, Inc. v. FCC, </em>628 F.2d at 128; <em>Lorain Community Broadcasting Co., </em>18 F.C.C.2d 686, 688 (1969), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Allied Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, </em>435 F.2d 68 (D.C.Cir.1970). Similarly, although we agree that \u201clegal argument is not testimony by a party or a representation by its counsel as to facts,\u201d RKO Brief at 34, we cannot excuse the calculated omissions in RKO\u2019s legal pleadings on this basis. In modern America, parties communicate with administrative agencies almost exclusively through lawyers, but this is all the more reason why we cannot assume that RKO did not know what its lawyers were saying \u2014 particularly when the number of pleadings and other opportunities for dissembling were as great as recounted above. It is not credible that lawyers were running the strategy of RKO and General Tire to the exclusion of all the corporate chiefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">RKO\u2019s most persuasive objection to the FCC finding that it lacked candor is that the finding was made without giving RKO formal notice and a hearing on the charge. The FCC acknowledges a \u201ctechnical failure to issue such a formal designation order,\u201d FCC Brief at 113 n.234, and admits that \u201c[i]n the normal case a hearing probably would have been warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. Ordinarily, such an admission would constitute grounds for reversal, for courts \u201chave stated time and again that reasonable notice of a charge and an opportunity to be heard in defense before punishment is imposed are \u2018basic in our system of jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Groppi v. Leslie, </em>404 U.S. 496, 502, 92 S.Ct. 582, 586, 30 L.Ed.2d 632 (1972) (quoting <em>In re Oliver, 333 </em>U.S. 257, 273, 68 S.Ct. 499, 507, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948)). We conclude, however, that RKO\u2019s conduct has been so egregious and so conspicuous that we cannot say the FCC\u2019s decision was an abuse of its authority. No purpose would have been served in this case by extending administrative proceedings that had already moved well into their second decade. The evidence of RKO\u2019s lack of candor was obvious from the documents that RKO itself had submitted to the FCC in this proceeding, as the applicants competing with RKO had been arguing for years. The Commission needed only to draw legal conclusions from \u201cfacts already known.\u201d <em>Lakewood Broadcasting Service, Inc. v. FCC, </em>478 F.2d 919, 924 (D.C.Cir.1973). In this context, the FCC was not required to designate the candor issue and reopen the proceeding for an evidentiary hearing that would have served no purpose. <em>See, e.g., Independent Bankers Ass\u2019n. of Georgia v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, </em>516 F.2d 1206, 1220-22 (D.C.Cir.1975); <em>Municipal Light Boards v. FPC, </em>450 F.2d 1341, 1345 (D.C.Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 989, 92 S.Ct. 1251, 31 L.Ed.2d 445 (1972). This is especially true where RKO itself had urged that there was no need to reopen the proceeding because resolution of Community\u2019s claims \u201cturns on inferences and legal conclusions\u201d to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>drawn from facts already before the Commission. <em>See Colorado Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>118 F.2d 24, 26 (D.C.Cir.1941) (\u201cAppellant took its chance that the Commission, on the existing record, would [find in its favor]. Now that the decision has gone against it, the appellant wants a chance to persuade the Commission with a supplemental record. We cannot allow the appellant to sit back and hope that a decision will be in its favor and then, when it isn\u2019t, to parry with an offer of more evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In reaching this determination, we start with the emphatic differences between a broadcast applicant before the FCC and one who faces the possibility of punishment. RKO has suffered a hardship as a result of the FCC\u2019s action, but it has not been punished; denial of a renewal application \u201cis not a penal measure.\u201d <em>FCC v. WOKO, Inc., </em>329 U.S. at 228, 67 S.Ct. at 215. As the Decision explains, the FCC\u2019s purpose is not to punish licensees for past wrongs, but to ensure that these \u201cfiduciaries of a great public resource\u201d will \u201csatisfy the highest standards of character commensurate with the public trust that is reposed in them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3; <em>see id. </em>at \u00b6 249 &amp; n.477. A broadcast license is less a property right than a privilege, <em>Mansfield Journal Co. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>180 F.2d 28, 35 (D.C.Cir.1950), and retention is not automatic but must be earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In practical terms, this means that \u201cproceedings before the Commission are not private law suits,\u201d and that the Commission does not function \u201cas an umpire blandly calling balls and strikes for adversaries appearing before it.\u201d <em>See Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, </em>354 F.2d 608, 620 (2d Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1462, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966). The FCC has an affirmative obligation to license more than 10,000 radio and television stations in the public interest, each required to apply for renewal every three years. FCC Brief at 60 n.114. As a result, the Commission must rely heavily on the completeness and accuracy of the submissions made to it, and its applicants in turn have an affirmative duty to inform the Commission of the facts it needs in order to fulfill its statutory mandate. This duty of candor is basic, and well known. <em>See, e.g., Sea Island Broadcasting Corp. v. FCC, </em>627 F.2d 240, 243 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 834, 101 S.Ct. 105, 66 L.Ed.2d 39 (1980); <em>Golden Broadcasting Systems, Inc., </em>68 F.C.C.2d at 1101-04. The Commission has said before that \u201cno specific misrepresentation or lack of candor issues are needed to consider these matters, since the Commission always has authority to deny a license or application where the record reveals such misconduct.\u201d <em>Radio Carrollton, </em>69 F.C.C.2d 1139, 1146 n.20 (1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem. sub nom. Faulkner Radio, Inc. v. FCC, </em>No. 79-1749 (D.C.Cir. October 15, 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1041, 101 S.Ct. 1758, 68 L.Ed.2d 238 (1981). <em>See Grenco, Inc., </em>39 F.C.C.2d 732, 737 (1973) (\u201cno one is allowed \u2018one bite\u2019 at the apple of deceit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Ultimately, of course, the procedures of the Commission must be measured against the demands of due process as well as the statutory requirements of the Communications Act. But it is a truism that due process standards in this context are fluid rather than fixed. In <em>WJR, The Goodwill Station, Inc. v. FCC, </em>337 U.S. 265, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353 (1949), a unanimous Court held that the FCC was not required to provide oral argument before ruling that a radio station\u2019s petition in a pending proceeding did not state facts sufficient to raise legal issues concerning the possible modification of that station\u2019s license rights. \u201c[T]he right of oral argument as a matter of procedural due process varies from case to case in accordance with differing circumstances, as do other procedural regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 69 S.Ct. at 1103. Subsequent cases have never departed from this proposition. <em>See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 268 n.15, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1020, n.15, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970); <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123, 163, 71 S.Ct. 624, 644, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Court has responded to the infinite variety and perplexity of the tasks of government by recognizing that what is unfair in one situation may be fair in another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Section 4(j) of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(j) (1976), empowers the FCC to \u201cconduct its proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>in such a manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.\u201d In <em>FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., </em>309 U.S. 134, 138, 60 S.Ct. 437, 439, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940), the Court held that Congress in that section had \u201cexplicitly and by implication\u201d delegated to the FCC the power to resolve \u201csubordinate questions of procedure.\u201d The Court upheld that delegation in light of the established principle that agencies \u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 60 S.Ct. at 441. In <em>FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. 279, 292, 85 S.Ct. 1459, 1468, 14 L.Ed.2d 383 (1965), the Court reiterated these observations in deciding whether a district court could substitute its own rules for the FCC\u2019s procedures governing public disclosure of its investigations. \u201cThe delegated power, of course, may not be exercised arbitrarily, but its exercise may not be impeached merely because reasonable minds might differ on the wisdom thereof.\u201d The Court also rejected the standard of review applied by the court of appeals: \u201cThe question for decision was whether the exercise of discretion <em>by the Commission </em>was within permissible limits, not whether the District Judge\u2019s substituted judgment was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 85 S.Ct. at 1468 (emphasis by the Court). <em>Cf. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 524, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1202, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">It is true that these recognitions of the FCC\u2019s discretion over certain questions of procedure have been cited most frequently to support agency control over dockets and hearing formats. When a statute dictates that parties receive notice and a hearing, of course, the provision of those basic procedural rights is not left to be decided by administrative \u201cflexibility\u201d or \u201cdiscretion.\u201d For that reason, RKO contends that Section 309 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309 (1976), requires a hearing prior to the denial of a renewal application even when there are no substantial or material questions of fact. RKO Brief at 15-23. <em>See Gottfried v. FCC, </em>655 F.2d 297, 310 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>United States v. FCC, </em>652 F.2d 72, 88-92 (D.C.Cir.1980). But such a literal approach to the words of the Act cannot govern this case, in which RKO had already been the subject of FCC proceedings that had lasted for years. The question is not whether RKO was entitled to a hearing under Section 309, but whether during the course of agency proceedings in which this candor issue arose in the most obvious and unavoidable manner, the Commission was required to call a halt to its proceedings, designate the issue formally, and begin again.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">We conclude that such an approach in this case would not have promoted \u201cthe proper dispatch of business\u201d and \u201cthe ends of justice.\u201d At some point in any administrative process, someone must determine whether the remaining issues are factual or legal, and whether hearings that have already been held must be supplemented by further proceedings. The initial answer must come from the agency, subject always to judicial review, but courts may defer to agency expertise and discretion here no less than on questions of docket management and the need for oral argument. Our decisions show the inherent difficulty of defining this administrative discretion. <em>Compare Radio Athens, Inc. (WATH) v. FCC, </em>401 F.2d 398, 401 (D.C.Cir.1968) (\u201celemental fairness\u201d used to judge whether FCC application requirements were sufficiently clear to obviate need for hearing on incomplete submission) with <em>Ranger v. FCC, </em>294 F.2d 240 (D.C.Cir.1961) (where application fails in material respects to comply with FCC rules concerning application contents, agency can reject application without hearing). Nevertheless, in appropriate situations, agency resolution of \u201csubordinate questions of procedure\u201d will be respected. In <em>Ranger, </em>we held that Section 309 requires a hearing only if, \u201cwith the required information before it,\u201d the FCC still cannot make a determination as to whether granting the application would be in the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 242. We thereby recognized the FCC\u2019s authority to determine without an evidentiary hearing whether applicants had submitted \u201cthe required information.\u201d <em>Cf. Guinan v. FCC, </em>297 F.2d 782, 785 (D.C.Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>1961) (FCC need not designate comparative hearing \u201conce it has been established that one of the competing applicants is basically unqualified\u201d because of frequency interference). The Commission\u2019s discretion should also be respected in this case, in which RKO has obviously failed to supply the information required for consideration of its merit in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">We find a compelling if imperfect analogy between this case and \u201chistorical exceptions to the general principle that punishment can only follow a determination of guilt after trial or plea \u2014 exceptions such as the power summarily to punish for contempt of court.\u201d <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 536 n.17, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1872 n.17, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">Where the contempt is committed directly under the eye or within the view of the court, it may proceed \u201cupon its own knowledge of the facts, and punish the offender, without further proof, and without issue or trial in any form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>In re Savin, </em>131 U.S. 267, 277, 9 S.Ct. 699, 701, 33 L.Ed. 150 (1889) (quoting <em>Ex parte Terry, </em>128 U.S. 289, 309, 9 S.Ct. 77, 81, 32 L.Ed. 405 (1888)). In these extraordinary situations, \u201c[t]here is no need of evidence or assistance of counsel before punishment, because the court has seen the offense. Such summary vindication of the court\u2019s dignity and authority is necessary.\u201d <em>Cooke v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 517, 534, 45 S.Ct. 390, 394, 69 L.Ed. 767 (1925). The rule is as old as Blackstone, see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *282-*285, and continues to have vitality in this day. <em>E.g., Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 765, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2463, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980). Modern jurisprudence may reveal a greater sensitivity for the notice and hearing requirements of due process than did an earlier age, of course. <em>See Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 498, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 2703, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974). Nevertheless, the cases continue to suggest the existence of a dividing line between events that take place \u201cbefore the judge\u2019s own eyes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 499, 94 S.Ct. at 2703, or \u201cin the face of the court,\u201d <em>Ex parte Terry, </em>128 U.S. at 313, 9 S.Ct. at 82, and situations in which \u201csome essential elements of the offense are not personally observed by the judge, so that he must depend upon statements made by others for his knowledge about these essential elements . . . . \u201d <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>403 U.S. 212, 215, 91 S.Ct. 1778, 1779, 29 L.Ed.2d 423 (1971). There is no doubt here as to which side of that line RKO\u2019s conduct falls. The Commission has drawn legal conclusions after comparing what RKO said in its earlier pleadings \u2014 and what it did not say\u2014 with RKO\u2019s subsequent admissions, such as General Tire\u2019s Special Report. RKO does not for a moment contend that it has in fact been candid with the Commission, nor do we see how it possibly could. No evidence remains to be introduced; no witnesses have been denied a chance to speak. There are no further issues to try. The FCC has not assumed the answers to any questions of fact, but has simply examined uncontested and uncontestable documents that are in the record at RKO\u2019s own election.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Because the Commission had \u201cso perfect a knowledge\u201d of the RKO misconduct that was evident from the documents directly before it, we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s action was erroneous. Forty years ago, in <em>FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., </em>Justice Frankfurter reflected on the \u201cmovement for administrative regulation.\u201d He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">Perhaps the most striking characteristic of this movement has been the investiture of administrative agencies with power far exceeding and different from the conventional judicial modes for adjusting conflicting claims \u2014 modes whereby interested litigants define the scope of the inquiry and determine the data on which the judicial judgment is ultimately based. Administrative agencies have power themselves to initiate inquiry, or, when their authority is invoked, to control the range of investigation in ascertaining what is to satisfy the requirements of the public interest .... These differences in origin and function preclude wholesale transplanation of the rules of procedure, trial, and review which have evolved from the history and experience of courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAm\">309 U.S. at 142-43, 60 S.Ct. at 441. The cases upholding summary punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in-court contempts without the need for formal notice or a separate hearing a <em>fortio-ri </em>support the disqualification of RKO. As we explained above, this case does not involve punishment at all, but the renewal of a public trust.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Our decision to affirm the FCC\u2019s action should not be read to include situations not covered by this unique record. The Commission concedes that \u201cthis case is unprecedented,\u201d FCC Brief at SA-1, and we expect that successors if any will be rare. Before the FCC can take action of this sort in the future, we believe that at least three conditions must be met in order to protect the parties. First, not only must the misconduct occur directly before the agency, but it should be of such a blatant and unacceptable dimension that its existence cannot be denied. The FCC has satisfied itself that this is the case with regard to RKO, whose lack of candor \u201cis abundantly clear.\u201d Decision H196. Second, although formal notice may not always be necessary, it should be evident that the party has some form of actual notice of the conduct said to be at issue, and must not be prejudiced by surprise. Finally, the party must be given an \u201copportunity to speak in [its] own behalf in the nature of a right of allocution.\u201d <em>Groppi v. Leslie, </em>404 U.S. at 504, 92 S.Ct. at 587. The procedure adopted by the FCC in this case satisfies these requirements, at least insofar as the Boston renewal is concerned. RKO does not contend that it was prejudiced by the lack of notice, for it undoubtedly had actual notice of the candor issue, as the pleadings filed prior to the Commission\u2019s decision demonstrate.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>See Harbenito Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>218 F.2d 28, 31 (D.C.Cir.1954). \u201cIf it is clear that the parties understand exactly what the issues are when the proceedings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>had, they cannot thereafter claim surprise or lack of due process because of alleged deficiencies in the language of particular pleadings.\u201d <em>Kuhn v. CAB, </em>183 F.2d 839, 842 (D.C.Cir.1950). RKO does not contend that it was denied any opportunity to present for the Commission\u2019s determination any matter of fact or law, or that the Commission has not given all matters submitted by RKO due and full consideration. <em>See WJR v. FCC, </em>337 U.S. at 284, 69 S.Ct. at 1107. RKO had a full opportunity to speak in its own behalf, and exercised it in pleadings, proffers of proof, and oral argument before the Commission.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We cannot say that the FCC abused its discretion by not giving RKO a formal hearing on issues arising from RKO\u2019s conduct during the initial proceeding.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Section 309 was not intended by Congress to reward delay and concealment that disserves the public interest. \u201cCongress did not intend by this section of the statute to require the formality of Commission consideration of and [rejhearing on an application in which the signatory obviously fails in major material respects to abide the regulations.\u201d <em>Ranger v. FCC, </em>294 F.2d at 243. <em>Cf. Storer Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>351 U.S. 192, 205, 76 S.Ct. 763, 771, 100 L.Ed. 1082 (1956) (\u201cWe do not think Congress intended the Commission to waste time on applications that do not state a valid basis for a hearing.\u201d). The FCC\u2019s denial of the Boston license renewal must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">IV. THE LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK CITY PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"aaa-dedup-0\">The narrow basis of our decision concerning RKO\u2019s Boston license illustrates why the FCC may not deny license renewals in Los Angeles and New York City simply because it happened to condition those proceedings on the Boston outcome. RKO\u2019s lack of candor during the Boston proceeding justifies its disqualification there because the misconduct took place directly before the trier of fact and has bearing on its general character, but the same cannot be said of the Los Angeles and New York City proceedings. The latter was conditioned on the Boston outcome in order to avoid making the parties \u201crelitigate those issues\u201d that had already been specified with regard to Boston. 46 F.C.C.2d at 249. By contrast, the former had been conditioned on the reciprocity issue only, in order to \u201cenable the Commission to proceed with the Los Angeles matter and bring it to a conclusion with no risk to the public interest.\u201d <em>RKO General, Inc. (KHJ\u2014 TV), </em>31 F.C.C.2d 70, 74 (1971). The FCC could not have known, when it conditioned either of these proceedings as it did, that the Boston outcome would turn on a lack of candor issue that had not even been designated in the Boston proceeding. RKO\u2019s misconduct did not occur directly before the trier of fact in either the Los Angeles or New York City proceedings. Accordingly, these decisions must be remanded to the Commission for further consideration as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">This conclusion is buttressed by the Commission\u2019s own discussion of what effect, if any, RKO\u2019s Boston disqualification should have on its other broadcast licenses. In an order released on November 26, 1980, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>FCC designated thirteen RKO stations for hearing, but held those proceedings in abeyance until resolution of this appeal. <em>RKO General, Inc., </em>82 F.C.C.2d 291, <em>appeal pending sub nom. New South Media Corp. v. FCC, </em>No. 80-2556 (D.C.Cir. filed December 22, 1980). One purpose of the separate proceeding will be to allow RKO \u201cto introduce evidence on meritorious programming with respect to the 13 other stations and any other mitigating evidence with respect to the remaining licenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Now that the issues in the Boston proceeding have been sorted out, the same treatment is appropriate for RKO\u2019s New York City and Los Angeles licenses.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The judgment that RKO showed a lack of candor in the Boston proceeding is <em>res judicata, </em>of course, and is not subject to collateral attack in these subsequent proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 312-18. The Commission may give that finding whatever weight it considers appropriate. Indeed, it may well be that such a finding is inconsistent with a licensee holding a license anywhere, although that decision is for the Commission in the first instance. At the same time, our remand of these proceedings is more than just an empty exercise. Each of RKO\u2019s renewal applications arises in different contexts and presents different levels of complexity.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> For example, the Los Angeles renewal was tentatively granted in 1973 subject only to future reciprocity findings. Because we have rejected reciprocity as a legitimate basis for disqualification of RKO in Boston, the Los Angeles situation may seem quite different when that proceeding is remanded. As the FCC noted, \u201cWe do agree with RKO that collateral estoppel will only apply to those grounds on which the court bases its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. Similarly, individual stations have different broadcast histories and policies. Although the FCC found that WNAC in Boston had a \u201cmediocre to poor record with respect to news, public affairs, and local programming,\u201d Decision 11227, it made no new findings at all with regard to KHJ in Los Angeles and WOR in New York City. These stations are entitled to an opportunity to appear directly before the Commission and to argue that they deserve different treatment than RKO\u2019s Boston station. After such a proceeding, of course, the Commission\u2019s broad latitude in \u201cthe choice of remedies and sanctions\u201d must be respected. <em>Leflore Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>636 F.2d at 463 (quoting <em>Lorain Journal Co. v. FCC, </em>351 F.2d 824, 831 (D.C.Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied sub nom. W.W.I.Z., Inc. v. FCC, </em>383 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 1272, 16 L.Ed.2d 308 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">This opinion will not close a sorry chapter in the history of American communications law. We must remand the Los Angeles and New York City proceedings because the FCC has not yet provided a principled explanation for RKO\u2019s disqualification as a licensee of those stations. The FCC\u2019s findings that RKO intentionally misrepresented financial information and engaged in unlawful reciprocal trade practices cannot stand, for one was reached without notice or hearing and the other constitutes an ex post facto application of new standards to conduct that is long past.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">We affirm the FCC\u2019s decision in the Boston proceeding, however, because the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>mission\u2019s finding that RKO displayed an egregious lack of candor in that proceeding does not suffer from either of these infirmities. During an administrative review that had already lasted for years, the FCC suddenly was confronted by documentary evidence establishing beyond doubt that RKO had been less than candid with the Commission in the very proceeding under way. The FCC could observe all material facts for itself, simply by comparing the documents that had already been submitted with those that were now before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The denial of a license renewal to a major licensee in a major market is of manifest moment and financial impact. The FCC\u2019s decision has not been reviewed callously, and we have tried not to lose sight of the difficult issues in this case by sweeping the reasoning of the Commission under a rug of agency expertise or administrative convenience. The record presented to this court shows irrefutably that the licensee was playing the dodger to serious charges involving it and its parent company. The Commission was entitled to ask whether such conduct, however convenient for corporate purposes, was consistent with the candor required of an applicant for a license to the public airwaves. We believe the Commission\u2019s answer is not open to doubt. The disqualification of RKO as a licensee of WNAC in Boston is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">.

See <em>Lake Erie Broadcasting Co., </em>33 F.C.C.2d 1009 (Rev.Bd.1972), which held that an investigation sparked by the accusations of outside complainants as opposed to official charges by a governmental agency did not require immediate notification of the FCC. Although the Commission has shifted away from this rule, <em>e.g., Payne of Virginia, Inc., </em>66 F.C.C.2d 633 (1977), that case was decided subsequent to RKO\u2019s disclosure of the SEC investigation in May 1976. We need not decide, however, whether the SEC decision in February 1976 to upgrade its enforcement activities from a preliminary to a formal investigation should have been reported under <em>Lake Erie. </em>In the context of the facts described above, it defies reason to imply that SEC enforcement activities were immaterial to the pleadings and claims then pending before the FCC. RKO can be faulted not for failing to report marginally relevant accusations, but for failing to realize from the change in the SEC\u2019s enforcement activities that its earlier statements to the Commission had been grossly inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\">. <em>See </em>Decision (| 202 (\u201cin refusing to be more forthcoming, RKO adopted a posture consistent with General Tire\u2019s SEC defense strategy.

Community Petition, <em>supra </em>note 8, at 5-6, J.A. 539-40. Community repeated that charge in its Supplement to the Reply, <em>supra </em>note 41, at 6-7, J.A. 683-84 (\u201cthe Commission must now seriously question the lack of good faith and candor of RKO.. .. RKO has failed to meet the minimal standards of candor, required of Commission licensees.\u201d). More than a year later, Community referred to RKO\u2019s \u201cdissembling and lack of candor in this proceeding\u201d and argued that lack of candor was \u201cthe darkest blot on RKO\u2019s record . ... \u201d Community Motion to Deny, September 13, 1977, at 2, 22, J.A. 737, 757. Community also reiterated this charge in its reply to RKO\u2019s Response, note 13 <em>supra. </em>Community Reply, December 16, 1977, J.A. 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The FCC also foreshadowed the candor issue in May 1977 when it denied General Tire\u2019s proposal to spin-off its RKO stock. The FCC cautioned that it had \u201cnot yet ruled on the merits of Community\u2019s petition to enlarge issues,\u201d <em>RKO General, Inc. (WNAC-TV), </em>64 F.C.C.2d 713, 718 (1977), but its refusal to act on the proposal because of \u201cthe undesirable possibility of impeding the conduct of an adjudicatory proceeding\u201d by eliminating \u201cadversarial development of the facts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 718, 719, must be considered notice to RKO of the seriousness of its situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Indeed, in October 1977, RKO spent several pages answering the lack of candor charge. RKO Response, <em>supra </em>note 13, at 14-19, J.A. 785-90. In September 1979, when RKO responded to FCC Order 79 \u2014 153, <em>see </em>note 17 <em>supra, </em>it made the same claims to the Commission that it has on this appeal, arguing that \u201cthe procedural context in which RKO\u2019s responses were made disproves Fidelity\u2019s claims that RKO has not been candid.\u201d RKO Response, September 24, 1979, at 56, J.A. 1183; <em>see id. </em>at 51-61, J.A. 1178-88. The FCC contends that these pleadings and other materials show that \u201cRKO had far more actual notice than the typical designation order would provide.\u201d FCC Brief at 113 n.234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. The full transcript of the oral argument held before the Commission on July 18, 1979, is not in the record before us. Nevertheless, the pleadings submitted by RKO before that proceeding amply demonstrate RKO\u2019s opportunity to address any factual or legal issues concerning its lack of candor. <em>See </em>note 45 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. Indeed, RKO\u2019s interpretation of Section 309 would create the possibility that an incorrigible applicant could prolong hearings indefinitely, as each instance of egregious conduct in one proceeding would require new designation and a subsequent proceeding. Renewal applicants have an obvious financial stake in delaying unfavorable resolutions of their applications as long as possible. RKO, for example, is still operating the stations involved in this case, pending resolution of this appeal. <em>See </em>Brief of Intervenor Multi-State Communications, Inc. at 35 (\u201cthe abundant \u2018due process\u2019 already accorded RKO has provided it with licenses (and income) for many more years than it should have had.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. We express no view, in light of the pending appeal of this FCC order, as to whether a separate proceeding is the appropriate format for the introduction of such evidence or whether the matter should be addressed in the context of license renewal proceedings. <em>See New South Media Corp. v. FCC, </em>644 F.2d 37 (D.C.Cir.1980). We do hold that it is appropriate to treat RKO\u2019s New York City and Los Angeles licenses in the same manner as the licenses for RKO\u2019s other thirteen stations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. KHJ-TV in Los Angeles and WOR-TV in New York City stand in very different positions, although this may be a distinction without a difference. KHJ\u2019s license renewal was granted, subject only to the FCC finding on reciprocity in the Boston proceeding that we now reject. WOR\u2019s license renewal was held in abeyance pending the resolution of the Boston renewal. <em>Cf. KFPW Broadcasting Co., </em>47 F.C.C.2d 1090 (1973), in which the Commission reversed denial of an application despite its earlier decision that renewal proceedings for the applicant\u2019s second station would be res judicata as to the application. The license renewal had been denied on character grounds, but the denial of the application was reversed because the licensee\u2019s misconduct occurred before the new station came on the air. <em>Id. </em>at 1095-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
