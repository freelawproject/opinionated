The plaintiff, Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. (Frisch\u2019s), has the exclusive license from Marriott to use these marks in Ohio and currently operates eighty restaurants in Ohio under the Big Boy trademark. One of the defendants, The Boury Corporation, operates the network of \u201cElby\u2019s Family Restaurants\u201d in western Pennsylvania (five restaurants), northern West Virginia, referred to in the record as \u201cthe panhandle,\u201d (seven restaurants), and eastern Ohio (eight restaurants in six different cities). The Boury Corporation holds the exclusive right to use the Big Boy trademark in the panhandle of West Virginia and in most of western Pennsylvania. Prior to 1971, the Elby\u2019s Restaurants in eastern Ohio were authorized under a franchise agreement with Frisch\u2019s to use the Big Boy trademark, but that agreement was terminated at Elby\u2019s request in late 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">When the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants continued to use the Big Boy trademark after the franchise agreement was terminated, Frisch\u2019s sought and obtained a preliminary injunction from the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in 1973, enjoining the Ohio Elby\u2019s organization from using the Big Boy trademark \u201cin any manner whatsoever in connection with [Elby\u2019s] business operations within the State of Ohio.\u201d The Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants have avoided using the Big Boy trademark in their restaurants and in Ohio advertising media since that time. However, the present action by Frisch\u2019s challenges the spillover effects of Elby\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>West Virginia advertising utilizing the Big Boy trademark. This advertising reaches eastern Ohio consumers and allegedly creates the false impression that Big Boy products are available at the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants as well as Elby\u2019s West Virginia operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The Ohio and the West Virginia Elby\u2019s restaurants conduct joint advertising and promotional campaigns under the direction of the parent corporation. A major avenue of media advertisement is the Wheeling, West Virginia television station WTRF. Most of Elby\u2019s commercials on WTRF which advertise for the entire chain contain a pictorial representation of the Big Boy figure,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> advertise \u201cBig Boy\u201d food items, or contain jingles which strongly identify all Elby\u2019s Family Restaurants with the Big Boy trademark. However, whenever a specific Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurant is advertised on WTRF or another West Virginia medium, no reference to the Big Boy trademark is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The WTRF signal is broadcast from Bridgeport, Ohio, across the Ohio River from Wheeling, West Virginia, and is widely received by television viewers in certain counties in the eastern portion of Ohio. Under their reciprocal advertising agreements with WTRF, the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants have erected billboards on their restaurant properties directing the attention of their Ohio customers to Elby\u2019s advertisements on station WTRF. These Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants also utilize various in-store promotional devices, including matchbooks and sugar packets, advertising station WTRF.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The Elby\u2019s chain also places newspaper advertisements in newspapers published in Wheeling, West Virginia which have considerable circulation in the counties of eastern Ohio where the Elby\u2019s restaurants are located. These advertisements publicize food items and specials available at all Elby\u2019s Family Restaurants with the aid of the Big Boy trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Frisch\u2019s filed a complaint against the Elby\u2019s organization and related corporations in an Ohio state court on November 27, 1978, alleging federal trademark infringement, breach of its prior franchise agreement with the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants, and a violation of Ohio\u2019s \u201cDeceptive Trade Practices Act.\u201d Elby\u2019s removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Frisch\u2019s amended its complaint on February 21, 1980, adding state law trademark infringement and common law unfair competition as well as \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976)) claims to its previous allegations. Frisch\u2019s had previously demanded a permanent injunction against Elby\u2019s advertisements; its amended complaint sought for the first time a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Frisch\u2019s moved for a preliminary injunction on October 21, 1980, requesting that Elby\u2019s be enjoined from using the Big Boy trademark in \u201cany advertising medium that reaches a not insubstantial number of Ohioans\u201d without disclosing Ohio Elby\u2019s disaffiliation with the Big Boy restaurant organization. On January 20, 1981, District Judge Robert M. Duncan, in an opinion reported at 514 F.Supp. 704 (S.D.Ohio 1981), issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Elby\u2019s from \u201cusing the \u2018Big Boy\u2019 trademark and service mark in their WTRF advertising without making a prominent disclosure that the Elby\u2019s Family Restaurants within the state of Ohio are not associated with the \u2018Big Boy\u2019 restaurant organization. Alternatively, defendants may wish to eliminate <em>all </em>reference to the \u2018Big Boy\u2019 mark on WTRF advertisements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712. Judge Duncan based his holding solely on \u201cthe unfair competition provisions of [\u00a7 43(a) of] the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a),\u201d <em>id., </em>and expressed no view on Frisch\u2019s alternative theories of recovery. However, Judge Duncan refused to extend his preliminary injunction to Elby\u2019s newspaper and radio advertisements, noting that Frisch\u2019s failed to establish a <em>\u201ccausal connection </em>between the public\u2019s confusion [the confusion of eastern Ohio consumers over the availabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ty of Big Boy products at Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants] and defendants\u2019 advertising in such media.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711 (emphasis in original). Elby\u2019s has appealed the grant of the WTRF preliminary injunction, and Frisch\u2019s cross-appealed the district court\u2019s failure to enjoin Elby\u2019s newspaper advertisements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">Any person who shall . .. use in connection with any goods or services ... a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce . . . shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The intent of the Lanham Act is set forth in \u00a7 45 thereof, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2k\">The intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce within the control of Congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce . . . [and] to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">It has been suggested that \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act \u201ccreated a <em>sui generis </em>federal statutory cause of action for \u2018false representation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Chevron Chemical Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Groups, Inc., </em>659 F.2d 695, 702 (5th Cir. 1981). The Fifth Circuit also concluded that \u201c\u00a7 43(a) proscribes not only what had been considered \u2018false advertising\u2019 but also what had been differentiated as \u2018unfair competition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the <em>Chevron Chemical </em>court described the distinctions between these two concepts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">In sum, the essential misrepresentation in \u201cfalse advertising,\u201d which we have noted forms the basis of the \u201cfalse representation\u201d leg of \u00a7 43(a), is fundamentally different from the essential misrepresentation in \u201cunfair competition\u201d: in the former case, the defendant makes no secret of the origin of the goods in himself, but merely misrepresents certain qualities or characteristics that his goods may or may not have; in the latter case, the defendant misrepresents his goods to be those of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 701 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">It is undisputed that Elby\u2019s has a right to use the Big Boy trademark in connection with its West Virginia operations; indeed, it has an obligation to promote the Big Boy trademark in the panhandle of West Virginia under its licensing agreement with Marriott. It is also undisputed that the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants have no right to use the Big Boy trademark. Frisch\u2019s contends that the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants, through their participation in Elby\u2019s West Virginia advertisements which have substantial exposure in eastern Ohio, are improperly using the Big Boy trademark to promote their products, thereby creating a \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d or a \u201cfalse description or representation\u201d of their goods as being sponsored by the Big Boy organization in the minds of Ohio consumers in violation of \u00a7 43(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">We conclude that Frisch\u2019s contentions are properly within the scope of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act. Frisch\u2019s primary concern is that Ohio consumers will assume that all Elby\u2019s restaurants, including the Ohio Elby\u2019s, sell food which is sponsored by or originates from the \u201cBig Boy\u201d chain of restaurants. This court previously concluded that false representations about the \u201corigin of source or manufacture\u201d of goods are prohibited by the \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d clause of \u00a7 43(a). <em>Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Azoff, </em>313 F.2d 405, 408 (6th Cir. 1963). \u201c[F]alse representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tions of the source of a product constitute the common-law tort of \u2018unfair competition,\u2019 or, as it is otherwise known, \u2018passing off.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chevron Chemical Co., supra, </em>at 701.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Passing off involves \u201cdefendant\u2019s use of plaintiffs well-known product name, symbol, or familiar packaging to attract the public to the product under the assumption that it is the plaintiff\u2019s product which is bought.\u201d Comment, <em>The Present Scope of Recovery for Unfair Competition Violations Under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, </em>58 Neb.L.Rev. 159, 163 (1978). As we have previously determined, attempts at passing off are prohibited by \u00a7 43(a); indeed, the Lanham Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac0\">a right of action to persons engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, against . .. deceptive and misleading use of words, names, symbols, or devices, or any combination thereof, which have been adopted by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured by others, where such misleading use is carried on, in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce, which is subject to regulation by Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><em>Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, supra </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The district court properly held that the standard of proof needed to prevail in a \u00a7 43(a) action for injunctive relief was a showing of \u201clikelihood of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">Although it is necessary to prove that the buying public was actually deceived in order to recover damages under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, <em>Skil Corp. v. Rockwell International Corp., </em>375 F.Supp. 777 (N.D.Ill.1974), only a likelihood of confusion or deception need be shown in order to obtain equitable relief. <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>[604 F.2d 200 (2d Cir. 1979)]. Here, since equitable relief is sought, only the likelihood of confusion need be shown, and not proof of actual confusion as was required by the District Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-9\"><em>Warner Bros., Inc., supra </em>at 79. This likeli-' hood of confusion need not arise from intentional conduct; furthermore, a mere showing that advertisements tend to create a false impression is sufficient to warrant injunctive relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">Under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act it is not necessary to show that any false description or representation is wilful or intentional. <em>Parkway Baking Co. v. Freihofer Baking Co., </em>255 F.2d 641, 648 (3d Cir. 1958). All that is required is that the representation or descriptions either be \u201cfalse\u201d or such as is \u201ctending falsely to describe or represent the goods or services in question.\u201d <em>Ames Publishing Co. v. Walker-Davis Publications, Inc., </em>372 F.Supp. 1, 11 (E.D.Pa.1974). Thus, liability is not restricted solely to descriptions which are literally false, but extends to instances where the defendant creates a false impression. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\"><em>Walker-Davis Publications, Inc. v. Penton/IPC, Inc., </em>509 F.Supp. 430, 435 (E.D.Pa.1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In <em>Toho Company, Ltd. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>645 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1981), the Ninth Circuit delineated eight factors which are helpful in demonstrating that there is a likelihood of confusion among consumers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">In <em>AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, </em>599 F.2d 341, 348 (9th Cir. 1979), we set forth eight factors that are relevant to the likelihood of confusion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">1. strength of the plaintiff\u2019s mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">2. relatedness of the goods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">3. similarity of the marks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">4. evidence of actual confusion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">5. marketing channels used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">6. likely degree of purchaser care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">7. defendant\u2019s intent in selecting the mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-13\">8. likelihood of expansion of the product lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">In considering these factors, the unique factual setting with which we are concerned militates strongly towards likelihood of confusion. Although the strength of the Big Boy mark was not addressed by the district court, we presume that it is a distinctive and desirable mark from Elby\u2019s attempts to implant in the public mind the idea that all of its restaurants are affiliated with the Big Boy mark. The parties are competing restaurant chains using the identical trademark to promote related if not identical goods; additionally, it is likely that the marketing methods used to promote the fast-food products served by both chains are substantially similar. All these factors contribute to the likelihood of confusion about the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants\u2019 association with the Big Boy trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">The district court determined that there was actual confusion among eastern Ohio consumers about the availability of Big Boy products at Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants. 514 F.Supp. at 708-09. This finding was supported by evidence from Frisch\u2019s expert witness, who testified about a survey he conducted which indicated that Elby\u2019s television advertisements contributed to confusion over the connection of the Big Boy organization with the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants. The Fifth Circuit deduced that while \u201cevidence of actual confusion is not necessary to a finding of likelihood of confusion, it is nevertheless the best evidence of likelihood of confusion.\u201d <em>Amstar Corp. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 252, 263 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 268, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-19\">The casual \u201cdegree of purchaser care\u201d in selecting fast-food restaurants also supports a conclusion of likelihood of confusion. The \u201cfast-food\u201d products promoted by Elby\u2019s are not likely to be the object of intensive consumer research, but rather subject to \u201cimpulse buying;\u201d therefore, it is highly unlikely that Ohio consumers will discover their mistake about the availability of Big Boy products in Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants before patronizing Elby\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-20\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s comments on the intent factor are equally supportive of likelihood of confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-21\"><em>Intent: </em>we stated in <em>Amstar </em>that the \u201cintent of defendants in adopting [their mark] is a critical factor, since if the mark was adopted with the intent of deriving benefit from the reputation of [the plaintiff,] <em>that fact alone may be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity.\" Amstar Corp., supra, </em>615 F.2d at 263 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-22\"><em>Chevron Chemical Co., supra </em>at 703-04. The district court found that \u201cthe defendants intentionally associate Ohio Elby\u2019s res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>taurants with the \u2018Big Boy\u2019 mark,\u201d since \u201cthe Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants are in fact direct participants in the reciprocal advertising agreement with WTRF,\u201d they \u201cactively encourage Ohio consumers to \u2018watch for Elby\u2019s specials on WTRF\u2019 . . . where the television advertisement frequently identifies the Elby\u2019s Family Restaurant with the \u2018Big Boy\u2019 mark\u201d and \u201c[a] variety of in-store promotional material including matchbooks and sacks also directs the Ohio consumer to WTRF.\u201d 514 F.Supp. at 710. The district court correctly inferred that Elby\u2019s improperly intended to \u201cderive benefit\u201d from the Big Boy trademark for their Ohio operations through coupling the entire chain to the trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Finally, the past association of the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants with the Big Boy trademark through their expired licensing agreement with Frisch\u2019s increases the likelihood that consumers would be confused about whether the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants continued to be linked with the Big Boy organization. It is evident from their actions that the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants hoped to reinforce the residual effects of Ohio consumer memories of their past affiliation with the Big Boy trademark by tying in with the legitimate West Virginia Big Boy advertisements, thereby obscuring their disaffiliation with the Big Boy trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The preceding factors led the district court to conclude that a likelihood of confusion existed with regard to Elby\u2019s television advertisements. However, Elby\u2019s contends that the district court erred in even applying \u00a7 43(a) to the facts of this ease, and broadly attacks the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Elby\u2019s first argues that Frisch\u2019s does not have standing to bring this suit because Frisch\u2019s does not operate any restaurants in the eastern Ohio area where the confusion about Big Boy products is prevalent. However, it is evident that Frisch\u2019s suffers a cognizable injury in this instance because it would have to combat consumer misperceptions about the availability of Big Boy products if it were to expand into the area itself or license restaurants in that area to operate under the Big Boy trademark. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that a trademark is entitled to protection throughout the entire state even though its owner is currently operating only in one part of the state. <em>Younker v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>175 Ohio St. 1, 191 N.E.2d 145 (1963). More to the point, this court in <em>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Oil City Refiners, Inc., </em>136 F.2d 470 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>320 U.S. 798, 64 S.Ct. 369, 88 L.Ed. 482 (1943), determined that the user of a trademark \u201cwas entitled to the exclusive use of the name within the entire state as territory which may reasonably be anticipated to be within normal business expansion . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475. <em>Accord, Grocers Baking Co. v. Sigler, </em>132 F.2d 498, 502 (6th Cir. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The issue of standing to sue under \u00a7 43(a) is closely related to the statute\u2019s declaration that a \u00a7 43(a) plaintiff includes one \u201cwho believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976). The Second Circuit explained the burden of proof such a plaintiff must meet to be entitled to injunctive relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">On the one hand, despite the use of the word \u201cbelieves,\u201d something more than a plaintiff\u2019s mere subjective belief that he is injured or likely to be damaged is required before he will be entitled even to injunctive relief. See, <em>Chromium Industries v. Mirror Polishing &amp; Plating, </em>448 F.Supp. 544, 554 (N.D.Ill.1978); <em>D. M. Antique Import Corp. v. Royal Saxe Corp., </em>311 F.Supp. 1261, 1269 n. 6 (S.D.N.Y.1970). On the other hand, as the district court in this case recognized, a plaintiff seeking an injunction, as opposed to money damages, need not quantify the losses actually borne.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-11\"><em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., </em>631 F.2d 186, 189 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">The Second Circuit further elaborated on these requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">The statute demands only proof providing a reasonable basis for the belief that the plaintiff is likely to be damaged as a result of the false advertising. The correct standard is whether it is <em>likely </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Carter\u2019s advertising has caused or will cause a loss of Johnson sales, not whether Johnson has come forward with specific evidence that Carter\u2019s ads actually resulted in some definite loss of sales. <em>Parkway Baking Co. v. Freihofer Baking Co., </em>255 F.2d 641, 649 (3d Cir. 1958); <em>Ames Publishing Co. v. Walker-Davis Publications, Inc., </em>372 F.Supp. 1, 13 (E.D.Pa.1974); 2 J.T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 27:5 at 249-50 (1973). Contrary to Johnson\u2019s argument, however, the likelihood of injury and causation will not be presumed, but must be demonstrated. If such a showing is made, the plaintiff will have established a reasonable belief that he is likely to be damaged within the meaning of \u00a7 43(a) and will be entitled to injunctive relief, as distinguished from damages, which would require more proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 190. In this instance, where Frisch\u2019s has demonstrated that it has a cognizable interest in protecting its Ohio trademark rights, and a showing of a likelihood of confusion about the origin and sponsorship of the products of Ohio .Elby\u2019s restaurants has been made, Frisch\u2019s has demonstrated the \u201clikelihood of injury and causation\u201d for injunctive relief, without the need for showing an actual loss of business to Frisch\u2019s restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Elby\u2019s also protests the imposition of an injunction requiring disclosures under \u00a7 43(a), claiming that \u00a7 43(a) does not cover its failure to disclose that its Ohio restaurants are not connected with the Big Boy trademark. However, the district court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">the Ohio Elby\u2019s affirmative participation in the WTRF reciprocal advertising campaign involves far more than simple non-disclosures and is accordingly within the purview of Section 43(a) .... Standing alone, neither the Ohio Elby\u2019s WTRF billboards nor the advertisements on WTRF-TV say that Ohio Elby\u2019s are \u201cBig Boy\u201d restaurants. Functioning together, however, the billboards and TV advertisements create the likely impression in the consumer that \u201cBig Boy\u201d products are available at Ohio Elby\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">514 F.Supp. at 710. When Elby\u2019s advertisements reached the Ohio consumers, they affirmatively misrepresented an affiliation of the local Elby\u2019s restaurants in Ohio with the Big Boy trademark. Since Elby\u2019s was directly responsible for the false impressions generated about the Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants\u2019 connection with Big Boy products, it was properly within the district court\u2019s discretion to require Elby\u2019s to disclose information that would correct those false impressions. <em>See, e.g., CBS Inc. v. Springboard International Records, </em>429 F.Supp. 563 (S.D.N.Y.1976), <em>CBS, Inc. v. Gusto Records, Inc., </em>403 F.Supp. 447 (M.D.Tenn.1974) (district courts ordered disclosures about release of collection of old Charlie Rich songs).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The district court was accordingly justified in determining that a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d existed, warranting injunctive relief against Elby\u2019s television advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The district court, however, failed to properly utilize the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d standard with respect to Elby\u2019s newspaper and radio advertisements: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s proof relative to defendants\u2019 advertising in newspapers and on radio is not sufficient to establish a <em>causal connection </em>between the public\u2019s confusion and defendants\u2019 advertising in such media. No proof comparable to the Becker Study has been presented for other media.\u201d 514 F.Supp. at 711. Because Frisch\u2019s did not prove through its consumer survey that Ohio consumers were actually confused by Elby\u2019s newspaper advertisements, the district court concluded that \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d was not present. As before pointed out, however, the existence of actual confusion is only one factor in determining whether likelihood of confusion is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">This failure by the district court properly to apply the likelihood of confusion standard to the newspaper advertising was an error of law and therefore, to this extent, an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Colahan, </em>635 F.2d 564 (6th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 127, 70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>L.Ed.2d 108 (1981). The question remains, however, whether a reversal and remand for a further factual determination is required or whether this court can determine on this record that Frisch\u2019s is entitled to injunctive relief as to the newspaper advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Ninth Circuit has developed a two-level test for reviewing lower court findings of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">In assessing whether there is likelihood of confusion, a court first considers numerous factors and then, based thereon, determines whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. With the analysis so structured, the <em>J. B. Williams [Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Le Conte Cosmetics, Inc.; </em>523 F.2d 187 (9th Cir.)], and <em>AMF, Inc. </em>courts held that the determination of what is the state of affairs regarding each factor (a \u201cfoundational fact\u201d) is a finding of fact reviewed on the clearly erroneous standard, but the further determination of likelihood of confusion based on those factors is a legal conclusion. <em>See J. B. Williams, </em>523 F.2d at 191-92; <em>AMF, Inc., </em>599 F.2d at 348-54 (applying two-level test as described here).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\"><em>Alpha Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alpha Steel Tube &amp; Shapes, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 440, 443-44 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\"> Applying this test, with which we agree, to the facts that are not in dispute and as found by the district court, we conclude that Frisch\u2019s is entitled to injunctive relief as to the newspaper advertising. Even without evidence of actual consumer confusion, examination of the other factors which are not in dispute, i.e., intent, likely degree of purchaser care, and the unavoidable confusion resulting from the use of identical trademarks in similar marketing channels, inexorably leads to the \u201clegal conclusion\u201d that confusion is just as likely to result from Elby\u2019s newspaper advertisements as from their television advertisements. <em>See, e.g., Chevron Chemical Co., supra </em>at 705 (\u201cthe lack of evidence of actual confusion did not militate strongly against a finding of likelihood of confusion\u201d when the other factors were also taken into account). Furthermore, the district court did find as a foundational fact that there was actual confusion among Ohio consumers about the availability of Big Boy products in Ohio Elby\u2019s restaurants; the only dispute concerned the causes of that confusion. In determining the proper scope of relief, we should recall that \u201c\u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act is remedial in nature, and should be interpreted and applied broadly so as to effectuate its remedial purpose.\u201d <em>Warner Bros., supra </em>at 79. Because the ultimate determination of \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d is a legal conclusion reviewable <em>de novo </em>by this court, <em>J. B. Williams Co. v. Le Conte Cosmetics, Inc., </em>523 F.2d 187, 190 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 1110, 47 L.Ed.2d 317 (1976), it is unnecessary to remand this case to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">A final issue raised by Elby\u2019s is whether the particular requirements for a preliminary injunction are met here. The legal standard governing the grant of a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 43(a) is clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">There must be a showing of (A) irreparable harm and (B) either (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-12\"><em>Warner Bros., supra </em>at 78. It is obvious to this court that Frisch\u2019s has shown a likelihood that it will succeed on the merits of this case. We are also convinced that Frisch\u2019s has demonstrated irreparable harm, since it has a \u201csubstantial financial interest at stake\u201d in its exclusive use in Ohio of the Big Boy trademark, it has \u201cincurred great expense\u201d in promoting that trademark in Ohio, and \u201cits licensing program will lose much of the confidence reposed in it by [its] licensees\u201d if they view Frisch\u2019s as unwilling to protect the exclusivity of its licenses. <em>Id. </em>at 79. Although it is true that \u201c[a] preliminary injunction imports a degree of urgency [and] . . . should not be available to the plaintiff who slumbered on his rights,\u201d 4 R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Callman, Law of Unfair Competition, Trademarks &amp; Monopolies \u00a7 88.3(b) at 206 (3d ed. 1970), it appears to us that Frisch\u2019s properly asserted its legal rights from the beginning through its litigation in the West Virginia state courts, and it undoubtedly hoped to defend its interests in that forum without the need of proceeding in another forum. We recognize Frisch\u2019s delay in moving for a preliminary injunction after the present action was originally filed; however, it so moved a few months after it filed its amended complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not believe the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction in spite of this delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The district court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction as to Elby\u2019s television advertisements is therefore affirmed, while we reverse on the issue of newspaper advertisements and remand for entry of such preliminary injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\">. This boy is rather chubby and somewhat cherubic in appearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">. The district court specifically declined to grant injunctive relief concerning Elby\u2019s newspaper and radio advertisements. While Frisch\u2019s notice of appeal is broad enough to cover the failure to grant relief as to radio as well as newspaper advertisements, Frisch\u2019s briefs on appeal have only addressed the issue of Elby\u2019s newspaper advertisements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\">. The Fifth Circuit has tied passing off to the \u201cfalse description or representation\u201d strand of \u00a7 43(a), contending that a \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d refers only to misrepresentations of geographic origin and not manufacture or source origin. <em>Chevron Chemical, supra </em>at 700. However, this court held that passing off can be considered a \u201cfalse designation of origin.\u201d <em>Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, supra </em>at 408. Nevertheless, whether characterized as a \u201cfalse description or representation\u201d or a \u201cfalse designation of origin,\u201d there is no disagreement that \u00a7 43(a) would apply to prohibit an attempt by Elby\u2019s to pass off the food products of its Ohio restaurants as Big Boy sponsored goods. <em>See, e.g., Chevron Chemical, supra; Warner Bros., Inc. v. Gay Toys, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981) (toy manufacturer\u2019s attempt to pass off its toy automobiles as sponsored by popular television series prohibited by \u00a7 43(a)); <em>Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b711-14\">. <em>Accord, CBS, Inc. v.

Evidently Frisch\u2019s sought a preliminary injunction when it became apparent that docket constraints in the district court would preclude a plenary hearing for an extended period of time.
