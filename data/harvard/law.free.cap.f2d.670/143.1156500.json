App.P. 34(a); Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Appellant is currently incarcerated at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester. In his complaint, he challenged certain conditions surrounding his confinement at the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center prior to his transfer to McAlester. These challenges included, <em>inter alia, </em>an allegation of interference with his right of access to the courts; a claim that certain personal property was illegally confiscated and/or destroyed; a claim that the reception center is overcrowded; and a claim that Department of Corrections officials retaliate against the Reception Center inmates\u2019 use of the law library by transferring such inmates to the more secure penitentiary. Appellant claims that such conduct was in violation of several provisions of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">At the outset, we must address appellee\u2019s assertion that the scope of this appeal should be limited to reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s new trial motion. The district court\u2019s judgment was filed on March 13, 1981. Thereafter, appellant sought post-judgment relief by filing a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 which sought a \u201cnew trial/amendment or rehearing.\u201d The Rule 59 motion was supported by an affidavit containing, in essence, a recapitulation of the allegations of the complaint. Although the Rule 59 motion was not filed in the district court until March 25, 1981, it appears that <em>service </em>of the motion may have been accomplished as early as March 23, 1981, the date stated in the certificate of service appended to the motion. To be timely, a Rule 59 motion must be <em>served </em>within ten days of the entry of judgment; the date of filing in the district court is essentially irrelevant here to a determination of timeliness. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 5(d). In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we construe appellant\u2019s Rule 59 motion as if served on March 23, 1981. Accordingly, the timely Rule 59 motion tolled the time for filing the notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Century Laminating, Ltd. v. Montgomery, </em>595 F.2d 563 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>444 U.S. 987, 100 S.Ct. 204, 62 L.Ed.2d 132 (1979). The notice of appeal, timely filed after disposition of the Rule 59 motion, preserved for review the prior judgment entered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">In dismissing the complaint, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to establish, if proven, any solid claim of deprivation of constitutional rights. He has not alleged facts sufficient to establish, if proven, any injury, damage or prejudice to himself. He has not alleged facts sufficient to establish, if proven, that the only named defendant in his action has personally participated or acquiesced in any action or inaction resulting in any deprivation of plaintiff\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">We concur in the district court\u2019s conclusion. Appellant can make no \u201crational argument on the law or facts in support of his claim.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Passic, </em>545 F.2d 1260 (10th Cir. 1976). <em>See also Collins v. Cundy, </em>603 F.2d 825 (10th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">As we reiterated recently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-15\">The Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201clawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u201d <em>Pell v. Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 822 [94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495]; <em>Accord, Jones v. North Carolina Prisoner\u2019s Labor Union, </em>433 U.S. 119, 125 [97 S.Ct. 2532, 2537, 53 L.Ed.2d 629]; <em>See generally Daughtery v. Harris, </em>476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 872 [94 S.Ct. 112, 38 L.Ed.2d 91].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaD\"><em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Lamm, </em>639 F.2d 559, 579 (10th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1041, 101 S.Ct. 1759, 68 L.Ed.2d 239 (1981). Appellant has presented no facts to suggest that the reception center officials have exaggerated their response to legitimate penological considerations. Under such circumstances, we will defer to the expertise of those prison officials in such internal administrative matters as herein challenged. <em>See Battle v. Anderson, </em>564 F.2d 388 (10th Cir. 1977); <em>Marchesani v. McCune, </em>531 F.2d 459 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 846, 97 S.Ct. 127, 50 L.Ed.2d 117 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In light of our conclusions stated above, we additionally find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial or for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
