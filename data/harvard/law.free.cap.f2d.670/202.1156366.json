Appellants claim that the Commission improperly considered the licensee\u2019s <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> equal employment opportunity (EEO) statistics for a period postdating the expired license term,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the licensee disregarded Commission regulations so flagrantly as to necessitate nonrenewal. Finding no legal impropriety in the Commission\u2019s exercise of its authority and discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">In 1972, Rust Communications Group, Inc., applied to the Commission for license renewals for radio stations WHAM and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>WHFM, in Rochester, New York.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The applications were contested by two local organizations, Metro-Act of Rochester, Inc., and Action for A Better Community, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the appellants here. The grounds of opposition essentially were that Rust had failed adequately to ascertain and serve the needs of the community, and had engaged in employment practices discriminating against minorities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The Commission concluded that appellants had identified serious flaws in Rust\u2019s applications<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and had, through statistical data, made a prima facie showing of employment discrimination as well.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Commission scheduled a hearing and designated a variety of issues for exploration. Included were whether Rust had properly ascertained, and had been reasonably responsive to, community problems and needs; whether it had made a good faith effort to meet its public affairs programming commitment; whether it had violated the Commission\u2019s equal employment opportunity rules; and whether sanctions should be imposed upon the licensee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">After completion of the hearing, an administrative law judge agreed that Rust\u2019s applications presented troublesome questions. Rust\u2019s affirmative action efforts during the term of the licenses, characterized as \u201cminimal\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u201cfar from vigorous and continuing,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> led the judge to observe \u201cthat until 1976, the [EEO] record . . . could not have been much poorer,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that \u201c[i]f that record was the sole criterion, the denial of the renewal applications would be warranted.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But Rust\u2019s post-term statistics- \u2014 those for the period after the Commission issued its designation order\u2014 presented a rosier picture. Affirmative action had been \u201cnotably intensified,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there had been a dramatic increase in the number of minority and women employees at the two Rochester stations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, the judge found, \u201cthe licensee appears to be seriously pursuing a training program for minority\u201d applicants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge concluded that Rust\u2019s post-designation affirmative action endeavors warranted a one-year renewal of the licenses, coupled with detailed account-ings by Rust of steps taken and progress made in the direction of equal employment opportunity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\">The judge\u2019s findings on other issues did not alter his determination that short-term renewal was appropriate. While Rust\u2019s attempts to ascertain community problems were defective, said the judge, \u201c[o]n the basis of the record, it appears that despite the deficiencies, [Rust] did in fact propose programming to meet the most pressing community problems or needs which were ascertained,\u201d and \u201cthere is no evidentiary support for a finding that problems other than those ascertained existed.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>thermore, the judge continued, \u201cthe non-entertaining programming of [the stations] was reasonably responsive to community needs and problems during the periods, 1969-1972 and 1972-1975.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, while Rust\u2019s public affairs responsibilities were not entirely fulfilled, it had \u201cmade reasonable and good faith efforts to meet its 1969 Public Affairs commitment.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">From this initial decision appellants went to the Commission,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> contending among other things that the administrative law judge erred in considering post-term data on the equal employment opportunity issue.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Commission disagreed, however. While \u201cpost-term <em>programming </em>improvements will be discounted and given little weight in a renewal proceeding,\u201d it noted, \u201c[b]y contrast, to date it has been the Commission\u2019s policy routinely to consider the post-term results of licensees\u2019 EEO programs ... so long as responsible allegations of specific acts of intentional discrimination or other possible evidence of intentional discrimination are not left unexamined.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Commission thus concluded that Rust\u2019s post-term upgrading was relevant and, since intentional discrimination was not urged,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it approved the one-year renewals<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> as \u201char-moniz[ing] with the actions we have taken on the renewal applications of other licensees who were responsible for deficient affirmative action implementation during the same period explored in this proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 contentions on ascertainment, programing responsiveness and public affairs were given short shrift. The Commission agreed with the administrative law judge that Rust\u2019s shortcomings were essentially harmless,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and \u201caffirmfed] his position that the outcome of these issues did not materially affect the sanction appropriate in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">The Commission did, however, use the occasion to announce a new equal employment opportunity policy. Future renewal applicants could safely rely only on statistics generated during the license term; \u201c[w]e will not consider post-term EEO evidence at all,\u201d the Commission stated, \u201cif the licensee\u2019s term-time EEO record is so deficient that it, standing alone, would warrant denial of renewal or other sanctions.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Rust was exempted from this policy because the Commission believed that the broadcasting industry had not fully understood the requirements in vogue during the 1969-1975 period, when the events relevant here transpired.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">Only Rust sought Commission reconsideration, which was denied.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Appellants, on the other hand, brought their grievances directly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">Appellants assert principally that the Commission cannot look to post-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>EEO statistics in licensing proceedings, and that without them the license renewals in Rust\u2019s favor were improper.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Commission points out, in response, that both it and this court have regularly resorted to such statistics in the past.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Undeniably, until adoption of its new policy, the Commission has not balked at considering post-term EEO statistics,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and that practice has been accepted by the court \u201cwithout discussion.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Indeed, we have expressly rejected the argument that the Commission must disregard post-term employment data,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> noting that the Commission has a proper role in \u201cseeking to lead a licensee who has not possessed an adequate affirmative action program in the past to adopt policies ensuring [one] ... in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It cannot be gainsaid that, in this context, post-term data have a \u201cdistinct relevance.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Appellants argue, however, that the use of such statistics is barred by our decisions in <em>Bilingual Bicultural Coalition v. FCC</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Los Angeles Women\u2019s Coalition v. FCC</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where we declared that \u201cwe have never accepted, and we do not here accept, the proposition that license renewals may be granted in reliance on post-term statistics alone.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> On close inspection, however, it becomes clear that both cases support the Commission\u2019s disposition here. In <em>Bilingual Bicultural Coalition, </em>we held that the Commission, when it finds a licensee\u2019s EEO efforts inadequate, may appropriately \u201cinvoke[] <em>prospective, </em>administrative sanctions \u2014 short-term license renewals and license renewals conditioned on reporting\u2014 which enable it to monitor broadcasters\u2019 progress in recruiting and hiring minority workers.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> To be sure, we also concluded that the Commission\u2019s approach cannot be wholly prospective because \u201cintentional discrimination almost invariably would disqualify a broadcaster from a position of public trusteeship.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> And since \u201csubstantial statistical disparity, especially when coupled with a languishing affirmative action plan, raises questions as to whether the station\u2019s poor EEO performance owes to inadvertence, or to intentional discrimination,\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> we admonished that the Commission, when faced with such a situation, must determine \u2014 by hearing or otherwise \u2014 what caused the disparity and what should be done about it.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In this light, the language relied on by appellants must be seen as meaning that post-term statistics cannot be used to nullify proven in-term <em>intentional </em>discrimination.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>A similar course was taken in <em>Los Angeles Women\u2019s Coalition. </em>Finding indications of substantial statistical disparity between the makeup of the licensee\u2019s workforce and that of the relevant labor market, we declared that \u201cthe \u2018public interest is not served by licensees who engage in intentional employment discrimination,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and explained that \u201cunderrepresentation of certain groups in a licensee\u2019s workforce . . . may result in programming which fails adequately to serve the community.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We therefore held that further consideration was there necessary to determine whether there had been intentional discrimination and, if not, to see whether \u201cpassive\u201d underrepresentation of protected groups required <em>\u2018\u201cprospective </em>administrative sanctions\u2019 \u201d such as short-term license renewals.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Commission\u2019s course in the instant case observed these guideposts. Noting Rust\u2019s poor EEO record, the Commission set a hearing, thereby affording appellants a chance to show specific acts of intentional discrimination. After they failed to do so,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> the Commission imposed administrative sanctions prospectively. Our decisions leave little room for debate on the propriety of that procedure.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Appellant Action for a Better Community, however, also takes an alternative tack, arguing that it was irrational for the Commission to exempt Rust from its new policy on the use of post-term EEO statistics.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Again, we believe the Commission\u2019s action was appropriate. As late as July, 1975 \u2014 two months after the designation order issued in this case \u2014 the Commission acknowledged that its previous pronouncements had failed \u201cto adequately describe and exemplify the measures which broadcasters should undertake to promote the full realization of equal opportunity in employment for qualified individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The Commission noted, at the same time, a widespread belief in the industry that its EEO requirements would be met so long as overt discrimination was avoided.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> It was not until 1976 that the Commission established its model EEO program.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Given the traditionally broad discretion accorded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Commission,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> we cannot say that it erred in refusing to impose forthwith the ultimate sanction of nonrenewal upon a licensee that might have been uncertain about the ramifications of agency policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Lastly, appellant Metro-Act urges that Rust\u2019s failures to properly ascertain and respond to community needs, along with its neglect of public affairs commitments, warrant outright denial of its renewal applications.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The Commission found however, that on these points Rust effectively achieved the goals erected by the Commission\u2019s rules, and concluded that short-term license renewals provided enough impetus for full compliance in the immediate future. Choice of sanction for a rule violation is an area wherein the Commission is to be indulged the widest possible latitude.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for what appears to be a reasonable exercise of agency discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The order appealed from is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-29\">.
