EPA, </em>645 F.2d 1349 (9th Cir. 1981), we affirmed the decision of the EPA. Subsequent to our decision, Northern Plains Resource Council (NPRC) filed for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Clean Air Act, \u00a7 307(f), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(f) (\u00a7 307(f)). EPA opposes this request, primarily arguing that under the circumstances of this case an award of attorney\u2019s fees would be inappropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Section 307(f) provides that \u201cin any judicial proceeding under this section, the court may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney\u2019s and expert witness\u2019s fees) whenever it determines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d As EPA recognizes, Congress, by adopting this section of the Clean Air Act, did not intend to limit the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, Congress sought to facilitate challenges of EPA decisions in order to insure that EPA fulfilled its designated function of preserving air quality. <em>See Metropolitan Washington Coalition for Clean Air v. District of Columbia, </em>639 F.2d 802, 804 (D.C.Cir.1981). We agree with the D.C. Circuit that in determining whether a party \u2014 prevailing or non-prevailing \u2014 can recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 307(f) from the Government, the test is \u201cwhether in light of what was known . . . when the action was instituted, the action was of the type Congress sought to encourage when it authorized awards of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Applying this test in the instant case, we believe NPRC is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Contrary to EPA\u2019s argument, at least two of the issues presented in this case had not been decided by this court prior to the institution of this suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the interest of certain NPRC members in preserving the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>their property which might have been decreased if the power plants were built would not have been sufficient incentive to encourage the expenditures required by a suit of this type.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Because NPRC brought this suit to promote the quality of air resources, and because the suit presented issues important to the construction of the Clean Air Act, this is precisely the type of suit Congress sought to encourage by enacting \u00a7 307(f). An award of attorney\u2019s fees to NPRC is therefore appropriate under that section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">NPRC is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 307(f). It will have 14 days from the entry of this order to file a motion specifying the amount of fees sought with supporting documents justifying the request. EPA will have 14 days from the date NPRC files its motion to file an opposition to NPRC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. EPA also argues that NPRC\u2019s motion is defective because it was filed 55 days after judgment and because it does not specify the amount of fees sought. The costs of litigation covered by \u00a7 307(f) are not the same costs this court is authorized to award under Fed.R.App.Pro. 39. Therefore, Rule 39\u2019s 14-day time limit for filing costs bills does not apply to motions for attorney\u2019s fees filed pursuant to \u00a7 307(f). Because prior to October 1, 1981, there was no prescribed time limit for filing a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, NPRC\u2019s motion was not untimely. <em>Cf. </em>Local Rule 14(g) (effective October 1, 1981, requests for attorney\u2019s fees must be filed within 30 days of entry of judgment); <em>cf. also </em>Local Rule 13(b)(1)(E) (effective October 1, 1981, party must indicate in brief if attorney\u2019s fees will be sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">We also refuse to reject NPRC\u2019s motion on the ground that it does not specify the amount of attorney\u2019s fees requested. Although the amount of attorney\u2019s fees requested should generally be included in a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, failure to specify the amount requested does not require denial of the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-15\">. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 337 <em>reprinted in </em>[1977] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 1077, at 1416 (\u201cThe committee did not intend that the court\u2019s discretion to award fees under [\u00a7 307(f) ] should be restricted to cases in which the party seeking fees was the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-16\">. As we indicated in our opinion, the precise issue presented in this case relating to \u201ccommenced construction\u201d had not been considered by this court in <em>Montana Power Co. v. EPA, </em>608 F.2d 334 (9th Cir. 1979). <em>Northern Plains, </em>645 F.2d at 1357 n.24. Nor had this court decided the issue of the applicability of new source performance standards prior to institution of this suit. The fact that other courts considered this issue prior to the release of our decision in no way affects NPRC\u2019s entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Metropolitan Washington, </em>639 F.2d at 804.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b913-18\">. EPA argues that if NPRC is awarded attorney\u2019s fees, it is entitled to contribution from intervenor Montana Power Company. However, there is no indication that Congress sought to require a prevailing intervening party to indemnify the party challenging an EPA decision. Instead, \u00a7 307(f) simply evinces a willingness on the part of Congress to have the Government bear the cost of litigation brought to promote air quality.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
