On appeal Smith contends the evidence presented was insufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he deposited the letter for conveyance in the mail, and the trial court gave an instruction that presented a false issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-23\">Smith stipulated that while imprisoned at the Kansas State Penitentiary he wrote the following letter dated April 8, 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-24\">\u201cDear Mr. President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"add-dedup-1\">My name is Kenneth Harold Smith Sr. # 31600 I\u2019m at the Kansas State Penitentiary doing a 3 to 10 yrs. for Felonious Assault ,with a Deadly Weapon and Criminal Damages to State Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-25\">I get out on my Correctional Release Jan. 9th 1981. But if Director Robert Atkins refuses to let me out on the above date mentioned I\u2019m going to kill you Mr. Carter when I do get out July 9th 1985 thats the end of my maximum sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0\">Mr. Kenneth Harold Smith Sr. # 31600 106E.A.&amp;T.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-26\">Box 2 Lansing Kansas 66043\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-27\">The envelope was addressed to President Carter at the White House in Washington, D. C., and Smith\u2019s name and address were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>shown in the upper left corner as the return address. The envelope was postmarked from Lansing, Kansas, on April 11, 1980, and was received at the White House on April 28, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">A Secret Service agent interviewed Smith at the penitentiary. According to the agent\u2019s testimony, corroborated by a prison counselor who was present at the interview, Smith acknowledged writing the letter, repeated its contents as best he remembered them, and declared his continuing intention to kill President Carter. The defense presented no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Smith contends that his conviction must be overturned because the government presented no evidence to show he deposited the letter for conveyance in the mail, an element of the crime with which he was charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While there was evidence that Smith-wrote the letter and addressed it to the President, the only direct evidence that Smith mailed it was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-7\">\u201cQ. [By defendant\u2019s counsel] What types of things did you ask him [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-8\">A. [Secret Service agent] The first thing I asked him was if he was indeed the author of a letter <em>sent </em>to the President of the United States that was dated April 8, 1980.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-9\">Q. He readily admitted that, did he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-10\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-11\">Q. And you asked him to write out as best he could remember what he <em>sent. </em>Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-12\">A. Yes, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-13\">Q. And he readily did that, did he not? A. Yes, he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">R. II, 34 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-15\">\u201cQ. [Prosecuting attorney] How did you come to be present during the course of that interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-18\">A. [Prison counselor] Due to a letter that was <em>sent </em>out and I got a phone call from the Treasury Department or Secret Service that they wanted to talk to him about a letter, which I had already known he had sent a letter. And Mr. Bay wanted to talk to him. So I brought him up to talk to Mr. Bay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-19\">R. II, 46-47 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-20\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, an appellate court must consider in the light most favorable to the prosecution not only the evidence introduced but all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Blitstein, </em>626 F.2d 774, 776 (10th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1102, 101 S.Ct. 898, 66 L.Ed.2d 828 (1981); <em>United States v. Brinklow, </em>560 F.2d 1008, 1009 (10th Cir. 1977). The Secret Service agent and the counselor stated that Smith freely admitted writing and addressing the letter, readily rewrote the substance of the letter from memory, and announced his continued intention to kill the President. Neither the agent nor the counselor said that Smith protested he had never mailed the letter, never intended that it be mailed, or the like. Because at the interview Smith repeated the threat and did not disclaim mailing the letter, the jury Could reasonably infer that Smith was acknowledging sending the letter as well as writing it. The direct evidence and the inferences available to the jury constitute substantial evidence in support of the jury\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b986-22\">Defendant Smith\u2019s second contention focuses upon the sentence in the court\u2019s instruction discussing \u201cthreat\u201d: \u201cThe term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>\u2018threat\u2019 means an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smith argues that this instruction requires proof of Smith\u2019s actual intention to carry out the threat, which is more than the Tenth Circuit cases require. <em>See United States v. Hart, </em>457 F.2d 1087 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 861, 93 S.Ct. 150, 34 L.Ed.2d 108 (1972); <em>Michaud v. United States, </em>350 F.2d 131 (10th Cir. 1965). Although acknowledging that his interpretation of the court\u2019s instruction may be viewed as favorable to him because, to reach its verdict of guilty, the jury had to find Smith intended to fulfill the threat, Smith argues it created a \u201cfalse issue\u201d in the minds of the jurors, may have confused them, and therefore requires a new trial. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, we believe Smith reads too much into the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The key word used in the instruction, \u201cavowed,\u201d means \u201copenly acknowledged or declared.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>151-52 (1976). We believe a fair reading of the instruction requires the jury to find that the defendant had openly declared a present intention to injure the President \u2014 which is nothing more than requiring the jury to find that defendant declared to others an \u201capparent determination\u201d to injure the President, language this Court has previously approved. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>457 F.2d 1087, 1090 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 861, 93 S.Ct. 150, 34 L.Ed.2d 108 (1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Requiring that the defendant\u2019s intention be \u201capparent\u201d or \u201cavowed\u201d is intended to preclude conviction if the defendant keeps secret an intention to harm the President.</p>\n<p id=\"aym-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b986-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-17\">\u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, ... shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b987-6\">. The entire paragraph containing this sentence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018threat\u2019 means an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future. A statement may constitute a threat even though it is subject to a possible contingency in the maker\u2019s control. The prosecution must establish a \u2018true threat,\u2019 which means a serious threat as distinguished from words uttered as mere political argument, idle talk or jest. In determining whether words were uttered as a threat the context in which they were spoken must be considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\">. In holding that the government need not prove that the defendant intended to carry out the threat, <em>Michaud </em>disagreed with <em>United States v. Metzdorf, </em>252 F. 933 (D.Mont.1918), terming it the \u201cextreme minority view.\u201d Smith contends that the portion of <em>Metzdorf </em>with which <em>Michaud </em>disagreed was its use of the same language challenged by Smith: \u201cA threat is an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future.\u201d <em>Metzdorf, </em>252 F. at 938. However, this Court\u2019s disapproval was of the <em>Metzdorf </em>court\u2019s holding that \u201csimple threats,\u201d which are those not made for the purpose of influencing the conduct of the person threatened, require for conviction \u201cexistence of intent to execute.\u201d <em>Metzdorf, </em>252 F. at 937-38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b987-23\">. Prior to <em>Hart, </em>the Supreme Court expressed \u201cgrave doubts\u201d whether apparent determination is sufficient for conviction. <em>Watts v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969). <em>But see Rogers v. United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 48, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 2099, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring) (suggesting only that the statute requires the government to show the defendant intended his statement to be regarded as a threat). Subsequent circuit courts have been nearly unanimous in concluding that actual intent to harm the President need not be shown. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kelner, </em>534 F.2d 1020, 1025 n.6 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1022, 97 S.Ct. 639, 50 L.Ed.2d 623 (1976) (collecting cases). <em>Cf. United States v. Lincoln, </em>589 F.2d 379 (8th Cir. 1979) (intent to carry out threat to life of judge need not be proven).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
