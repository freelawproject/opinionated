This action was taken after a visit of an agent of the Board to the area of the proposed branch and after affording oral argument to First National Bank of Baudette, which had filed a protest against the branch application. First National then brought this suit, asking that the Board\u2019s action be set aside as arbitrary and capricious. On August 10, 1981, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary' judgment for defendants, holding that the Board\u2019s action was based on adequate evidence in the record and was not irrational. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The scope of judicial review in matters of this kind is narrow, even more circumscribed than in many cases of review of agency action. The courts may set aside the Board\u2019s order only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). As we said in <em>Madison County Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Federal Home Loan Bank Board, </em>622 F.2d 393, 397 (8th Cir. 1980),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">Congress apparently intended to give the FHLBB wide discretion to apply its expertise in this difficult area, and believed the exercise of that discretion should be subject to the very limited review of \u00a7 706(2)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Board need not even make formal findings of fact, although here it has favored us with a summary statement of supporting findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We agree with the District Court that First National failed to sustain the heavy burden precedent has placed upon it in this type of case. The bank presents a vigorous and detailed argument, all of which we have considered. Had we been sitting as members of the. Federal Home Loan Bank Board, we might well have agreed with the bank that there is no \u201cnecessity\u201d for a new financial institution in Lake of the Woods County, and that there is no \u201creasonable probability of success\u201d for the new branch. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.14(c)(2) (1980). The area hardly seems affluent. But we cannot say that the Board acted irrationally. The nearest savings and loan is now 56 miles from Baudette; the protestant bank is the only financial institution in the county as matters now stand; and First National\u2019s savings deposits increased by about $1.5 million in 1979 and $710 thousand during the first three months of 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">First National also argues that an error of law was committed, in that the Board failed to make a finding as to whether the establishment of the new branch would unduly injure the existing bank. Under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.14(c)(3), a branch applicant must show that \u201cthe branch can be established without undue injury to properly conducted existing local thrift and home-financing institutions .... \u201d In dealing with this criterion, the Board observed simply that there are no thrift and home-financing institutions currently in Lake of the Woods County. It thus construed its regulation to be concerned only with possible injury to other savings and loan associations, not with the competitive impact on commercial banks like First National. This was a permissible construction of the regulation, see, <em>e.g., Union Nat\u2019l Bank of Clarksburg v. Federal Home Loan Bank Board, </em>233 F.2d 695, 696-97 (D.C.Cir.1956), and we customarily defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. Although the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, P.L. 96-221, 94 Stat. 132, has eliminated some of the distinctions between commercial banks and thrift institutions, it has not obliterated them altogether. Savings and loans, unlike commercial banks, still have as their primary business focus the making of long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>term loans for the purchase or construction of homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We have considered plaintiff\u2019s other arguments and conclude that they have no merit. The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. The Hon. Edward J.
