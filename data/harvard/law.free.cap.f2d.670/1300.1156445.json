Because we conclude that the controlling legislation does not authorize direct review by a court of appeals of this type of determination by the Board, we dismiss New Jersey\u2019s petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-27\">Under the Medicaid program (Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.), eligible individuals who receive medical assistance generally are not billed for any services rendered to them. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>the \u201cprovider\u201d of such services seeks reimbursement of its expenses from the \u201csingle state agency\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> responsible for administering the state\u2019s Medicaid arrangement and for distributing federal funds. In order to qualify for reimbursement, a provider institution, such as a nursing home, must enter into a \u201cprovider agreement\u201d with the single state agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That agreement is contingent upon certification by a \u201cstate survey agency\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the facility in question meets certain federal standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-4\">On October 21, 1975, the New Jersey Department of Health \u2014 the State\u2019s Title XVIII and Title XIX survey agency<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 conducted a \u201clicensure walk-through\u201d of Spring-view Nursing Home, a new facility located in Freehold, New Jersey. Grant Appeals Board Decision No. 137 (Dec. 1, 1980), Appendix at 10a. Based on its inspection, New Jersey\u2019s single state agency (the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services) executed a provider agreement with Springview covering the Medicaid program. Appendix at 54a. On October 23, 1975, the single state agency requested a statement from the survey agency \u201cto the effect that [Springview] meets the standards for Medicaid participation.\u201d Record at 3-1. In response, the director of the survey agency issued the following hand-written note: \u201c10/28/75. Now meets the Standards for Medicaid participation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-10\">In January 1976, Springview also sought to enter into a provider agreement with respect to the Medicare program. That agreement was not forthcoming, however, because a joint Title XVIII-Title XIX survey conducted on January 12 and 13 revealed operating deficiencies sufficient to render the institution ineligible for both Medicare and Medicaid funds. Record at 5-1 to 5-74. Only after Springview committed itself to and undertook a plan of correction did the facility receive approval, effective March 22, 1976, for Medicare participation. Grant Appeals Board Decision, <em>supra, </em>Appendix at 10a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-11\">Citing the results of the January 1976 survey, HHS refused to honor New Jersey\u2019s subsequent request for reimbursement for Medicaid-related services provided at Springview during the October 1975 to March 1976 period. Record at 11 \u2014 1 &amp; 16 \u2014 1. The State\u2019s claim, which totaled $221,824, was disallowed by the Administrator of HHS\u2019 Health Care Financing Administration on the ground that a provider agreement could issue only after a full-fledged Title XIX certification survey, such as that conducted in January 1976, as opposed to October 1975\u2019s mere \u201clicensure walk-through.\u201d Record at 56-1 to 56-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">New Jersey appealed the Administrator\u2019s determination to the HHS Grant Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>Board, which affirmed the disallowance, albeit on a different ground. <em>See </em>Grant Appeals Board Decision, <em>supra, </em>Appendix at 9a-14a. The Board declined to decide whether the Department of Health\u2019s failure fully to survey Springview nullified the October 21, 1975, provider agreement. Rather, the Board held that, although there existed no explicit statutory or regulatory requirement that any particular form be completed in certifying a nursing home for Title XIX eligibility, a survey agency was obligated to \u201ccommunicate certain information\u201d to the single state agency before Medicaid funds could be made available with respect to that institution. Specifically, the Board stated that the survey agency must record \u201c[t]he duration of the certification period, the type of facility involved, whether the facility is in compliance with program requirements, and the existence of [any] special conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applying this standard, the Board concluded that the \u201cone-line note\u201d penned by the director of New Jersey\u2019s survey authority did not constitute an \u201ceffective\u201d certification of Springview. Grant Appeals Board Decision, <em>supra, </em>Appendix at 13a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">On appeal to this Court, New Jersey contends that: (1) because neither statute nor regulation mandates that a particular form be used or that specific information be provided when a state survey agency represents that a nursing home meets certification criteria, HHS \u201celevated form over substance\u201d by refusing to accept the written memorandum involved here; (2) in this instance, the single state agency actually was aware of all the \u201cinformation\u201d that the Board deemed necessary for the agency to know in making a Title XIX eligibility determination; (3) because of \u201ca severe shortage of nursing home beds available for New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid recipients,\u201d informal and expedited certification procedures were necessary; and (4) by imposing a \u201chuge forfeiture\u201d in a situation where there was no damage to Medicaid recipients themselves, HHS violated the principle of \u201ccooperative federalism.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 14-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">New Jersey maintains that its petition is properly before this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a), which authorizes direct appellate review of a determination by the Secretary of HHS that a state\u2019s Medicaid plan is not in compliance with federal statutes and regulations. HHS insists, on the other hand, that the present controversy is more appropriately classified as a disallowance dispute, and therefore should be reviewed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(d), which does not provide for initial consideration by a court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\">A jurisdictional question similar to the one presented here was discussed and resolved in two recent decisions of this Court, both of which, in fact, involved these same litigants. <em>See State of New Jersey v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>670 F.2d 1262 (3d Cir. 1981) (hereinafter referred to as <em>New Jersey </em>I); <em>State of New Jersey v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>670 F.2d 1284 (3d Cir. 1982) (hereinafter referred to as <em>New Jersey </em>II). In view of these decisions, we believe it unnecessary once again to identify the various differences between section 1316(a) and section 1316(d) procedures or to justify why \u201ca court of appeals is obligated to look beyond the label the Secretary puts on his or her actions, and instead is required to conduct an independent evaluation of the underlying substance of the dispute.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>I, at 1272. Rather, we believe it appropriate to explain only why we have concluded, in contrast to the result reached in the previous two cases, that the petition for review presented by New Jersey cannot be entertained for jurisdictional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>In <em>New Jersey </em>I, this Court determined that review under section 1316(a) was in order where a state raised \u201cdifficult and significant legal issues having to do with the construction of the Social Security Act . . . and [with] the legality of certain HHS administrative actions.\u201d At 1273. Similarly, in <em>New Jersey </em>II, section 1316(a) procedures were deemed appropriate where the dispute involved \u201cthe coverage of certain individuals under the Medicaid program, the estoppel of a federal agency for its allegedly misleading advice to state officials, and the ability of a state retroactively to alter provisions of its Social Security plan so as to maximize its receipt of federal dollars.\u201d At 1291. In both cases, we concluded that HHS \u201cin effect\u201d had found that New Jersey, in the overall administration of one of its state Social Security plans, was not conforming with applicable federal requirements. <em>New Jersey </em>I, at 1273; <em>New Jersey </em>II, at 1291-1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-4\">Unlike <em>New Jersey </em>I and <em>New Jersey </em>II, however, the administrative decision about which New Jersey here complains in no way affects its entire Medicaid plan. Quite simply, HHS did not determine that the State\u2019s Title XIX arrangement, either in whole or in part, was defective, either on its face or in its administration. Instead, the Department merely refused to credit the State for expenses incurred for a limited period of time at a single nursing home that the agency believed was improperly certified. In our view, the denial of reimbursement in such an isolated instance and for such a discrete reason constitutes an almost archetypical section 1316(d) situation \u2014 that is, a situation where \u201cthe Secretary disallows specific State expenditures for Federal financial participation,\u201d <em>see </em>S.Rep.No.404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1965] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1943, 2091. We cannot hold that the failure of New Jersey\u2019s survey authority properly to inform the single state agency about the Medicaid status of Springview Nursing Home somehow \u201cimplicate[d] the administration of ... New Jersey\u2019s [Medicaid] program as a whole,\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>I, at 1275, and therefore entitled the State to the full panoply of section 1316(a)-review procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">Our classification of the present dispute as a \u201ctypical\u201d disallowance matter, appropriate for consideration in connection with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(d), is consistent with the position adopted by a number of other federal courts in similar cases. In <em>Wingate v. Harris, </em>501 F.Supp. 58 (S.D.N.Y.1980), for example, New York challenged HHS\u2019 refusal to reimburse it for expenses incurred by three institutions adjudged by the Department not to meet federal standards for \u201cskilled nursing care facilities.\u201d The court held that section 1316(d) procedures were in order, instead of those associated with section 1316(a), because \u201cthe dispute in this case involves disallowance of a class of items \u2014 claims relating to three decertified nursing homes \u2014 and not \u2018plan conformity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63. Similarly, in <em>State of Washington, Department of Social and Health Services v. Schweiker, </em>No. 81\u20147414 (9th Cir. Sept. 29, 1981), a motions panel of the Ninth Circuit declined to review, for jurisdictional reasons, a Grant Appeals Board Decision, <em>see </em>No. 176 (May 26, 1981), disallowing Medicaid reimbursement with respect to two intermediate-care facilities for which, in the agency\u2019s opinion, valid provider agreements had not been obtained. And, in a situation in which a state-wide survey of twenty intermediate-care institutions revealed that one patient in one facility had not been properly certified as eligible for long-term inpatient treatment, <em>see </em>Grant Appeals Board Decision No. 167 (Apr. 30, 1981), the Sixth Circuit agreed with HHS\u2019 characterization of the controversy as a \u201cdisallowance\u201d and dismissed the State\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Department of Public Health, State of Tennessee v. Departmental Grant Appeals Board, HHS, </em>672 F.2d 916 (6th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>As a final matter, we reject New Jersey\u2019s contention that section 1316(a) procedures are necessary because the present controversy largely concerns a legal, and not a factual, question' \u2014 namely, whether a handwritten notation, such as that relied on here by New Jersey\u2019s single state agency, constitutes sufficient certification of an institution\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. We repeat our earlier admonition: a state is not entitled to plan-conformity treatment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A55\">merely because its challenge to the HHS \u201cdisallowance\u201d is premised on legal, as opposed to factual, grounds. Had Congress wanted courts of appeals to review directly <em>all </em>legal matters surrounding the administration of a state\u2019s Social Security-type programs, it of course could have written \u00a7 1316 accordingly. Instead, Congress chose, for whatever reasons, to limit the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal appellate courts only to those situations involving plan conformity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\"><em>New Jersey </em>I, at 1277 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">Having concluded, for the above reasons, that a court of appeals does not have jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a) to consider the disallowance objected to in this instance by New Jersey, we dismiss the State\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">. In relevant part, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(5) specifies that a state plan for medical assistance must \u201cprovide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to administer or to supervise the administration of the plan.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">.
