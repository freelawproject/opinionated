We answer both questions in the negative and, therefore, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-17\">Plaintiff-appellee Chatios Systems, Inc., initiated this action in the Superior Court of New Jersey, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of warranty regarding an NCR 399/656 computer system it had acquired from defendant National Cash Register Corp. The case was removed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Following a non-jury trial, the district court determined that defendant was liable for breach of warranty and awarded $57,152.76 damages for breach of warranty and consequential damages in the amount of $63,558.16. <em>Chatlos Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Corp., </em>479 F.Supp. 738 (D.N.J.1979), <em>aff\u2019d in part, remanded in part, </em>635 F.2d 1081 (3d Cir. 1980). Defendant appealed and this court affirmed the district court\u2019s findings of liability, set aside the award of consequential damages, and remanded for a recalculation of damages for breach of warranty. Cha<em>tlos Systems, Inc. v. National Cash Register Corp., </em>635 F.2d 1081 (3d Cir. 1980). On remand, applying the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d formula of N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12A:2-714(2) (Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-714(2)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court determined the damages to be $201,826.50,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which it added an award of pre-judgment interest. Defendant now appeals from these damage determinations, contending that the district court erred in failing to recognize the $46,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>020 contract price of the delivered NCR computer system as the fair market value of the goods as warranted, and that the award of damages is without support in the evidence presented. Appellant also contests the award of pre-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">Waiving the opportunity to submit additional evidence as to value on the remand which we directed, appellant chose to rely on the record of the original trial and submitted no expert testimony on the market value of a computer which would have performed the functions NCR had warranted. Notwithstanding our previous holding that contract price was not necessarily the same as market value, 635 F.2d at 1088, appellant faults the district judge for rejecting its contention that the contract price for the NCR 399/656 was the only competent record evidence of the value of the system as warranted. The district court relied instead on the testimony of plaintiff-appel-lee\u2019s expert, Dick Brandon, who, without estimating the value of an NCR model 399/656, presented his estimate of the value of a computer system that would perform all of the functions that the NCR 399/656 had been warranted to perform. Brandon did not limit his estimate to equipment of any one manufacturer; he testified regarding manufacturers who could have made systems that would perform the functions that appellant had warranted the NCR 399/656 could perform. He acknowledged that the systems about which he testified were not in the same price range as the NCR 399/656. Appellant likens this testimony to substituting a Rolls Royce for a Ford, and concludes that the district court\u2019s recomputed damage award was therefore clearly contrary to the evidence of fair market value \u2014 which in NCR\u2019s view is the contract price itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-14\">Appellee did not order, nor was it promised, merely a specific NCR computer model, but an NCR computer system with specified capabilities. The correct measure of damages, under N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12A:2\u2014 714(2), is the difference between the fair market value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted. Award of that sum is not confined to instances where there has been an increase in value between date of ordering and date of delivery. It may also include the benefit of a contract price which, for whatever reason quoted, was particularly favorable for the customer. Evidence of the contract price may be relevant to the issue of fair market value, but it is not controlling. <em>Mulvaney v. Tri State Truck &amp; Auto Body, Inc., </em>70 Wis.2d 760, 767, 235 N.W.2d 460, 465 (1975). Appellant limited its fair market value analysis to the contract price of the computer model it actually delivered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee developed evidence of the worth of a computer with the capabilities promised by NCR, and the trial court properly credited the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>Appellee was aided, moreover, by the testimony of Frank Hicks, NCR\u2019s programmer, who said that he told his company\u2019s officials that the \u201ccurrent software was not sufficient in order to deliver the program that the customer [Chatios] required. They would have to be rewritten or a different system would have to be given to the customer.\u201d Appendix to Brief for Appellee at 2.68. Hicks recommended that Chatios be given an NCR 8200 but was told, \u201cthat will not be done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.69. Gerald Greenstein, another NCR witness, admitted that the 8200 series was two levels above the 399 in sophistication and price. <em>Id. </em>at 14.30. This testimony supported Brandon\u2019s statement that the price of the hardware needed to perform Chatios\u2019 requirements would be in the $100,000 to $150,000 range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\">Essentially, then, the trial judge was confronted with the conflicting value estimates submitted by the parties. Chatios\u2019 expert\u2019s estimates were corroborated to some extent by NCR\u2019s supporters. NCR, on the other hand, chose to rely on contract price. Credibility determinations had to be made by the district judge. Although we might have come to a different conclusion on the value of the equipment as warranted had we been sitting as trial judges, we are not free to make our own credibility and factual findings. We may reverse the district court only if its factual determinations were clearly erroneous. <em>Krasnov v. Dinan, </em>465 F.2d 1298 (3d Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Upon reviewing the evidence of record, therefore, we conclude that the computation of damages for breach of warranty was not clearly erroneous. We hold also that the district court acted within its discretion in awarding pre-judgment interest, <em>Chatlos Systems, Inc. v. National Cash Register Corp., </em>635 F.2d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">. Section 12A:2-714(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-13\">The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1369-19\">. The district court found the fair market value of the system as warranted to be $207,826.50; from this it subtracted its determination of the value of the goods delivered, $6,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">. At oral argument, counsel for appellant responded to questions from the bench, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-6\">Judge Rosenn: Your position also is that you agree, number one, that the fair market value is the measure of damages here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-7\">Counsel for Appellant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-8\">Judge Rosenn: The fair market value you say, in the absence of other evidence to the contrary that is relevant, is the contract price. That is the evidence of fair market value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-9\">Counsel: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-10\">Judge Rosenn: Now seeing that had the expert or liad the plaintiff been able to establish testimony that there were other machines on the market that were similar to your machine\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-11\">Counsel: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-12\">Judge Rosenn: That the fair market value of those was $50,000, that would have been relevant evidence but it had to be the same machine \u2014 same type machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-16\">Counsel: Well, I would say that the measure of damages as indicated by the statute requires the same machine \u2014 \u201cthe goods\u201d \u2014 in an operable position.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1370-17\">. We find the following analogy, rather than the Rolls Royce-Ford analogy submitted by appellant, to be on point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-18\">Judge Weis: If you start thinking about a piece of equipment that is warranted to lift a thousand pounds and it will only lift 500 pounds, then the cost of something that will lift a thousand pounds gives you more of an idea and that may be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-19\">Counsel for Appellee: That may be a better analogy, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-20\">Judge Weis: Yes.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">. The dissent essentially is based on disagreement with the estimates provided by Chatios\u2019 expert, Brandon. The record reveals that he was well qualified; the weight to be given his testimony is the responsibility of the factfinder, not an appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1371-10\">ROSENN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAN3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">The primary question in this appeal involves the application of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by New Jersey in N.J.S.A. 12A:2-101 et seq. (1962) to the measure of damages for breach of warranty in the sale of a computer system. I respectfully dissent because I believe there is no probative evidence to support the district court\u2019s award of damages for the breach of warranty in a sum amounting to almost five times the purchase price of the goods. The measure of damages also has been misapplied and this could have a significant effect in the marketplace, especially for the unique and burgeoning computer industry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">In July 1974, National Cash Register Corporation (NCR) sold Chatios Systems, Inc. (Chatios), a NCR 399/656 disc computer system (NCR 399) for $46,020 (exclusive of 5 percent sales tax of $1,987.50). The price and system included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-13\">The computer (hardware)........ $40,165.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-14\">Software (consisting of 6 computer programs)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ................. 5,855.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-15\">$46,020.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-16\">NCR delivered the disc computer to Chat-ios in December 1974 and in March 1975 the payroll program became operational. By March of the following year, however, NCR was still unsuccessful in installing an operational order entry program and inventory deletion program. Moreover, on August 31, 1976, Chatios experienced problems with the payroll program. On that same day and the day following NCR installed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>operational state income tax program, but on September 1, 1976, Chatios demanded termination of the lease<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and removal of the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">When this case was previously before us, we upheld the district court\u2019s liability decision but remanded for a reassessment of damages, instructing the court that under the purchase contract and the law consequential damages could not be awarded. Consequential damages, therefore, are no longer an issue here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">On remand, the district court, on the basis of the previous record made in the case, fixed the fair market value of the NCR 399 as warranted at the time of its acceptance in August 1975 at $207,826.50. It reached that figure by valuing the hardware at $131,250.00 and the software at $76,575.50, for a total of $207,826.50. The court then determined that, the present value of the computer hardware, which Chatios retained, was $6,000. Putting no value on the accepted payroll program, the court deducted the $6,000 and arrived at an award of $201,-826.50 plus pre-judgment interest at the rate of 8 percent per annum from August 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">Chatios contends before this court, as it had before the district court on remand, that under its benefit of the bargain theory the fair market value of the goods as warranted was several times the purchase price of $46,020. As the purchaser, Chatios had the burden of proving the extent of the loss. <em>Council Brothers, Inc. v. Ray Burner Co., </em>473 F.2d 400, 408 (5th Cir. 1973). In remanding to the district court for a reassessment of the damages, we did not reject the contract price for the goods sold as the proper valuation of the computer as warranted. We merely corrected the district court\u2019s misconception that the language of the New Jersey statute precluded consideration of fair market value. We held that \u201cvalue\u201d in section 2-714(2) must mean fair market value at the time and place of acceptance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-11\"><em>It may be assumed </em>that <em>in many cases </em>fair market value and contract price are the same, and therefore, if a party wishes to show a difference between the two he should produce evidence to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajn-dedup-0\"><em>Chatlos Systems, Inc. v. National Cash Register Corp., </em>635 F.2d 1081, 1088 (3d Cir. 1980) (emphasis added) <em>on remand, </em>No. 77-2548 (D.N.J., filed Mar. 12,1981). Thus, the sole issue before us now is whether the district court erred in fixing the fair market value of the computer system as warranted at the time of the acceptance in August 1975 at $207,826.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">I believe that the district court committed legal error. The majority conclude that the standard of review of the district court\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the goods for the purpose of awarding damages is whether the trial judge\u2019s determination of market value is clearly erroneous. I disagree. Had the court merely miscalculated the amount of damages, I might agree with the majority\u2019s standard, for then our concern would be with basic facts. Here, however, no evidence was introduced as to the market value of the specific goods purchased and accepted had the system conformed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>warranty. Thus, the matter before us is one of legal error, and our standard of review is plenary. But even under the standard applied by the majority, the district court should be reversed because its determination of market value is not supported by probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">There are a number of major flaws in the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to prove damages in excess of the contract price. I commence with an analysis of plaintiff\u2019s basic theory. Chatios presented its case under a theory that although, as a sophisticated purchaser, it bargained for several months before arriving at a decision on the computer system it required and the price of $46,020, it is entitled, because of the breach of warranty, to damages predicated on a considerably more expensive system. Stated another way, even if it bargained for a cheap system, <em>i.e., </em>one whose low cost reflects its inferior quality, because that system did not perform as bargained for, it is now entitled to damages measured by the value of a system which, although capable of performing the identical functions as the NCR 399, is of far superior quality and accordingly more expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">The statutory measure of damages for breach of warranty specifically provides that the measure is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value \u201cof the goods accepted\u201d and the \u201cvalue they would have had if they had been as warranted.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The focus of the statute is upon \u201cthe goods accepted\u201d \u2014 not other hypothetical goods which may perform equivalent functions. \u201cMoreover, the value to be considered is the reasonable market value of the <em>goods delivered, </em>not the value of the goods to a particular purchaser or for a particular purpose.\u201d <em>KLPR-TV, Inc. v. Visual Electronics Corp., </em>465 F.2d 1382, 1387 (8th Cir. 1972) (emphasis added). The court, however, arrived at value on the basis of a hypothetical construction of a system as of December 1978 by the plaintiff\u2019s expert, Brandon. The court reached its value by working backward from Brandon\u2019s figures, adjusting for inflation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">In presenting its case Chatios developed its expert testimony as though it were seeking \u201ccover\u201d damages \u2014 the cost for the replacement of the computer system under section 2-712 of the statute. First, \u201ccover\u201d damages are obviously inappropriate here because both the district court and this court in its earlier decision held that the measure of damages is governed by section 2-714(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, Chatios did not \u201ccover\u201d in this case and, although there was testimony that it would use an IBM Series 1 mini-computer to perform the NCR 399 functions, the president of Chatios personally testified that the IBM \u201cwasn\u2019t purchased with intent to replace the 399 system at the time of purchase.\u201d Second, Chatios gave no evidence as to the cost of the IBM Series 1 computer system. However, under the applicable section of the statute, 2-714, the measure of damages is specifically confined to \u201cthe difference between the value of the <em>goods accepted </em>and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted\u201d and does not include \u201cthe difference between the cost of cover and the contract price\u201d as provided by section 2-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">Although NCR warranted performance, the failure of its equipment to perform, absent any evidence of the value of any NCR 399 system on which to base fair market value,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not permit a market value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>based on systems wholly unrelated to the goods sold. Yet, instead of addressing the fair market value of the NCR 399 had it been as warranted, Brandon addressed the fair market value of another system that he concocted by drawing on elements from other major computer systems manufactured by companies such as IBM, Burroughs, and Honeywell, which he considered would perform \u201cfunctions identical to those contracted for\u201d by Chatios. He conceded that the systems were \u201c[pjerhaps not within the same range of dollars that the bargain was involved with\u201d and he did not identify specific packages' of software. Brandon had no difficulty in arriving at the fair market value of the inoperable NCR equipment but instead of fixing a value on the system had it been operable attempted to fashion a hypothetical system on which he placed a value. The district court, in turn, erroneously adopted that value as the fair market value for an operable NCR 399 system. NCR rightly contends that the \u201ccomparable\u201d systems on which Brandon drew were substitute goods of greater technological power and capability and not acceptable in determining damages for breach of warranty under section 2-714. Furthermore, Brandon\u2019s hypothetical system did not exist and its valuation was largely speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">A review of Brandon\u2019s testimony reveals its legal inadequacy for establishing the market value of the system Chatios purchased from NCR. Brandon never testified to the fair market value which the NCR 399 system would have had had it met the warranty at the time of acceptance. He was not even asked the question. His testimony with respect to the programming or software <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was developed along the following line:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-6\">Q: Mr. Brandon, based upon your knowledge and experience in the field, are you aware of any other vendors in the computer industry \u25a0 who would have been able to supply a system, that is, hardware and software, which would provide the functions that were contemplated by the arrangement between NCR and Chatios Systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aka-dedup-1\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-10\">A: Yes, there are a number of other vendors who would have made or \u2022 could have made comparable systems available whose functions would be identical to those desired by Chatios or required by Chatios.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A90D\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-11\">Q: What, if you know, would have been the price of acquiring that similar system in September of 1976?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-13\">A: I made some estimates of cost of acquiring seven separate application components, the seven to which I have earlier testified. I made those estimates in December, 1978, at which time I estimated the cost to be approximately, in the aggregate, approximately $102,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-14\">His estimate of the cost of the hardware in 1976 was \u201cin the range of $100,000 to $150,-000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-15\">Not only did Brandon not testify in terms of the value of the NCR 399, but he spoke vaguely of \u201ca general estimate ... as to what the cost might be of, let\u2019s say, developing a payroll or purchasing a payroll package today and installing it at Chatios.\u201d He explained that what he would do, without identifying specific packages, would be to obtain price lists \u201cfrom the foremost organizations selling packages in our field, in that area,\u201d organizations such as Management Science of America in Atlanta, and take their prices for specific packages. When asked what packages he would use for this system, he replied, \u201cI would shop around, frankly.\u201d Speculating, he testified, \u201cI think that I would go to two or three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>alternatives in terms of obtaining packages.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When asked to address himself to the packages that he would provide for this system, he acknowledged that the programs he had in mind were only available \u201c[for] certain types of machines.\u201d For example, he conceded that these programs would not be available for the Series 1 IBM mini-computer, \u201cwith the possible exception of payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\">Thus, the shortcomings in Brandon\u2019s testimony defy common sense and the realities of the marketplace. First, ordinarily, the best evidence of fair market value is what a willing purchaser would pay in cash to a willing seller. <em>Vollmer </em>v. <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>350 Pa. 223, 38 A.2d 266, 269 (1944) (quoting <em>Hudson Coal Company\u2019s Appeal, </em>327 Pa. 247, 251, 193 A. 8, 10 (1937)); <em>Yara Engineering Corp. v. City of Newark, </em>136 N.J.Eq. 453, 42 A.2d 632, 638 (N.J. Ch. 1945). In the instant case we have clearly \u201cnot ... an unsophisticated consumer,\u201d <em>Chatlos Systems </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Corp., </em>479 F.Supp. 738, 748 (D.N.J.1979), <em>modified, </em>635 F.2d 1081 (3rd Cir. 1980), <em>on remand, </em>No. 77-2548 (D.N.J., filed Mar. 12, 1981), who for a considerable period of time negotiated and bargained with an experienced designer and vendor of computer systems. The price they agreed upon for an operable system would ordinarily be the best evidence of its value. The testimony does not present us with the situation referred to in our previous decision, where \u201cthe value of the goods rises between the time that the contract is executed and the time of acceptance,\u201d in which event the buyer is entitled to the benefit of his bargain. Cha<em>tlos, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 1088. On the contrary, Chatios here relies on an expert who has indulged in the widest kind of speculation. Based on this testimony, Chatios asserts in effect that a multi-national sophisticated vendor of computer equipment, despite months of negotiation, incredibly agreed to sell an operable computer system for $46,020 when, in fact, it had a fair market value of $207,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">Second, expert opinion may, of course, be utilized to prove market value but it must be reasonably grounded. Brandon did not testify to the fair market value \u201cof the <em>goods </em>accepted\u201d had they met the warranty. Instead, he testified about a hypothetical system that he mentally fashioned. He ignored the realistic cost advantage in purchasing a unified system as contrasted with the \u201ccost of acquiring seven separate application components\u201d from various vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">Third, in arriving at his figure of $102,-000 for the software, Brandon improperly included the time and cost of training the customer\u2019s personnel associated with the installation of the system. In a deposition prior to trial, Brandon testified that his valuation of the software included the time necessary to train Chatios\u2019 personnel in the use of the system. On direct examination at trial, he testified that the $102,000 value fixed for software and programming did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number><em>not </em>include the time and cost necessary to train Chatios\u2019 personnel in the use of the system, indicating that the cost of training a customer and his personnel is \u201cdefinitely\u201d not included in the price of programming and software. When confronted with his prior inconsistent deposition, he conceded that in his estimate of $102,000 \u201cwe included the Chatios time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Fourth, the record contains testimony which appears undisputed that computer equipment falls into one of several tiers, depending upon the degree of sophistication. The more sophisticated equipment has the capability of performing the functions of the least sophisticated equipment, but the less sophisticated equipment cannot perform all of the functions of those in higher levels. The price of the more technologically advanced equipment is obviously greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">It is undisputed that in September 1976 there were vendors of computer equipment of the same general size as the NCR 399/656 with disc in the price range of $35,000 to $40,000 capable of providing the same programs as those required by Chat-ios, including IBM, Phillips, and Burroughs. They were the very companies who competed for the sale of the computer in 1974 in the same price range. On the other hand, Chatios\u2019 requirements could also be satisfied by computers available at \u201cthree levels higher in price and sophistication than the 399 disc.\u201d Each level higher would mean more sophistication, greater capabilities, and more memory. Greenstein, NCR\u2019s expert, testified without contradiction that equipment of Burroughs, IBM, and other vendors in the price range of $100,000 to $150,000, capable of performing Chatios\u2019 requirements, was not comparable to the 399 because it was three levels higher. Such equipment was more comparable to the NCR 8400 series.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">Fifth, when it came to the valuation of the hardware, Brandon did not offer an opinion as to the market value of the hypothetical system he was proposing. Instead, he offered a wide ranging estimate of $100,000 to $150,000 for a hypothetical computer that would meet Chatios\u2019 programming requirements. The range in itself suggests the speculation in which he indulged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">The purpose of the N.J.S.A. 12A:2-714 is to put the buyer in the same position he would have been in if there had been no breach. <em>See </em>Uniform Commercial Code 1\u2014 106(1). The remedies for a breach of warranty were intended to compensate the buyer for his loss; they were not intended to give the purchaser a windfall or treasure trove. The buyer may not receive more than it bargained for; it may not obtain the value of a superior computer system which it did not purchase even though such a system can perform all of the functions the inferior system was designed to serve. Thus, in <em>Meyers v. Antone, </em>227 A.2d 56 (D.C.App.1967), the court held that where the buyers contracted for a properly functioning used oil heating system which proved defective, they were free to substitute a gas system (which they did), change over to forced air heating, or even experiment with a solar heating plant. \u201cThey could not, however, recover the cost of such systems. They contracted for a used oil system that would function properly, and can neither receive more than they bargained for nor be put in a better position than they would have been had the contract been fully performed. <em>Id. </em>at 59 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">This court, in directing consideration of fair market value as the starting point in deciding damages noted Chatios\u2019 contention that exclusive use of contract price deprives the dissatisfied buyer of the \u201cbenefit of his bargain.\u201d We accepted the concept of \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d and explicated our understanding of the concept as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>If the value of the goods rises between the time the contract is executed and the time of acceptance, the buyer should not lose the advantage of a favorable contract price because of the seller\u2019s breach of warranty. Conversely, if the value drops, the seller is entitled to the resulting lower computation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\"><em>Chatlos, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 1088. Ironically, this example of benefit of the bargain is actually based on contract price. If on the date of acceptance the fair market value of the goods has risen or declined from the contract price, that variation must be taken into account in awarding damages. But here plaintiff\u2019s market value figures, accepted by the district court on remand, have no connection whatsoever with the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">Although it may be that the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d concept is applicable to situations involving other than periodic fluctuations in market prices, the cases cited by Chatios stand only for the premise that the proved market value of the goods in question must be accepted. Thus, in <em>Melody Home Manufacturing Co. v. Morrison, </em>502 S.W.2d 196 (Tex.Civ.App.1973), where $5,300 was the price of a mobile home, the measure of damages for breach of warranty under U.C.C. \u00a7 2-714(2) was the difference between $2,000, the value of the delivered home, and $6,000 the proved market value of the particular home. In <em>Miles v. Lyons, </em>42 Mass.App.Dec. 77, 6 U.C.C.Rep. 659 (Dist.Ct.1969), the defendants (Lyons) sued for conversion of furniture, impleaded Anita Miles, former wife of the plaintiff, from whom they had purchased the furniture. Mrs. Miles had sold it to the Lyons for $100, falsely asserting it belonged to her. The justice found for the plaintiff in the amount of $275, the value of the furniture at the time of conversion, but he found for the Lyons as third-party plaintiffs for $100. On appeal, the finding of $100 was vacated and judgment entered for $275, the loss resulting from the seller\u2019s breach of warranty of title. The Lyons were entitled, the court held, to the benefit of their bargain and the measure of damages under section 2-714. The bargain consisted of the value of the specific furniture they purchased\u2014 not other hypothetical furniture constructed in superior fashion or of superior materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">Even if we were to accept plaintiff\u2019s theory that the value of other systems may be used to establish the value of the specific computer system purchased, the cases cited by Chatios to support its theory are distinguishable. In <em>Giant Food v. Jack I. Bender &amp; Sons, </em>399 A.2d 1293 (D.C.App.1979), when a seller, after three years, replaced carpet under warranty with new carpet of higher price, the buyer refused to pay the excess cost. The court agreed that the value of the replacement carpet represented the buyer\u2019s damages. However, the appellate court expressly noted that \u201c[t]he trial court implicitly found that the <em>replacement </em>was a reasonable one \u2014 i.e., it was of substantially the same style, goods and character as that for which [the buyer] had originally contracted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306 n.26 (emphasis added). In the instant case, there was no testimony that the hypothetical system \u2014 apart from its ability to perform identical functions\u2014 was otherwise the same. Furthermore, as distinguished from this case, the goods were <em>actually replaced </em>by the seller. In <em>Huyett-Smith Manufacturing Co. v. Gray, </em>129 N.C. 438, 40 S.E. 178 (1901), a pre-Code case, the vendor of a kiln represented that it had a capacity in excess of any kiln on the market. In measuring the damages claimed by the purchaser the court would not fix damages in excess of the contract by looking to a non-existent kiln stating that the purchaser \u201cis not entitled to speculative damages for an ideal machine which was not on the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">Because Brandon\u2019s testimony does not support Chatios\u2019 grossly extravagant claim of the fair market value of the NCR 399 at the time of its acceptance, the only evidence of the market value at the time is the price negotiated by the parties for the NCR computer system as warranted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-10\">There are- many eases in which the goods will be irreparable or not replaceable and therefore the costs of repair or replacement can not serve as a yardstick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>of the buyer\u2019s damages. . . . When fair market value cannot be easily determined . . . the purchase price may turn out to be strong evidence of the value of the goods as warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 10-2, at 380 (2d ed. 1980) (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Accord Auto-Teria, Inc. v. Ahern, </em>170 Ind.App. 84, 352 N.E.2d 774, 783 (1976). In <em>Long v. Quality Mobile Home Brokers, Inc., </em>271 S.C. 482, 248 S.E.2d 311 (1978), the court applied section 2-714(2) of the U.C.C. to arrive at a measure of damages for breach of warranty. Noting that \u201cvalue\u201d as used in that section meant \u201cfair market value,\u201d it asserted that \u201cthe cash price paid for goods is prima facie the value of the goods as warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>248 S.E.2d at 312. <em>White &amp; Summers, supra, </em>at 382, also remind us that \u201cthe value of goods <em>as warranted </em>will seldom be in dispute, for the contract price will be a powerful measure of that end of the formula.\u201d (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">Thus, where there is no proof that market value of the goods differs from the contract price, the contract price will govern, cf. <em>Gulf Chemical &amp; Metallurgical Corp. v. Sylvan Chemical Corp., </em>122 N.J.Super. 499, 505, 300 A.2d 878, 882 (Law Div.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>126 N.J.Super. 261, 314 A.2d 73 (App.Div.1973), <em>certification denied, </em>64 N.J. 507, 317 A.2d 720 (1974) (party not entitled under N.J.S.A. 12A:2-713(1) to damages based on the benefit of his bargain, <em>i.e., </em>the difference between the contract price and the market price when \u201cthere is no proof . . . that the market price for the goods purchased was any different than the price contracted for .... \u201d), and in this case that amounts to $46,020. Chatios has retained the system hardware and the district court fixed its present value in the open market at $6,000. The court properly deducted this sum from the damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-10\">Chatios purchased the NCR payroll program and acknowledged at trial that the program operated fully and satisfactorily beginning February or March 1975 until October 1978 when it discontinued its use. The district court assigned no value to it because there was no evidence of fair market value. However, the law is clear that without evidence of a value other than contract price, that price should be accepted as the fair market value of the payroll program. The parties agreed on a contract price of $1,000 and that sum should be deducted from the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-12\">NCR complains that the award of prejudgment interest is impermissible under New Jersey law. On remand, the district court awarded prejudgment interest from August 1975 but offered no explanation for so doing. Congress has not provided for prejudgment interest but has provided that interest on a money judgment recovered in a district court in a civil case shall be allowed and \u201cshall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment, at the rate allowed by State law.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1961 (1959). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.App.P. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-13\">In <em>Buono Sales, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>449 F.2d 715 (3d Cir. 1971), the plaintiff also claimed that it was entitled to prejudgment interest under New Jersey law for a breach of contract. In writing for this court, Chief Judge Seitz stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-14\">Under New Jersey law, a successful plaintiff in an action for breach of contract is not entitled to prejudgment inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>est as a matter of right where damages are unliquidated. Indeed, the rule appears to be that, unless considerations of justice and fair dealing clearly demand a different result, \u201cinterest should not be allowed where the damages are unliquidated and not capable of ascertainment by mere computation, or where a serious and substantial controversy exists as to the amount due under a contract.\u201d <em>Jardine Estates, Inc. v. Donna Brook Corp., </em>42 N.J.Super. 332, 341, 126 A.2d 372, 377 (App.Div.1956); ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 723. This case too involves a breach of contract and unliquidated damages. In light of its history and the nature of the very appeal, there can be no doubt that a substantial controversy existed over liability and damages. The trial judge made no finding that considerations of justice and fair dealing demanded an award of prejudgment interest. On the contrary, the judge found that plaintiff had not proved fraud on NCR\u2019s part and found that it had acted fairly and in good faith with Chatios during the entire course of their dealings. When we previously considered the issue of liability, we concluded \u201c[n]o evidence of wrongful intent on the part of NCR was found, nor did the plaintiff prove fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Chatlos supra, </em>635 F.2d at 1084. We also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-5\">[I]t is worth mentioning that even though unsuccessful in correcting the problems within an appropriate time, NCR continued in its efforts. Indeed, on the date of termination NCR was still actively working on the system at the Chatios plant. In fact, the trial court thought that Chat-ios should have cooperated further by accepting the installation of the programs. This is not a case where the seller acted unreasonably or in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1087 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">I have examined the cases cited by Chat-ios in support of the award and find them inapposite. Thus, I conclude that under New Jersey law Chatios is not entitled to prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">On this record, therefore, the damages to which plaintiff is entitled are $46,020 less $6,000, the fair market value at time of trial of the retained hardware, and less $1,000, the fair market value of the payroll program, or the net sum of $39,020.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the district court and direct it to enter judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $39,020 with interest from the date of entry of the initial judgment at the rate allowed by state law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">. Plaintiff\u2019s expert, Brandon, testified that generally 40 percent of all computer installations result in failures. He further testified that successful installations of computer systems require not only the computer companies\u2019 attention but also the attention of the customers\u2019 top management.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1371-18\">. The six basic computer programs were; (1) accounts receivable, (2) payroll, (3) order entry, (4) inventory deletion, (5) state income tax, and (6) cash receipts. The contract price also included installation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">. Chatios decided to lease the system rather than purchase it outright. To permit this arrangement, NCR sold the system to Mid Atlantic National Bank in July 1975 for $46,020, which leased the system to Chatios. Chatios made monthly payments to Mid Atlantic in amounts which would have totaled $70,162.09 over the period of the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">. Besides rejecting the district court\u2019s award of consequential damages, this court on the previous appeal disagreed with the district court\u2019s starting point of $70,162.22, the amount Chat-los obligated itself to pay the bank, for two reasons: (1) the price Chatios paid the bank included the bank\u2019s finance charges which should have been excluded, and (2) the district court erred in refusing to consider Chatios\u2019 evidence of fair market value, which is the starting point for determining damages under section 2-714(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1372-16\">. August 1975 represents the acceptance date. It is the date the finance company paid NCR and leased the computer system to Chatios.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">. The measure of damages is not an issue. Since Chatios accepted the computer system, the measure of damages is set out in N.J.S.A. 12A:2-714 \u201cBuyer\u2019s Damages for Breach in Regard to Accepted Goods.\u201d The relevant subsection is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-7\">(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference . . . between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1373-13\">. \u201cCover\u201d damages are not available for goods purchased except under the provisions of N.J. S.A. 12A:2 \u2014 711 and 712 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1373-14\">. There is evidence that the NCR 399 model had been installed at a number of customer sites prior to the Chatios installation. See plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">. By working backwards and factoring 15 to 20 percent for inflation, Brandon attempted to fix a value on the software as of September 1976. But under the statute, the valuation date is the \u201ctime of acceptance\u201d and it is undisputed that took place over a year earlier \u2014 August 1975. The court adjusted for inflation back to August 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">. The speculative nature of his estimate is revealed by his reply on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-6\">Q: Now, your estimate of $103,000 was based on the use of what packages, payroll, accounts receivable, order entry, inventory control, etcetera; what packages did you include in your estimate of $102,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-7\">A. I assumed that we would be able to obtain through competitive bidding packages from vendors in the computer field to meet most of these requirements, if not all of those requirements, and that to the extent that we could not meet the Chatios requirements they could be modified by a programmer to meet those requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-8\">Q. Do you know or did you make an estimate of the purchase price for the various programs that you have told us about, packages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-12\">A. I only made estimates, sir, because no decision as to machine is available, therefore, it is impossible to go out and shop for specific packages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-13\">Q. Does the cost of a package depend on the machine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-14\">A. In part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-15\">Q. You estimated a cost of $102,000 but you don\u2019t know how much the packages cost; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-16\">A. Well, I did obtain some estimates of packages from, as I mentioned the foremost package sales organization in the country, just so that I would have a basis for making sure that my numbers were not unreasonable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">.

Philadelphia Eagles Football Club, </em>595 F.2d 1265, 1286-87 (3d Cir. 1979) (in banc) (Aldisert, J., dissenting). In this case, however, the majority\u2019s holding, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>endorses a measure of damages that is based on what appears to be a new interpretation of New Jersey\u2019s commercial law, involves a construction of the Uniform Commercial Code as well. Rectification of any error in our interpretation is, because of the national application of the Uniform Commercial Code, significantly more difficult than it would be if New Jersey law alone were implicated. \u25a0Moreover, the provision of the Uniform Commercial Code involved here is of unusual importance: the measure of damages approved by this Court may create large monetary risks and obligations in a wide range of commercial transactions, including specifically the present burgeoning computer industry. Because there would appear to be considerable force to the dissenting opinion of Judge Rosenn and because I believe that the principle articulated by the majority should be reviewed by the entire Court before it is finally adopted, I would grant the petition for rehearing in banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">JAMES HUNTER, III and GARTH, Circuit Judges join in this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">BY THE COURT,</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">RUGGERO J.
