The appellees are the Community for Creative Non-Violence (\u201cCCNV\u201d), an unincorporated religious association working on behalf of homeless persons, and ten named individuals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the fall of 1981, the appellees applied to the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, for a permit to hold a demonstration in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, from November 26, 1981 through March 20, 1982, as a means of calling attention to the plight of homeless persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The application indicated that CCNV would provide the demonstration participants with shelter, in the form of tents, sleeping bags and blankets; meals, either in its drop-in centers or in the Park; and all necessary sanitation facilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By letter dated September 30, 1981, the Park Service denied this application, citing 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.27.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That Park Service regulation restricts \u201ccamping\u201d to areas designated by the Superintendent of National Capital Parks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lafayette Park is admittedly not so designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-20\">Following receipt of this denial, the ap-pellees filed suit in the District Court seeking to enjoin the National Park Service from denying them permission to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>strate in the manner sought,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and moved for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By order dated November 25,1981, the District Court denied this motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">On November 30, the National Park Service granted the appellees a permit for a seven-day demonstration in Lafayette Park.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This permit excluded any use of the area for camping or living accommodations, but did provide for the erection of nine \u201csymbolic\u201d tents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Apparently, permission for this latter activity was granted pursuant to 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(8), which provides that \u201c[i]n connection with permitted demonstrations or special events, temporary structures . . . shall be permitted.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">On December 17, the appellees moved in the District Court for summary judgment on their complaint and for entry of a permanent injunction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In response the Government moved for summary judgment or dismissal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The District Court, following arguments, denied the Government\u2019s motion and granted the appellees\u2019 motion in part.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The District Court order provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-14\">Plaintiffs are entitled to sleep in the nine (9) tents which plaintiffs have placed in Lafayette Park pursuant to a valid permit issued by defendants. Plaintiffs are not entitled to engage in \u201ccamping activities,\u201d such as the preparation or service of food in Lafayette Park. . . .<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AACl\">The District Court stayed the judgment and injunction pending the Government\u2019s appeal to this court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">The appellees have not challenged that portion of the District Court order prohibiting them from engaging in camping activities such as the preparation or service of food; we are thus concerned only with the appellees\u2019 ability to sleep in the nine tents during the course of their demonstration. At oral argument before this court, counsel for the Government acknowledged that Park Service regulations do not prohibit sleeping <em>per se. </em>Counsel also admitted that the appellees are not prohibited from maintaining a continuous presence in and around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>the symbolic tents now standing in the Park, or from placing either cots or blankets inside those tents. Indeed, as counsel for the Government also conceded, the ap-pellees may, without violating any regulations, lie down on a cot or blanket inside a tent; they simply may not fall asleep. Thus, the issue presented for resolution is necessarily narrow. We need only decide whether the Park Service regulations prohibiting camping in all but designated areas <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> properly encompass the sleeping activities proposed by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Only two months ago, the National Park Service issued amendments to its regulations governing demonstrations and special events in and around Washington, D.C., and an Administrative Policy Statement interpreting those regulations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In construing the Park Service\u2019s regulations, we are guided by the principle that a court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute or a regulation if a construction is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We need not strain to find that saving construction here, because we believe that the Park Service\u2019s regulations plainly allow the appellees to sleep in the tents as an intrinsic part of their protest against governmental policies which they allege contribute to their lack of shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">It is axiomatic that an agency is bound by its own rules and policies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, in interpreting an agency\u2019s regulations, a court may rely upon the agency\u2019s contemporaneously issued Policy Statement as an accurate representation of the agency\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In this case, the National Park Service\u2019s Administrative Policy Statement accompanying the changes to 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19 was in fact \u201cintended ... to clarify and simplify the regulatory system.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Policy Statement describes the scope of section 50.19(e)(8) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0r\">Camping is prohibited in all park areas except those specially designated as official campsites (36 CFR 50.27). <em>The National Park Service does permit the use of symbolic campsites reasonably related to First Amendment activities. However, camping primarily for living accommodation must be confined to designated </em>campsites<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-12\">This Policy Statement, likely reflecting the Park Service\u2019s view of what is required by the First Amendment, makes a clear distinction between \u201cthe use of symbolic campsites reasonably related to First Amendment activities\u201d and \u201ccamping primarily for living accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-13\">We have no doubt as to which category encompasses the activities in question here. First, the appellees are engaged in a political protest and a petition for redress of grievances. As part of their protest, the appellees desire permission to sleep in their tents in Lafayette Park. This appears to be no more than \u201cthe <em>use </em>of [a] symbolic campsiteQ.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, as the District Court found,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in this case sleeping itself may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>express the message that these persons are homeless and so have nowhere else to go.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">Second, there is no evidence in the Record suggesting that the handful of tents in Lafayette Park is intended \u201cprimarily for living accommodation.\u201d The appellees will not prepare or serve food there; they will not build fires or break ground; they will not establish sanitary or medical facilities. Indeed, the uncontroverted evidence in the case is that the purpose of the symbolic campsite in Lafayette Park is \u201cprimarily\u201d to express the protesters\u2019 message and not to serve as a temporary solution to the problems of homeless persons.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, the only activity at issue here \u2014 sleeping in already erected symbolic tents \u2014 cannot be considered \u201ccamping\u201d proscribed by 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find it clear from the Record before us and from the National Park Service\u2019s Administrative Policy Statement that these protesters may lawfully sleep in their symbolic campsite. That conclusion necessarily follows from the National Park Service\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On this basis, the order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">Before ROBINSON, Chief Judge, and WRIGHT, TAMM, MacKINNON, ROBB, WILKEY, WALD, MIKVA, EDWARDS and GINSBURG, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"alm-dedup-0\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"A9J7\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">A member of the Court has <em>sua sponte </em>suggested consideration of this case by the <em>en banc </em>Court.

Quaker Action Group, </em>402 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 1398, 28 L.Ed.2d 665 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-15\">What appears in the court\u2019s decision to be a limited holding to enable demonstrators to \u201csleep[] in already erected <em>symbolic </em>tents\u201d for a limited period of time in reality extends to the appellants a defeasible right to indefinite occupancy at Lafayette Park. Although not readily apparent from a casual reading of the court\u2019s memorandum, <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Watt, </em>670 F.2d 1213 (D.C. Cir. 1982) [hereinafter <em>Memo, </em>at 1217.], the court has reached this result by ignoring the controlling precedent on point and by manipulating a National Park Service policy statement to support its conclusion. This decision opens the door for virtually any group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>of demonstrators in presumed furtherance of First Amendment rights to convert national monuments, symbols, and grounds into sites for sleeping accommodations of indefinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">This is not a case of first impression in this circuit. At least twice before this court has interpreted regulation 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.-27(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prohibits camping in areas not designated for such use by the Superintendent of National Capital Parks. In 1971 the Department of Justice obtained an injunction against the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, prohibiting them from establishing a base camp on the Mall in connection with a proposed upcoming demonstration. <em>Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Etc. v. Morton, </em>506 F.2d 53, 56 n.9 (D.C.Cir.1974). The district court\u2019s order there defined the terms \u201covernight camping\u201d and \u201ccampsite\u201d as <em>\u201csleeping activities, or making preparations to sleep </em>(including the laying down of bedrolls or other bedding), <em>or </em>making any fire, <em>erecting any shelter, tent or other sleeping accommodation structure, or </em>doing any digging or earth breaking, or carrying on any cooking activities. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) After argument on the Veterans\u2019 motion for summary reversal, this court modified the district court\u2019s order to permit the Veterans to use their demonstration campsite \u201cfor the purpose of sleeping in their own equipment, such as sleeping bags, on that portion of the Mall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The following day, Chief Justice Burger, as Circuit Justice for this circuit, vacated this court\u2019s order and reinstated the district court\u2019s prohibitory injunction. <em>Id. The next day, the full Supreme Court upheld the Chief Justice, vacating this court\u2019s order which permitted sleeping and reinstating \u201cwith full force and effect\u201d the injunction of the district court. Morton v. Quaker Action Group, </em>402 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 1398, 28 L.Ed.2d 665 (1971) (Justice Douglas not participating); <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Vietnam Veterans, supra, </em>506 F.2d at 56 n.9. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling controls this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">Three years later in 1974 the Vietnam Veterans Against the War/Winter Soldiers Organization filed suit in the local federal district court to enjoin the Superintendent 'of National Capital Parks from withholding from them a permit to establish a \u201csymbolic campsite\u201d on the Mall as part of an upcoming demonstration. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted the Veterans\u2019 motion and ordered the Superintendent to allow the Veterans to <em>encamp </em>around the clock for a four-day period. On the same day the government moved this court for summary reversal of the district court\u2019s order. This court granted summary reversal of the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>order on the specific ground that it violated the Supreme Court\u2019s 1971 decision concerning the same litigants and the same legal issues. This court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-5\">By its order of 21 June 1971, reinstating (after a reversal by this court) District Judge Hart\u2019s injunction forbidding the VVAW from camping on the same part of the Mall, the Supreme Court accepted the finding of Judge Hart that <em>overnight camping was not activity within the purview of the First Amendment and that the blanket ban on camping in nondesig-nated areas was a reasonable exercise of supervisory authority over the public parkland. We </em>are bound by that determination. Since appellees herein seek nothing beyond that which the Supreme Court denied them in 1971, the appellant Government officials are entitled to summary judgment on remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\"><em>Vietnam Veterans, supra, </em>506 F.2d at 53, 56 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">One of the legal issues involved in the district court\u2019s 1974 order was the granting of permission for \u201cthe laying down of bedrolls and the sleeping aspects of the plaintiffs\u2019 [i.e. the Veterans\u2019] proposed nighttime activities . . . .without breaking ground, building fires, cooking, or pitching tents.\u201d <em>Vietnam Veterans Against the War v. Morton, </em>379 F.Supp. 9, 12 (D.D.C.1974). As was the case with the district court\u2019s 1974 order, the order of the district court here attempts somehow to distinguish <em>sleeping </em>from <em>camping </em>so as to permit <em>overnight sleeping </em>while not running afoul of the clear pronouncement of this court and the Supreme Court in the <em>Vietnam Veterans </em>cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-8\">Again, the Court emphasizes that what it is permitting is not camping; it is permission and a declaratory judgment to use the facilities now permitted by the Park Service [i.e. tents] <em>for sleeping accommodations and no more.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-9\">This declaration by this court is not at variance with the decision of the Court of Appeals in Vietnam War Veterans v. Morton, nor any pronouncement of the Supreme Court of the United States, including Morton v. Quaker Action Group, insofar as this court is aware. Otherwise, it would not do what it declared it will do and about which there can be no reasonable dispute as to any material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">(A. 307, 308.) (emphasis added); <em>See The Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Watt, </em>No. 81-2844 (D.D.C. Dec. 23, 1981) (A. 313-14). This attempt to distinguish our prior decisions cannot be supported because sleeping in a tent is \u201ccamping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">The factual similarities among the cases in 1971, 1974 and now are striking. In all cases the demonstrators sought permission to <em>sleep </em>in areas not designated by the Superintendent as official campsites. They claim the same nexus between overnight sleeping and the underlying purposes of their demonstrations. The wording of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.27(a) has remained unchanged in the intervening years. Thus, given essentially the same factual setting how can a different result be reached? The legal question presented here is precisely the same one addressed by earlier courts, especially in <em>Quaker Action Group, supra </em>\u2014 mention of which is conspicuously absent in the court\u2019s memorandum decision here \u2014 : \u201c[W]hether the Park Service regulations prohibiting camping in all but designated areas properly encompass the sleeping activities proposed by the appellees.\u201d <em>Memo. </em>at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">Faced with the unchanged language of the regulation prohibiting camping in non-designated areas and the binding judicial precedents upholding it, the court was hard put to find some new imaginative basis for its decision to separate overnight sleeping from camping. The court claims that its decision can be supported by a recently issued National Park Service Administrative Policy Statement (Policy Statement) which accompanied amendments to the Service\u2019s regulations governing demonstrations and special events in and around Washington, D.C., 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19 (1980), <em>as amended </em>46 Fed.Reg. 55,959 (Nov. 13,1981). The court claims that the Policy Statement supports its construction of the Service\u2019s regulations. <em>Memo, </em>at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>The crucial language from the Policy Statement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-4\">Camping is prohibited in all park areas except those specially designated as official campsites (36 CFR 50.27). The National Park Service does permit the use of symbolic campsites reasonably related to First Amendment activities. However, camping primarily for living accommodation must be confined to designated campsites.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">46 Fed.Reg. 55,961 (Nov. 13, 1981). The court asserts that this brief excerpt makes \u201ca clear distinction\u201d between \u201cthe use of symbolic campsites reasonably related to First Amendment activities\u201d (allowed in all park areas) and \u201ccamping primarily for living accommodation\u201d (confined to designated campsites). Seizing upon this latter phrase \u201cprimarily for living accommodation\u201d the court by inference concludes that mere <em>sleeping </em>in tents does not amount to occupancy of the area \u201cprimarily for living accommodation\u201d because no food is served or prepared, no fires are built, no ground is broken, and no sanitary or medical facilities are established. <em>Memo </em>at 1217. This is directly contrary to the specific provisions of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">If the statement \u201ccamping primarily for living accommodation must be confined to designated campsites\u201d were the only expression available on the question of whether \u201ccamping\u201d encompasses \u201csleeping,\u201d then the court\u2019s inference might be reasonable. But it is not. The fact is that the court\u2019s interpretation blatantly ignores (1) precedent of the Supreme Court and this court to the contrary, (2) <em>the plain language of the Service\u2019s regulations, </em>and (3) other pertinent portions of the Service\u2019s Policy Statement. When appropriate consideration is given to these weightier sources of authority, the court\u2019s conclusion allowing demonstrators to sleep in tents in areas not designated as official campsites emerges as an unsound construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">This court in <em>Quaker Action Group, supra, </em>and the district court in <em>Vietnam Veterans, supra, </em>379 F.Supp. 9, attempted to circumvent the regulatory ban against camping in areas not designated as official campsites by ordering that at least <em>overnight sleeping </em>be allowed. As is the case here, the veterans group in those two cases attempted to articulate a nexus between their request for overnight camping and the purposes underlying their demonstrations. The decision of the Supreme Court in the former case and this, court in the latter case specifically rejected those interpretations and made the ban against camping a <em>complete </em>one that <em>specifically prohibited overnight sleeping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">The language of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.27(a) clearly states that camping is permitted only in designated campsites. There is no indication whatever in that specific, affirmative declaration that overnight sleeping in tents does not fall within the meaning of \u201ccamping.\u201d Indeed the common understanding of the word and the district court definition which was reinstated \u201cwith full force and effect\u201d by the Supreme Court in <em>Quaker Action Group, supra, (see Vietnam Veterans, supra, </em>506 F.2d at 59) leave no doubt that <em>\u201ccamping\u201d includes overnight sleeping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">The Service\u2019s Administrative Policy Statement reiterates that \u201c[cjamping is prohibited in all park areas except those specially designated as official campsites.\u201d 46 Fed.Reg. 55,961 (Nov. 13, 1981) (emphasis added). That is a flat prohibition. The next sentence indicates that the Service \u201cdoes permit the use of <em>symbolic campsites </em>reasonably related to First Amendment activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) The court pays little attention to the term \u201csymbolic campsite.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In common parlance, a <em>symbolic </em>campsite is distinguished from an <em>actual </em>campsite by the fact that the latter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>actually occupied and used for overnight sleeping (or by <em>possibly </em>cooking, or eating, or ground breaking, or fire building and so forth). In contrast a <em>symbolic campsite </em>is only erected to give the appearance of occupancy. If the campsite were for actual occupancy it would cease to be symbolic in the sense intended by the regulations. In short, the court\u2019s construction has the effect of reading the word \u201csymbolic\u201d completely out of the Service\u2019s policy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">It is significant that the Service\u2019s statement about permissible \u201csymbolic campsites\u201d is immediately preceded by a reference to 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(8) which permits structures to be used in the conduct of demonstrations and special events. The Service \u201cpermits all groups to <em>erect </em>structures, props and displays\u201d as used in connection with government-sponsored events. 46 Fed.Reg. 55,961 (Nov. 13, 1981). When plaintiffs/appellees originally applied for a demonstration permit on November 30, 1981, they specifically proposed the <em>\u201cerection of symbolic </em>tents to focus on the need for shelter for homeless persons . . . . \u201d (A. 79-82.) (emphasis added) The Service granted permission for the demonstrators to <em>erect </em>tents as structures for a <em>symbolic </em>purpose, <em>not </em>to actually accommodate overnight sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">Hence, the judicial precedent, the regulatory language and its accompanying policy statement clearly show that the Service has eonsistently banned camping and overnight sleeping in areas other than officially designated campsites. The court\u2019s attempt to reach a different conclusion by relying upon strained inferences flies into the face of controlling judicial precedent and a reasonable interpretation of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">Finally, the mischief created by the court\u2019s' decision is that it opens the door for any group of demonstrators to gain in effect a defeasible right to indefinite occupation of national monument grounds or other areas administered by the Service. In the instant case, 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(5) (1980) directs that permits for Lafayette Park, which is considered part of the White House area, not exceed seven days. This regulation also provides that the permit \u201cperiods shall be extended for demonstrations only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The only stated basis in the regulation for the Service withholding a renewal request is the situation where \u201canother application requests use of the particular area and said application precludes double occupancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the court\u2019s ruling those sleeping in the tents in Lafayette Park have in effect received a right of indefinite occupation to Lafayette Park which will not be interrupted unless either another group of demonstrators apply for the same location or the Service revokes the permit on a regulatory ground.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">The court\u2019s own decision in this matter openly acknowledges that the occupation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Lafayette Park by plaintiffs/appellees is intended to run through the entire winter and could continue indefinitely if the demonstrators choose to pursue the option set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That result thus violates the binding Supreme Court precedent established in <em>Morton v.
