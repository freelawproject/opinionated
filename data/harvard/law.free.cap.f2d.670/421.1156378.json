In <em>Larry V. Muko, Inc. v. Southwestern Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council, </em>609 F.2d 1368 (3d Cir. 1979) <em>[Muko </em>I], this Court, sitting <em>in Banc, </em>reversed a district court order granting defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and remanded the case for a new trial. The second trial resulted in a jury verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff once again has appealed to this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Long John Silver\u2019s, Inc. (\u201cSilver\u2019s\u201d), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, operates fast food seafood restaurants in several markets across the United States. In 1973, it decided to enter the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania market, and contracted with Larry V. Muko, Inc. (\u201cMuko\u201d), a non-union general contractor experienced in constructing fast food restaurants, to build its first outlet in Monroe-ville, a suburb of Pittsburgh. After completion of the Monroeville restaurant, Silver\u2019s president Jim Patterson met with Larry Muko and indicated his willingness to give future construction business to Muko if his prices remained competitive and the quality of his construction remained good. Muko was awarded a contract to build a second restaurant in Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania, but Silver\u2019s did not commit itself any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">During construction of the Monroeville restaurant, two labor organizations, the Southwestern Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council and the Building and Construction Trades Council of Pittsburgh (the \u201cCouncils\u201d), picketed the site. After completion of construction, handbills were distributed to customers of the Monroeville restaurant urging them not to patronize Silver\u2019s because the chain used \u201ccontractors who are paying less than the established prevailing wages in the area.\u201d Appendix at 115a. The handbill exhorted the customers \u201cto protect the living and working standards established by the Building Trades Council.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Silver\u2019s management was alarmed when it was informed that customers were leaving the premises after reading the handbill. In response to the leafletting, Silver\u2019s arranged a meeting with the Building Trades Councils. After the meeting, Silver\u2019s vice-president sent a letter to the Councils emphasizing the company\u2019s \u201cdesire to establish good working relationships with the unions in the Greater Pittsburgh Area\u201d and stating Silver\u2019s \u201cintent ... to use only union contractors certified by the [Councils]\u201d in the future. The letter concluded: \u201cIn any relationship between two parties there must be mutual need and assistance. ... It is . . . extremely important to both parties that our location at Monroeville, Pennsylvania and the one under construction in Low-, er Burrell Township, Pennsylvania not be subjected to any kind of informational pick- . eting.\u201d Appendix at 116a-117a.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">Subsequently, Silver\u2019s employed only unionized general contractors to build its Pittsburgh-area restaurants, although the general contractors were free to use nonunion subcontractors. Silver\u2019s discussed with Muko the question whether Muko would be willing to bid on the construction . of its restaurants as a union firm. Muko declined to build under such circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>however, and it was not awarded any of Silver\u2019s contracts after the construction of the Lower Burrell restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On August 12, 1975, Muko filed the present lawsuit against Silver\u2019s and the two Councils, alleging that the defendants had entered into an agreement to award contracts for the construction of Silver\u2019s restaurants in the Pittsburgh area only to union contractors. This, claimed Muko, was an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act and sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act. After Muko presented its case at a jury trial held on July 19-20, 1977, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict. The directed verdict apparently was granted \u201cbecause the court believed the evidence could sustain no finding other than a unilateral decision on the part of Silver\u2019s to accept bids only from union contractors.\u201d 609 F.2d at 1372. On appeal, this Court, sitting <em>in banc, </em>reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. 609 F.2d 1368. We held that the jury could have found an agreement between Silver\u2019s and the Councils that was not exempt from antitrust scrutiny because, under the standards set forth in <em>Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 100, </em>421 U.S. 616, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975), such an agreement might have \u201cactual or potential anticompetitive effects that would not flow naturally from the elimination of competition over wages and working conditions.\u201d 609 F.2d at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Upon remand, a bifurcated jury trial on issues of liability and damages took place. At the close of the evidence on liability, the district court submitted four special interrogatories to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">1. Did Long John Silver\u2019s and the Trade Councils enter into an agreement or combination to refuse to grant construction contracts to non-union builders, including Muko?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">Answer: YES_ NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">If your answer to question 1. is NO, go no further. If your answer to question 1. is YES, go on to question 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">2. Was the effect of the agreement between Long John Silver\u2019s and the Trade Councils to impose a restraint on free competition beyond that which would follow from the elimination of competition based on wage rates and working conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">Answer: YES_ NO-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">If your answer to question 2. is NO, go no further. If your answer to question 2. is YES, go on to question 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">3. Was the agreement between Long John Silver\u2019s and the Trade Councils an unreasonable restraint of trade under the standards given you by the court in its instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">Answer: YES_ NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">If your answer to question 3. is NO, go no further. If your answer to question 3. is YES, go on to question 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-15\">4. Did the agreement between Long John Silver\u2019s and the Trade Councils cause injury to the plaintiff in his business or property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-16\">Answer: YES. NO_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">On February 17, 1981, the jury returned its verdict, answering \u201cYes\u201d to Interrogatories 1 and 2 and \u201cNo\u201d to Interrogatory 3. The jury thus found that the defendants had reached an agreement, outside the labor exemption, to exclude Muko as a competitor for Silver\u2019s construction work. Because the jury concluded that the agreement was not an unreasonable restraint of trade, however, the district court entered judgment for the defendants. The district court subsequently denied Muko\u2019s motion for a new trial and denied defendants\u2019 conditional motions for judgment n. o. v. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">Muko challenges two aspects of the district court proceeding. First, it claims that the trial judge erred as a matter of law when he instructed the jury to apply the rule of reason, rather than the <em>per se </em>standard, to the agreement at issue. Second, it argues that, even if the district judge was correct in applying the rule of reason, he erred in his instructions on the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>product market. We disagree with both contentions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In the earlier <em>in banc </em>opinion in this case, we declined to decide the proper standard by which to measure any potential antitrust violation. We intimated, however, that traditional antitrust principles would govern such a determination by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aux-dedup-0\">The jury might have found a concerted refusal to deal with a class of contractors of which Muko is a member. But whether the evidence here is viewed as capable of sustaining a finding of a group boycott, to which a <em>per se </em>rule would apply, or some lesser restraint to which a rule of reason analysis might apply, it was sufficient to take Muko\u2019s case to the jury. We have no occasion on this record to rule on whether, after hearing the defendants\u2019 evidence as well, the court should instruct the jury that it should measure the agreement by rule of reason or <em>per se </em>standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">609 F.2d at 1376 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In counseling that the level of antitrust inquiry depends upon the nature of the conduct alleged, even in the labor-antitrust context, <em>Muko </em>I reflected the approach taken by a panel of this Court in <em>Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Association, </em>602 F.2d 494 (3d Cir. 1979), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>448 U.S. 902, 100 S.Ct. 3040, 65 L.Ed.2d 1131 (1980) <em>[\u201cConex\u201d], </em>a case decided several months prior to <em>Muko </em>I. There, the plaintiff was a freight consolidator whose business was threatened after defendants New York Shipping Association (an association of employers) and the longshoremen\u2019s union negotiated \u201cRules on Containers\u201d and the so-called \u201cDublin Supplement\u201d in response to the perceived threat to waterfront labor posed by technological change in the shipping industry. Conex claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendants\u2019 enforcement of the rules constituted a group boycott of the plaintiffs that was illegal <em>per se </em>under the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held, as an initial matter, \u201cthat the proper method of analysis is to determine the issue of nonstatutory labor exemption separately, . . . and then to proceed with conventional antitrust scrutiny of the complaint.\u201d 602 F.2d at 522. In so holding, the <em>Conex </em>Court expressly rejected Professor Handler\u2019s view \u201cthat there be a full-scale rule of reason inquiry in every instance in which a non-exempt activity is claimed to be in violation of antitrust.\u201d Handler, <em>Labor and Antitrust: A Bit of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>History, </em>40 Antitrust L.J. 233, 239-40 (1971). Pointing to <em>United Mineworkers v. Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965), and its companion case, <em>Local 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., </em>381 U.S. 676, 85 S.Ct. 1596, 14 L.Ed.2d 640 (1965), Judge Gibbons concluded: \u201c[T]he three groups of Justices in those cases, while they diverged widely on other issues, appear to have agreed that \u2018settled antitrust principles\u2019 would be \u2018appropriate and applicable\u2019 to activity found to be nonexempt. . . . Those \u2018settled\u2019 principles include the <em>per se </em>rule, <em>where the facts warrant its application.\u201d </em>602 F.2d at 522-23 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">We take this opportunity explicitly to reaffirm the holding in <em>Conex, </em>as reflected implicitly in <em>Muko </em>I. In so doing we adopt a middle position between that advocated by Professor Handler and that proposed by the appellant in the case at hand. While we agree with Professor Handler that the \u201cfactors to be considered in determining the existence of an antitrust <em>exemption </em>are separate and distinct from those bearing on the presence of an antitrust <em>infraction,\u201d </em>and that \u201conce such conduct is deemed not exempt, it is incumbent upon the decisionmaker to consider the relative anticompetitiveness of the conduct before imposing antitrust liability,\u201d Handler &amp; Zifchak, <em>Collective Bargaining and the Antitrust Laws: The Emasculation of the Labor Exemption, </em>81 Colum.L.Rev. 459, 51-1 (1981), we do not share Professor Handler\u2019s view that union conduct necessarily \u201cshould be measured by the rule of reason in recognition of the peculiar labor relations context in which the restraint arises even if, in a nonlabor context, similar conduct might be per se unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The mere fact that a labor union is one of the participants in an otherwise illegal combination should not preclude a determination that, in appropriate circumstances, the conduct is unreasonable <em>per se. See, e.g., Allen Bradley Co. v. Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>325 U.S. 797, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 89 L.Ed. 1939 (1945). The <em>per se </em>rule is, essentially, a short cut employed by a court in determining unreasonableness; as Professor Sullivan has taught, \u201cthe <em>per se </em>doctrine is precisely a special case of rule of reason analysis.\u201d L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust (1977). <em>See </em>discussion in part III(B) <em>infra. </em>If, after extensive experience with a particular kind of union conduct, a court concludes that the conduct invariably restrains competition, it is unnecessary, in our view, for the court to engage in lengthy rule-of-reason analysis when the <em>per se </em>rule would yield identical results more efficiently and expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">It is important, however, to caution against mechanical or imprudent application of the <em>per se </em>rule in the labor context. A finding that particular union conduct has anticompetitive effects that do \u201cnot flow naturally from the elimination of competition over wages and working conditions,\u201d and hence is non-exempt under <em>Connell, </em>should not drive a court inexorably to the conclusion that the union has violated the antitrust laws. We thus cannot agree with Muko, who contends that every labor-antitrust case in which the labor exemption is found to be inapplicable should be held illegal under the <em>per se </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In support of this proposition Muko points to the following language in the <em>Co-nex </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">[0]nce a court has concluded that the labor exemption does not shield anticompetitive conduct, application of the rule of reason is redundant. The justification offered for application of the rule of reason is the need to recognize, in the antitrust context, labor\u2019s legitimate interest in the collective bargaining process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>That interest, however, is precisely the same one that must be taken into account in determining the scope of the nonstatutory labor exemption. A holding that the exemption does not apply embodies a judgment that considerations of labor policy are outweighed by the anticompetitive dangers posed by the challenged restraint. The proposed use of the rule of reason would, therefore, simply be an invitation to the court or jury to reweigh under a different label the question of the non-statutory exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">602 F.2d at 523-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Although this language appears to support Muko\u2019s contention, the actual holding in <em>Conex </em>is far narrower in scope. In <em>Co-nex, </em>in fact, this Court carefully analyzed the conduct in question before determining that it constituted a <em>per se </em>illegal group boycott. <em>See </em>discussion in part III(B) <em>infra. </em>Indeed, the Court suggested that had pro-competitive effects been shown, the boycott may have been removed from the category of <em>per se </em>violations. <em>See </em>602 F.2d at 524 n.18 and accompanying text. As the <em>Conex </em>majority points out, \u201cpublic interest\u201d considerations, such as the advancement of labor policy, are not proper subjects for examination under the rule of reason. <em>National Society of Professional Engineers v.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\"><em>United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 688, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1363, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The passage from <em>Conex </em>quoted above merely reflects the view that it is unnecessary, if not improper, to weigh \u201clabor\u2019s legitimate interest in the collective bargaining process\u201d twice \u2014 once in determining the labor exemption and again in deciding the antitrust liability question. <em>See </em>Casey &amp; Cozzil-Iio, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 271. There is no indication that the Court was prepared to find that the defendants\u2019 conduct was <em>per se </em>illegal merely because it was not exempt from the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, in <em>Muko </em>I, Judge Gibbons \u2014 who earlier had written <em>Conex </em>\u2014 explicitly left open the possibility that a \u201clesser restraint,\u201d though nonexempt, might be judged under the rule of reason. 609 F.2d at 1376. <em>But see </em>King &amp; Moser, Muko <em>and </em>Conex: <em>The Third Circuit Responds to </em>Connell, 8 Pepperdine L.Rev. 79 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">In short, a fair reading of both <em>Conex </em>and <em>Muko </em>I impels the conclusion that, once it is ascertained that union activity falls outside the protection of the labor exemption, a court must apply traditional antitrust principles in determining whether the activity in question violates the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In most cases the rule of rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>son will supply the measure of illegality; the <em>per se </em>rule may, however, be invoked where appropriate. We turn now to this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Though framed in absolute terms, section 1 of the Sherman Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> has been construed throughout its history to proscribe only <em>unreasonable </em>restraints of trade. <em>Chicago Board of Trade </em>v. <em>United States, </em>246 U.S. 231, 38 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918); <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U.S. 1, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619 (1911). In most cases, a \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis requires a detailed examination of the affected business and the nature of the restraint imposed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There are, however, \u201ccertain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.\u201d <em>Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1958). Such determinations of <em>per se </em>illegality are not casually made. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>United States v. Topco Associates, </em>405 U.S. 596, 607-08, 92 S.Ct. 1126, 1133, 31 L.Ed.2d 515 (1972), and as our Court reiterated most recently in <em>Tose v. First Pennsylvania Bank, </em>648 F.2d 879, 891 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 390, 70 L.Ed.2d 208 (1981), \u201c[ijt is only after considerable experience with certain business relationships that courts classify them as <em>per se </em>violations of the Sherman Act.\u201d <em>See Cernuto, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Cabinet Corp., </em>595 F.2d 164, 166-67 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>Harold Friedman Inc. </em>v. <em>Thorofare Markets Inc., </em>587 F.2d 127, 140 (3d Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither mere speculation, nor the desire to simplify the cumbersome process of determining antitrust illegality, is enough to justify the imposition of a <em>per se </em>rule. In <em>Tose, </em>for example, we declined to extend the <em>per se </em>rule to an agreement to force a distress sale of a partner\u2019s share of a business because we were \u201cnot aware of any body of judicial experience teaching\u201d that such an agreement had a \u201c \u2018pernicious effect on competi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tion ....\u2019\u201d 648 F.2d at 891. In short, \u201cdeparture from the rule-of-reason standard must be based upon <em>demonstrable economic effect </em>rather than . . . upon formalistic line drawing.\u201d <em>Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., </em>433 U.S. 36, 58-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2561-2562, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Group boycotts have typically been among those categories of conduct deemed unreasonable <em>per se. See, e.g., United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>384 U.S. 127, 86 S.Ct. 1321, 16 L.Ed.2d 415 (1966); <em>Klor\u2019s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., </em>359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959); <em>Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, </em>312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941). In <em>Klor\u2019s, supra, </em>for example, the Supreme Court condemned as unlawful an agreement between a large chain department store and a group of manufacturers and distributors not to deal with a smaller, competing retail store. The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">Group boycotts, or <em>concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders, </em>have long been held to be in the forbidden category. They have not been saved by allegations that they were reasonable in the specific circumstances, nor by a failure to show that they \u201cfixed or regulated prices, parcelled out or limited production, or brought about a deterioration in quality.\u201d <em>Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild v. Federal Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>312 U.S. 457, 466, 467-468 [61 S.Ct. 703, 707, 708, 85 L.Ed. 949]. Cf. <em>United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., </em>273 U.S. 392 [47 S.Ct. 377, 71 L.Ed. 700]. Even when they operated to lower prices or temporarily to stimulate competition they were banned. For, as this Court said in <em>Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram &amp; Sons, </em>340 U.S. 211, 213 [71 S.Ct. 259, 260, 95 L.Ed. 219], \u201csuch agreements, no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.\u201d Cf. <em>United States v. Patten, </em>226 U.S. 525, 542, 33 S.Ct. 141, 145, 57 L.Ed. 333.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUd\">359 U.S. at 212, 79 S.Ct. at 709 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Though <em>Klor\u2019s </em>appears flatly to proscribe group boycotts, whatever their form or function, courts and commentators <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> alike continue to resist the notion that all concerted refusals to deal fall automatically as <em>per se </em>violations of the antitrust laws. Generally, the application of the <em>per se </em>rule has been limited to those \u201cclassic\u201d boycotts in which a group of business competitors seek to benefit economically by excluding other competitors from the marketplace.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe crucial element\u201d in such boycotts, according to Professor Sullivan, \u201cis an effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to exclude or cause disadvantage to one or more competitors by cutting them off from trade relationships which are necessary to any firm trying to compete. The classic boycott . . . also usually entails an effort to induce two or more suppliers or customers not to deal with firms being excluded from the protected level.\u201d L. Sullivan, <em>Handbook of the Law of Antitrust </em>260 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">While the Supreme Court has not confronted this issue directly, a survey of the Court\u2019s group boycott decisions in which the <em>per se </em>rule was invoked \u201cconfirms that it is attempts by competitors to exclude horizontal competitors which trigger the per se rule.\u201d Comment, <em>Protest Boycotts Under the Sherman Act, </em>128 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1131, 1151 (1980). In <em>Klor\u2019s, </em>for example, the unlawful conduct was the attempt by one retailer to push a competitor out of the market. Similarly, in <em>Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., </em>364 U.S. 656, 81 S.Ct. 365, 5 L.Ed.2d 358 (1961), the plaintiff, a gas burner manufacturer, complained that the arbitrary denial of a gas association\u2019s \u201cseal of approval\u201d prevented the company from competing with the manufacturer-members of the association. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a trial on these allegations. In <em>United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>384 U.S. 127, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1966), a scheme in which retailers induced a manufacturer not to sell to competing discount retailers was held illegal <em>per se </em>under the Sherman Act. And in <em>Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, </em>312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941), the Court concluded that the <em>per se </em>rule was appropriate where one group of manufacturers attempted to induce retailers not to buy from another group of manufacturers. Significantly, while the Supreme Court recently declined to limit, for purposes of the McCar-ran-Ferguson Act, the definition of the term \u201cboycott\u201d to \u201cthose combinations which target <em>competitors </em>of the boycotters as the ultimate objects of a concerted refusal to deal,\u201d the Court did intimate that it was willing to distinguish between those boycotts that were unreasonable <em>per se </em>and those that were not. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, </em>438 U.S. 531, 542, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 2930, 57 L.Ed.2d 932 (1978). Noting the continuing controversy over the definition of the <em>per se </em>illegal boycott, the Court declared: \u201cBut the issue before us is whether the conduct in question involves a boycott, not whether it is <em>per se </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.

Be-</p>\n<p id=\"b495-2\">More recently, in <em>Sitkin Smelting &amp; Refining Co. v. FMC Corp., 575 </em>F.2d 440 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 866, 99 S.Ct. 191, 58 L.Ed.2d 176 (1978), we again faced the problem of defining the term \u201cgroup boycott\u201d and determining the bounds of its legality. In <em>Sitkin, </em>the plaintiff complained that the defendant had engaged in a sham bidding scheme with a third party whereby the defendant agreed that the third party would be awarded a contract to dismantle defendant\u2019s rayon plant if it matched the bid of the otherwise highest bidder. The Court declined to hold that this conduct constituted an illegal group boycott: \u201cThe controlling cases involve broad combinations and rather pervasive refusals to deal by a group of suppliers covering many transactions over an extended period of time.... We are not confronted with such a factual situation here. Plaintiffs have not brought to our attention any case where a court has found a per se violation of the Sherman Act on the basis of a concerted refusal to deal between a single seller and a single buyer.\u201d 575 F.2d at 446-47 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\">In contrast, the Court indicated its willingness to apply the <em>per se </em>rule in <em>Cernuto, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Cabinet Corp., </em>595 F.2d 164 (3d Cir. 1979). There, the manufacturer of kitchen cabinets allegedly terminated its sales to a discount retailer at the urging of another competing retailer, who wished to maintain prices. Like <em>Klor\u2019s </em>and <em>General Motors, </em>the case involved the attempt of one competitor to squeeze out its direct competitor. \u201c[Although the termination in such a situation is, itself, a vertical restraint, the desired impact is horizontal and on the dealer, not the manufacturer, level.\u201d 595 F.2d at 168. Thus, we reversed the summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants on the ground that at trial a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sherman Act might be found. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Vertical Agreement as Horizontal Restraint: Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., </em>128 U.Pa.L.Rev. 622 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Finally, in <em>Conex, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>we addressed the question whether a group boycott in the labor context was <em>per se </em>unreasonable. There, we outlined a \u201ccore group of situations\u201d in which group boycotts have been deemed illegal <em>per se:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa_-dedup-0\">(1) horizontal combinations of traders at one level of distribution having the purpose of excluding direct competitors from the market, <em>e.g., Associated Press v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 1, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945); <em>Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>234 U.S. 600, 34 S.Ct. 951, 58 L.Ed. 1490 (1914); (2) vertical combinations, designed to exclude from the market direct competitors of some members of the combination, <em>e.g., Klor\u2019s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., </em>359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959); and (3) coercive combinations aimed at influencing the trade practices of boycott victims. <em>E.g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 211, 71 S.Ct. 259, 95 L.Ed. 219 (1951); <em>Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild of America v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">602 F.2d at 522. <em>See E. A. McQuade Tours, Inc. v. Consolidated Air Tour Manual Committee, </em>467 F.2d 178, 186-87 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1109, 93 S.Ct. 912, 34 L.Ed.2d 690 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In <em>Conex, </em>after holding that the Rules on Containers and the Dublin Supplement were not exempt from the antitrust laws, the Court concluded that the facts of the case did warrant the application of the <em>per se </em>rule. Specifically, we found that the rules had \u201chorizontal, vertical, and coercive aspects\u201d: the goal of the union organization was \u201cwork acquisition\u201d because the \u201cunion\u2019s efforts clearly were directed toward the elimination of teamster competition\u201d; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>rules \u201cwholly bar\u201d the plaintiffs from providing their services in the market in question; the \u201canticompetitive effect of [the] arrangement [was] clear\u201d; nor was there \u201cany suggestion in the record that the application of the Rules will in the long run have procompetitive rather than anticom-petitive effects.\u201d In sum, the Court determined that the rules represented \u201c \u2018agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conex </em>at 522-23, (quoting <em>National Society of Professional Engineers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand, we conclude that the agreement between Silver\u2019s and the Trade Councils should not be deemed unreasonable <em>per se. </em>A distillation of the facts at issue here makes it clear that this is not a classic group boycott; the defendants\u2019 conduct should not be proscribed until the fact-finder has been given the opportunity to determine its reasonableness. Simply put, a small retailer has been picketed by a union. To preserve its business, the firm agrees to purchase union-made goods or services in the future. We cannot agree with Muko or the dissent that this is the kind of behavior against which the <em>per se </em>rule traditionally has been invoked. Unlike <em>Klor\u2019s </em>and <em>General Motors, </em>this is not a case in which one competitor, through concerted action with a supplier or customer, attempts to cut another, horizontal competitor out of the marketplace. Nor is there any suggestion of attempted price-fixing, as in <em>Cernuto. </em>Notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s assertion, which is not ground\u00e9d on record evidence, that Muko \u201cmust be viewed as the representative of non-union labor,\u201d the fact remains that neither Silver\u2019s nor the Trades Councils was in competition with each other or with Muko. There is no evidence that Silver\u2019s goal was to affect Muko\u2019s business; rather, it is uncontradicted that Silver\u2019s sought only to retain the goodwill of its customers in a new market. The Councils\u2019 goal was to ensure payment of the prevailing union wage to Pittsburgh-area construction workers. The record is barren of anything to suggest that either of the defendants wished, through their concerted action, to gain an advantage over Muko in an <em>economic </em>or <em>competitive </em>sense. This fundamentally distinguishes the present case from <em>Conex, </em>which involved an agreement between the defendant longshoremen\u2019s union, common carriers, and stevedores to exclude from direct competition all the teamsters employed by the plaintiff freight consolidators.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">We note, too, the limited nature of the restraint at issue here. Unlike <em>Conex, </em>in which the defendant union imposed a widespread restraint of trade, affecting the entire shipping industry, the \u201crefusal to deal\u201d in this case involved only one relatively small buyer: Silver\u2019s. Moreover, we fail to perceive the significant anticompetitive effects alleged by the appellant. Again, unlike <em>Conex, </em>the agreement did not have the necessary effect of destroying Muko\u2019s business; indeed, the evidence shows that Muko\u2019s profits increased during the time in question. Appendix at 127a. Silver\u2019s also appeared prepared to give Muko the job of constructing future restaurants if Muko employed union labor. Finally, procompeti-tive effects were demonstrated \u2014 Silver\u2019s gained a position in the otherwise crowded Pittsburgh-area fast food market.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The dissent points to a series of cases in an effort to support its view that Silver\u2019s agreement not to employ non-union contractors is unreasonable <em>per se. </em>None is apposite. Most of the cases <em>cited</em>\u2014Klor\u2019s <em>Fashion Originators\u2019, Radiant Burners, </em>and <em>Cernuto, </em>discussed <em>supra\u2014involve </em>horizontal restraints (or, perhaps more accurately, vertical restraints with horizontal effects) by direct competitors. Similarly, <em>United States v. Topco Associates, </em>405 U.S. 596, 92 S.Ct. 1126, 31 L.Ed.2d 515 (1972), involved a horizontal territorial restraint. Another case, <em>National Society of Professional Engineers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978), a suit brought by the Government to nullify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>professional association\u2019s canon of ethics prohibiting competitive bidding, was decided under the rule of reason. Indeed, <em>Continental T.V., Inc. </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania Inc., </em>433 U.S. 36, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977), overruled the <em>per se </em>rule of <em>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co., </em>388 U.S. 365, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967) that had previously governed vertical restraints. <em>United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963), cited by the dissent for the proposition that a procompetitive effect in one market will not excuse an anticom-petitive effect in another, was a merger case under section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18. The defendants sought to defend their merger in part on the proposition that \u201cif all the commercial banks in the Philadelphia area merged into one, it would be smaller than the largest bank in New York City.\u201d 374 U.S. at 370, 83 S.Ct. at 1745. While the Court rejected this argument as a justification for a merger, it in no way addressed the question whether pro-competitive effects could be considered in making the initial determination whether conduct was so pernicious as to be illegal <em>per se </em>under section 1 of the Sherman Act. And, finally, in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, </em>438 U.S. 531, 542, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 2930, 57 L.Ed.2d 932 (1978), discussed <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly declined to address the question whether all boycotts were unreasonable <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In sum, we have been referred to no case that suggests that the agreement at issue here is one \u201cwhose nature and necessary effect [is] so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed.... \u201d <em>Conex </em>at 522-23. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in instructing the jury to apply the rule of reason, rather than the <em>per se </em>standard, to the conduct in question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We turn now to Muko\u2019s second contention in this appeal \u2014 that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the relevant product market.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">At trial, Muko\u2019s expert testified that the relevant product market was the construction of fast food restaurants. Defendants contended that the relevant product market was the construction of small commercial buildings, including fast food restaurants. The trial judge instructed the jury that it could consider whether the construction of fast food restaurants was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amr-dedup-0\">a type of trade in which the contractors limit themselves or specialize in to the exclusion of other lines; is the construction of fast food restaurants, from what you have heard in the evidence here, a line of trade, a real line of trade in which somebody either devotes all his time, he doesn\u2019t do anything else, or a majority of his time or is that bigger? Do contractors in general \u2014 not necessarily the plaintiff here, all of them, do they regard this as an activity in which they devoted their time and energy and assets to so that, if that is blocked, they can\u2019t easily change to another line? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">If this agreement puts a restraint only on fast food restaurants, is that sufficiently reasonable for your consideration, or can contractors who do fast food restaurants just as easily do convenience stores, 7-Eleven Stores, small business buildings, branch banks? Is the line of trade confined to restaurants, or is it a little bigger, to include, as has been argued here, small commercial buildings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Appendix at 1253a-1254a.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Muko objects to the trial court\u2019s instruction in this respect because the charge \u201cmade definition of the market and reasonableness of the restraint dependent upon Muko\u2019s ability to compete in a market other than the one in which the alleged restraint occurred.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 21. It points to cases such as <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962) and <em>United States v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 994, 100 L.Ed. 1264 (1956), arguing that the fact that \u201cthe defendant in <em>DuPont </em>was presumably able to make wrapping products other than cellophane\u201d was not relevant to a determination of the product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>market: \u201cThe law does not, however, define either the product market or the reasonableness of a restraint in terms of the versatility of the alleged antitrust victim.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In a traditional section 2 monopolization case, the \u201cproduct market\u201d is defined in terms of cross-elasticity of demand \u2014 can the consumer of the product of an alleged monopolist switch easily to a substitute product, thereby undercutting the monopolist\u2019s power? <em>See Brown Shoe, supra. </em>As this Court held in <em>SmithKline Corp. </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly and Co., </em>575 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 838, 99 S.Ct. 123, 58 L.Ed.2d 134 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">defining a relevant product market is a process of describing those groups of producers which, because of the similarity of their products, have the ability \u2014 actual or potential \u2014 to take significant amounts of business away from each other. A market definition must look at all relevant sources of supply, either actual rivals or eager potential entrants to the market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuzJ\">575 F.2d at 1063. <em>See also Coleman Motor Co. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>525 F.2d 1338, 1349 (3d Cir. 1975) (emphasizing \u201cinterchangeability\u201d of products).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">It should be remembered that this case is <em>not </em>a monopolization case; nor is it a restraint of trade by <em>producers </em>of the product. Here, the <em>consumers </em>of Muko\u2019s product (construction services) have contracted to restrain trade. Thus the market must be analyzed not in terms of cross-elasticity of <em>demand </em>for the product, but of cross-elasticity of <em>supply. </em>That is, can Muko easily substitute one product (any type of small commercial building) for another (fast food restaurants)?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Under this analysis, Muko\u2019s argument fails to withstand scrutiny. The district court did not instruct the jury to decide whether, if pushed out of the \u201crelevant product market,\u201d Muko could enter a new, unrelated market. It simply asked the jury to determine whether Muko\u2019s \u201cline of trade\u201d was confined to fast food restaurants or whether it included other sorts of small commercial buildings. We find no error in this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">To summarize, we hold that the district court correctly instructed the jury on the rule of reason standard as well as on the relevant product market. Accordingly, the order of the district court, entering judgment for the defendants, will be affirmed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-12\">. Silver\u2019s argues that these two points cannot be assigned as error under Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 because Muko failed to present timely objections to the district court. While Muko may not have formally objected to the jury charge, it is clear from the record that the judge was made aware of Muko\u2019s position \u201cbefore the jury retire[d] to consider its verdict.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>Appendix 63a-66a; 98a-102a; 1138a; 1220a-1221a. We therefore conclude that Muko did not waive its right to appeal under Rule 51. <em>See United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>226 F.2d 745, 750 (3d Cir. 1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-15\">.

I agree with the majority that the precedent of <em>Connell Construction Co. v.

I disagree with the majority that the application of traditional antitrust principles to the agreement found by the jury in this case supports the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that the rule of reason rather than the <em>per se </em>standard must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">Although the parties disagree on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, the jury could have found that at the meeting on November 1, 1973, representatives of Silver\u2019s and the Trades Councils reached an agreement, the substance of which was reflected in the letter sent by Silver\u2019s Vice-President within a week thereafter, that Silver\u2019s would use only union contractors certified by the Trades Councils in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>struction of the Silver\u2019s restaurants. Interrogatory 1 to the jury asked \u201cDid Long John Silver\u2019s and the Trades Councils enter into <em>an agreement or combination to refuse to grant construction contracts to non-union builders, including Muko?\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It replied in the affirmative. Thereafter, by its reply to Interrogatory 2, the jury found that the effect of the agreement between Silver\u2019s and the Trades Councils was to impose a restraint on free competition \u201cbeyond that which would follow from the elimination of competition based on wage rates and working conditions.\u201d In other words, the defendants entered into an agreement, and that agreement fell outside the nonstatutory labor exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The majority gives four reasons for its unwillingness to apply the <em>per se </em>standard usually applicable to concerted refusals to deal: (1) \u201cneither Silver\u2019s nor the Trades Councils was in competition with each other or with Muko,\u201d and no evidence suggests that either defendant wished, through their concerted action, to gain an advantage over Muko in an economic or competitive sense; (2) \u201cthe \u2018refusal to deal\u2019 in this ease involved only one relatively small buyer: Silver\u2019s\u201d, rather than the imposition of a \u201cwidespread restraint of trade\u201d; (3) \u201cthe agreement did not have the necessary effect of destroying Muko\u2019s business,\u201d since his profits increased during the time in question and Silver\u2019s might have permitted Muko to construct future restaurants if Muko employed union labor; and (4) \u201cpro-competitive effects were demonstrated\u201d because Silver\u2019s gained a position in the otherwise crowded Pittsburgh-area fast food market. At 432. I believe the grounds on which the majority bases its decision are either factually erroneous or legally irrelevant. Those grounds will be considered seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">(1) The principal reason relied upon by the majority, both in its legal analysis and in its application of the legal principles to the case at hand, is its view that \u201cthis is not a case in which one competitor, through concerted action with a supplier or customer, attempts to cut another, horizontal competitor out of the marketplace.\u201d In the same paragraph, the majority enunciates its conclusion that there was no anticompeti-tive intent underlying the agreement. Thus, the majority states, Silver\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d was not to affect Muko\u2019s business but \u201cto retain the goodwill of its customers in a new market\u201d; the Councils\u2019 \u201cgoal was to ensure payment of the prevailing union wage\u201d. Neither defendant was, according to the majority, \u201cin competition ... with Muko\u201d and neither sought \u201cto gain an advantage over Muko in an <em>economic </em>or <em>competitive </em>sense.\u201d At 432 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The legal and factual flaws underlying the majority\u2019s analysis are numerous. It is of no small significance that in dealing with the definition of a \u201cboycott\u201d, as that term is used in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), the Supreme Court rejected the contention that \u201cboycott\u201d embraces \u201conly those combinations which target <em>competitors </em>of the boycotters as the ultimate objects of a concerted refusal to deal.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, </em>438 U.S. 531, 542, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 2930, 57 L.Ed.2d 932 (1978) (emphasis in original). The Court noted instead:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">As the labor-boycott cases illustrate, the boycotters and the ultimate target need not be in a competitive relationship with each other. This Court also has held unlawful, concerted refusals to deal in cases where the target is a customer of some or all of the conspirators who is being denied access to desired goods or services because of a refusal to accede to particular terms set by some or all of the sellers. See, <em>e.g., Paramount Famous Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U.S. 30, 51 S.Ct. 42, 75 L.Ed. 145 (1930); <em>United States v. First Nat. Pictures, Inc., </em>282 U.S. 44, 51 S.Ct. 45, 75 L.Ed. 151 (1930); <em>Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, </em>263 U.S. 291, 44 S.Ct. 96, 68 L.Ed. 308 (1923). See also <em>Anderson v. Shipowners Assn., </em>272 U.S. 359, 47 S.Ct. 125, 71 L.Ed. 298 (1926). As the Court put it in <em>Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram &amp; Sons, </em>340 U.S. 211, 214, 71 S.Ct. 259, 261, 95 L.Ed. 219 (1951), \u201cthe Sherman Act makes it an offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>[businessmen] to agree among themselves to stop selling to particular customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asd-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 543-44, 98 S.Ct. at 2930-31 (footnote omitted). Although the majority states that in the <em>St. Paul </em>case, \u201cthe Court did intimate that it was willing to distinguish between those boycotts that were unreasonable <em>per se </em>and those that were not\u201d, at 430, I would not be comfortable with that reading of the case in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s express disclaimer of any such intimation. After referring to the attempt by commentators to define those boycotts to which the <em>per se </em>approach should be limited, the Court stated, \u201cWe express no opinion, however, as to the merit of any of these definitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542 n.14, 98 S.Ct. at 2930 n.14. Its express rejection of a limitation of the boycott definition to those agreements that target competitors undercuts the legal foundation upon which the majority opinion is constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Even if use of a <em>per se </em>analysis is justified, as the majority suggests, only when there is some competitive impact, the majority\u2019s failure to recognize such an impact stems from a somewhat naive perception of the marketplace in which this agreement was wrought. The Trades Councils are representatives of union labor; Muko, a nonunion contractor, must be viewed as the representative of non-union labor. Thus the parties represent two strong <em>competitive </em>forces in the Pittsburgh area construction industry. If the Trades Councils succeed in their effort to limit the construction work available to firms using non-union labor, the union workers will have gained a competitive advantage over the non-union workers. This is an economic conflict in the most basic sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Because the true antagonists are workers, not businesses, \u201cstrong labor policy favor[s] the association of employees to eliminate competition over wages and working conditions.\u201d <em>Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 100, </em>421 U.S. at 622, 95 S.Ct. at 1835. Notwithstanding the actual or potential anticompetitive effects that flow from such agreements, the non-statutory labor exemption from the antitrust laws which is applied even to union-employer agreements is founded on the recognition that \u201clabor policy requires tolerance for the lessening of business competition based on differences in wages and working conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But once the agreement has effects which extend beyond the lessening of business competition based on differences in wages and working conditions, we are compelled to apply traditional antitrust analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Significantly, the unions in this case did not use the customary method by which organized labor attempts to effectuate its goals regarding wage rates and working conditions, which would have been to seek to organize Muko\u2019s employees. Instead, for reasons which do not appear on the record, the unions circumvented that route and confined themselves to pressuring Silver\u2019s not to do business with Muko merely because Muko employed their competitors, the non-union workers. It is because this effort had an effect, as the jury found, beyond that on wages and working conditions, that the Trades Council \u2014 Silver\u2019s agreement goes beyond the recognized labor protection. As such, it is indistinguishable from similar agreements which have been placed in the <em>per se </em>category.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">As we pointed out in <em>Consolidated Express, </em>defendants cannot avoid <em>per se </em>illegality merely because they had no anticom-petitive intent. We stated there, in rejecting the relevance of the factor of \u201cgoal\u201d on which the majority here relies, \u201cA showing of a specific intent to harm one\u2019s competitors or restrain competition need not be shown.\u201d 602 F.2d at 523. In effect, the majority\u2019s use of the \u201cgoal\u201d of the Trades Councils \u201cto ensure payment of the prevailing union wage\u201d as a reason for the application of the rule of reason standard is simply another way of saying that special consideration should be given to this agreement because it involved union activity. This is inconsistent with the majority\u2019s own recognition that traditional antitrust principles must apply once the nonstatutory labor exemption is found to be inapplicable, and is inconsistent with this court\u2019s holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Association, Inc., </em>602 F.2d 494, and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 100, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Further, the majority misperceives the thrust of the recent efforts to define more precisely the type of concerted refusals to deal with warrant <em>per se </em>treatment. It is true, as the majority suggests, that there is some resistance to application of a <em>per se </em>standard to all refusals to deal. But the leading academic commentators agree that a classic boycott, one which entails exclusionary conduct for economic benefit, merits <em>per se </em>treatment. <em>See, e.g., </em>L. Sullivan, <em>Handbook of the Law of Antitrust </em>256 (1977); 3 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, <em>Antitrust Law </em>H 836, at 351-52 (1978). What could be more exclusionary or fit more into the mold of a classic boycott than an agreement to exclude another firm (Muko and other nonunion contractors) from a market (construction of Silver\u2019s restaurants) because it does not use union labor?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">To be sure, it has not always been easy for the courts to apply the <em>per se </em>rule when the conduct itself could be considered to have a redeeming value. Thus, one might justify concerted refusals to deal when the effort is to eliminate design piracy, to prevent production of inferior work and insure ethical behavior, or to insure that potentially dangerous products are safe, useful and durable. But when met with each such rationale, the Supreme Court held that such potential justification does not warrant consideration of the combination by any standard less than the <em>per se </em>one applicable to concerted refusals to deal. See Fashion <em>Originators\u2019 Guild of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>FTC, </em>312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941); <em>National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 38 S.Ct. 242, 244 L.Ed. 683 (1978);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Radiant Burners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., </em>364 U.S. 656, 81 S.Ct. 365, 5 L.Ed.2d 358 (1961) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">There has been a recent group of cases, primarily those in connection with professional sports, where the courts have recognized that the necessity of combined action makes the field inappropriate for <em>per se </em>treatment. Obviously, if two clubs do\u2019not agree to be at the same field at the same time, to the exclusion of their competitors, there would hardly be a game in town. Other forms of combination within sports leagues are equally difficult, to fit into the traditional antitrust analysis. <em>See, e.g., Mo-linas </em>v. <em>National Basketball Association, </em>190 F.Supp. 241, 243-44 (S.D.N.Y.1961). Antitrust professors delight in pushing their students to the outer limit of analysis by posing hypothetical (and some not-so-hypothetical) situations in which consumer boycotts are organized against grape growers, non-ERA states, or racial discriminators to test if the students are willing to apply a laxer antitrust standard in these situations than when businesses combine to refuse to deal with other businesses. Whatever the merits of making a distinction along these lines, it has no application in the present situation. Indeed, in the case of the type of agreement at issue here, akin to a hot cargo agreement, Congress has already determined its lack of redeeming value since, in the labor context, such an agreement is ordinarily banned. <em>See </em>NLRA \u00a7 8(e); <em>Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Association, Inc., </em>602 F.2d at 524. Thus I disagree with both the majority\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the scope of the <em>per se </em>standard in antitrust cases and its failure to apply what have heretofore been traditional antitrust principles to combinations of labor and business which go far beyond labor\u2019s recognized exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">(2) The majority\u2019s second reason for applying the rule of reason here focuses on \u201cthe limited nature of the restraint\u201d which \u201cinvolved only one relatively small buyer: Silver\u2019s.\u201d The facts in this case simply do not fit into the majority\u2019s view of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>seller, a single buyer, and a single transaction. Arrayed on one side of the agreement were the Trades Councils representing all of the construction unions in six Pennsylvania counties, Allegheny County and the five surrounding counties. On the other side of the agreement was Silver\u2019s, which as of the trial date had constructed nineteen additional restaurants in the Western Pennsylvania area. At stake in the agreement was the considerable business represented by this construction, hardly similar to the single transaction to which we referred in <em>Sitkin Smelting &amp; Refining Co. v. FMC Corp., </em>575 F.2d 440 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 866, 99 S.Ct. 191, 58 L.Ed.2d 176 (1978), cited by the majority. In <em>Sitkin, </em>which did not involve a classic agreement not to deal, the agreement found by the jury was one involving a sham bidding scheme for one transaction, the sale of scrap of a building damaged by a hurricane. That agreement did not fall within one of the categories which the Supreme Court has held must be construed under the <em>per se </em>standard and was therefore one to be evaluated under the rule of reason standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In this case, on the contrary, the restraint of trade was not \u201climited\u201d, as the majority suggests, but was found by the jury to be directed to \u201cnon-union builders, including Muko\u201d who were the object of the agreement not to deal. Thus, this case must be viewed in a light far different from that seen by the majority, even were we free to gloss over the precedent of <em>Klor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., </em>359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959), where the Court stated of a concerted refusal to deal,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aro\">[I]t is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy. Monopoly can as surely thrive by the elimination of such small businessmen, one at a time, as it can by driving them out in large groups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 213, 79 S.Ct. at 710 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Further, the majority\u2019s apparent view that <em>per se </em>analysis is inappropriate because only one \u201crelatively small buyer\u201d was involved is inconsistent with this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., </em>595 F.2d 164 (3d Cir. 1979), also authored by Judge Adams, where we held that a manufacturer\u2019s withdrawal of its line of kitchen cabinets from the plaintiff dealer at the instigation of a competitor stated a <em>per se </em>violation of the antitrust laws. In <em>Cernuto </em>there was no \u201cwidespread restraint of trade;\u201d indeed we recognized that the impact may solely have been in the market for that manufacturer\u2019s cabinets, rather than in the general market for kitchen cabinets. <em>Id. </em>at 166. Nonetheless, we rejected the contention that the rule of reason should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The jury\u2019s affirmative response to Interrogatory 1 reflects its finding that there was an agreement between Silver\u2019s and the Trades Councils. In <em>Muko I </em>we suggested how such an agreement should be viewed when we stated, in rejecting the defendants\u2019 contention that the evidence failed to support an antitrust claim,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">A factfinder could have found an agreement to exclude nonunion contractors from the Silver\u2019s construction market, a significant interstate market consisting of twelve construction projects. The premise of both the majority and minority opinions in <em>Connell </em>is that absent an exemption such an agreement may be the basis of a federal antitrust claim. The jury <em>might have found a concerted refusal to deal with a class of contractors of which Muko is a member. </em>But whether the evidence here is viewed as capable of sustaining a <em>finding of a group boycott, to which a per se rule would apply, </em>or some lesser restraint to which a rule of reason analysis might apply, it was sufficient to take Muko\u2019s case to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">609 F.2d at 1376 (emphasis added). Once the jury found \u201ca concerted refusal to deal with a class of contractors of which Muko is a member\u201d, it follows, as we previously recognized, that the agreement must be characterized as a group boycott and is one to which the <em>per se </em>rule applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>(3) The third ground relied upon by the majority, that \u201cthe agreement did not have the necessary effect of destroying Muko\u2019s business\u201d, is legally irrelevant. The entire purpose of utilization of a <em>per se </em>rule is to avoid the necessity by plaintiffs to show the anticompetitive effects of the conspiracy. <em>See Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., </em>595 F.2d at 166. The thrust of the inquiry must be directed to whether the agreement is one which falls within the category of agreements classified as <em>per se, </em>not whether anticompetitive effects have been shown in the specific case. As we stated in <em>Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Association, Inc., </em>602 F.2d at 523,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">If a <em>per se </em>violation has been established, the court will already have found that \u201cthe nature and <em>necessary effect\u201d </em>of the challenged conduct is \u201cplainly anticom-petitive.\u201d <em>National Society of Professional Eng\u2019rs v. United States, </em>435 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. at 1364 (emphasis added). Once that fact has been established, all that need be shown is that the charged anticompetitive acts were in fact performed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">If application of the <em>per se </em>standard were to be limited to those cases in which plaintiffs have shown the anticompetitive effects of the conspiracy, there would be no need to establish any <em>per se </em>rule. The extent of injury, if any, suffered by Muko is evidence directed to the amount of damages to which he would be entitled rather than to the standard by which the conduct should be judged. The \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of the agreement found by the jury, which was to exclude Muko and other non-union contractors from the construction of Silver\u2019s restaurants, is inevitably exclusionary. It thus falls within the category of \u201cagreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality \u2014 they are \u2018illegal per se.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">(4) The final ground relied upon by the majority, that \u201cprocompetitive effects were demonstrated\u201d because Silver\u2019s gained a position in the otherwise crowded Pittsburgh-area fast food market, also cannot withstand analysis. The self-interest of Silver\u2019s, in avoiding union pickets and displeasure, is hardly synonymous with a \u201cprocompetitive effect\u201d. Even if there were evidence of such an effect, antitrust cases have always rejected the premise that a procompetitive effect in one market will excuse an anti-competitive effect in another. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., </em>405 U.S. 596, 609-11, 92 S.Ct. 1126, 1134-35, 31 L.Ed.2d 515 (1972); <em>United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 370, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1745, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963). During the almost 100 years of antitrust enforcement in this country, antitrust defendants have often sought to rationalize their conduct either on the ground that some benign and beneficent purpose is served or on the ground that competition, rather than being hurt, is enhanced. In the rare instances where the latter ground has been accepted as the basis for placing a class of agreements into the rule of reason category, the courts have not looked to whether the individual self-interest of one of the parties to the agreement would be served, as the majority does in this case, but to whether the competition that may flow from such agreements in general warrants a judgment that they could have economic utility. <em>See Continental T.V., Inc. </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 36, 54-59, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2559-2562, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977). In contrast, the majority has proffered no legally cognizable basis for application of the rule of reason to an agreement not to use non-union contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Since I believe none of the reasons given by the majority to support the use of a rule of reason standard when unions conspire with business to exclude a non-union firm from the market withstands analysis, I conclude that the underlying rationale for the majority\u2019s approach must stem from its discomfort with the application of traditional antitrust rules in the labor context. Judge Adams candidly set forth his concern in his concurring opinion in <em>Muko </em>I, 609 F.2d at 1376-77. While there may be some merit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>that position, it is, as Judge Adams recognized, one which we, as an inferior court, are not free to take in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Connell. </em>Further, were we free to examine the issue anew, I have grave question whether the extension of labor\u2019s exemption from the antitrust laws should be accomplished by the courts or whether it should not be left to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">For the aforesaid reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand for retrial so that the jury may apply a <em>per se </em>standard to the concerted refusal to deal which it already found existed and which it found extended beyond labor\u2019s nonstatutory exemption from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. Although the majority characterizes the <em>Professional Engineers </em>case as one decided under the rule of reason, the Supreme Court itself in <em>Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 643, 647, 100 S.Ct. 1925, 1927, 64 L.Ed.2d 580 (1980) (per curiam), included that case among those applying a <em>per se </em>rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
