Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). The background facts, which have not changed at all, were recited fully by Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">Doyle was first employed by the Board in 1966. He worked under one-year contracts for the first three years, and under a two-year contract from 1969 to 1971. In 1969 he was elected president of the Teachers\u2019 Association, in which position he worked to expand the subjects of direct negotiation between the Association and the Board of Education. During. Doyle\u2019s one-year term as president of the Association, and during the succeeding year when he served on its executive committee, there was apparently some tension in relations between the Board and the Association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-14\">Beginning early in 1970, Doyle was involved in several incidents not directly connected with his role in the Teachers\u2019 Association. In one instance, he engaged in an argument with another teacher which culminated in the other teacher\u2019s slapping him. Doyle subsequently refused to accept an apology and insisted upon some punishment for the other teacher. His persistence in the matter resulted in the suspension of both teachers for one day, which was followed by a walkout of a number of other teachers, which in turn resulted in the lifting of the suspensions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-15\">On other occasions, Doyle got into an argument with employees of the school cafeteria over the amount of spaghetti which had been served him; referred to students, in connection with a disciplinary complaint, as \u201csons of bitches\u201d; and made an obscene gesture to two girls in connection with their failure to obey commands made in his capacity as cafeteria supervisor. Chronologically the last in the series of incidents which respondent was involved in during his employment by the Board was a telephone call by him to a local radio station. It was the Board\u2019s consideration of this incident which the court below found to be a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-16\">In February 1971, the principal circulated to various teachers a memorandum relating to teacher dress and appearance, which was apparently prompted by the view of some in the administration that there was a relationship between teacher appearance and public support for bond issues. Doyle\u2019s response to the receipt of the memorandum \u2014 on a subject which he apparently understood was to be settled by joint teacher-administration action\u2014 was to convey the substance of the memorandum to a disc jockey at WSAI, a Cincinnati radio station, who promptly announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item. Doyle subsequently apol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ogized to the principal, conceding that he should have made some prior communication of his criticism to the school administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">Approximately one month later the superintendent made his customary annual recommendations to the Board as to the rehiring of nontenured teachers. He recommended that Doyle not be rehired. The same recommendation was made with respect to nine other teachers in the district, and in all instances, including Doyle\u2019s the recommendation was adopted by the Board. Shortly after being notified of this decision, respondent requested a statement of reasons for the Board\u2019s actions. He received a statement citing \u201ca notable lack of tact in handling professional matters which leaves much doubt as to your sincerity in establishing good school relationships.\u201d That general statement was followed by references to the radio station incident and to the obscene-gesture incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 281-83, 97 S.Ct. at 573-74 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">On these facts the United States District Judge who heard this case in the first instance granted relief to the plaintiff finding that the nonrenewal by the Board was based in substantial part on Doyle\u2019s protected right of speech in relation to the Cincinnati radio station incident and this court had affirmed by per curiam decision. The Supreme Court upheld the District Court\u2019s finding that protected activity had played a substantial part in the decision not to rehire Doyle, but this fact did not automatically warrant the relief which had been ordered. The Court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">Initially, in this case, the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d \u2014 or, to put it in other words, that it was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent\u2019s reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The Supreme Court then remanded the case for further proceedings. The District Judge then determined from the original record that \u201cthe Board has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Doyle would not have been renewed because of the incidents \u2014 exclusive of the radio incident \u2014 which had occurred during the year or so prior to the nonrenewal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">The record does disclose some major reasons; one involving \u201cobscene gestures to correct students in a situation in the cafeteria causing considerable concern among those students present,\u201d and another concerning what is referred to as the \u201cs.o.b.\u201d name-calling incident. We read this record as disclosing that while appellant Doyle had some fine qualities as a teacher, he also had a very quick temper.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">On the whole record, we cannot find that the District Judge\u2019s finding of fact on remand is clearly erroneous. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
