We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Black claimed to have been disabled by an injury he received while working. His employer denied liability for Black\u2019s condition, but agreed to a lump sum settlement of the claim in the amount of $20,000, pursuant to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.289(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After this settlement, the Social Security Administration notified Black that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 424a(a) &amp; (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the disability insurance benefits he had been receiving would be reduced to reflect the value of the settlement. Black contends that the offset was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">Black argues that the settlement with his employer was not \u201ca commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic [workers\u2019 compensation] payments\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b) and thus could not properly be offset against his disability benefits. Black insists that, under Oregon law, the lump sum payment he received was in settlement of a claim that was not yet established and therefore cannot be considered a substitute for periodic payments. He supports this contention by calling to our attention that, under Oregon law, a bona fide dispute over the compensability of the claim is a prerequisite to a valid workers\u2019 compensation settlement. <em>See Schulz v. State Compensation Dep\u2019t, </em>252 Or. 211, 448 P.2d 551 (1968) (en banc). The Secretary, on the other hand, argues that the settlement is clearly a substitute for whatever periodic payments Black might otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Oregon workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We agree with the Secretary. Black docs not, and cannot, contend that the settleanient was for something other than a claim arising out of an injury he received while on the job. In his brief, he admits that, having agreed to the lump sum settlement, he is barred from asserting any claim for compensation under Oregon workers\u2019 compensation law. The settlement itself relieves Black\u2019s employer of liability for whatever payments may be due to Black under that law on account of injuries received in the accident. Where the right to and liability for periodic workers\u2019 compensation payments are thus extinguished by a voluntary settlement, the settlement can only be regarded as a \u201csubstitute\u201d for the payments. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>358 F.Supp. 1310, 1311 (W.D.Va.1973). The fact that Black had no absolute right to receive such a substitute, and that the settlement was subject to the approval of a referee, the Board, or the court, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.-289(4), does not alter its nature. <em>See Walters </em>v. <em>Flemming, </em>185 F.Supp. 288, 289-90 (D.Mass.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We need not and do not hold that every compromise of a workers\u2019 compensation claim is a substitute for periodic payments within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b). For example, it may well be that a lump sum settlement of a claim under Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 656.204(1), which provides for burial costs not exceeding $1,000, or a settlement of a final payment made to a surviving spouse under Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.204(2)(c), are not in lieu of periodic payments. But the case before us is different. Black claims disability as a result of psychological problems allegedly caused by an on-the-job injury. This injury could be either a permanent partial disability under Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.214 or a temporary partial disability under Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.212, both of which provide for compensation payments on a periodic basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since Black\u2019s settlement with his employer meant that he surrendered his claim to periodic payments under either of these sections, the settlement must be considered a \u201ccommutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments\u201d pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b). We therefore affirm the decision of the Secretary to offset the amount of Black\u2019s settlement against his disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">.

Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.216 provides for periodic payments in cases of permanent partial disability. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.230 gives the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board the discretion to order, upon application of the worker, that the unpaid award of periodic payments for permanent partial disability be paid to the worker in a lump sum. Although Black might argue that the settlement at issue here was in lieu of a lump sum payment under this section, this would not alter its characterization as a commutation of, or substitute for, periodic payments. The discretionary accelerated payment provided by section 656.230 is itself just a commutation of, or substitute for, the periodic payments available under Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.214 (permanent partial disability) and \u00a7 656.216 (method of payment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b174-8\">FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aqm-dedup-0\">concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Black has failed to prove that his settlement was not a substitute for periodic payments. I would, however, leave open the question of what workers\u2019 compensation payments, under Oregon law, are payable as a lump sum. The question was not argued to or decided by the district court. Accordingly, I would not decide it here. I nonetheless concur in the result since Black has not sustained the burden imposed on the claimant to show what part of a workers\u2019 compensation settlement is not a substitute for periodic payments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.408(d) (1980).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
