After initially determining that we have jurisdiction to entertain New Jersey\u2019s appeal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a), we conclude, both as a matter of statutory construction and as a matter of administrative law, that the Department had sufficient authority to impose the challenged disallow-ances. Accordingly, we affirm the orders entered by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-22\">On January 4, 1975, President Ford signed into law the Child Support Enforcement Act, Pub.L. No. 93-647. The Act made available to the states federal financial assistance \u201c[f]or the purpose of enforcing the support obligations owed by absent parents to their children, locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and obtaining child support.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 651. The authors of' the legislation \u2014 -which was codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>fied as Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-662, and hence became known as the \u201cIV \u2014 D\u201d program \u2014 left basic responsibility for child support plans with the states, but envisioned \u201ca far more active role on the part of the Federal Government in monitoring and evaluating State programs . . . [and] in undertaking to give direct assistance to the States in locating absent parents and obtaining support payments from them.\u201d S.Rep. No. 93-1356, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 8133, 8134.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">The primary justification for this increased federal role can be discerned from the relevant legislative history. Congress was concerned about the \u201crapid and uncontrolled growth\u201d of expenditures under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. In large measure, such growth could be attributed to the failure of the states to ensure that individuals legally obligated to provide child support actually did so. Greater efforts in this regard by both the federal and state governments, it was believed, would reduce overall welfare costs. <em>Id. </em>at 8148-50. Moreover, according to one of the Senate sponsors of the IV \u2014 D program, \u201conce an effective support collection system is established, fathers will be deterred from deserting their families to welfare and children will be spared many of the effects of family breakup.\u201d 120 Cong. Rec. 40,323 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Long).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">To achieve these ends, Congress required each state to establish a IV \u2014 D program, designed to provide all AFDC recipients with certain child support and paternity services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(27).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The legislation specifies that, to qualify for federal financial participation, a state must draw its IV-D plan in accord with certain statutory requirements, set forth at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654. Among other things, a state IV-D agency must \u201center[] into cooperative arrangements with appropriate courts and law enforcement officials\u201d in order to ensure that its child support program is administered in the most effective fashion. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 654(7). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">Intent on \u201ccreating] a mechanism to require compliance with the law,\u201d [1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, <em>supra; </em>at 8149-50, Congress mandated that a \u201cseparate organizational unit\u201d be established within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to administer the IV \u2014 D program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(a). That unit, known as the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), is charged by statute with the responsibility, <em>inter alia, </em>for reviewing and approving state IV \u2014 D proposals, evaluating their implementation, and ensuring that states comply with federal IV \u2014 D standards. Pursuant to congressional directive, OCSE also compiles and submits \u201cfull and complete report[s]\u201d detailing all activities, expenses, and problems associated with federal and state child support programs. <em>Id. </em>Finally, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(13), states are required to \u201ccomply with such other requirements and standards as the Secretary [of HHS] determines to be necessary to the establishment of an effective [IV-D] program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-14\">Congress did not limit the availability of IV \u2014 D services to those individuals who received AFDC monies, however. The legislators recognized that \u201cthe problem of nonsupport is broader than the AFDC rolls\u201d and that \u201cmany families might be able to avoid the necessity of applying for welfare in the first place if they had adequate assistance in obtaining the support due from absent parents.\u201d [1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, <em>supra, </em>at 8158. Consequently coverage under the Child Support Enforcement Act was extended to include <em>non-</em>AFDC recipients as well. Specifically, Congress provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>the child support collection or paternity determination services established under [a state\u2019s IV-D] plan shall be made available to any individual not otherwise eligible for such services upon application filed by such individual with the State.. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A). The statute authorizes a state to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d application fee on non-AFDC recipients seeking IV-D services, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 654(6)(B), and permits a state to deduct its additional administrative expenses from any recovery ultimately obtained from a delinquent parent, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 654(6)(C). OCSE was instructed to pay particular attention to the non-AFDC aspects of the IV-D effort. As part of its periodic reporting obligation, OCSE was to identify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-5\">(i) the total amount of child support payments collected as a result of services furnished ... to individuals under [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)], (ii) the cost to the States and to the Federal Government of furnishing such services to those individuals, and (iii) the extent to which the furnishing of such services was successful in providing sufficient support to those individuals to assure that they did not require assistance under the State [AFDC plan].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">In mid-1975, pursuant to its statutory authority, HHS promulgated a series of administrative regulations covering the IV-D program. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 301.0-306.40 (1980). One such regulation restates the requirement that states make child support services available to non-AFDC individuals, as well as to AFDC recipients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-8\">The State plan shall provide that the child support collection or paternity de-, termination services established under the plan shall be made available to any individual not otherwise eligible for such services upon application filed by such individual with the IV-D agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 302.33(a). As is apparent, the regulation tracks the language of section 654(6)(A) of the Act, save for its final clause: while the statute requires only that applications by non-AFDC individuals be filed \u201cwith [a] State,\u201d the regulation specifies that such applications be filed \u201cwith [a] IV-D agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-11\">Neither the statute nor the regulation elaborate upon the application requirement; that is, neither the statute nor the regulation addresses the format or the timeliness of the application itself. On June 9, 1976, however, OCSE issued a \u201cprogram instruction\u201d setting forth certain procedures to be followed by states seeking reimbursement of costs for services provided to non-AFDC persons. OCSE noted that both the statute and the regulation make reimbursement contingent \u201cupon application filed by [a non-AFDC] individual.\u201d Therefore, states were informed that \u201c[i]n order to comply with the statutory requirements, . . . [an] application must be in writing . . . [and] must be signed by the individual applying for child support services\u201d before federal funds could be received. App. at 59a. Additionally, OCSE observed that, while a number of states made non-welfare recipients eligible for child support services prior to the enactment of the Child Support Enforcement Act, none of those previously existing state plans was \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the IV-D program adopted by Congress. Thus, states were instructed that \u201c[applications filed prior to the effective date of title IV \u2014 D ... do not make a case eligible for Federal financial participation under title IV-D.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60a \u2014 61a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">In a subsequent communication, OCSE established August 1, 1976, as the effective date of the June 9 program instruction. Appropriate state officials were urged to \u201cproceed immediately\u201d to obtain \u201cnew applications\u201d for child support services from non-AFDC individuals, \u201cso that you do not suffer any loss of Federal funds.\u201d Letter from. J. Steigman, Deputy Regional Director, OCSE (Sept. 20, 1976), App. at 66a-67a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-14\">On July 1, 1975, New Jersey commenced participation in the national IV-D program. Retroactive to that date, New Jersey\u2019s Divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>sion of Public Welfare entered into a cooperative agreement, as required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(7), with the State\u2019s Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC). That agreement obligated the AOC to furnish those services required of the State under the IV \u2014 D Act; in exchange, the Division of Public Welfare was to forward to the AOC whatever amounts it received as reimbursement for its IV-D expenditures from HHS. Brief for Petitioner at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">Prior to the enactment of the Child Support Enforcement Act, New Jersey, not unlike other states, provided child support collection and paternity loeater services through its state courts and county probation departments. <em>See </em>2A N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 168-ll(b) (West); N.J.Ct.R. 4:79-9(a) &amp; (b). These services were made available, pursuant to court order, to any eligible person, regardless of whether that person was a welfare recipient. Thus, at the time New Jersey entered the IV \u2014 D program, thousands of child support cases \u2014 many of them involving non-AFDC individuals \u2014 already were pending with local probation offices, and the authorities proceeded to process them in connection with applicable IV-D rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">New Jersey received a copy of the OCSE program instruction concerning the non-AFDC application requirement on July 19, 1976. Shortly thereafter, an official in New Jersey\u2019s Division of Public Welfare recommended that the AOC undertake \u201cimmediate action ... in order to assure that New Jersey will remain eligible for Federal reimbursement in non-public assistance eases.\u201d Specifically, the AOC was urged to secure new, signed applications from \u201call persons seeking child support enforcement services.\u201d Letter from P. Timlen, Coordinator, Child Support and Paternity Unit (Aug. 19, 1976), App. at 64a-65a. In response to this directive, the AOC, acting through county probation offices, attempted to obtain signed requests for IV \u2014 D services from all non-AFDC recipients, \u201cincluding those who had initially petitioned the courts for assistance in obtaining child support payments many years before New Jersey\u2019s entry into the IV-D Program.\u201d Affidavit of F. Fant, Assistant Director for Probation, AOC (Mar. 15, 1978), App. at 68a \u2014 69a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">For a variety of reasons, however, the AOC was unable to acquire new IV-D applications from all non-AFDC individuals to whom the State provided child support services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By March 31, 1977, for example, signed applications had been secured from only 60-65% of the non-AFDC population.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While that percentage increased in the months that followed, as late as June 30, 1980, New Jersey was continuing to report less-than-complete compliance with the new application requirement. App. at 54a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-11\">As a result, in a series of determinations covering the period from August 1, 1976, through June 30, 1980, OCSE regional officials disallowed $1,772,920 of IV \u2014 D expenditures for which New Jersey sought reimbursement. These various disallowances represented the amount of child support services provided by the State to non-AFDC individuals from whom as yet no application had been obtained. App. at 43a-57a. New Jersey challenged the disallowances through appropriate HHS administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the main, the State ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>gued that, instead of requiring new applications for members of the non-AFDC population, OCSE should have accepted court orders, complaints, or other \u201cobjective indi-cia\u201d of a need by such individuals for child support services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">The HHS Departmental Grant Appeals Board rejected this, as well as other arguments proffered by New Jersey.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board held that OCSE could insist that a state obtain signed, post-1975 applications from non-AFDC recipients in order to be eligible for federal reimbursement. The Board acknowledged that neither the IV \u2014 D statute nor its legislative history explicitly directed that such new applications be secured. Nonetheless, it reasoned that, \u201cin the absence of an express reference in Title IV-D to services provided prior to the effective date of that title, it [cannot] clearly be inferred that new applications are not required.\u201d Faced with this ambiguity, the Board concluded that the proper result was to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own statute. It maintained that it could logically be assumed that Congress would not want to provide child support services to individuals who failed to submit IV-D applications, since the failure to submit IV-D applications \u201cmight arguably reflect the absence of any serious desire for continued services.\u201d There was no reason to believe, moreover, that the \u201cminimal\u201d burden placed on states by the new application requirement served to frustrate, to any significant degree, the overall objectives of the IV-D program. In addition, the Board determined that there was no violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when OCSE issued its June 9, 1976, program instruction. That instruction was \u201cinterpretative\u201d in nature, the Board concluded, and, as such, need not have been promulgated in accordance with the provisions of the APA. Dec. No. 135 (Nov. 28, 1980), App. at la-7a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">New Jersey seeks direct review in this Court of the Grant Appeals Board decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">Before we can address the merits of this appeal, two preliminary questions must be resolved. HHS maintains, first, that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the petitions presented by New Jersey. The Department further contends that, even if jurisdiction properly lies with this Court, the State has yet to exhaust its administrative remedies. For the reasons that follow, we reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-12\">New Jersey argues that the denial of federal monies challenged here is expressly grounded upon the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the State failed to comply with the statutory requirement that IV \u2014 D applications be obtained. Therefore, the State urges, jurisdiction exists under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a), which authorizes direct review by a court of appeals of determinations involving the conformity of a state\u2019s AFDC plan to federal standards. HHS, on the other hand, argues that this case simply entails the disallowance of discrete expenditures for which New Jersey erroneously sought reimbursement, rather than the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>whether the State\u2019s plan, as a whole, conforms to applicable national requirements. HHS insists that the governing statute is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(d), which does not provide for immediate appellate-level judicial review. In order to determine which of these two competing schemes is applicable to the dispute here, it is necessary to undertake a somewhat extended journey through the relevant statutory and regulatory bramble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Title IV of the Social Security Act makes federal matching funds available only to states that \u201chave submitted, and had approved by the [Secretary of HHS], State plans for aid and services to needy families with children,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601. In this regard, the Act requires the Secretary to determine, within ninety days of receipt of a proposed state AFDC plan, whether that plan \u201cconforms to the requirements for approval\u201d set forth in various sections of Title IV. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1316(a)(1); <em>see </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.3. If the Secretary ascertains that it does not, the state may request administrative reconsideration by the Secretary, in the form of a plan-conformity hearing. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a)(2); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.4. Should the state\u2019s plan once again be rejected, the Act provides that the state \u201cmay, within 60 days after it has been notified of such determination, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of such determination.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a)(3); <em>see </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.7. Upon review, a court of appeals must accept as conclusive all findings of fact by the Secretary, \u201cif supported by substantial evidence,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a)(4); otherwise, the court is free \u201cto affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1316(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">According to the Act and accompanying regulations, the thre\u00e9-tiered plan-conformity procedure set forth in section 1316(a)\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>initial determination, administrative reconsideration. and appellate review \u2014 is to be used not only when state AFDC plans are offered to HHS for approval, but in other situations as well. Once a state plan is in effect, for example, any amendment thereto may be treated, at the option of the state, as the submission of an entirely new plan, thereby triggering the plan-conformity <em>modus operandi. See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(b); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.3(f). Similarly, section 1316(a) review would be necessary were the Secretary to determine, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 604(a)(2), that \u201cin the administration of\u201d a state\u2019s AFDC plan \u201cthere is a failure to comply substantially\u201d with any requirement enunciated in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) <em>(e.g., </em>the requirement that a state establish a IV-D program, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 602(a)(27)). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1316(a)(3). By regulation, HHS has defined substantial noncompliance to include, among other things, \u201cthe failure of [a] State in practice to comply with a Federal requirement, whether or not its State plan has been amended to conform to such requirement.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">If the Secretary ascertains for whatever reasons, that a state\u2019s AFDC plan, either on its face or in its administration, does not conform to federal standards, the Secretary is obligated to terminate the payment of federal funds for the offending plan (or, at his or her discretion, to limit payments to those parts of the state plan \u201cnot affected by\u201d the noncompliance) until satisfied that \u201cthere is no longer any such failure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 604(a); see 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.6(e); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 213.32(c). In other words, a sanction assessed pursuant to a plan-nonconformity determination is prospective in nature, and generally is imposed to remedy a broad, pervasive defect in a plan as a whole. <em>See, e.g., Arizona State Department of Public Welfare v. HEW, </em>449 F.2d 456 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 919, 92 S.Ct. 945, 30 L.Ed.2d 789 (1972); <em>Connecticut State Department of Public Welfare v. HEW, </em>448 F.2d 209 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>Gardner v. State of Alabama, Department of Pensions and Security, </em>385 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1046, 88 S.Ct. 773, 19 L.Ed.2d 839 (1968). As if to undermine the gravity of this potential penalty, HHS regulations specify that, before a compliance hearing is ordered, agency authorities are to make a \u201creasonable effort ... to resolve the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>tions involved by conference and discussion with State officials,\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.6(c), and that, should such a hearing nonetheless occur, the full panoply of trial-type procedural protections be afforded to the state, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 213.1.-.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">This description of the plan-conformity review arrangement set out in section 1316(a) must be qualified in a number of respects when considering the IV \u2014 D child support program. First, no explicit statutory provision makes section 1316(a) procedures apposite in the IV-D context. Nonetheless, the applicability of these procedures can be inferred with little difficulty, given that state IV-D plans are reviewed and approved by OCSE before they become effective, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(a)(3), that OCSE is directed to \u201cevaluate the implementation of State [IV-D] programs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 652(a)(4), and that a determination that a state\u2019s IV-D plan or program is not in compliance necessarily constitutes a determination that the state\u2019s AFDC program is not in compliance, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 602(a)(27). Second, the IV-D program contains a requirement not present in other aspects of the AFDC statutory scheme, namely, that the Secretary conduct a \u201ccomplete [annual] audit of the programs established under [the IV-D] plan in each State [in order to] determine . . . whether the actual operation of such programs in each State conforms to [federal] requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 652(a)(4); <em>see </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 305.0.-50. According to regulations promulgated by HHS, noncompliance determinations arising directly from such an audit are not reviewed under the provisions of section 1316(a). Rather, if the Secretary concludes \u201con the basis of the results of the [section 652(a)(4)] audit\u201d that a state has \u201cfailed to have an effective child support enforcement program,\u201d the disallowance procedures set forth in section 1316(d) \u2014discussed in more detail below \u2014 are applicable. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 305.50; <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 205.146(e). Finally, whereas a finding that a state\u2019s AFDC program is not in compliance may result in a cutoff of all federal dollars to that program, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 604(a), the maximum penalty that can be imposed when HHS determines that a state\u2019s IV-D program is not in compliance is the withholding of five percent of the quarterly AFDC payments otherwise due the offending state. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 604(d) &amp; 603(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">In contrast to the plan-conformity provisions of section 1316(a) are the disallowance review procedures set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(d). According to statute, HHS periodically forwards to each participating state an amount equivalent to that state\u2019s projected financial needs under the IV \u2014 D program, \u201creduced or increased to the extent of any overpayment or underpayment which the Secretary determines was made [previously].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 655(b)(2). By regulation, HHS has interpreted this statutory provision as authorization to disallow specific expenditures, presented for reimbursement by a state, determined by the Secretary to be impermissible under federal or state IV \u2014 D standards. <em>See 45 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 304.29. In this connection, the Social Security Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aao-dedup-0\">Whenever the Secretary determines that any item or class of items on account of which Federal financial participation is claimed under <em>[inter alia, </em>a state\u2019s AFDC plan] shall be disallowed for such participation, the State shall be entitled to and upon request shall receive a reconsideration of the disallowance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(d). If HHS concludes, therefore, that certain IV \u2014 D expenditures claimed by a state should be disallowed, the agency is obligated to notify the state of the availability of administrative reconsideration, <em>see 45 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 201.14(a). Thereupon, if the state so desires, it may request and obtain a hearing before the HHS Departmental Grant Appeals Board. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 201.14 &amp; 16.1 \u2014 91. The Board, after considering all pertinent facts, laws, and regulations, proceeds to issue \u201ca written decision\u201d that constitutes \u201cfinal administrative action on the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 201.-14(d)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">Section 1316(a) explicitly provides for direct court of appeals review of all plan-nonconformity determinations. There is no corresponding judicial review provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>sion set forth in section 1316(d), however. Either of two conclusions can be drawn from this silence. It may be argued that section 1316(d), by implication, altogether forbids judicial review, by any court, of an administrative disallowance decision made under the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Alternatively, following <em>County of Alameda v. Wein-berger, </em>520 F.2d 344, 347-49 (9th Cir. 1975), it might be argued that jurisdiction to review disallowances lies with the federal district courts. Although HHS on occasion has argued that no federal court has jurisdiction to review disallowances, the Department apparently no longer holds to such a view.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any event, it is sufficient to note that, regardless of whether a district court has jurisdiction to examine a disallowance determination, it is clear that initial appellate court review of such a determination is not authorized. <em>See Medical Services Administration v. United States, </em>590 F.2d 135, 136 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-4\">A number of other observations concerning disallowance procedures are of some pertinence. First, whereas a finding of plan-nonconformity results in the application of a prospective sanction (i.e., federal funds are terminated in whole or in part for the offending state program), disallowance determinations are retrospective in- effect <em>(i.e., </em>federal reimbursement is denied for specific unauthorized expenditures previously incurred by a state). Second, plan-conformity disagreements, by their very nature, concern either the validity of a state\u2019s plan as a whole or its overall administration. Disallowance disputes, however, are far more narrowly focused: they generally arise \u201cin connection with a routine audit\u2019\u2019 and involve \u201cthe accuracy of [that] audit,\u201d <em>see Medical Services Administration, supra, </em>at 136.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, it is worth repeating, if only to avoid confusion, that HHS regulations provide for the use of section 1316(d) disallowance procedures not only in the routine situation where the agency denies reimbursement for an unauthorized IV-D claim, <em>see </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 304.29, but also in connection with the annual IV-D compliance audit required of the agency under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(a)(4), <em>see </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 305.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">At first blush, it might appear that HHS\u2019 refusal to reimburse New Jersey for IV-D expenditures in the absence of new applications from non-AFDC recipients should be treated, for purposes of the jurisdictional question involved here, as a disal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>lowance under section 1316(d). The agency did not conclude that New Jersey\u2019s AFDC plan, which has been in effect for many years, was somehow not in compliance with federal statutes and regulations; nor did the Secretary determine that the State, while purporting to operate under a previously approved plan, had substantially deviated from it in practice. On the contrary, HHS found New Jersey\u2019s plan and its administration entirely satisfactory, but instead objected to the State\u2019s attempt to claim IV-D funds for individuals who had not filed what HHS deemed to be an appropriate application. At no time during the administrative proceedings to date, therefore, did HHS employ the plan conformity-related provisions described above, <em>e.g., </em>no compliance hearing was conducted by the agency in this matter. Additionally, the Secretary did not attempt to invoke the statutory penalty associated with a finding of nonconformity on the part of a state\u2019s IV-D plan, <em>i.e., </em>a five percent reduction in the total amount of AFDC monies otherwise payable to the state. Primarily for these reasons, HHS asserts that it has done no more than to disallow certain expenditures wrongly claimed by New Jersey. As such, the agency contends that a section 1316(a) review is improper and that the State\u2019s petitions for review should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">We decline, however, to adopt an approach which would permit the Secretary to foreclose judicial review under section 1316(a) in situations where one administrative route is pursued when another would be more appropriate. HHS, for example, should not be entitled to categorize as a \u201cdisallowance\u201d what, in essence, amounts to a determination that a state\u2019s IV-D program does not conform to a federally mandated requirement. We agree with New Jersey, therefore, that in deciding whether section 1316(a) or section 1316(d) procedures are applicable, a court of appeals is obligated to look beyond the label the Secretary puts on his or her actions, and instead is required to conduct an independent evaluation of the underlying substance of the dispute. To do otherwise would be to elevate form over substance, and, in practice, would make the jurisdiction of a court of appeals contingent upon the Secretary\u2019s unfettered discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">Our reasoning in this regard is consonant with the pragmatic approach to section 1316 jurisdiction employed by other federal courts. In the lead case, <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, supra, </em>note 7, HHS denied a Texas claim for $92 million on the ground that reimbursement was sought for services \u201cnot covered or purchasable under [Texas\u2019] approved State Plan.\u201d 556 F.2d at 331. When Texas filed a petition for review before the Fifth Circuit, HHS contended that a court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear the State\u2019s complaint. Specifically, the agency insisted that it simply had \u201cdisallowed\u201d the State\u2019s claim under section 1316(d), and that therefore section 1316(a)-type review was unavailable. The court, however, after observing that \u201c[t]he unusual circumstances of this case do not fall neatly into any usual classification,\u201d refused to grant HHS\u2019 motion to dismiss. On the contrary, after \u201creviewing the Act, the statutory history, and the circumstances of the claim,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe purposes of the Act and the equities are best served by treating this case as a plan-conformity dispute under section 1316(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. In a subsequent decision, a different panel of the Fifth Circuit reached the opposite result \u2014 it concluded that, given the facts of the dispute, section 1316(d) review procedures were applicable \u2014 but nonetheless employed the same functional analysis. <em>See Medical Services Administration, supra. </em>The second panel posed the jurisdictional issue in terms of \u201chow we categorize\u201d the so-called \u201cdeduction\u201d imposed by HHS upon the amount of Medicaid funds made available to Alabama. In the course of making that categorization, and thereby resolving the jurisdictional question, the court observed that \u201cit may not be easy in some cases to determine whether a particular dispute involves a disallowance,\u201d 590 F.2d at 136. Similarly, in <em>Solomon v. Califano, </em>464 F.Supp. 1203 (D.Md.1979), the court, after considering the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>underlying dispute, observed that \u201cthe present problem does not fall neatly under either [the disallowance or plan conformity] category,\u201d and, citing <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, </em>opined that \u201cprocedurally, th[e] matter more closely approximates a non-conformity than a disallowance issue.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1208. <em>See also Wingate v. Harris, </em>501 F.Supp. 58, 62-64 (S.D.N.Y.1980); <em>State of Georgia, Department of Human Resources v. Califano, </em>446 F.Supp. 404, 412\u201413 (N.D.Ga.1977).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-4\">Following <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare </em>and its progeny, therefore, our task with respect to the petitions presently under review is to determine whether the denial by HHS of New Jersey\u2019s claim for reimbursement is more like a plan conformity dispute under section 1316(a), or more like a disallowance determination under section 1316(d). After careful consideration of the contentions of both parties, we have concluded that the controversy at bar involves not merely an audit disallowance, but rather raises difficult and significant legal issues having to do with the construction of the Social Security Act, the interpretation of congressional intent with respect to the IV \u2014 D program, and the legality of certain HHS administrative actions. HHS\u2019 refusal to reimburse some of New Jersey\u2019s IV-D expenses because no new non-AFDC applications have been obtained amounts, in effect, for purposes of the section 1316 jurisdiction question, to a determination that New Jersey, in the administration of its state plan, is not conforming to applicable federal regulations. Accordingly, we hold that \u201cthe purposes of the Act and the equities are best served by treating this case as a plan-conformity dispute under section 1316(a),\u201d <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, supra, </em>556 F.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">We believe that our consideration of this dispute under the jurisdictional auspices of section 1316(a) can be justified on a number of grounds. First, the plan-conformity approach appears more appropriate when the issue involved in the present appeal is juxtaposed with the issue raised in each of the previous <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare-type </em>cases. In <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, </em>for example, HHS \u201cdisallowed\u201d various Social Security expenses claimed by the State because the agency believed those expenses to be either \u201coutside the scope of\u201d the approved state plan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>or else submitted for a fiscal year during which a state plan was \u201cnot in operation with respect to the claimed expenditures.\u201d 556 F.2d at 331. The Fifth Circuit refused to treat this matter as a disallowance dispute because, in its opinion, \u201c[t]he record reveals that [HHS\u2019] reasons for denying the . . . claim amount to a finding of nonconformity with Texas DPW\u2019s approved plan and with federal requirements.\u201d In this regard, the court was particularly impressed by the statements of two HHS officials. One observed that \u201c \u2018there was, for the purposes of this decision, no State plan,\u2019 \u201d and the other explained that \u201c \u2018the claims are not proper and allowable under the provisions of your State plan and the law and regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded, therefore, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayh-dedup-0\">the dispute in this case results largely from [HHS\u2019] attempt to deal in a summary manner with a substantial Texas DPW claim for expenditures for services which [HHS] considered to differ materially from those approved as part of Texas DPW\u2019s approved state plan. In view of the statutory history of the judicial review amendments of the Act, we conclude that the dispute should be resolved by means of the procedure established by Congress for dealing with plan-conformity issues, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 332. Likewise, in <em>Solomon v. Califa-no, supra, </em>Maryland sued to prevent HHS from recovering what the agency believed to be payments by the State to various nursing homes in excess of federal statutes and regulations. Once again, the \u201cdisallowance\u201d label imposed by HHS on its own administrative activity was ignored by the court. In justifying a remand to the Department for a compliance hearing under section 1316(a), the <em>Solomon </em>court observed that the essential \u201cunderlying problem\u201d giving rise to the lawsuit was Maryland\u2019s alleged failure to calculate certain Medicaid expenses \u201cin accordance with the requirements of its state plan.\u201d The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-5\">The Medicaid provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act . . . require the State plan to meet certain federal requirements .... Implicit in that requirement is the demand that the State, in its administration of the Medicaid program, comply with the provisions of the plan. Thus, a failure to administer the program in compliance with the plan is a non-conformity with the provisions of applicable federal law. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">464 F.Supp. at 1208 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\">In contrast to the <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare </em>and <em>Solomon </em>decisions are those cases in which it was apparent, from the facts of the controversies, that disallowance-related procedures were appropriate. In <em>Medical Services Administration, supra, </em>for example, HHS \u201cdisallowed\u201d certain Medicaid funds requested by Alabama after an audit report revealed a two month lag between \u201cthe time ineligibility for Medicaid was determined and the time this information was communicated to Alabama\u2019s fiscal agents responsible for processing Medicaid claims.\u201d 590 F.2d at 136. The court dismissed Alabama\u2019s petition for review for lack of jurisdiction under section 1316(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acl\">[HHS contends that] where the crux of the matter concerns the accuracy of an audit, as here, then the deduction is to be considered a \u201cdisallowance.\u201d We agree. The record shows that basically this case concerns an audit dispute. While it may not be easy in some cases to determine whether a particular dispute involves a disallowance . . . there is no difficulty in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\"><em>Id. </em>The <em>Medical Services Administration </em>case did not involve a disagreement as to the \u201cdefinition of eligibility\u201d under the Alabama plan. Rather, the \u201cisolated and highly focused\u201d inquiry conducted by HHS had to do with whether, in practice, the State was providing Medicaid only to those individuals actually eligible under the State\u2019s plan. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit reasoned, it lacked jurisdiction to review what amounted to a complaint concerning the results of a \u201croutine audit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>State of Georgia, Department of Human Resources, supra, </em>the court, while acknowledging the validity of the <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare </em>approach to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>section 1316 jurisdiction problem, reached a different result in light of the factual nature of the controversy under review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aba-dedup-0\">Unlike the <em>Texas DPW </em>case, the ease sub judice is not properly characterized as a plan conformity dispute. [HHS] did not terminate reimbursement of all physicians\u2019 services; rather it merely refused to pay the cost of services which exceeded the State plan. There is no dispute between Georgia and [HHS] as to the type of services covered by the Georgia plan or even as to the cost of services which are reimbursed pursuant to the plan. The only dispute is a clerical one: whether Georgia, in fact, overpaid physicians for services rendered. For these reasons, this Court concludes that the dispute between Georgia and [HHS] is properly classified as an audit dispute under section 1316(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abp-dedup-0\">446 F.Supp. at 413. To the same effect, see <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>520 F.2d at 347 (\u201cdisallowance,\u201d where HHS deducted $11 million from the State\u2019s Social Security claim, in order to compensate for alleged previous overpayments due to the State\u2019s using an erroneous reimbursement formula); <em>Wingate v. Harris, supra, </em>501 F.Supp. at 63 (\u201cthe dispute in this case involves disallowance of a class of items \u2014 claims relating to three decertified nursing homes\u2014 and not \u2018plan conformity\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\">The administrative determination about which New Jersey complains would appear to resemble more a finding of overall noncompliance with federal requirements, in the sense of <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare </em>and <em>Solomon, </em>than it does a technical, audit-connected shortcoming, as was the situation in <em>Medical Services Administration </em>and similar eases. HHS does not contend that the present controversy arose because the State made a \u201cclerical\u201d mistake with respect to computation of the amount of services to be provided to non-AFDC persons seeking child support assistance, <em>cf. State of Georgia, Department of Human Resources </em>; nor does the Department assert that the State sought too much IV-D reimbursement from the federal government due to the employment of an erroneous formula, <em>cf. County of Alameda. </em>Rather, HHS denied funds to New Jersey because, from the agency\u2019s perspective, the State failed to abide by an explicit requirement upon which the receipt of federal funds was conditioned \u2014 namely, that applications be obtained from non-AFDC individuals who qualify for IV-D services. Here, as in <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, </em>HHS\u2019 \u201creasons for denying the . . . claim amount to a finding of nonconformity with . . . federal requirements,\u201d 556 F.2d at 330-31. It cannot be said, moreover, that the \u201cdisallowances\u201d imposed here originated \u201cin connection with a routine audit of specific claims submitted by the state to [HHS] for reimbursement,\u201d <em>Medical Services Administration, </em>590 F.2d at 136. Instead, New Jersey\u2019s \u201cnoncompliance\u201d can be traced directly to the new administrative obligation imposed on the states by the OCSE program instruction of June 9, 1976. Once New Jersey failed to live up to the terms of that instruction, HHS behaved not as if it believed \u201cthe crux of the matter [to] concern[] the accuracy of an audit,\u201d <em>Medical Services Administration, id., </em>but rather as if it had determined that the claims presented by New Jersey were \u201c \u2018not proper and allowable under . . . the law and regulations,\u2019 \u201d <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, </em>556 F.2d at 331. Finally,'it should be noted that in the present case HHS does not contest specific \u201cindividual items or classes of items\u201d for which the State seeks reimbursement, as was the ease in <em>Wingate v. Harris, </em>where claims involving only three nursing homes were under review, <em>see </em>501 F.Supp. at 63. On the contrary, the disallowances imposed by the Department here necessarily implicate the administration of the non-AFDC aspect of New Jersey\u2019s IV \u2014 D program as a whole. In sum, we believe that the results reached in previous section 1316 cases preclude us from treating New Jersey\u2019s petitions for review as involving merely an audit-related disallowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">Apart from the dictates of previous cases, consideration of this dispute under the plan-conformity review provisions of section 1316(a), as opposed to the disallowance review provisions of section 1316(d), can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>justified on a second ground: such an approach is supported, albeit modestly, on the basis of the relevant legislative history. In explaining the provision that eventually became codified as section 1316(a), Senator Javits remarked that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-4\">most satisfactory approach to providing judicial review of administrative decisions of the Secretary is to establish a procedure whereby in cases of disagreement between the State agency and the Secretary, court review would occur prior to actual implementation of a proposed change in the State\u2019s existing approved plan. This would avoid the necessity for withholding or recouping Federal funds. <em>Court review would involve </em>a <em>determination of whether </em>an amendment to the existing plan proposed by the State or <em>a new administrative requirement promulgated by the Federal agency conformed with the intent of the Federal statute. </em>Under such procedure there would be no disruption in the operation of the existing approved State plan until agreement between the parties was reached or the court decision was rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">Ill Cong.Rec. 3068 (1965) (remarks of Sen. Javits) (emphasis added). In the present case, OCSE\u2019s instruction that signed, post-1975 applications be obtained from non-AFDC IV-D recipients can be viewed as a \u201cnew administrative requirement promulgated by [a] Federal agency.\u201d We conclude, following Senator Javits, that under such circumstances, judicial review in a court of appeals should be available in order to determine whether that new requirement \u201cconform[s] with the intent of the Federal statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Third, additional support for treating the disagreement between HHS and New Jersey as a plan-conformity matter can be drawn from the Department\u2019s own administrative regulations. Under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.5(a), a state is obligated to amend its plan \u201cwhenever necessary to reflect new or revised Federal statutes or regulations.\u201d If New Jersey, immediately after OCSE issued its application instruction, had sought to amend its state IV \u2014 D plan to provide explicitly that <em>no </em>applications need be obtained from members of the non-AFDC population, HHS of course would have rejected that proposed amendment as inconsistent with Regulation 205.5(a). Had such an alternative procedural route been followed in this case, there can be little doubt that New Jersey, at its option, could have insisted on section 1316(a)-type review'\u2014 since, according to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(b) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.3(f), any amendment to an approved state plan may be treated as the submission, under section 1316(a), of an entirely new plan. We believe that New Jersey should not be denied the opportunity of receiving plan-conformity review simply because it did not take the <em>pro forma </em>step of submitting an obviously unacceptable plan amendment to HHS. Moreover, it could be argued that taking such a step is unnecessary in any event, because 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.-6(a) explicitly provides that \u201c[a] question of noncompliance of a State plan may arise from,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe failure of the State in practice to comply with a Federal requirement, whether or not its State plan has been amended to conform to [this] requirement.\u201d In short, in contending that it would be inappropriate to treat this case under section 1316(a) because there was no Secretarial finding of plan nonconformity, HHS ignores the apparent force of its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">Fourth and finally, handling this appeal in accord with the provisions of section 1316(a) can be justified in terms of administrative and judicial economy. There is, in a word, little to be gained by dismissing these petitions for lack of jurisdiction, thereby delaying consideration by this Court of the underlying merits until, many months from now, an appeal can be brought from a final determination of a district court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>practical matter, given the uncertainty that accompanies any attempt to administer a statute or regulation under attack in the courts, and given the amount of money involved, it should be in the interest of HHS, no less than in the interest of New Jersey, to have the present controversy resolved with all due haste \u2014 at least as long as that resolution can be accomplished consistent with the statutory framework developed by Congress. In light of how closely the dispute between HHS and New Jersey approximates the standard plan-conformity conflict, and in view of the absence of any policy counseling against immediate disposition of this matter on the merits, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> initial appellate-level review pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a) is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">HHS interposes a second objection to our consideration of the merits of this appeal. The Department contends that, by bringing this appeal now rather than insisting that a plan-conformity hearing be held pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a)(2), New Jersey has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. HHS points out that in both of the previous cases in which it was determined that section 1316(a) procedures were appropriate, a remand was ordered so that a full plan-conformity hearing could be conducted by the agency. <em>See Texas Department of Public Welfare, supra, </em>556 F.2d at 332; <em>Solomon v. Califano, supra, </em>464 F.Supp. at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">As a general rule, of course, a party must attempt to exhaust all available administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. <em>See Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938). The Supreme Court has instructed, however, that \u201c[t]he requirement of exhaustion is a matter within the sound discretion of the courts,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Industrial Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Workers, </em>391 U.S. 418, 426 n.8, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 1722, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968). <em>See Cerro Metal Products v. Marshall, </em>620 F.2d 964, 970 &amp; n.10 (3d Cir. 1980). Our Court has recognized that, \u201c[a]s a judicially created doctrine, the requirement of exhaustion has traditionally been waived\u201d in those situations where \u201cexhaustion [would be] \u2018futile,\u2019\u201d <em>Susquehanna Valley Alliance </em>v. <em>Three Mile Island Nuclear Reactor, </em>619 F.2d 231, 245 (3d Cir. 1980), quoting <em>United States ex rel.

Forest Hills School District, </em>665 F.2d 443, at 447 n.5 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Porter County Chapter, Izaak Walton League of America, Inc. v. Costle, </em>571 F.2d 359, 363 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 834, 99 S.Ct. 115, 58 L.Ed.2d 130 (1978); <em>Ogletree v.

There is no factual dispute be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>tween the parties that might be resolved by additional testimony or hearings. Neither the State nor the agency contests, for example, the amount of the \u201cdisallowances\u201d under review here. Rather, the concern of both parties focuses upon the legality of those disallowances. And it is quite clear, at this point, what the Department\u2019s legal posture is with respect to the need for new IV-D applications for non-AFDC recipients: the HHS Grant Appeals Board, on no less than five separate occasions, has considered and rejected the objections raised by New Jersey to the OCSE instruction. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>There is nothing in the record that even remotely indicates that the Secretary might adopt any other position were the case to be remanded for a compliance hearing. Moreover, none of the general justifications of the exhaustion doctrine identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Wein-berger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), appears relevant in the situation at bar: a decision on the merits of the IV-D application question would not \u201cpremature[ly] interfere[] with agency processes\u201d; because HHS already has made clear its preference with respect to the resolution of those merits, exhaustion is not advisable in order to \u201cafford the parties and the courts the benefits of [the agency\u2019s] experience and expertise\u201d; and there exists no need for a remand so that HHS can \u201ccompile a record which is adequate for judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765, 95 S.Ct. at 2466; <em>see Liberty Alliance of the Blind v. Califano, </em>568 F.2d 333, 344-45 (3d Cir. 1977). We conclude, therefore, that to require a formal compliance hearing \u201cat this stage, when the controversy concerns only a legal issue, would not serve the purposes underlying the doctrine requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies or the purposes of Title IV \u2014 D,\u201d <em>Reser v. Califano, </em>467 F.Supp. 446, 449 (W.D.Mo.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">Consequently, HHS\u2019s failure to dispose of New Jersey\u2019s claims through an official section 1316(a)(2) proceeding does not render the present appeal nonjusticiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">This then brings us to the merits of the dispute. In this regard, we are asked to decide whether HHS \u2014 or, more specifically, OCSE \u2014 by issuing a \u201cprogram instruction,\u201d can require New Jersey to secure post-1975, signed applications from non-AFDC recipients before seeking reimbursement for IV \u2014 D child support services provided to those individuals. We arrive at an affirmative answer to that question via two alternative routes. First, we believe that the language of the IV-D statute can be said to mandate the obtaining of such new applications. Second, conceding <em>arguendo </em>that the language of the statute is ambiguous in this regard, we believe that HHS acted well within its statutory authority and consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act when it published what we have determined to be an interpretative rule regarding the non-AFDC aspect of the title IV-D program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">The Child Support Enforcement Act provides, in relevant part, that various IV \u2014 D services established under a state\u2019s plan \u201cbe made available to any individual not otherwise eligible for such <em>services\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., to any individual not presently receiving AFDC as<em>sistance </em>\u2014 \u201cupon <em>application filed by such individual with the State,\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A) (emphasis added). Relying primarily on the words of this highlighted phrase, the Department maintains that the application requirement imposed by OCSE on state authorities is mandated by the language of the Act itself. New Jersey contends, on the other hand, that section 654(6)(A) should not be read to require a state to obtain new, signed applications from non-AFDC individuals when other documents, verifying the need of such individuals for child support services, are already on file with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">As a matter of statutory construction, we accept the Department\u2019s argument. To be sure, New Jersey is technically correct that nothing in the statute explicitly \u201cpurports] to delimit the type of document or the date by which it must be filed in order to entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>the participating state to federal reimbursement.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 21. We are of the view, however, that HHS did not insist that states such as New Jersey obtain new applications from non-welfare recipients who seek IV-D assistance to satisfy some irrational, bureaucratic whim. On the contrary, the agency did no more and no less than to identify and to implement the congressional directives implicit in the terms of section 654(6)(A) itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-4\">With respect to New Jersey\u2019s contention that post-1975 applications are not demanded by the Act, we observe that section 654(6)(A), read in its entirety, is primarily prospective. The statute does not mandate, for example, that IV-D services be made available to any non-AFDC recipient who either \u201chas filed at some point in the past or will file at some point in the future\u201d an appropriate application. Rather, the provision of those services is made contingent upon the filing of an application by such an <em>individual </em>\u2014 i.e., the statute specifically states that services \u201cshall be made available . . . <em>upon </em>application filed. . . . \u201d It requires no great logical effort to conclude from this language that Congress meant for funds to be expended pursuant to section 654(6)(A) only <em>after </em>eligible non-AFDC recipients filed requisite IV \u2014 D applications with their respective states.. To argue, as does New Jersey, that post-1975 applications are not explicitly necessitated by the language of the statute is to ignore the obvious implication of the words Congress chose to employ in drafting this portion of the IV-D Act. (It also is to ignore the even more precise words HHS used in drafting the administrative regulation that implements section 654(6)(A)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">In response to New Jersey\u2019s related argument, that HHS should accept certain documents already on file with the State as sufficient evidence of a need for child support services on the part of non-AFDC individuals, we conclude once again that the precise words of the statute counsel otherwise. No doubt Congress could have made a state\u2019s receipt of non-AFDC-related reimbursements contingent upon the filing of a court order, a complaint, or an affidavit\u2014 documents that, presumably, New Jersey would have us deem acceptable substitutes for the statutorily prescribed \u201capplication.\u201d Section 654(6)(A), however, speaks <em>only </em>in terms of the filing of an \u201capplication\u201d\u2014 and, as HHS observes in this connection, \u201c[t]here is no indication in either the statute itself or the legislative history that anything other than the plain meaning of the word \u2018application\u2019 was intended by Congress,\u201d Brief for Respondent at 9. Moreover, the statute directs that the application for IV-D services be filed <em>by the non-AFDC individual </em>with the state. This requirement of some sort of personalized filing by the applicant in our view precludes a state from transferring its entire pre-1975 child support caseload to the IV \u2014 D program in the absence of an intervening affirmative statement on the part of each non-AFDC participant that he or she still desires to receive such aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">The Department\u2019s interpretation of section 654(6)(A) is reinforced when the analytical focus is shifted from an examination of the precise language of the provision to a consideration of the provision\u2019s underlying general purpose. New Jersey contends that HHS\u2019 reading of section 654(6)(A) is inconsistent with the IV-D statutory scheme, if for no other reason than that a state\u2019s funds, better spent on the provision of child support services, are necessarily, diverted toward the accumulation of \u201cunnecessary\u201d applications. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 12-16. We find this contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>First, it is to be emphasized that the non-AFDC aspect of the IV \u2014 D program (and, for that matter, the IV \u2014 D program itself) represented an unprecedented federal experiment. Just as Congress insisted that certain statutory standards be satisfied by the states in order to ensure the success of the overall IV-D program, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-662, so too did Congress set forth specific requirements intended to accompany and to monitor the non-AFDC effort, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at \u00a7 652(a) (obligating OCSE to conduct an annual audit of the non-AFDC portion of the IV-D program). Examined in this light, the application requirement of section 654(6)(A) appears not as an inexplicable aberration, but rather as the logical concomitant of a new federal program. \u201cIt seems only reasonable that individuals in need of a newly created service be asked to express a desire for the service and that such application should be contemporaneous with the availability of that service.\u201d Brief for Respondent at 11. Second, there can be little doubt that Congress was aware, prior to the enactment of the IV \u2014 D program, that a number of states, such as New Jersey, already operated their own child support and paternity programs. In fact, the perceived failure of many of these programs was a significant motivating force that led to the adoption of the Child Support Enforcement. Act. <em>See </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, <em>supra, </em>at 8145-58. Perhaps because it wished to eliminate the shortcomings in existing state child support programs, Congress made no effort to \u201cgrandfather\u201d any aspect of those programs into the new federal scheme. Again, given this information, it is not illogical to assume that the application requirement set forth in section 654(6)(A) was envisioned by Congress as consistent with its attempt to \u201crequire new administrative procedures . . . rather than [to] rely on pre-existing ones which generally produced an inferior result,\u201d Brief for Respondent at 12. Third, viewed with the benefit of hindsight, the new application requirement strikes us as entirely consonant with Congress\u2019 ultimate objective of reducing unnecessary welfare expenditures through the IV \u2014 D program. For a variety of reasons, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, </em>New Jersey was not able to obtain signed requests for IV-D services from a significant percentage of the individuals for whom it sought reimbursement from the federal government \u2014 and this remained the case many months after the OCSE instruction had been issued, <em>see, e.g., </em>App. at 54a. There simply is nothing in the legislation or its history to indicate that Congress wished to provide federal monies for individuals who either could not be located by a state or who, once located, refused to complete an application for IV \u2014 D services.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that, in requiring states to obtain post-1975, signed applications from non-AFDC individuals receiving IV \u2014 D assistance, HHS correctly interpreted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\">Even if it were concluded that section 654(6)(A) is ambiguous on its face, however, we would be constrained to decide this appeal against New Jersey. We believe that HHS had the authority, under the Administrative Procedure Act, to promulgate the application requirement contained in the OCSE program instruction as an interpretative rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">New Jersey concedes that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 (vesting authority in the Secretary to make and publish regulations implementing the AFDC program) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(13) (obligating states to comply with such \u201crequirements and standards as the Secretary determines t\u00f3 be necessary to the establishment of an effective [IV \u2014 D] program\u201d), HHS could have adopted an administrative regulation providing that IV \u2014 D funds be made available only to non-AFDC individuals from whom a signed, post-1975 application had been secured. The State contends, however, that such a \u201clegislative-type\u201d regulation could have been issued only in conformity with the' notice and comment provisions of the APA, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. Because HHS provided New Jersey with no such opportunity to comment upon the OCSE transmittal before it became effective, the State argues that HHS violated the APA and that, consequently, the new application instruction should be invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">The APA notice and comment procedures exist for good reason: to ensure that unelected administrators, who are not directly accountable to the populace, are forced to justify their quasi-legislative rule-making before an informed and skeptical public. When these procedures are not followed in situations where they are in fact applicable, a court promotes neither the agency\u2019s ultimate mission nor respect for the law by ignoring the agency\u2019s indiscretion or condoning the agency\u2019s shortcut. The rulemaking processes set forth in the APA do not govern every action undertaken by an administrative agency, however. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A) provides that an agency need not accord interested parties an opportunity for notice and comment with respect to the promulgation of \u201cinterpretative rules.\u201d HHS asserts, not surprisingly, that the OCSE instruction at issue here constitutes an interpretative rule within the meaning of this provision and that therefore notice and comment procedures were not necessary. As previously noted, New Jersey contends, on the other hand, that HHS \u201cin effect\u201d has issued a legislative rule in \u201cinterpretative\u201d clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-16\">This Court has attempted to identify the definitional and practical differences between legislative and interpretative rule-making on a number of recent occasions. <em>See Cerro Metal Products v. Marshall, </em>620 F.2d 964, 981-82 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>Buczynski v. General Motors Corp., </em>616 F.2d 1238, 1242 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>448 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 25, 65 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1980); <em>Baker v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>609 F.2d 686, 691 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged v. Mathews, </em>590 F.2d 1250, 1258-59 (3d Cir. 1978). In light of our previous decisions, we believe it unnecessary to consider the question once again in any detail. In brief, a \u201clegislative rule is the product of an exercise of delegated legislative power to make law through rules,\u201d whereas an \u201cinterpretative rule is any rule an agency issues without exercising delegated legislative power to make law through rules.\u201d 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 36 (1979). Expressed somewhat differently, an interpretative rule is a \u201cstatement^ made by an agency to give guidance to its staff and affected parties as to how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>agency intends to administer a statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Daughters of Miriam Center, supra, </em>590 F.2d at 1258; <em>see Pickus v. United States \u2019Board of Parole, </em>507 F.2d 1107, 1113 (D.C.Cir.1974); <em>Haddon Township Board of Education v. New Jersey Department of Education, </em>476 F.Supp. 681, 691 (D.N.J.1979). In contrast, a legislative rule, rather than merely setting forth an agency\u2019s own interpretation of the meaning of a statute it administers, actually implements that statute and, in so doing, \u201ccreates\u201d new law \u201caffecting individual rights and obligations.\u201d <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 232, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1073, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); <em>see Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 301-03, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1717-1718, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979); <em>National Association of Insurance Agents, Inc. v. Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System, </em>489 F.2d 1268, 1270-71 (D.C.Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">In our view, the OCSE \u201cprogram instruction\u201d under review on this appeal constitutes an interpretative rule for two reasons. First, in announcing the need for states to secure signed, post-1975 applications from non-welfare recipients of IV \u2014 D services, HHS was not imposing a new, substantive requirement upon the states. Rather, the agency was merely attempting to interpret a discrete provision of the Child Support Enforcement Act, <em>i.e., </em>it was attempting to flesh out the implicit mandates of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A). We agree with HHS that \u201c[t]he only questions left open by the statutory language [of section 654(6)(A) are] administrative [questions] such as the format and timeliness of the required application.\u201d Brief for Respondent at 9. Relatively technical, unimportant considerations such as these are appropriately resolved through the promulgation of an interpretative rule. Second, in <em>Cerro Metal Products, supra, </em>we advised that, in distinguishing between interpretative and legislative rules, a court should \u201ctake the agency at its word.\u201d 620 F.2d at 981. That is, \u201c[i]f an agency that has the statutorily delegated power to issue legislative rules chooses instead to issue an interpretative rule, the court accepts that characterization of the rule,\u201d <em>id.; see Daughters of Miriam Center, supra, </em>590 F.2d at 1255 n.9, 1258-59; <em>Joseph v. United States Civil Service Commission, </em>554 F.2d 1140, 1153 n.24, 1154 n.26 (D.C.Cir.1977). <em>Cerro Metal Products </em>therefore provides an additional justification for concluding that the OCSE application instruction involved here is properly classified, for our purposes, as an interpretative rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">The standard of review that should be applied by a court in evaluating an interpretative rule is, at least in this Circuit, a settled question. Interpretative rules are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agi-dedup-1\">\u201cnot controlling upon the courts\u201d [quoting <em>United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., </em>411 U.S. 655, 674, 93 S.Ct. 1804, 1816, 36 L.Ed.2d 567 (1973)] inasmuch as they are not promulgated pursuant to a delegation by Congress of authority to legislate. Instead, courts remain free to substitute their judgment for that of the agency in determining how the statute or regulation is to be implemented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\"><em>Daughters of Miriam Center, supra, </em>590 F.2d at 1258; <em>see Cerro Metal Products, supra, </em>620 F.2d at 981-82; <em>Buczynski v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>616 F.2d at 1242; <em>Baker v. Otis Elevator Co., supra, </em>609 F.2d at 691; <em>see also Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944) (identifying certain factors to be weighed in this connection). This seemingly broad-sweeping statement must be qualified in two related respects, however, lest the conclusion be drawn that courts enjoy a license to substitute their own predilections for admittedly valid interpretations of a statute arrived at by an agency. First, the Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed that \u201cgreat deference\u201d be accorded \u201cthe interpretation given [a] statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>see EPA </em>v. <em>National Crushed Stone Association, </em>449 U.S. 64, 83, 101 S.Ct. 295, 306, 66 L.Ed.2d 268 (1980); <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v.

Youakim, </em>440 U.S. 125, 144 n.25, 99 S.Ct. 957, 968, 59 L.Ed.2d 194 (1979); <em>Zenith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number><em>Radio Corp. v.

Second, the Court has cautioned, albeit in a context not directly involving interpretative rulemaking, that to sustain an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term, a court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-5\">need not find that [the agency\u2019s] construction is the only reasonable one, or even that it is the result [the court] would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings. . . . All that is needed to support the [agency\u2019s] interpretation is that it has \u201cwarrant in the record\u201d and a \u201creasonable basis in law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\"><em>Unemployment Compensation Commission of Alaska v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153-54, 67 S.Ct. 245, 250, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">Applying these principles to the present appeal, we conclude, that the interpretative rule set forth by HHS in the OCSE transmittal constitutes a valid exercise of administrative authority. First, in accordance with our earlier analysis, we are of the opinion that the agency correctly interpreted the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A) insofar as it relates to the filing of new applications. In \u201csubstitutpng our] judgment for that of the agency in determining how the statute ... is to be implemented,\u201d then, we arrive at precisely the same result as did HHS: that signed, post-1975 applications are necessary under the Act. Second, even were we less convinced that section 654(6)(A), on its face, requires that new applications be obtained from non-AFDC individuals, we would be inclined to defer to the interpretation given the Child Support Enforcement Act by HHS, the \u201cagency charged with its administration.\u201d None of the previously discussed arguments proffered by New Jersey persuades us that HHS\u2019 new application requirement, even if not directly mandated by the Act, is in any way inconsistent with or inimical to the overall IV \u2014 D scheme envisioned and enacted by Congress.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Having reached such a conclusion, our inquiry is at an end. New Jersey\u2019s contention that the OCSE instruction should be invalidated because \u201cthere appears to be no rational basis\u201d why certain pre-1975 documents <em>(e.g., </em>court orders) would not suffice for IV-D application purposes, Brief for Petitioner at 15-16, fundamentally misperceives the scope of our review with respect to interpretative rules. Having determined that HHS\u2019 construction of section 654(6)(A) has a \u201creasonable basis in law,\u201d we are not at liberty to adopt the alternative reading urged by New Jersey, however rational or desirable its likely result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">We hold, therefore, that whether or not the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A) is construed as specifically conferring power on HHS to require new applications, HHS had sufficient authority, pursuant to its own interpretative rule, to deny reimbursement to New Jersey for IV \u2014 D services provided to non-AFDC individuals from whom no application has been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the orders of the HHS Departmental Grant Appeals Board will be affirmed and the petitions for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">.

One sponsor of an amendment to the Social Security Act that provided for judicial review of HHS administrative decisions inserted in the <em>Congressional Record </em>the following recommendation from a 1964 report of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-6\">Some States and local officials believe that some form of judicial review should encompass all aspects of the public assistance programs, including matching issues or audit exceptions. However, the much greater concern is for review of decisions regarding plan-conformity issues. The Commission believes that to involve audit exceptions or issues other than those of plan conformity in the judicial review process would create many additional problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">Ill Cong.Rec. 3068 (1965) (remarks of Sen. Javits). One court of appeals apparently has accepted, albeit in dictum, the argument that no judicial review is available with respect to \u00a7 1316(d) disallowances. <em>See Texas Department of Public Welfare v. Califano, </em>556 F.2d 326, 329 &amp; n.4 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 818, 99 S.Ct. 78, 58 L.Ed.2d 108 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1335-10\">.

Perhaps the best distinction between matters appropriate for resolution under \u00a7 1316(a) and those appropriate for resolution under \u00a7 1316(d) can be found in the Senate Report that discusses the Social Security Act\u2019s judicial review provisions: Plan-conformity questions \u201cconcern[ ] State plan proposals\u201d and \u201cinvolve discontinuance of Federal payments under part or all of a State plan\u201d; disallowance determinations, on the other hand, \u201cusually take the form of audit exceptions\u201d and \u201coccur when the Secretary disallows specific State expenditures for Federal financial participation.\u201d S.Rep.

It is arguable that the <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare </em>approach to the \u00a7 1316 jurisdiction problem was not followed in recent decisions of the Sixth and Ninth Circuits. <em>See Department of Public Health, State of Tennessee v. Departmental Grant Appeals Board, HHS, </em>672 F.2d 916 (6th Cir. 1981); <em>State of Washington, Department of Social and Health Services v. Schweiker, </em>No. 81-7414 (9th Cir. Sept. 29, 1981). In the <em>State of Washington </em>decision, a two-Judge motions panel, in a two-paragraph order, granted HHS\u2019 motion to dismiss a petition for review on the ground that \u201c[\u00a1jurisdiction to review the disallowance determination, made under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(d), lies in the district court and not in this court.\u201d We recognize that it is possible to interpret this decision as holding that the Secretary\u2019s administrative categorization of a dispute should be controlling for \u00a7 1316 jurisdiction purposes, <em>i.e., </em>should the Secretary proceed under \u00a7 1316(d), jurisdiction lies with the district court, but should the Secretary follow \u00a7 1316(a), review at the court of appeals level would be appropriate. The <em>State of Washington </em>court gave no reason for its order, however. In our opinion, it is just as likely that the Ninth Circuit, rather than rejecting <em>sub silentio </em>the functional analysis adopted in <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare, </em>instead concluded on the basis of the facts presented in Washington\u2019s petition, that the administrative action under review was properly classified as a disal-lowance determination by HHS in the first place. This reading is buttressed by the fact that the Ninth Circuit cites <em>Medical Services Administration </em>in support of its order to dismiss. As noted previously, <em>Medical Services Administration </em>explicitly employed the underlying-nature-of-the-dispute analysis set forth in <em>Texas Department of Public Welfare. </em>Similarly, in <em>State of Tennessee, </em>the court noted that \u201cthere was no finding of failure to comply with the state plan,\u201d and therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction a petition to review HHS\u2019 disallowance of certain funds on the ground that Tennessee had failed to establish \u201cthe required control over utilization of [certain Medicaid] services\u201d pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(l). For present purposes, however, it should be realized that the Sixth Circuit dismissed the petition only after observing that \u201cit appears that this reduction is a \u2018disallowance,\u2019 \u201d and after citing <em>Medical Services Administration.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">. This argument assumes, of course, that if these petitions were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, some sort of judicial review would be available at the district court level. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. An additional justification for court-of-appeals-level review of a case such as the present might be proffered were it well established that, contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>holding of <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>disallowance determinations are unreviewable in <em>any </em>court. If such a situation existed, courts would have every incentive to construe the reach of the plan-conformity procedures broadly, lest significant legal disputes be unreviewable due to inartful drafting of \u00a7 1316.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">. It should be stressed that we do not hold that New Jersey is entitled to \u00a7 1316(a) review merely because its challenge to the HHS \u201cdisal-lowance\u201d is premised on legal, as opposed to factual, grounds. Had Congress wanted courts of appeals to review directly all legal matters surrounding the administration of a state\u2019s Social Security-type programs, it of course could have written \u00a7 1316 accordingly. Instead, Congress chose, for whatever reasons, to limit the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal appellate courts only to those situations involving plan conformity. Neither do we wish to imply that <em>any </em>administrative disallowance can be reviewed directly in this Court as long as the protesting state asserts that the disallowance \u201creally\u201d raises compliance-r\u00e9lated questions. We do not, after all, resort to such legal legerdemain in this case. Rather, we have independently reviewed the substance of the particular dispute involved here, and have concluded that the question of plan conformity lies at the heart of the claims of which New Jersey seeks review. It is precisely for this- reason that \u00a7 1316(a) review can be justified. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">. As mentioned previously, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.-33(a) duplicates the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(6)(A), with one important exception: whereas the statute states that IV-D applications are to be filed \u201cwith the State,\u201d the regulation directs that such' applications be filed \u201cwith the IV D agency.\u201d We reject New Jersey\u2019s contention that Regulation 302.33(a) \u201cprovides mere restatement of the statutory directive,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner at 2. In our view, it is difficult to conceive that the regulation sanctions the use of anything other than post-1975 applications inasmuch as the regulation mandates that applications be filed with various agencies that did not even exist prior to 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">. In this connection, we agree with the conclusion of the HHS Departmental Grant Appeals Board, that if, as the Fant affidavit indicates, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-5\">non-AFDC recipients refused to sign new applications on the advice of counsel, an informed decision to forgo further services was made. Since the Act provides for the furnishing of services to non-AFDC recipients only upon request, the continued provision of services under such circumstances would appear to be improper. It is not our duty to inquire into the reasons why such advice was given by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">Dec. No. 135 (Nov. 28, 1980), App. at 5a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">. Because we hold, as a matter of statutory construction, that section 654(6)(A) mandates that new IV-D applications be obtained from non-AFDC recipients, we are unable to accede to New Jersey\u2019s request, Brief for Petitioner at 23-25, that, at a minimum, we reverse disal-lowances imposed by HHS as to the initial quarters during which the application requirement was enforced by HHS. We note, however, that the Grant Appeals Board found that there was \u201csome merit\u201d to New Jersey\u2019s contention that, despite its good faith efforts, it did not have enough time to obtain approximately 55,000 new applications between July 19, 1976, the date when the OCSE instruction was received, and August 1, 1976, the date when the disallowances commenced. Accordingly, the Board recommended that HHS, after further discussions with the State, \u201cset another time and reduce the amount of the disallowance to the extent that it determines appropriate.\u201d Dec.
