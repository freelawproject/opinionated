Code Ann. \u00a7 28-304. The District Court held that Iowa\u2019s borrowing statute, Iowa Code \u00a7 614.7, when considered along with the borrowing statute of Missouri, Overland\u2019s domicile, Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 516.190, required it to apply the Tennessee statute of limitations, and therefore dismissed the action. 531 F.Supp. 210 (S.D.Iowa 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-20\">We affirm. The question in this case turns on the interpretation of the Iowa borrowing statute in somewhat unusual circumstances. Plaintiff complains that the District Court has adopted a species of the doctrine of <em>renvoi, </em>a doctrine, he says, that has never been approved by the Supreme Court of Iowa, which is, of course, the final arbiter of Iowa conflict-of-laws rules. For us it is sufficient that the District Court\u2019s construction of the state statute is not inconsistent with any opinion of the Supreme Court of Iowa, that that court has never disapproved the doctrine of <em>renvoi, </em>and that such precedents as exist in Iowa seem, for reasons ably set out by the District Court, to point towards application of the Tennessee limitations period in this case. We agree both with the result and with the reasoning of the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">This disposition of Drudge\u2019s appeal makes it unnecessary to deal with Overland\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>cross-appeal from the denial of its alternative motion for transfer of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-22\">.
