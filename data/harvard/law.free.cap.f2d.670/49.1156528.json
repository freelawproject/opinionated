(collectively \u201cRo-senthal\u201d) seek review under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(g) of an order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) issued in a reparation proceeding conducted pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18. In its order the Commission denied review of a decision by an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) which awarded Gerald C. Martin reparation plus interest. The ALJ based his decision <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon a violation of Commission rule 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a finding the Commission left undisturbed. With the Commission\u2019s order denying review, the ALJ\u2019s decision became final, prompting Rosenthal\u2019s appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-24\">This dispute flows from the sale by Ro-senthal to Martin of two London sugar call options.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In July 1976, Martin received an unsolicited telephone call from Jay Sills, a registered associated person<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Rosenthal <em>&amp; </em>Co. at its Houston office, who interested Martin in purchasing a London sugar option. Martin subsequently purchased a March 1977, London call option for the total cost of $4,458.94. That same day Martin, a novice in securities and commodities trading, opened an unrelated account for trading commodity futures contracts with another firm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two days later Martin signed a number of documents received from Rosenthal, one of which was a disclosure statement. From July until September the fortuneless Martin, often conferring with Sills, watched the sugar market decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Sometime in September 1976, Martin discovered that Sills had left Rosenthal &amp; Co. and that John Anderson, an associated person and employee of Rosenthal &amp; Co., had taken over his account. At Anderson\u2019s urging, Martin purchased another option, this time a May 1977, London sugar call option at a total cost of $3,011.90. In due time, both of the options expired and Martin lost his entire investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The ALJ held that Rosenthal violated the Commission\u2019s anti-fraud regulation, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981), in that Rosenthal misrepresented to Martin the risks involved in trading London sugar options. Fantastic sugar profits were described, anywhere from $30,000 to $60,000, with virtually no chance of a loss. Moreover, the sugar market was pictured as being on the verge of skyrocketing. Against this tableau, the ALJ held that Rosenthal\u2019s risk disclosure was similar to the disclosure in <em>Kelley v. Carr, </em>where the \u201cdisclosure of risk was not emphasized, indeed it was generally omitted entirely.\u201d 442 F.Supp. 346, 354-55 (W.D.Mich.1977). Ordered to pay Martin reparations, Rosenthal filed its unsuccessful petition with the Commission for a review of the order. In this court Rosenthal principally makes two arguments: first, the Commission erred in that a violation of Commission rule 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981), requires a finding of willfulness or scienter; second, the requirement in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(g) that an aggrieved and appealing party post a bond for double the amount of the award deprives Rosenthal of equal protection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In response to Rosenthal\u2019s first argument, the Commission contends that Rosenthal\u2019s failure to raise before the Commission the issue of whether a violation of Commission rule 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981), must be willful precludes our consideration of that issue. As a general rule, in considering a petition for review from a final agency order, the courts will not consider questions of law which were neither presented to nor passed on by the agency. <em>United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, </em>344 U.S. 33, 36-37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 68-69, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952); <em>Board of Public Instruction v. Finch, </em>414 F.2d 1068, 1073 (5th Cir. 1969). Practical notions of judicial efficiency, administrative autonomy and encouraging effective agency procedures provide the basis for the general rule. <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 195, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Rosenthal candidly admits that the issue of willfulness was not the subject of the initial decision and that on review of the decision it did not raise the issue before the Commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rosenthal, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>makes two arguments in its attempt to avoid the general rule. Rosenthal first argues that because the Commission raised the willfulness issue in its opinion and order reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision, Rosenthal did not have notice and a fair opportunity to respond to that issue. As a result, Rosen-thal contends it can raise the scienter issue for the first time before this court. Rosen-thal also argues that it raised the scienter issue in the administrative proceedings in its answer to Martin\u2019s complaint. In the answer, Rosenthal asserted as an affirmative defense its contention that the reparation proceedings violated due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">We find Rosenthal\u2019s arguments meritless. In making its first argument Rosenthal fails to refer the court to language in the Commission\u2019s order raising the issue of scienter. It does so for good reason: the order does not advance the issue. The Commission merely reviewed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Nor is the second contention any stronger. Nothing in Rosenthal\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d contention before the Commission was in any way related to the question of whether the Commission rule embodies the scienter requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The general rule of nonreviewability is not absolute. In exceptional circumstances a court will review for the first time on appeal a particular challenge to an agency\u2019s decision which was not raised during the agency proceedings. <em>Board of Public Instruction v. Finch, </em>414 F.2d at 1072-73. In <em>Finch </em>this court found an exception to the general rule after determining that the action of the agency was (1) in excess of statutory authority, (2) likely to result in individual injustice, (3) disruptive of the legislative scheme and (4) contrary to an important public policy extending beyond the rights of the individual litigants. <em>Id. </em>at 1073. After considering each of the <em>Finch </em>factors, however, we feel that they are inapplicable in the instant case. Consequently the general rule applies and precludes our consideration of whether a violation of Commission rule 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981), requires scienter. We now turn to Rosenthal\u2019s equal protection argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Rosenthal\u2019s equal protection contentions center around 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(g), a provision requiring the party appealing from a reparation order entered by the Commission to post a bond in double the amount of the reparation award. Rosenthal argues that the double bond requirement as applied to commodity professionals, such as itself, is a prima facie denial of equal protection since the Commission only orders commodity professionals to pay reparation awards, and thus only commodity professionals must post a double bond in order to appeal the Commission\u2019s reparation orders. A review of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>and the Commission rules, however, reveals that Rosenthal\u2019s prima facie violation argument has no merit. Commission rule 12.23(b)(2), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.-23(b)(2) (1981),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> authorizes registered commodity professionals to file counterclaims in reparation proceedings, making possible recovery by a registered commodity professional against the complainant. Moreover, the double bond language in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(g) does not limit the posting of a double bond to commodity professionals; rather, it requires \u201cthe appellant\u201d to post a double bond.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, if a eommodi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ty customer seeks judicial review of a Commission order requiring the customer to pay a reparation award to a registered commodity professional, the customer must file a bond in double the amount of the award. In contrast with 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(g), other subsections of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18 explicitly refer to registered commodity professionals and reflect Congress\u2019 intent that they apply solely to those professionals. <em>Compare </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(g) (\u201cappellant also files with the clerk of the court a bond . . . \u201d) <em>with </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(a) (\u201cany violation ... by any person who is registered or required to be registered . . . \u201d) <em>and </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(h) (\u201cUnless the registrant against whom a reparation order has been issued . . . \u201d). Since the double bond requirement applies equally to all persons whom the Commission has ordered to pay a reparation award, Rosenthal is not denied equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In addition to its prima facie equal protection argument, Rosenthal implies that the bond requirement violates the principle of equal protection implicit in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, relying heavily on <em>O\u2019Day v. George Arakelian Farms, Inc., </em>536 F.2d 856 (9th Cir. 1976). By discussing <em>O\u2019Day, </em>Rosenthal implies that the instant double bond requirement violates equal protection in that it impermissibly denies indigents an appeal from a Commission reparation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Its argument, however, is not its case. Unlike the appellant in <em>O\u2019Day, </em>who, due to an alleged lack of financial resources, did not file a double bond as required by statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rosenthal filed a double bond. Indeed, Rosenthal does not argue financial hardship. Generally \u201cone to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.\u201d <em>United States v. Raines, </em>362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 522, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960); <em>accord, McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 429, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1107, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). Rosenthal cannot assert another\u2019s cause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-11\">.

Rosenthal\u2019s argument misconstrues the Act and is without merit: 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18(c) states the Commission shall determine whether the respondent violated a provision of the Act or <em>any rule or regulation </em>promulgated under the Act. The ALJ found Rosenthal in violation of Commission rule 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981), a decision which became the Commission\u2019s final decision. Thus, in finding Rosenthal in violation of 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1981), the Commission complied with the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b115-14\">.

Rosenthal argues for the first time in its reply brief that the Commission, in not considering the record as a whole, deprived it of due process of law. Rosenthal assert^ that the Commission disregarded the evidence of risk disclosure which was part of the record. Tardiness of this argument aside, a reading of the decisions below show that the argument has no merit.
