Specifically, we have been asked to find that a prosecutor is prohibited from questioning or commenting on the defendant\u2019s failure to provide an exculpatory explanation when confronted by police in what has been alleged to be a custodial detention prior to arrest. The facts of this case, however, do not support petitioner\u2019s premise that a custodial detention occurred prior to his arrest as we fail to detect the slightest existence of mandatory confinement. We therefore decline the petitioner\u2019s invitation. We conclude that absent the custodial detention alleged by petitioner, the facts are controlled by the recent Supreme Court decision of <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980), which permits impeachment of a defendant with his pre-arrest silence. The District Court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Early on the morning of December 8, 1973, the police arrived at the home of the defendant, Walter B. Lebowitz, to execute a search warrant. The object of the search was a purse allegedly stolen by one of the defendant\u2019s clients and thought to be in the possession of the defendant. The maid met the officers at the door and permitted them to enter the house. She announced the officer\u2019s presence to Lebowitz, who met them as he descended from his upstairs bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">The officers explained their presence to Lebowitz and read the search warrant to him. The defendant was not asked nor did he volunteer any information as to the location of the purse. Within the next three to five minutes the officers located the purse in a dressing room area adjacent to the upstairs bedroom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As soon as one of the officers found the purse, he brought it into the bedroom area where the defendant had been sitting. Lebowitz was immediately advised of his rights after which he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-19\">During his trial, the prosecution called two of the police officers to testify. The first officer testified that they entered the house, encountered Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lebowitz, and proceeded to search the defendant\u2019s bedroom and adjoining dressing rooms. On cross examination defense counsel questioned why the police officers had not asked the defendant where the purse was located.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second officer provided further details of the purse\u2019s discovery. Once again on cross examination, defense counsel questioned the officer as to whether the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>ant had been asked the location of the purse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">During presentation of the defense, Le-bowitz provided extensive testimony on the search and attempted to prove that the purse had been given to him by a client as partial payment for services rendered. During his direct testimony his attorney asked: \u201cDid any of the police officers who came to the house ask you if you had a purse such as this, and if so, would you go ahead and get it for him?\u201d The defendant answered: \u201cIf any of them would have said, \u2018Do you have such a purse, and if so, would you please give it to me,\u2019 I would have gone to get it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor then followed up on this testimony as he questioned the defendant on whether he had volunteered any help in locating the purse or volunteered the explanation which he now set forth as a defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At no time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>during the course of cross examination did defense counsel lodge an objection to this line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">In his closing argument the prosecutor made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-6\">Here\u2019s a man, the police come to his house. Knock knock. They let them in. The maid advises him the police are here. They have a search warrant. Now, that might take you by surprise or it might take most people by surprise, but this man is a lawyer. You\u2019re dealing in his field. So, he goes down there and the police read him the warrant and they describe the stolen property and they go into the description of the purse. Now, from your common sense, from your everyday experience, what does the person whose heart is pure, who\u2019s an innocent person, a possible victim of circumstances, say at that point? Oh, my God, I got a purse like that up in my bedroom.' A client gave it to me the other day as a gift. Does he say, wait a minute, fellows, I know I must have a receipt here someplace. He showed it to me. You don\u2019t have to search my house, gentlemen. I\u2019ve got that purse. Let me get it for you. And, I want to give you a statement right now where I got it from, who gave it to me. And, I will stand as a witness if there\u2019s criminal charges to be brought out of this thing, and see that that man is prosecuted. Or, do you say, go ahead and search. Not from the testimony of George Foley. The Miami Beach Police said that. What do you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-15\">What did he say when they read the warrant to him? He invited us to go ahead and search. Now, that was very generous of Mr. Lebowitz, five policemen there with a search warrant. That was very generous of him to say go ahead and search. Are you satisfied that that\u2019s an honest man standing there? Or, is that consistent with the man who knows that he\u2019s been had, that he\u2019s been caught, that he\u2019s trapped with the evidence in his home?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">Defense counsel made no objection to this comment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of guilty of possession of stolen property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-17\"> It is the prosecutor\u2019s cross examination and closing remarks on the defendant\u2019s failure to volunteer any information concerning the purse which serves as the basis of the constitutional violation alleged in his petition. We do not find the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>this case support the defendant\u2019s theory that a custodial detention took place prior to his arrest. Absent such a finding, we decline to hold the comment in this case violated the defendant\u2019s fourteenth amendment right to due' process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The substance of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the cross examination and prosecutorial comment on his silence during the execution' of the search warrant violated his right to fundamental fairness as mandated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He argues that recent United States Supreme Court decisions should not be read to draw the line on constitutionally permissible comment on the basis of whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given or the actual arrest has taken place. He proposes that the \u201cgovernmental action\u201d \u2022 standard set forth in the Court\u2019s most recent opinion is satisfied by the execution of the search warrant which occurred here. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">In recent years the United States Supreme Court has provided us with two major opinions regarding the use of a defendant\u2019s silence for impeachment purposes. In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1975), the Court held that use of post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings for impeachment was \u201cfundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245. Subsequently, the Court clarified the parameters of <em>Doyle </em>in <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">Jenkins had been convicted of manslaughter in Michigan state court. During his trial he testified that he had acted in self-defense. The prosecutor attempted to impeach his credibility by questioning why he had failed to assert this story prior to his surrender to the police.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court found the facts in <em>Jenkins </em>clearly distinguishable from <em>Doyle. </em>In <em>Jenkins </em>\u201cno governmental action induced petitioner to remain silent before arrest. The failure to speak occurred before the petitioner was taken into custody and given <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 100 S.Ct. at 2130. Thus the Court found the fundamental unfairness it had detected in <em>Doyle </em>did not exist in <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">Lebowitz contends the facts surrounding his silence fall within a void left by the <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Jenkins </em>opinions and has provided this Court with a helpful graphic illustration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Alleged Crime Contact with Police Arrest <em>Miranda </em>Warnings</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Time Line-<em>Jenkins: </em>Comment on silence at this phase\u2014 permitted <em>Lebowitz Doyle: </em>Comment on silence at \u2022 this phase\u2014 prohibited</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\"><em>Bradley v. Jago, </em>594 F.2d 1100 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 847, 100 S.Ct. 94, 62 L.Ed.2d 61 (1979)\u2014comment permitted <em>United States ex rel. Smith v. Franzen, </em>660 F.2d 237 (7th Cir. 1981)\u2014comment prohibited <em>Weir v. Fletcher, </em>658 F.2d 1126 (6th Cir. 1981)\u2014comment prohibited <em>People v. Conyers, </em>52 N.Y.2d 454, 420 N.E.2d 933, 438 N.Y.S.2d 741 (1981)\u2014comment prohibited</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-22\">The facts in this case do fall somewhere between the post-arrest silence in <em>Doyle </em>and the pre-arrest silence in <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-23\">In <em>Jenkins </em>the defendant\u2019s silence occurred prior to <em>any </em>contact with the police. In the present case, Lebowitz was confronted by the police in their execution of a valid search warrant. However, the silence commented upon in this case undisputedly occurred prior to the arrest of the defendant and prior to a reading of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. It therefore falls outside the protection set forth in <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-24\">We are cognizant of recent opinions from other jurisdictions which have sought to travel this difficult time line and have anchored their decisions along its treacherous course. <em>See United States ex rel. Smith v. Franzen, </em>660 F.2d 237 (7th Cir. 1981); <em>Weir v. Fletcher, </em>658 F.2d 1126 (6th Cir. 1981); <em>People </em>v. <em>Conyers, </em>52 N.Y.2d 454, 420 N.E.2d 933, 438 N.Y.S.2d 741 (1981). In each, the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s silence have varied causing the court\u2019s decisions to contain helpful analysis, but no definitive answer to the case before us.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nevertheless, each court has clearly delineated the point of arrest as the line of demarcation where prosecutorial comment and cross examination on the defendant\u2019s silence becomes constitutionally impermissible. Due to the variety of circumstances that may occur in the course of an arrest, we refrain from suggesting a universal answer to the question of how much \u201cgovernmental action\u201d is required before comment becomes impermissible. We are certain, however, that something more than mere confrontation is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>The defendant claims that the execution of the search warrant constitutes sufficient \u201cgovernmental action.\u201d He asserts that the three to five minute confrontation with the police amounted to a custodial detention depriving him of his freedom in a significant way. It is with this assertion that we must depart from the defendant\u2019s analysis. When all of the testimony is read and taken as a whole, it is apparent that the Lebowitz family was not mandatorily confined.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It was not until the moment of arrest that a custodial detention took place. We decline to hold that the facts of this case satisfied the \u201cgovernmental action\u201d requirement of <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">\u201cA <em>failure to assert </em>a fact, when it would have been natural to assert it, amounts in effect to an assertion of the non-existence of the fact.\u201d 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1042, p. 1056 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). It is this general rule under which silence finds its probative value. \u201cEach jurisdiction may formulate its own rule of evidence to determine when prior silence is so inconsistent with present statements that impeachment by reference to such silence is probative.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>447 U.S. at 239, 100 S.Ct. at 2129. In this case, the Florida courts ruled that the cross examination and comment on Lebowitz\u2019s silence during the execution of the search was probative and thus did not constitute a violation of due process. As the Third District Court of Appeal stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-19\">[W]e think the state\u2019s cross-examination was a logical and common sense test of the appellant\u2019s credibility and one which the appellant certainly invited by his own testimony on direct examination. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>deed, we think that to have denied the state the right to point out the appellant\u2019s previous silence, in light of his elaborate version at trial . . . would have been unfair to the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\"><em>Lebowitz v. State, </em>313 So.2d 473, 477, <em>cert. denied, </em>330 So.2d 19 (Fla.1976). In view of the state court\u2019s determination, we find no constitutional violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. \u201cThe fact that the defendant did not offer the exculpatory explanation when he had an earlier opportunity to do so is evidence which the jury is entitled to hear, and from which it may draw reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Jago, </em>594 F.2d 1103 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 847, 100 S.Ct. 94, 62 L.Ed.2d 61 (1979). The District Court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">.

In describing the pocketbook to him in the search warrant, he did not volunteer any information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-21\">Q. Of course he didn\u2019t volunteer any information, but'you asked him, you took it upon yourselves to ask him where his bedroom was, Sergeant. Why didn\u2019t you say to him, Mr. Lebowitz, you know him as an attorney, did you not, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-22\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-23\">Q. All right. And why didn\u2019t you just say to Mr. Lebowitz, do you have a purse, and describe it to him, and say if so, would you mind going and getting it for me? Why didn\u2019t you say that to him?</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-24\">A. I felt the purse, the description and the reason why we were there was self-explanatory as far as the search warrant having been read to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-25\">T.

Why didn\u2019t you, sir, before going into the dressing room to make your job that much easier, say, Mr. Lebowitz, do you have, or does your wife have a purse such as that which I have described to you? Why didn\u2019t you do that, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">A. He invited us to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">Q. Did you ask him anything about the purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">A. No, sir, I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-15\">T. Tr. at 319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-16\">The State asserts that this line of cross examination by defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d or invited the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent cross examination and comment. Because we find the circumstances insufficient to bar impeachment by use of the defendant\u2019s silence, it is unnecessary for us to examine the prosecutor\u2019s actions on this assertion. Nevertheless, these questions do appear to encourage a prosecutor\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1040-17\">. T.

The Florida Supreme Court denied certiorari for the second time. <em>Lebowitz v. State, </em>366 So.2d 882 (Fla.1977). This time the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Following the entry of an order committing the defendant to custody, he filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">. The State of Florida suggests that a decision on the merits of this appeal is barred by <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). We disagree. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>held that a state court\u2019s refusal to reach the merits of a case because of a state contemporaneous objection rule precluded federal habeas corpus relief absent a showing of \u201ccause and prejudice.\u201d It did not, however, bar federal habeas corpus relief when the state court addressed the merits of the case. When this occurs, <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>does not apply and there is no need to show cause and prejudice. \u201cThus the rule is that \u2018if the state courts entertained the federal claims on the merits, a federal habeas corpus court must also determine the merits of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ratcliff v.

As we find the Florida courts addressed the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we perceive no bar under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1042-14\">. <em>Doyle </em>involved a conviction in state court for selling marijuana. During the trial, the prosecutor cross examined the defendants as to why they had not told their exculpating story prior to taking the stand at trial. The Court found that once they had been arrested and advised of their right to remain silent, it was impermissible for the prosecutor to use the exercise of their right to remain silent in order to impeach their testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1042-15\">.

Franzen </em>involved a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to come forward with his alibi defense after arrest, but prior to trial. On remand from the United States Supreme Court, the Seventh Circuit held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights. In <em>Weir v. Fletcher, </em>the Sixth Circuit divided numerous questions posed by the prosecution into those concerning pre-arrest silence and others involving post-arrest silence. The court found no constitutional impropriety in the questions regarding pre-arrest silence, but did find a violation of due process in the questioning on the defendant\u2019s silence after arrest, but prior to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Finally, in <em>People v. Co-nyers, </em>the New York Court of Appeals, on remand from the United States Supreme Court, found the use of the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence lacked sufficient probative value under the New York rules of evidence to be used for impeachment. The court did, however, refrain from deciding the case on state or federal constitutional principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">. Neither police officer indicated that the Le-bowitz family had been instructed to confine themselves to the bedroom. Yet, each officer was cross examined on the sequence of events that transpired and any conversations that had taken place during that time. On direct examination, Lebowitz stated: \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Y\u2019all go sit in the bedroom and we\u2019re going to search this house.\u2019 \u201d T. Tr. at 758. During cross examination, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-6\">A. And, I was told to go directly to the bedroom with my family and not leave the room. And, 1 followed their instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6r\">Q. Just a second.

You weren\u2019t under arrest, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACZ\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-9\">Q. They were just standing there reading the warrant to you, explained to you why they were there, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-10\">A.

They didn\u2019t tell you you were under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-14\">A. No. They did tell me to go in the bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-15\">Q. And that was after they read the warrant to you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-17\">T. Tr., at 869-70. On redirect, defense counsel asked: \u201cThen after reading this entire document [search warrant], was it then that they told you and your wife and daughter to go in the bedroom?\u201d The defendant answered: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d T. Tr. at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-21\">This testimony does not indicate that the defendant had been placed in custodial detention. Rather, it appears that the officers suggested the most convenient area for the family to stay while the search was undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-22\">Moreover, even if more fully developed facts might indicate that defendant was placed in custodial detention by virtue of the request that defendant and his family wait in the bedroom, we would nevertheless affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. The thrust of the questions, and the prosecutor\u2019s comment relating to defendant\u2019s failure to offer an explanation, clearly refer to that period of time during the reading of the search warrant and immediately thereafter. In other words, the reference is to that period of time before the officer requested defendant and his family to wait in the bedroom. These questions and the prosecutor\u2019s comment clearly refer to a period of time that is both before any arrest and before there is any evidence at all of custodial detention. We hold that such questions and comment are proper under <em>Jenkins. </em>The few questions which might refer to the period of time after defendant went to the bedroom, assuming arguendo that defendant could show that this amounted to custodial detention, would be merely cumulative of the preceding proper questions, and, under all the facts and circumstances of this case, would be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>546 F.2d 583 (5th Cir. 1977). <em>See also United States v.

The conviction is logically affirmed on the \u201cinvited error\u201d or waiver rule. No objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument was asserted by the defense. The defense broached the issue of silence by cross-examining the police about why defendant was not asked where the purse was located. Then counsel argued to the jury that the police should have inquired into the location of the purse. (See text accompanying notes 2-6, majority opinion.) However, the majority holds that a person in his own home is not in custodial detention while the police search the house pursuant to a search warrant. This is completely unnecessary in reaching.a decision in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
