We hereby grant the request for rehearing and vacate those parts of Section III A which are inconsistent with this supplemental opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">Section III A examined Illinois Cities of Bethany\u2019s (\u201cCities\u201d) allegation that a wholesale electric power tariff, filed by CIPSCO under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d, and approved by FERC, was too high in comparison with CIPSCO\u2019s retail rates. Cities, a group of CIPSCO wholesale customers, claimed that they were being price squeezed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relying upon a Staff study that indicated that CIPSCO\u2019s profit margin was higher for its retail services than its wholesale services, <em>see </em>Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 16, 412, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) rejected Cities\u2019 claim. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 406-17. FERC affirmed that decision. <em>Id. </em>at 425. Because we read the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>F.P.C. v. Conway, </em>426 U.S. 271, 96 S.Ct. 1999, 48 L.Ed.2d 626 (1976) to permit the Commission, in the interests of competition, to adjust even cost-justified differentials, we remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>to allow the Commission, if it [found] that CIPSCO and petitioners [were] competitors, ... to reduce [CIPSCO\u2019s wholesale] rate to the higher of the \u2018lower end of the range of reasonableness\u2019 or that needed to eliminate the price squeeze, or to justify a higher rate by reference to other factors.\u201d <em>Illinois Cities, supra, </em>slip op. at 24. On rehearing, however, we have determined that no price squeeze exists so as to justify invocation of the <em>Conway </em>doctrine. We now <em>vacate </em>that decision and <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Our decision to remand was based upon our finding that the ALJ had erred initially in rejecting a <em>prima facie </em>price squeeze case <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> presented by Cities and subsequently in failing to determine whether CIPSCO\u2019s wholesale rate, although within the range of reasonableness, lay at the \u201clower end of the range of reasonableness,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>at a point <em>within </em>the range of reasonableness that would permit elimination of the price squeeze. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 21. Upon further reflection, inspired in part by the additional information and reformulated arguments in the petitions for rehearing and the responses thereto, we now conclude that we were mistaken in ordering the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The price squeeze case presented by Cities was based upon the <em>Alcoa </em>transfer price test. <em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, </em>148 F.2d 416, 436-38 (2d Cir. 1945) (hereinafter Alcoa). That test maintains that \u201c[i]f a vertically integrated entity cannot purchase at its own wholesale rates and still realize a profit at its own retail rates, then it can be concluded that the supplier has overcharged its wholesale customers.\u201d <em>Illinois Cities, supra, </em>slip op. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">The ALJ appears, however, to have misunderstood the appropriate transfer price test proffered. He concluded that \u201cit would place in the hands of the party alleging discrimination the ability to create the discriminatory premises either willfully or simply through an inefficient municipal operation.\u201d J.A. 416. Thus he viewed it as requiring an inquiry into whether a vertically integrated company could realize a profit by purchasing at its own wholesale rates and selling at the retail rates of the party alleging discrimination rather than at its own retail rates. Language in our original opinion <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> may inadvertently have contributed further to the confusion. Thus, both respondent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and intervenor,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in their petitions for rehearing, misconstrued our initial decision as \u201crequiring the Commission to lower wholesale electric utility rates whenever a municipal customer, competing with the utility for retail business, cannot pay the rate, and (while incurring its own costs) resell at a profit.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Properly understood, however, the transfer price test probes only whether the utility itself could buy or sell at its own prices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As such, it is similar to the method of analysis employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>in the Staff study relied upon by the ALJ <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which compares the company\u2019s rate of return on sales at both the wholesale and retail level to see whether the company is subsidizing lower retail prices through higher wholesale prices in order to compete against its wholesale customers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Both tests depend upon a proper allocation of wholesale and retail costs, and both seek to test whether there is a price discrimination <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 a non-cost justified differential\u2014 between wholesale and retail customers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, Cities\u2019 attempted use of the transfer price squeeze test to attack the findings of the Staff cost-of-service study is in fact not materially different from a direct attack upon the accuracy of the Staff study itself. Having acknowledged the discretion of the Commission to utilize its choice of an appropriate methodology <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to prove or disprove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>price discrimination, and having rejected Cities\u2019 frontal assault upon that methodology,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we should have found that Cities had failed to make out a price squeeze case. In sum, since the Staff study found that after fully allocating wholesale and retail costs the company\u2019s rate of return on wholesale sales was reasonable and indeed less than its rate of return on retail sales, there was no reason to believe that Cities was being price squeezed at all. <em>See </em>n.14 <em>supra. </em>And where no price squeeze case exists, there is no need to decide whether Conway<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> requires the ALJ to determine whether CIP-SCO\u2019s wholesale rate, although within the range of reasonableness, lay at a point <em>within </em>that range where it could or should be lowered to eliminate the price squeeze. Because we erred in remanding for the Commission to consider applying <em>Conway </em>to this case, we vacate our earlier decision on this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Conway </em>held that although the Commission lacked jurisdiction to fix retail rates, its jurisdiction to set wholesale rates allowed it to take retail rates into consideration where wholesale customers were price squeezed by dint either of the utility company\u2019s desire to drive out retail competitors or of the interplay between federally and locally regulated rates. .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">The Commission must arrive at a rate level deemed by it to be just and reasonable, but in doing so it must consider the tendered allegations that the proposed rates are discriminatory and anticompeti-tive.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Supreme Court upheld a decision of this court, <em>per </em>Leventhal, J., and observed that this court was \u201cquite correct\u201d in concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">When costs are fully allocated, both the retail rate and the proposed wholesale rate may fall within a zone of reasonableness, yet create a price squeeze between themselves. There would, at the very least, be latitude in the FPC to put wholesale rates in the lower range of the zone of reasonableness, without concern that overall results would be impaired, in view of the utility\u2019s own decision to depress certain retail revenues in order to curb the retail competition of its wholesale customers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">We read that language as permitting the Commission to adjust wholesale rates within a range of reasonableness to respond either to utility efforts to depress retail rates to meet competition, or to situations where the imperfections of regulation result in an unintended price squeeze. Since ratemaking is an inexact science, even <em>bona fide </em>allocations of costs between wholesale and retail operations may be imperfect or rates of return set by different regulators at the wholesale and retail levels may make it impossible for purchasing wholesalers, no matter how efficient, to compete at the retail level. In such cases, <em>Conway </em>acknowledges the Commission\u2019s discretion to press wholesale rates to the lower end of the zone of reasonableness. The <em>Conway </em>doctrine is not, however, we emphasize, designed to subsidize particular retail competitors. Rather, the doctrine allows the Commission some leeway where it finds that the process of price setting by regulation, and not the superior efficiency of the utility, might result in retail competitors being driven from the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Here, the requisite \u2022 proof that a price squeeze existed was not forthcoming and indeed was refuted by the Staff study. When costs were fully allocated between wholesale and retail operations, CIPSCO\u2019s wholesale profit margin was both reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ble and sufficiently lower than its retail profit margin so that there was no occasion for the Commission to exercise its <em>Conway </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate those parts of our initial decisions as are inconsistent with this supplemental opinion, and <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-13\">.

Under the price transfer test the vertically integrated company\u2019s costs of retail operations must be added to the product purchased at its wholesale rates to determine profitability, so the usefulness of that test depends upon an accurate identification of retail costs. If the company fails to realize a profit under this test, <em>indications </em>are that retail costs have been improperly transferred to the wholesale operations, (or, less likely, retail operations are inefficient). Under the methodology of the Staff study, wholesale and retail revenues over their respective incurred costs are compared. This method of analysis also depends upon a proper identification of wholesale and retail costs. If after wholesale and retail costs are fully allocated the company\u2019s wholesale profit margin is significantly greater than its retail profit margin, <em>indications </em>are that a price discrimination is occurring. Both methods of analysis are acceptable methods of establishing a price squeeze case. <em>See </em>J.A. at 625. Although the results of a cost of service study are phrased in terms of a profit differential, <em>see </em>Memorandum By The Cities of Bethany, Et Al. In Response To The \u201cMemorandum Amicus Curiae\u201d Filed By The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice at 4, like the price squeeze test, the cost of service study also seeks to determine whether the vertically integrated company maintains artificially high wholesale prices in order to squeeze out its retail competition. If, after costs are fully allocated, it appears that the wholesale rate of return of a vertically integrated company is reasonable and, in fact, lower than retail rate of return, it would appear that wholesale customers are not being price squeezed \u2014 indeed, the higher the retail rate of return <em>vis-a-vis </em>the wholesale rate of return, the greater the wholesale customer\u2019s discount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b254-11\">. <em>Illinois Cities, supra, </em>slip op. at 16 n.47; <em>see also San Antonio, Texas Acting By and Through Its City Public Service Board v.

The petitioners, wholesale customers of CIPSCO, challenge the substantive reasonableness of the tariff, as well as the Commission\u2019s decision to refrain from investigating CIPSCO\u2019s high operation and maintenance costs. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">On December 1,1977, CIPSCO filed tariff sheets with the Commission proposing increases in three wholesale rates: W \u2014 1, which governs sales to electric cooperatives, W-2, which covers sales to full-requirement <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> municipal customers, and W-3, which applies to sales to partial-requirement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> municipal customers. Though the electric cooperatives acquiesced in the new rates,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> several of the W-2 and W-3 customers formed the Illinois Municipal Group (\u201cpetitioners\u201d or \u201cCities\u201d) to protest the proposed rate increases. The Cities petitioned the Commission to intervene in the ratemaking proceeding as CIPSCO\u2019s opponent on December 27, 1977.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Three days later the Commission issued an order accepting the Company\u2019s W-l filing and permitting it to become effective without suspension on January 1, 1978.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the same order, however, the Commission conditionally accepted the Company\u2019s W-2 and W-3 tariffs pending determination of the issues raised by the Cities. The challenged rates went into effect subject to refund on January 2,1978, following a one-day suspension.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">Hearings were not held on the disputed issues until December, 1978.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The presiding Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued his Initial Decision, based on the record of 77 physical exhibits and 1,337 pages of transcript as well as briefs and reply briefs submitted by both parties, on July 26, 1979.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In his 72-page decision, the ALJ made some but not all of the adjustments to the Company\u2019s cost-of-service figures requested by the Cities and the Commission staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(\u201cStaff\u201d),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> upheld the Company\u2019s refusal to extend preferential rates contained in certain long-term contracts with one W-2 and one W-3 customer to the remaining customers in those rate categories; found that the Cities\u2019 failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case that a price squeeze inimical to the Company\u2019s wholesale customers existed; and recommended that the Commission investigate the Company\u2019s abnormally high operation and maintenance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Both parties filed briefs on exceptions to the Initial Decision with the Commission. Six months later, on February 21, 1980, the Commission issued an order summarily affirming the ALJ\u2019s opinion in all but two respects.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commission reversed the ALJ\u2019s recommendation of an investigation into the prudence of CIPSCO\u2019s management <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and his directive that CIPSCO be required to \u201cflow through\u201d its construction-related interest deductions on a current basis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Cities petitioned for rehearing on twelve issues, including its contract discrimination and price squeeze arguments, eight rate base or rate of return disputes, and the Commission\u2019s refusal to investigate CIP-SCO\u2019s management.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission denied this rehearing request by taking no action within the statutorily prescribed period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The Cities have petitioned this court for review of the Commission\u2019s order. CIPSCO moved for and was granted leave to intervene before this court in support of the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">II. THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Though the Cities preserved twelve arguments by their petition for rehearing, they present only six in this petition for direct review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Of those six, three were argued by one of the petitioners, the village of Rantoul, before this court in a challenge to a FERC order approving a previous CIP-SCO tariff.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This court affirmed the Commission\u2019s actions in that case in an unpublished memorandum opinion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Though that opinion does not bind our decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>this case,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> our review of the record in the i;?stant proceeding gives us no cause to question the outcome in <em>Rantoul </em>or its applicability to this case. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the Commission in this case as to those issues decided in <em>Rantoul,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and discuss in this opinion only those arguments presented here for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Petitioners raise three novel claims of error. They challenge first the Commission\u2019s decision to deny \u201cprice squeeze\u201d relief to the Cities, contending that they established that a price squeeze, as defined by the Commission\u2019s regulations, existed and thus that the Commission\u2019s adoption of the ALJ\u2019s finding that no price squeeze relief was warranted lacked a substantial eviden-tiary basis. Secondly, they claim the Commission erred in failing to normalize the excess generating capacity created by the opening of the new Newton power plant, thereby unreasonably inflating the rate base and corresponding rate assessments. Finally, they argue that the Commission\u2019s reversal of the ALJ\u2019s recommendation that FERC investigate CIPSCO\u2019s management constituted reversible error, and they ask this court to direct the Commission to undertake the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AQs\">A. <em>Price Squeeze</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The most serious of the Cities\u2019 allegations is that the challenged rates are set too high in comparison to CIPSCO\u2019s retail rates to allow the Cities to compete with CIPSCO for retail, especially high-volume retail,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> customers, and thus that FERC should have reduced those rates to \u201cthe lower end of the range of reasonableness.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Cities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>trace FERC\u2019s decision not to do so to the ALJ\u2019s acceptance of faulty cost of service estimates and his reliance on an inappropriate conceptual framework for analyzing the significance of those estimates. FERC maintains that the ALJ\u2019s analysis of petitioners\u2019 price squeeze complaint was correct, and that the petitioners failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for the existence of a price squeeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">1. <em>The Elements of a </em>Prime Facie <em>Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Though a fixture of antitrust law since the 1945 decision in <em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (\u201cAlcoa\u201d),</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>price squeeze complaints are relatively new to the regulated industries field. FERC routinely disclaimed jurisdiction over such arguments until 1976, when the Supreme Court held that they could be considered when determining whether a rate meets the antidiscrimination requirement of section 205(b) of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Following that decision, FERC promulgated guidelines for dealing with price squeeze complaints. Those guidelines established the criteria necessary to make out a <em>prima facie </em>price squeeze case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">(1) Specification of the filing utility\u2019s retail rate schedules with which the intervening wholesale customer is unable to compete due to purchased power costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">(2) A showing that a competitive situation exists in that the wholesale customer competes in the same market as the filing utility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">(3) A showing that the retail rates are lower than the proposed wholesale rates for comparable service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">(4) The wholesale customer\u2019s prospective rate for comparable retail service, i.e., the rate necessary to recover bulk power costs (at the proposed wholesale rate) and distribution costs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">(5) An indication of the reduction in the wholesale rate necessary to eliminate the price squeeze alleged.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">It should be noted that unlike the ordinary situation where a party who establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case is, as a matter of law, entitled to relief unless the defending party rebuts the case, the establishment of a <em>pri-ma facie </em>price squeeze case means only that enough has been shown to warrant inquiry into the price squeeze allegations to ascertain whether price discrimination exists. It is, the Commission assures us, merely the threshold<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which must be crossed to put the question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">Petitioners claim that they established a <em>prima facie </em>ease by comparing the wholesale rates W-2 and W-3 with the comparable<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> retail rates 9 and 9-B in ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>feet on January 2, 1978. At that time, the wholesale rates were higher than the retail rates for which petitioners would have been eligible based on their demand characteristics.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, on April 14, 1978, a new retail tariff went into effect,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> raising the 9 and 9-B retail rates above the W-2 and W-3 wholesale rates. Whether or not these new rates were annualized,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the ALJ found that petitioners would have paid more for their electric power purchases during the 1978 calendar year had they paid the retail rather than the wholesale rates. Therefore, he concluded that petitioners failed to establish the third element of a <em>prima facie </em>ease under the Commission\u2019s guidelines.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Petitioners challenge the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the revised retail tariffs. They claim that the proper comparison is always between the wholesale and retail rates in effect on the date of implementation of the revised wholesale tariff because \u201cCIPSCO had full discretion to wait until after a resolution of its retail rates before filing a wholesale increase.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, we find that the Commission had the discretion to consider the April retail rate increases when evaluating petitioners\u2019 price squeeze allegations. Petitioners overstate the utility\u2019s control over the timing of its rate increases given the inevitable regulatory process delays entailed in finalizing such rates;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we cannot ignore that lack of control when judging the reasonableness of the ALJ\u2019s actions. Moreover, while annualizing a new rate as opposed to averaging the rates in effect weighted by their periods of incidence may in some cases lead to unacceptably unrepresentative information regarding the existence of a price squeeze,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the ALJ\u2019s decision to annualize the increases here was not unreasonable in light of the proportion of the year they were actually in effect<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and the fact that the outcome, under the Commission\u2019s guidelines, would have been no different had the ALJ computed the costs to petitioners over the whole year based on the actual date of implementation of the new rates.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Petitioners further challenge the ALJ\u2019s finding that the wholesale rates were lower than the retail rates by arguing that a \u201ctrue comparison\u201d of the two rates requires that the wholesale rate be compared to an \u201cadjusted\u201d retail rate, that is, the retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>rate minus expenses associated with the costs of distribution.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This argument is a confusing variation<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> on petitioners\u2019 main argument: a frontal assault on FERC\u2019s price squeeze guidelines <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> as insufficiently sensitive to price squeeze possibilities. Petitioners point out that if retail and wholesale rates are equal (thus preventing wholesale customers from making a <em>prima facie </em>case under the Commission\u2019s guidelines), the wholesale customers will be unable to compete with the public utility for retail customers because they will inevitably incur some distribution costs, which will require them either to lose money or to increase their retail rate above that of the public utility \u2014 the classic price squeeze situation.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Therefore petitioners advocate utilization of the transfer-price test adhered to in many antitrust cases: \u201c[i]f a vertically integrated entity cannot purchase at its own wholesale rates and still realize a profit by selling at its own retail rates, then it can be concluded that the supplier has overcharged its wholesale customers.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The petitioners in another utility rate case before the Commission described the operation of this test in the electric utility context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">They argue that a utility performs three analytically distinct functions: generation, transmission and distribution. Generation and transmission are company-wide costs and do not vary with the type of customers taking the power. Distribution, on the other hand, is largely a retail cost since the municipals provide their own distribution. Thus, the cities argue that we should compare the wholesale rate for transmission and generation with the average retail rate for serving all customer classes with transmission and generation. Any disparity would be implicitly unjustified since these costs should be uniform company-wide. Consequently, the difference would show the amount of the price squeeze.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Petitioners attempted to show that under this test a price squeeze exists here by working the transfer price analysis forwards and backwards. First, petitioners subtracted costs they claim are associated only with the distribution function from the revenues that would have been collected from them had petitioners been charged for their electricity purchases under the retail rates 9 and 9-B. The difference, according to petitioners\u2019 calculations, is less than the amounts actually collected from them under the wholesale rates.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Petitioners claim this shows that CIPSCO charges its wholesale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>customers more for generation and transmission services than it does its retail customers. Secondly, petitioners\u2019 applied the transfer-price test directly to show that CIPSCO could not make a profit if it owned the municipal operations, bought power from itself at its wholesale rates, distributed it through the municipal operations, and charged its customers at its prevailing retail rates.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The ALJ rejected the Cities\u2019 first attempt at proving that they were being charged more than retailers for generation and transmission services not by rejecting individually the proposed adjustments<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> but by relying on a study prepared by the Staff purporting to show the Company\u2019s comparative rate of return between its wholesale and 9 and 9-B retail customers. According to this study, the Company\u2019s profit margin was higher for its retail service.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Accepting as accurate the study\u2019s assignment of costs,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the ALJ concluded that the study rebutted petitioners\u2019 argument that the Company\u2019s rate differential was not justified by a difference in costs. He then went on to disparage, rather than refute, the remainder of petitioners\u2019 analysis, calling the transfer price test a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">concept ... so new that one doubts if it will ever become old for it would place in the hands of the party alleging discrimination the ability to create the discriminatory premises either willfully or simply through an inefficient municipal operation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">He concluded with the parting shot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aow-dedup-0\">it is not the policy of <em>Conway </em>to guarantee that all costs incurred in operating a municipal system (efficiently or otherwise) should be \u201csubsidized by its investor-owned supplier.\u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The price transfer test, as set forth in <em>Alcoa, </em>is a legitimate means of indicating a price squeeze. FERC itself has accepted that test.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The ALJ here, however, appears to have misunderstood the test. He concluded that \u201cit would place in the hands of the party alleging discrimination the ability to create the discriminatory premises either willfully or simply through an inefficient municipal operation, J.A. 416, thus misinterpreting the test as requiring an inquiry into whether a vertically integrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>company could realize a profit by purchasing at its own wholesale rates and selling at the retail rates of the party alleging discrimination rather than at its own retail rates. Properly understood, the transfer price test is, in fact, quite similar to the method of analysis employed by the Staff study in this case and relied upon by the ALJ to show the absence of any price discrimination.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Both depend upon a proper allocation of wholesale and retail costs, and both seek to test whether there is price discrimination<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> between wholesale and retail customers.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Thus, to use the transfer price test to attack the findings of the Staff study seems to us to be not materially different than a direct attack upon the accuracy of the Staff study. Since we have already rejected Cities\u2019 direct attack upon the Staff study,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and have acknowledged the agency\u2019s discretion to utilize its choice of methodology,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> this indirect attack upon the Staff study must also be rejected. Furthermore, in this case, Cities itself has misapplied the transfer price test by assuming, without adequate proof, that CIPSCO\u2019s retail costs would be the same as the retail costs of its wholesale customers, J.A. 139, an assumption which may explain the ALJ\u2019s misunderstanding of the test he was being asked to apply.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>At any rate, having failed to make out a price squeeze case, Cities is not aided by <em>FPC v. Conway, supra. </em>The Supreme Court in <em>Conway </em>held that although the Commission lacked jurisdiction to fix retail rates, its jurisdiction to set wholesale rates allowed it to take retail rates into consideration where wholesale customers were price squeezed by dint either of the utility company\u2019s desire to drive out retail competitors or of the interplay between federally and locally regulated rates.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">The Commission must arrive at a rate level deemed by it to be just and reasonable, but in doing so it must consider the tendered allegations that the proposed rates are discriminatory and anticompeti-tive.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Supreme Court upheld a decision of this court, <em>per </em>Leventhal, J., and observed that this court was \u201cquite correct\u201d in concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">When the costs are fully allocated, both the retail rate and the proposed wholesale rate may fall within a zone of reasonableness, yet create a price squeeze between \u2022themselves. There would, at the very least, be latitude in the FPC to put wholesale rates in the lower range of the zone of reasonableness, without concern that overall results would be impaired, in view of the utility\u2019s own decision to depress certain retail revenues in order to curb the retail competition of its wholesale customers.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We read that language as permitting the Commission to adjust wholesale rates , within a range of reasonableness to respond either to utility efforts to depress retail rates to meet competition, or to situations where the imperfections of regulation result in an unintended price squeeze. Since ratemaking is an inexact science, even <em>bona fide </em>allocations of costs between wholesale and retail operations may be imperfect or rates of return set by different regulators at the wholesale and retail levels may make it impossible for purchasing wholesalers, no matter how efficient, to compete at the retail level. In such cases, <em>Conway </em>acknowledges the Commission\u2019s discretion to press wholesale rates to the lower end of the zone of reasonableness. The <em>Conway </em>doctrine is not, however, we emphasize, designed to subsidize particular retail competitors. Rather, the doctrine allows the Commission some leeway where it finds that the process of price setting by regulation, and not the superior efficiency of the utility, might result in retail competitors being driven from the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Here, the requisite proof that a price squeeze existed was not forthcoming and indeed was refuted by the Staff study. When costs were fully allocated between wholesale and retail operations, CIPSCO\u2019s wholesale profit margin was sufficiently lower than its retail profit margin so that there was no occasion for the Commission to exercise its <em>Conway </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">B. <em>Normalization of Generating Capacity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">In 1977, CIPSCO opened a new generating plant resulting in a sudden increase in the system\u2019s generating reserves.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Petitioners contend the Commission erred in failing to \u201cnormalize\u201d this increase in generating capacity \u2014 that is, to exclude from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the rate base all costs associated with reserve capacity in excess of 15 percent \u2014 despite the fact that they did not allege<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and made no attempt to prove<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> that any portion of these costs were occasioned by managerial imprudence. We affirm the Commission\u2019s refusal to normalize these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">While we recognize that rate treatment of excess generating capacity in the electric utility industry is controversial in this era of slow demand growth, we are also aware that it is notoriously difficult to project accurately the demand for electric power far enough in advance to coordinate need with the construction of new generating facilities,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> CIPSCO has argued that practical reasons often exist for constructing facilities with a capacity in excess of the recommended norm.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The ALJ relied here upon the absence of any sort of managerial imprudence to support the inclusion of the total plant in the rate base.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Regardless of whether that test is \u2014 or should be \u2014 the exclusive one in deciding whether a utility\u2019s ratepayers must always bear the total costs of excess capacity by having such costs included in the rate base in the year the plant comes on line, we do not find the Commission\u2019s action on the basis of the record in this case to be arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">C. <em>Refusal to Investigate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">The ALJ found that CIPSCO\u2019s operating and maintenance costs exceded the industry norm, and recommended that FERC investigate the causes of this phenomenon.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> FERC reversed this recommendation, deciding not to institute an investigation because \u201c[t]he asserted need for the investigation requested by Cities has not been adequately established.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Cities contends FERC \u201cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>proach [is] . . . substantially in error\u201d as \u201cF.E.R.C. should have routine reporting and evaluating functions to monitor such companies as CIPSCO.... [because the Cities] should not have to launch such an expensive inquiry, which is clearly beyond their resources ...\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Cities then asks this court to order the Commission to undertake such an investigation.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Petitioners\u2019 argument is misdirected to this court. It is now settled law that, barring extreme circumstances, an agency\u2019s refusal to institute an investigation is unreviewable.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-11\"> Judge Wright did not participate in the rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\">.

At oral argument, counsel for the Cities contended that the contract discrimination issue in this case differs from that in <em>Rantoul </em>because, unlike that case, there is no evidence here that the petitioners were offered and rejected the now favorable contract terms. In this case, each city (with the exception of Carmi, Rood-house and Bushnell, which began purchasing power from CIPSCO after it had ceased offering long-term contracts to customers, <em>see </em>J.A. 150-06 (cross-examination of Carl Wall, CIP-SCO vice-president)) had had a contract similar to those still governing the sale of power to the cities of Marshall and Metropolis. Because they had entered into the fixed rate, fixed term contracts at a date earlier than had Marshall and Metropolis, their contracts expired at an earlier date. <em>See </em>J.A. 79 (cross-examination of Bruce Barnes, Jr., Cities\u2019 witness); J.A. 105-06 (cross-examination of Carl Wall). We view this factual dissimilarity as a distinction without a (legal) difference. Petitioners have still failed to demonstrate more than that a rate differential stemming \u201cfrom the fact that a public utility is free to file for unilateral rate increases with respect to some of its customers while the rate it charges to the remainder are frozen under the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine\u201d exists; as we have made clear in previous cases, more is necessary to establish a violation of section 205(b) of the Federal Power Act. <em>See Boroughs of Chambersburg v. FERC, </em>580 F.2d 573, 578 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The Cities agreed at oral argument that their tax normalization and demand allocation argu-merits were identical in all essential respects to those made in <em>Rantoul. </em>Our review of the record reveals that petitioners in this action, like the petitioner in <em>Rantoul, </em>lack a substantial evidentiary basis for contending that the demand allocation method used failed to credit petitioners\u2019 for their generating capacity. We likewise find without merit their argument that the Commission could not order rates collected <em>subject to refund </em>pending the outcome of a highly disputed rulemaking proceeding.

Petitioners now challenge the accuracy of the study\u2019s allocation of costs of service between retail and wholesale customers. However, the majority of their challenges stem from their dissatisfaction with the way FERC has defined the cost of wholesale service in this proceeding, a definition which we uphold in its entirety in this appeal. In addition, petitioners claim that the ratio of wholesale to retail costs may have changed in the two years since this study was conducted. However, the Cities have not indicated any reason aside from the passage of time why such ratios might have changed, <em>see Initial Decision </em>at 68, J.A. 414; in the absence of such evidence, we will not hold that the utilization of a two year old study for these purposes is per <em>se </em>unreasonable. Two years is not so long a time that substantial changes can be presumed to have taken place. Finally, petitioners allege that neither the ALJ nor the Staff examined the methodology of the study. This assertion is belied by the record. <em>See Initial Decision </em>at 68, J.A. 414; J.A. 13 (testimony of David Hedberg); J.A. 129-131 (cross-examination of James Bachman); Exhibit 9, J.A. 200-201 (Display A) (letter to Carl Wall from Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. re cost of service study).

It is true that an exhaustive comparison would probably be more accurate than a survey, however, the survey indicated that there was no need to conduct a full comparison of wholesale and retail rates of return.

Under the price transfer test the vertically integrated company\u2019s costs of retail operations must be added to the product purchased at its wholesale rates to determine profitability, so the usefulness of that test depends upon an accurate identification of retail costs. If the company fails to realize a profit under this test, <em>Indications </em>are that retail costs have been improperly transferred to the wholesale operations (or, less likely, retail operations are inefficient). Under the methodology of the Staff study, wholesale and retail revenues over their respective incurred costs are compared. This method of analysis also depends upon a proper identification of wholesale and retail costs. If, after wholesale and retail costs are fully allocated, the company\u2019s wholesale profit margin is significantly greater than its retail profit margin, <em>indications </em>are that a price discrimination is occuring. Both methods of analysis are acceptable methods of establishing a price squeeze case. <em>See </em>J.A. at 625.

In Response To The \u201cMemorandum Amicus Curiae\u201d Filed By The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice at 4, like the price squeeze test, the cost of service study also seeks to determine whether the vertically integrated company maintains artificially high wholesale prices in order to squeeze out its retail competition. If, after costs are fully allocated, it appears that the wholesale rate of return of a vertically integrated company is reasonable and, in fact, lower than retail rate of return, it would appear that wholesale customers are not being price squeezed \u2014 indeed, the higher the retail rate of return <em>vis-a-vis </em>the wholesale rate of return, the greater the wholesale customer\u2019s discount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">. <em>See supra </em>at 198 n.47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b263-11\">. <em>Id.

For instance, in times of increasing demand, a utility would have to open new plants each year to maintain a constant reserve capacity.

The magnitude of the mismatch is not so great that we can conclude that CIPSCO\u2019s management was <em>per se </em>incompetent, or even that CIPSCO committed a gross error in judgment. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent the mismatch will burden the ratepayers with extra costs. The ALJ points out that CIPSCO is expected to sell most of its excess capacity to other utilities, and the revenues \u201cwould necessarily redound to the benefit of ratepayers.\u201d <em>See Initial Decision </em>at 31, J.A. 377. One point troubles us, however. Because FERC sets rates in advance, if CIPSCO was expected to sell its excess generating capacity during the 1978 calendar year, <em>the expected revenues should have redounded </em>to the ratepayers\u2019 benefit \u2014 that is, they should have been factored into the rates accepted by the Commission. The ALJ\u2019s use of the future tense to describe the crediting of these revenues may have been a mere \u201cslip of the pen.\u201d However, on remand, the Commission should check to ensure that any expected sale revenues were in fact credited against the sums to be raised from the ratepayers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b265-15\">. We note, however, that some state utility commissions as well as commentators have advanced a form of normalization, not unlike that which petitioners press here, as a more equitable way of sharing the risks of overfore-casting utility demand. This alternative involves charging maintenance and depreciation expenses on the excess capacity as above-the-line operating expenses to be paid by the ratepayers over a period of years until the capital investment has been repaid. Because the excess capacity is not included in the rate base, however, shareholders do not receive any return on their investment. <em>See </em>Trebing, <em>supra </em>note 77.
