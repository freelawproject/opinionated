We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Gila River Farms (Gila), an agency of the Gila River Indian Community, obtained a loan from the United States under the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 422a <em>et seq. </em>The statute provides that the Secretary of the Interior may negotiate contract terms with loan recipients which shall set out \u201csuch provisions as the Secretary shall deem necessary or proper to provide assurance of and security for prompt repayment of the loan and interest as aforesaid.\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 422e.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The loan repayment contract involved here requires Gila to accept competitive bids on contracts over $10,000. The contract also provides for review by the Secretary of the Interior or his representative (Secretary) should Gila award a contract to one other than the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Merrill had previously received the contract for \u201cReach II\u201d of the South Side Canal. When a dispute arose under that contract, Gila and Merrill submitted their claims to an arbitrator. That proceeding was pending when Gila requested bids on this \u201cReach III\u201d portion of the project now involved in this lawsuit. Merrill submitted the lowest bid (approximately $1.7 million) for Reach III but Gila awarded the contract to the second lowest bidder (higher than Merrill\u2019s by approximately $32,000). By the terms of the contract this award was \u201csubject to review\u201d by the Secretary. The Secretary approved the award because it would \u201cnot adversely affect the repayment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Merrill sued Gila, certain federal officials, and the United States. The district court dismissed as to all the federal defendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The dismissal is challenged on appeal. The central issue is whether the Secretary\u2019s approval of the award to the second lowest bidder is \u201cagency action committed to agency discretion by law\u201d and thus not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The district court has subject matter jurisdiction to review agency action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) if the action is not otherwise made unreviewable. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S.Ct. 980, 984, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977) (The 1976 amendments to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 confer \u201cjurisdiction on federal courts to review agency action,\u201d \u201csubject only to preclusion-of-review statutes created or retained by Congress.\u201d) The Administrative Procedure Act, however, precludes review of \u201cagency action committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). The Supreme Court has described this as creating a narrow exception to judicial review, applicable \u201cin those rare instances where \u2018statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">This circuit applied <em>Overton Park </em>in <em>Ness Invest. Corp. v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, </em>512 F.2d 706 (9th Cir. 1975). Judicial review is available when the plaintiff alleges a violation of \u201cconstitutional, statutory, regulatory or other legal mandates or restrictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 715, but review is precluded when plaintiff\u2019s complaint is primarily that the agency made the wrong choice when making an \u201cinformed judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The issue here is whether the Small Reclamation Projects Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 422a <em>et seq., </em>or regulations promulgated pursuant to that statute, provide a legal standard by which a court can measure the propriety of the Secretary\u2019s actions. <em>Arizona Power Authority </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>549 F.2d 1231, 1240 (9th Cir. 1977). Merrill contends that the Secretary\u2019s review of the contract award should be governed by the Federal Procurement Regulations, which provide that award of contracts must be made to the lowest responsible bidder unless there is a compelling reason to reject all bids. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-2.-414-1A. According to Merrill, since there is clear law to apply, the district court had jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Federal Procurement Regulations apply to procurements made by federal agencies. The Gila Tribe, however, is not a federal agency. The Small Reclamation Projects Act does not require loan recipients to comply with the regulations. The Federal Procurement Regulations, therefore, do not provide the court with a standard to apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Contracts for loans under the Small Reclamation Projects Act are governed by 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 422e. The statute provides that the secretary may negotiate a contract which shall set out, among other things\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">(aHd)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">(e) such provisions as the Secretary shall deem necessary or proper to provide assurance of and security for prompt repayment of the loan and interest as aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">43 U.S.C. \u00a7 422e. The requirements of competitive bids and secretarial review of the contract awards are <em>contract provisions </em>negotiated by the Secretary pursuant to his statutory authority to \u201cprovide assurance of and security for prompt repayment.\u201d This authority is reflected in the justification offered by the Secretary\u2019s representative in approving the award to the second lowest bidder that \u201c[t]he difference in cost . . . will not adversely affect the repayment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The statute itself does not provide a standard for the court to apply in determining whether the provision in the contract \u201cprovides assurance of and security for prompt repayment\u201d. Nor does it provide a legal standard against which the court can judge the Secretary\u2019s action in approving the award to the second lowest bidder. We conclude that the facts of this case fall under the narrow exception to judicial review: the statute (at least as to the relationship of competitive bidding to repayment assurance) is \u201cdrawn in such broad terms\u201d that \u201cthere is no law to apply.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The district court was correct in dismissing the federal defendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
