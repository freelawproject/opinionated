Doyle is a former counseling psychologist employed by the Veterans\u2019 Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ministration at the San Antonio branch unit of the Houston Regional Office. Following receipt of reports of Doyle\u2019s sexual advances toward female beneficiaries assigned to him for counseling, the VA commenced an investigation. On December 7, 1978, Doyle\u2019s attorney demanded, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] and the Privacy Act, all documents in the investigative file. On December 26, 1978, the VA\u2019s Assistant Inspector General for Investigation responded to counsel\u2019s request, claiming that the documents were exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(7)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 552a(d)(5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> primarily because disclosure at that time would interfere with a pending investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">By letter dated February 14, 1979, Doyle was informed of his proposed termination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Doyle\u2019s counsel repeated his requests and the majority of the documents were furnished. In addition, the VA made available the \u201cevidence file\u201d containing the materials relied on to support the proposed discharge. Doyle complains about certain documents the VA declined to make available.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">On February 14, 1979, Dorothy Starbuck, the Chief Benefits Director of the VA, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>notified by the Field Director of the Western Region, John Travers, that Doyle was to be removed. On that day, she was furnished a copy of the termination letter. Because Congressman Henry Gonzalez had manifested an abiding interest in the VA facilities and staff in his congressional district, Starbuck telephoned the congress-naan\u2019s office and informed Gail Beagle, a congressional staff member, that Doyle was being dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In the instant suit, Doyle claims that information was withheld wrongfully under the FOIA and that Starbuck\u2019s conversation with Beagle violated a provision of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b). Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">1. <em>Exceptions to disclosure</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aeqt\">In discussing Doyle\u2019s disclosure claims (set forth in footnote 4), the district court reasoned that the VA properly withheld the first two items according to the Veteran\u2019s Benefits statutes, particularly 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301(a) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">All files, records, reports and other papers and documents pertaining to any claim ... administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration ... in the possession of the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be confidential and privileged, and no disclosure thereof shall be made ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The counseling records, tests, and psychological profiles of the three females who reported Doyle\u2019s advances are covered by this statutory umbrella of confidentiality. A number of exceptions are enumerated in section 3301, but none is suggested, nor do we note any, as applicable. The trial court correctly upheld the administrator\u2019s decision to withhold these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Doyle complains that the investigator\u2019s summary was not made available to him. No merit exists in this contention. Prior to February 14, 1979, the file was the product of a pending investigation and the request for disclosure did not have to be honored under the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A). <em>See N. L. R. B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978). After completion of the investigation, the evidence file was made available to Doyle. We find no credible support for the suggestion that a summary was secreted from the file so as to deny Doyle access. We concur with the trial judge\u2019s conclusions in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Doyle\u2019s final complaint relates to the demand for a copy of the authority for the VA to monitor his telephone conversations. In response to this request, the VA advised Doyle that the practice was authorized by federal law. The trial judge understood this to mean that no documentary information existed, obviously other than the statute, and there was nothing to produce. Doyle does not contravene this position and we discern no basis upon which to find that a genuine dispute of a material fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">2. <em>Unauthorized disclosure of information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">The most serious matter raised by Doyle in this appeal relates to Starbuck\u2019s conversation with Beagle concerning the charges against Doyle and his impending discharge. Doyle maintains that this communication was a willful and intentional disclosure of records protected by the Privacy Act, constituting a violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b). This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">The VA\u2019s position, as supported by Star-buck\u2019s affidavit, is that the content of her telephone communication with Beagle did not include the disclosure of a record contained in a system of records, but was based on memory and personal knowledge developed as the case unfolded. Specifically, in her affidavit Starbuck said: \u201cIn my conversation with Mrs. Beagle, I did not rely primarily on the proposed removal letter in giving her the message intended for the Congressman, but rather on my oral discussion with Mr. Travers and my previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>knowledge of the case as it developed from September 1978 to the date of the conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Citing <em>King v. Califano, </em>471 F.Supp. 180 (D.C.D.C.1979), and <em>Savarese </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Health, </em>479 F.Supp. 304 (N.D.Ga.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1078, 101 S.Ct. 858, 66 L.Ed.2d 801 (1981), the trial court reasoned that the \u201cinformation imparted was merely a conclusionary statement from the utterer\u2019s memory,\u201d and ruled that a system of records had not been utilized by Starbuck to gather the information conveyed to Beagle. Further, the district court noted that according to Starbuck\u2019s affidavit, the \u201cinformation was acquired independent of the records pertaining to Mr. Doyle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On appeal, Doyle does not challenge the rationale of the <em>King </em>and <em>Savarese </em>decisions, that remarks based upon independent knowledge and not from an examination of an individual\u2019s records kept by the agency, do not violate the Privacy Act. Instead Doyle attempts to distinguish those cases by asserting that Starbuck\u2019s communication to Beagle contained data retrieved from VA files.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">This naked allegation, however, is not sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact in the face of Starbuek\u2019s affidavit. As against a motion for summary judgment, a litigant is required to present more than unsupported pleadings or allegations. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Doyle was required to come forth with evidence indicating that a triable issue of fact existed with regard to the informational source of Star-buck\u2019s conversation with Beagle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">From Starbuck\u2019s testimony, the trial court concluded that the information transmitted to Beagle was not retrieved from a system of agency records within the intendment of the Privacy Act; thus, the VA was entitled to summary judgment. Because we agree that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b) forbids only the disclosure of such records, and considering that the only evidence offered on the issue is to the effect that the February 14, 1979 telephone conversation between Starbuck and Beagle was not drawn from agency record, we perceive no error in that disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">This section does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">(7) investigatory records complied for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (E) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or (F) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(5) provides that \u201cnothing in this section [section 552a] shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\">. The letter communicated to Doyle his right to reply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">2. You have the right to reply to this notice orally or in writing or both orally and in writing; and to submit affidavits in support of your reply, showing why this notice is inaccurate and any other reasons why your proposed removal should not be effected.

Doyle contends he was entitled to receive the following: (1) records of any test administered by the VA to the three complaining beneficiaries; (2) the complete counseling records of the three complaining beneficiaries; (3) a copy of the investigator\u2019s summary of findings and recommendations; and (4) the authority for the VA to monitor telephone conversations between Doyle and other individuals without first informing Doyle that the calls were being monitored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. Neither the record nor Doyle\u2019s brief indicates that Beagle was questioned with regard to the February 14, 1979 telephone call from Star-buck. There is no explanation of this obvious void. Beagle\u2019s recollection of the conversation might have addressed the particulars and the detail. Since the VA\u2019s defense of the Privacy Act claim is grounded on the theory that Star-buck did not utilize agency records to formulate her statements to Beagle, her remarks are contended to have been general in nature. If Starbuck\u2019s comments had been specific, a matter about which Beagle could have testified, a triable issue of fact may have been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">The distinction was recognized by the trial court: \u201cHad the disclosure in this case involved the retrieval of explicit detail from the records regarding episodes investigated, or other information of a specific nature, the plaintiff may well have stated a case under the Privacy Act.\u201d But in view of the lack of evidence traversing Starbuck\u2019s affidavit account, we must agree with the district court that \u201cno such disclosure is at issue.\u201d A genuine dispute may not be predicated on speculation as to what might later be proven.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
