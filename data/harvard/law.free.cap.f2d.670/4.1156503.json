At the same time, there is a serious question about whether this court has jurisdiction. It is allowed to review only National Transpor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tation Safety Board \u201corder(s),\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(d) \u2014 a term interpreted to reflect the need for \u201can adequate administrative record\u201d to allow review. <em>Cf. Sima Products Corp. v. McLucas, </em>612 F.2d 309, 312 (7th Cir. 1980). The district courts, however, have authority to review \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. This latter term, we believe, is broader than \u201corder\u201d and allows district courts broader scope to review, where the need to develop a record expeditiously is critical, as it is here. Moreover, petitioner\u2019s counsel has informed us that he will be filing a petition for review in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Therefore, confident that petitioner will receive an expedited hearing in the district court, we shall hold our decision in abeyance. We direct the clerk of this court to send a copy of this Order forthwith to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
