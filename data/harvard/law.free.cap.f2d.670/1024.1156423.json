We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-18\">Since one of the principal issues in this case is what facts were established, we will develop them in the course of the opinion. Suffice to say at this time that appellant seeks to uphold a registration, which has been on the register since 1969, on the basis of two shipments of FANCY FIXIN\u2019S cat food. Appellee, who admittedly made only a single shipment of FANCY FIXINS cat food to support an application for registration, seeks to remove appellant\u2019s registration as an obstacle to the registration it seeks and relies on the statutory presumption of abandonment raised after nonuse of a registered mark for two consecutive years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-19\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-20\">The board held that in order to possess standing or a real interest in seeking to challenge a registration on the ground of abandonment, it is incumbent upon a petitioner to establish use of the same or similar mark for the same or similar goods as the mark and goods of the registrant so that the registration is in derogation of the petitioner\u2019s right to use its mark in commerce. The board then made extended findings based on appellant\u2019s admissions and appellee\u2019s answers to appellant\u2019s interrogatories which, in the board\u2019s view, established that appellee had used the mark as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>alleged; that such use was bona fide; that appellee\u2019s asserted investigation revealed that the registered mark was not in use; that appellee filed an application which was refused because of appellant\u2019s registration; that contemporaneous marketing by the parties would unquestionably cause purchaser confusion; and that pending the determination of this proceeding, appellee\u2019s action in not continuing to exploit the mark was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Concerning the issue of abandonment, the board invoked the presumption of abandonment arising from two years\u2019 nonuse of a mark provided in section 45 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since no explanation was given which would justify appellant\u2019s nonuse, the mark was found to have been abandoned. One member dissented on the ground that the findings and conclusions drawn by the majority concerning ap-pellee\u2019s standing were unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">For a petitioner to prevail in a cancellation proceeding, it is incumbent upon that party to show (1) that it possesses standing to challenge the continued presence on the register of the subject registration and (2) that there is a valid ground why the registrant is not entitled under law to maintain the registration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">There is no dispute between the parties that the above requirements must be met by appellee. The disagreement arises over what constitutes standing and whether ap-pellee has sustained its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">\n<em>The Position of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">Appellee\u2019s principal argument is that the issue of standing is to be determined on the basis of the well-pleaded allegations of its petition. Since these allegations are sufficient, and in any event the record supports the specific findings of fact by the board concerning its interest in the mark FANCY FIXINS, appellee maintains that it is entitled to be heard on the issue of abandonment, which was established by appellant\u2019s admitted nonuse of the mark for a period of more than two years immediately prior to the date of the filing of appellee\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-15\">Appellant, on the other hand, argues that the allegations in a petition cannot in themselves establish standing, that appellee must prove credible interest and credible damage to itself from the subject registration which it failed to do, and that because appellee lacks standing, the board improperly shifted the burden to appellant to excuse its nonuse of the registered mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-16\">\n<em>Standing of Appellee/Petitioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-17\">Section 14 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064) sets forth the requirements with respect to the standing of a petitioner seeking to cancel a registration of a mark on the ground of abandonment. This section of the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-18\">A verified petition to cancel a registration of a mark, stating the grounds relied upon, may ... be filed by any person who believes he is or will be damaged by the registration of a mark on the principal register established by this Act. . . . * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-19\">(c) at any time if the registered mark . . . has been abandoned, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-20\">It had, for many years, been the view of the board that the determinative issue under section 14 was whether the petitioner would be \u201cdamaged\u201d by the registration. While the petitioner was not required to prove actual damage, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to prove that the registered mark was likely to cause confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>with a mark in which petitioner had superi- or rights or that the registered mark was a descriptive term which petitioner was entitled to use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the petitioner was unable to establish such \u201cdamage,\u201d the petition for cancellation would be dismissed even in instances where there was uncontroverted evidence of abandonment of the mark or other grounds showing that the subject registration should be cancelled. Moreover, the board repeatedly held that a petitioner or opposer who did not prove \u201cdamage\u201d could not be heard on what it termed \u201cex parte\u201d issues affecting the validity of an application or registration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">In a number of cases, this court criticized the practice of the board in not deciding all issues within the inter partes proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the practice of the board continued until its decision in <em>Norac Co. v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., </em>197 USPQ 306 (TTAB 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">In <em>Norac, </em>a petitioner sought to cancel a number of registrations on the ground of prior rights in a mark with which the registrant\u2019s marks were alleged to be in conflict. In addition, some of the registrations were also challenged on the ground of abandonment because of nonuse of the marks. The board ruled that there was no likelihood of confusion between the respective uses. Under prior practice, the petition would have been dismissed without reaching the issue of abandonment. However, the board rejected its previous practice and ordered cancellation of the registrations covering abandoned marks. In so doing, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-7\">This past practice of the Board permitted invalid registrations to remain on the Register only because petitioner failed to prove its standing, <em>as distinct from alleging such standing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-8\">The modern theory of standing, as we review the legal decisions, is that <em>it is determined from a reading of the allegations made in good faith in the pleading. </em>The purpose of requiring allegations that demonstrate standing is to preclude meddlesome parties from instituting proceedings as self-appointed guardians of the purity of the Register. However, a party who demonstrates a real interest in the proceeding has standing to litigate even though ultimately <em>its allegation </em>that he is or will be damaged is refuted. <em>See: Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Company, </em>192 USPQ 24 (CCPA, 1976); and <em>Yoder Brothers, Inc. v. California-Florida Plant Corporation, </em>193 USPQ 264 (CA 5, 1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-9\">Although fully recognizing the change from our past practice, we nevertheless, conclude that <em>the question of standing is to be determined upon the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint, made in good faith, and is not contingent upon re-examination based on the evidentiary record, </em>unless such record establishes clearly and convincingly that the allegation was a sham <em>pleading.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-10\">Thus, where a party in good faith has pleaded <em>several causes of action, </em>as petitioner has in the present case before us, it is our firm belief that petitioner is entitled to be heard on all causes of action set forth in its pleading, even if it is not successful in one or more of such actions. <em>See: Fort Howard Paper Company v. Kimberley-Clark Corporation, </em>157 USPQ 55 (CCPA, 1971); and <em>The Community of Roquefort v. Santo, </em>170 USPQ 205 (CCPA, 1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">197 USPQ at 320 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">In seeking to rectify its previous error, the board went further in its <em>Norac </em>decision than necessary in that case and further than warranted as a matter of law. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>the board now looks at a party\u2019s pleading rather than proof, it continues to equate the facts which give rise to standing with all of the facts of a separate cause of action. However, standing is a threshold inquiry directed solely to establishing interest of the party. Thus, this court held that a petitioner who asserted only one cause of action for cancellation, namely, likelihood of confusion with its subsidiary\u2019s prior mark, had standing even though it lost on the merits. <em>Universal Oil Products Co. </em>v. <em>Rexall Drug &amp; Chemical Co., </em>59 CCPA 1120, 463 F.2d 1122, 174 USPQ 458 (1972). Drawing a distinction between the facts creating standing and the additional facts necessary to the cause of action, we reject the premise that a petitioner should be found to have' standing by virtue of its complaint alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">\n<em>Allegations Alone Do Not Establish Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">To support its argument that allegations in the petition alone establish standing, ap-pellee relies on Norac-and a line of cases in which the board restated this position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant asserts that the board\u2019s theory is unsound and that the result of following it would transpose the responsibilities in litigation which require that a plaintiff <em>prove </em>a prima facie case before a defendant is required to put in any defense. In effect, appellant raises a question of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">On this issue we agree with appellant. A petitioner\u2019s allegations alone do not establish standing. That is not to say that standing cannot be tested at the pleading stage. A party\u2019s pleading lays the foundation for standing. Thus, if it does not plead facts sufficient to show a personal interest in the outcome beyond that of the general public, the case may be dismissed for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, it does not follow that the facts affording a party standing, which as pleaded are sufficient as a matter of law, do not have to be proved by that party. As stated in <em>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, </em>412 U.S. 669, 689, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2417, 37 L.Ed.2d,254 (1973): \u201c[I]t is equally clear that the allegations must be true and capable of proof at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">While the board added a caveat to its reliance on a petitioner\u2019s pleading, pointing out that standing could be destroyed if the record proved the pleading to be a sham, we agree with appellant that the board\u2019s analysis would place the burden on the respondent and is, thus, in error. The facts regarding standing, we hold, are part of a petitioner\u2019s case and must be affirmatively proved. Accordingly, appellee is not entitled to standing solely because of the allegations in its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">\n<em>What Constitutes Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"avh-dedup-0\">No absolute test can be laid down for what must be proved to establish standing as a petitioner in a cancellation proceeding or as an opposer in an opposition. The starting point is the statute. Congress has defined the class in section 14 as \u201cany person who <em>believes </em>he is or will be damaged by the registration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In construing comparable language of section 13, this court stated in <em>Federated Foods, Inc. v. Ft. Howard Paper Co., </em>544 F.2d 1098, 1101, 192 USPQ 24, 27 (CCPA 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-11\">A party has standing to oppose within the meaning of \u00a7 13 if that party can demonstrate a <em>real interest </em>in the proceeding. <em>Universal Oil Products Co. v. Rexall Drug and Chemical Co., </em>59 CCPA 1120, 463 F.2d 1122, 174 USPQ 458 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">The same general statement is applicable to cancellation proceedings. The purpose in requiring standing is to prevent litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>where there is no real controversy between the parties, where a plaintiff, petitioner or opposer, is no more than an intermeddler. Congress, however, has specified a broad class who must be deemed proper litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Thus, this court has found standing based on widely diverse interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-6\">1. importation of petitioner\u2019s products deterred by a registration, <em>Plastilite Corp. v. Kassnar Imports, </em>508 F.2d 824, 184 USPQ 348 (CCPA 1975).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-7\">2. use of copyrighted appearance of doll, <em>Knickerbocker Toy Co. v. Faultless Starch Co., </em>467 F.2d 501, 175 USPQ 417 (CCPA 1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-8\">3. pecuniary interest of trade association, <em>Tanners' Council of America, Inc. v. Gary Industries, Inc., </em>58 CCPA 1201, 440 F.2d 1404, 169 USPQ 608 (1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-9\">4. prior registration but not priority in use, <em>King Candy Co. v. Eunice King\u2019s Kitchen, Inc., </em>496 F.2d 1400, 182 USPQ 108 (CCPA 1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-10\">5. protection of subsidiary\u2019s mark, <em>Universal Oil Products Co. v. Rexall Drug &amp; Chemical Co., </em>supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-11\">6. descriptive use of term in registered mark, <em>Golomb v. Wadsworth, </em>592 F.2d 1184, 201 USPQ 200 (CCPA); <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 833, 100 S.Ct. 63, 62 L.Ed.2d 42 (1979).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-12\">7. advertising emphasis of American origin, <em>Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Bir-ginal-Bigsby Corp., </em>50 CCPA 1380, 319 F.2d 273, 138 USPQ 63 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">In <em>Norac, </em>petitioner proved by testimony, inter alia, that it had extensively used OXY as a trademark for certain chemical compositions. The next inquiry should have been whether its <em>belief </em>of likelihood of confusion with the registered mark OXY and various marks incorporating OXY for a line of products of the registrant was not wholly without merit. The error of the board in its earlier cases had been in requiring proof of a legal conclusion, likelihood of confusion,' rather than directing its inquiry to whether a petitioner established facts which showed that it had a legitimate personal interest. Had the appropriate inquiry been made in <em>Norac, </em>petitioner would have had standing, not because of its mere allegations, but because it proved a real commercial interest <em>in its own marks, </em>and a reasonable basis for its <em>belief </em>that it would be damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-16\">Appellee asserts an interest arising from its attempt to obtain a registration for the mark FANCY FIXINS for cat food which is blocked by appellant\u2019s registration. We regard the desire for a registration with its attendant statutory advantages as a legitimate commercial interest. To establish a reasonable basis for a belief that one is damaged by the registration sought to be cancelled, a petition may assert a likelihood of confusion which is not wholly without merit (as in <em>Norac) </em>or, as here, a rejection of an application during prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-17\">Thus, to have standing in this case, it would be sufficient that appellee prove that it filed an application and that a rejection was made because of appellant\u2019s registration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These facts do not provide a statutory ground for cancellation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but no more is necessary for standing. Appellant could, of course, seek to attack the legitimacy of appellee\u2019s application or in some other way negate appellee\u2019s interest. <em>American Lava Corp. v. Multronics, Inc., </em>461 F.2d 836, 174 USPQ 107 (CCPA 1972). However, the legitimacy of the petitioner\u2019s activity from which its interest arises will be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-18\">In determining the requirements for standing, we have taken into consideration that no ex parte vehicle for removing \u201cdead\u201d registrations from the register is provided in the statute except for the provisions of section 8 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1058) requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>ing an affidavit or declaration of use to be filed during the sixth year of its term. There is no procedure for the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to initiate action against defunct marks which appear in registrations. Thus, we believe the public interest is served, contrary to appellant\u2019s view, in broadly interpreting the class of persons Congress intended to be allowed to institute cancellation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">\n<em>Proof of Appellee\u2019s Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AER\">The final question to be answered on the issue of standing is whether the record establishes at least the minimum requirements pertinent to this case, namely an application by appellee and a rejection of the application because of appellant\u2019s registration. No evidence of such facts was offered by appellee during the trial period. Accordingly, we must determine whether appellant admitted these facts in its answer, as found by the majority below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">The pertinent pleadings are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-6\">\n<em>Petition</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-7\">2) Petitioner has applied to register the said \u201cFancy Fixins\u201d trademark for cat food in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and said application was assigned Serial No. 116,960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">\n<em>Answer</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-9\">2. Lipton Industries, Inc. (hereinafter Defendant), upon information and belief concerning the truth and accuracy of the attachments to Plaintiff\u2019s original PETITION FOR CANCELLATION served on Defendant\u2019s predecessor in title on 15 July 1977 by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), admits the allegation in paragraph 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-10\">\n<em>Petition</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-11\">3) Registration to Petitioner of the said mark has been refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act as conflicting with Respondent\u2019s Registration No. 876, 136 covering the mark \u201cFancy Fixin\u2019s\u201d for cat food.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-12\">\n<em>Answer</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-13\">3. Defendant, upon information and belief concerning the truth and accuracy of the attachments to Plaintiff\u2019s original PETITION FOR CANCELLATION served on Defendant\u2019s predecessor in title on July 15, 1977 by the TTAB, admits the allegation in paragraph 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">The majority below, noting FRCP Rule 8(d), found appellant\u2019s answers to be acknowledgement of the pleaded facts. We agree. No significance can be given appellant\u2019s attempted qualification of an admission by use of the words \u201con information and belief.\u201d Equivocal admissions are not permitted under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules. Rule 8(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-15\">Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required .... are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-16\"><em>See Mesirow v. Duggan, </em>240 F.2d 751 (CA 8), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 864, 78 S.Ct. 93, 2 L.Ed.2d 70 (1957); <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>222 F.2d 637 (CA 5 1955); <em>Dunlop v. Quality Spring Products, Inc., </em>20 F.R.Serv.2d 561 (W.D.Mich.1975). Appellant\u2019s answers are, therefore, admissions. The purpose of Rule 8 is stated in 2A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice U 8.21 at 8-229 (2d ed. 1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-17\">The third sentence of subdivision (b) [Rule 8] epitomizes the objective: \u201cDenials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied.\u201d It follows that denials must not be evasive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-18\">An answer which attempts to,..evade the pleading requirements of Rule..8 by the tactic of an equivocal admissiqn_o_r denial is an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-19\">To negate appellee\u2019s interest, appellant asserts that the board should~~nofTiavg~re-lied on appellee\u2019s answers to interrogatories and that it drew unwarranted inferences. In view of our holding on standing, we need not decide whether each of the board\u2019s conclusions was correct. While we agree that the answers, which appellant, itself, placed in the record, were properly considered by the board for any relevant purpose, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>board\u2019s extended findings were simply unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">Standing having been established, peti-. tioner is entitled to rely on any statutory ground which negates appellant\u2019s right to the subject registration and may invoke the general public interest in support of its claim. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">\n<em>Presumption of Abandonment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"azt-dedup-0\">Under section 45 of the Lanham Act, proof of nonuse of a mark for two consecutive years is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">In the answer to interrogatories given by appellant on August 8, 1978, appellant stated upon information and belief that its predecessor in interest, Usen Products Company, had. made a shipment of cat food under a label bearing the mark FANCY FIXIN\u2019S as averred in its application for registration and that this was the only use made of the mark until just prior to the submission of a Combined Affidavit under sections 8 and 15 by Lipton Pet Foods, Inc. on March 11, 1975.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Appellant argues that there is no reason to believe that section 45 was intended to water down the presumption of validity of a registration under section 7(b) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057(b)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, a heavy burden of proof falls on a petitioner in a cancellation proceeding because of this presumption and, appellant argues, the board improperly shifted the burden of proof to appellant to justify nonuse of its mark based on a paucity of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">We agree with appellant that a petitioner bears a heavy burden to establish the facts underlying its claim that the mark has been abandoned. Strict proof of a two year period of nonuse is required. <em>P.A.B. Produits et Appareils de Beaute v. Santinine Societa in Nome Collettivo di S.A. e.M. Usellini, </em>570 F.2d 328, 196 USPQ 801 (CCPA 1978). However, no proof could be more persuasive than appellant\u2019s admission of nonuse in this case. It was at this point that the provision of section 45 became operative, and the board properly required appellant to put forth at least some evidence to explain its nonuse which, in conjunction with the presumption of validity, might have defeated appellee\u2019s case. <em>Sterling Brewers, Inc. v. Schenley Industries, Inc., </em>58 CCPA 1172, 441 F.2d 675, 169 USPQ 590 (1971). We see nothing in the board\u2019s opinion which would lead us to conclude that the board shifted the burden of proof merely because appellee established standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">The decision of the board granting the petition for cancellation of Registration No. 876,139 is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1089-14\">. 209 USPQ 538 (TTAB 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1089-15\">.

Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Non-use for two consecutive years shall be prima facie abandonment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1090-22\">. <em>See </em>J.

If the facts pleaded show standing, the pleader is in court. Those facts must thereafter be proved, but at the pleading stage they need only be \u201ccapable of proof at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, </em>412 U.S. 669, 689, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2416, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973). The facts establishing standing were proved here. That to me ends our consideration of the standing issue. Because I am not aware of an instance in which the board has sustained standing on the basis of unproven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>allegations, or in which it has canceled a registration on the basis of mere allegations, I see no reason to discuss its past decisions. Nor, for the same reason, do I view the board\u2019s approach as shifting the burden.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
