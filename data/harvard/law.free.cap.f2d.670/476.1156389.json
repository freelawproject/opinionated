BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">This diversity case presents for our decision a narrow question of Mississippi law, a question on which Mississippi should have the final answer and for which Mississippi affords the means for a ready answer. Guided by principles of Our Federalism, we defer decision in the cause and certify one question to the Supreme Court of Mississippi,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to its Rule 46,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopted August 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">To establish the context surrounding our question to the Supreme Court, we summarize the relevant facts. Mr. Walters sustained injuries in an accident on the premises of Inexco Oil Company. He and his wife brought suit against Inexco, a foreign corporation, to recover damages for his personal injuries and her loss of consortium. The District Court, <em>Walters v. Inexco, </em>511 F.Supp. 21 (S.D.Miss.1979), returned a judgment for $584,116.54 plus interest in their favor. This Court affirmed that judgment, 632 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1980), and denied rehearing en banc, 642 F.2d 1210 (5th Cir. 1981). <em>Inexco </em>filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, which it denied on March 23, 1981. 450 U.S. 999, 101 S.Ct. 1704, 68 L.Ed.2d 200 (1981). <em>Inexco </em>ultimately paid $674,504.09 in damages and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Back in the Court of Appeals, the Walters filed a motion to assess statutory damages pursuant to \u00a7 11-3-23, Mississippi Code Annotated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 19, 1981, this Court referred that motion to the District Court for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The District Court, on remand, <em>citing Perkins </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>210 Miss. 297, 49 So.2d 383 (1950); <em>Covington County v. Mississippi Road Supply Co., </em>Miss., 59 So.2d 325 (1952); and <em>Burgson &amp; Co. v. Williams, Smithwich &amp; Co., </em>155 Miss. 351, 121 So. 817 (1929), concluded that \u00a7 11-3-23 applies only to appeals to the state supreme court and \u201ccannot be construed to be general in nature\u201d. The Judge distinguished a similar Alabama damages statute that refers generally to the \u201cappellate court\u201d rather than the supreme court. This Court has held that the Alabama statute constitutes a substantive rule that governs in diversity. <em>Proctor v. Gissendaner, </em>587 F.2d 182 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">We discern no clear path from the cases that the District Court cited. <em>Perkins </em>apparently was cited in error; it involves the validity of a mineral lease, not statutory damages. In <em>Covington County, </em>the Court declined to impose statutory damages upon a county. And in <em>Burgson, </em>the Court refused because, in 1929, no statute authorized such damages. These cases, obviously, cannot provide the guidance that this Court, sitting in diversity, requires. Whether the statute should apply in the present action, we simply cannot tell. Concerned not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>violate our Erie<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> duty of applying the substantive law of the forum state in a diversity case, we seek a definitive answer to this question from the one court both intellectually capable <em>and </em>constitutionally entitled to supply one. Indeed, as the case involves questions of local Mississippi policy, this course accords with our carefully wrought system of federalism. We should hesitate to \u201ctrade [our] judicial robes for the garb of prophet\u201d, J. Brown, <em>Certification </em>\u2014 Federal<em>ism in Action, </em>7 Cumberland L.Rev. 455 (1977), when the procedure of certification to the Supreme Court of Mississippi<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> renders the crystal ball unnecessary. In following that course, we once again seize the opportunity to praise, extol, laud, and proclaim the virtues of this wonderful device that \u201cwithout abdicating one Article III function\u201d, <em>Strange v. Krebs, </em>658 F.2d 268, 269 (5th Cir. 1981), enables us to obtain a definitive answer when <em>Erie </em>charts a perilous course through uncharted waters. The Court only expresses again its regret that the largest state in both the former Fifth and present Circuit cannot constitutionally open its eyes and mind to this procedural wonder, as have its sister states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Following our customary practice we request counsel to submit a joint statement of facts and proposed agreed certificate of the questions, <em>see West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>504 F.2d 967 (5th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">CERTIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">.

Of the certification procedure, Chief Judge Godbold has written; \u201c[Bloth federal and state judicial systems are the beneficiaries of a procedure rooted in cooperative federalism.\u201d <em>American Eastern Development Corp. v.
