The case presents a question of first impression concerning construction of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), as extended by the District of Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 36 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 501, 502 (1973) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cthe Longshoremen\u2019s Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-26\">The claimant in this case is Sonia Hilyer. On April 19, 1974 her husband, James H. Hilyer, was fatally injured during the course of his employment with respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Morrison-Knudsen Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of his death, Hilyer was a member of Local 456 of the Laborers\u2019 District Council of Washington, D.C. and Vicinity, an AFL-CIO affiliate. In addition to the covered employees\u2019 hourly rates of pay, the collective bargaining agreement between the union and Morrison-Knudsen provided that the company would pay fixed sums of money into three union trust funds. Specifically, the company agreed to pay twenty-eight cents into the health and welfare fund, thirty-five cents into the pension fund, and five cents into the training fund, for each hour that each employee worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Morrison-Knudsen began paying death benefits under the Act to the claimant immediately upon her husband\u2019s death. A dispute arose, however, over the amount of benefits to which she was entitled. Hilyer had been employed by Morrison-Knudsen for only five months when he died. During the year before his death, he had also been employed as a security guard and a grocery clerk, at substantially lower wages. In figuring his average weekly wage, the company took into account his prior employment. The claimant contended that her husband\u2019s average weekly wage should be based only on his employment with Morrison-Knudsen. She also contended that the company\u2019s contributions to the three union trust funds should be included as part of her husband\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Following a hearing, an administrative law judge agreed with the claimant that the average weekly wage should reflect only the deceased\u2019s earnings as a construction worker for Morrison-Knudsen. Accordingly, pursuant to section 10(b) of the Act, the average weekly wage was determined by reference to the average yearly wages of a fellow employee whose wages most closely resembled those of the deceased during the period he worked for Morrison-Knudsen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The administrative law judge further ruled, however, that the contributions to the union trust funds were not includable in the average weekly wage. At the hearing, the claimant also presented a claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to section 28 of the Act. Although she requested $7,530, the administrative law judge awarded a fee of $2,988.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">On cross-appeals to the Benefits Review Board, the Board upheld the administrative law judge\u2019s ruling with respect to the amount of benefits to which the claimant was entitled. The Board rejected the company\u2019s contention that section 10(b) should not be applied, and also rejected the claimants\u2019 contention that fringe benefit payments should have been included in the average weekly wage. The Board remanded the case, however, ordering that the administrative law judge give detailed reasons for the substantial reduction of the attorney\u2019s fee award. On remand, the case was assigned to a different administrative law judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The new administrative law judge increased the attorney\u2019s fee award to $4,000. The claimant again appealed to the Board, contending that the award was still inadequate. The Board modified the fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>award to $6,215. Both parties thereafter petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s order. The claimant contends that the Board should have included the employer\u2019s trust fund contributions in computing her husband\u2019s average weekly wage; the company contends that the Board\u2019s modification of the attorney\u2019s fee award was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We address first the .claimant\u2019s contention that the fringe benefits provided to her husband by means of the company\u2019s contributions to the union trust funds are a part of her husband\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d within the meaning of the Act. This issue has apparently not been addressed before. We begin our analysis with the specific language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The term \u201cwages\u201d is defined at section 2(13) of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201cWages\u201d means the money rate at which the service rendered is recompensed under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the injury, including the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer, and gratuities received in the course of employment from others than the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(13). We agree with the Board that this definition \u201cclearly implies that values received by an employee that are readily identifiable and calculable should be included in the determination of the average weekly wage.\u201d App. I at 51. Thus, for example, vacation pay constitutes wages, <em>Baldwin v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>5 BRBS 579, BRB No. 76-271 (March 15, 1977), as does overtime pay, <em>Gray v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>5 BRBS 279, BRB No. 76-105 (December 21,1976), although neither is explicitly mentioned in section 2(13).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question, then, is whether the benefit fund contributions are identifiable, calculable values received by the employees. We hold that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">We recognize that, as Morrison-Knudsen emphasizes, the contributions are made to the union funds, not to the employees, and that the individual employees have no voice in the day-to-day operation of the funds. The company cannot seriously maintain, however, that because the union funds receive the contributions, then the funds are the beneficiaries of the company\u2019s payments. The beneficiaries are the employees. The funds are no more than a channel; they are merely a means by which the company provides life insurance, health insurance, retirement benefits, and career training for its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">Further, it is indisputable that each of these benefits has substantial economic value to the employees. If they were not provided at the company\u2019s expense, each employee would have to spend his or her own money to acquire them. The Board apparently felt that it would be impossible to determine the \u201cvalue\u201d to an employee of the insurance policies, the career training, or the pension because whether and to what extent the employee might use them is highly speculative. This reasoning ignores the fact that an insurance policy must be bought and paid for whether or not a claim is ever made upon it. The economic advantage lies in the employer\u2019s provisions of such a policy at no cost to the employee. <em>See W. W. Cross v. NLRB, </em>174 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir. 1949).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The same is true of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>retirement pension and the career training. With respect to the pension, we agree with the Michigan appellate court\u2019s statement in <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Evart Products Co., </em>34 Mich.App. 247, 191 N.W.2d 136 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">We may only speculate whether plaintiff would have worked a full 10 years for defendant [and thereby obtained a vested interest in the pension fund] had she not been injured. However, the <em>facts </em>are that at the time of the injury her employer was putting aside this potential benefit for her and that the injury prevented a continuation of this potential toward a vested interest. As the result of her injury she must find some other way of providing income for retirement. The pension payment was a part of her weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">191 N.W.2d at 139 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As for career training, that too is something the employee would have had to spend his or her own money to acquire. It is therefore as much an economic advantage as are the insurance policies and the pension. That an employee may choose not to participate in the career training opportunity does not make the opportunity any less valuable, for it is of course up to each employee to decide what to do with the consideration tendered by the employer in return for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>353 U.S. 210, 77 S.Ct. 793, 1 L.Ed.2d 776 (1957), is instructive. In <em>Carter, </em>the Court found contributions of seven and one-half cents per hour to a union health and welfare fund to be part of the \u201csums justly due\u201d to employees under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a <em>et seq., </em>and held accordingly that a federal contractor\u2019s surety was liable for such contributions when the contractor failed to pay them. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">It is undisputed that if the collective-bargaining agreement had required the contractor to pay each employee <em>Pk </em>cents per hour above the prevailing wage rate, and the employee had, by contract with his bargaining representative, agreed to contribute that sum to the fund, the surety would have been obligated to make good any default in the contractor\u2019s payment of that extra <em>Th </em>cents per hour.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqx\"><em>Id. </em>at 217, 77 S.Ct. at 797. The same logic applies here. If Morrison-Knudsen paid the sixty-eight cents per hour to its employees, and the employees, in turn, paid this amount into the various funds, the sixty-eight cents per hour undoubtedly would be seen as part of the employees\u2019 wages. That result does not change simply because the company has agreed to eliminate two unnecessary steps by paying the contributions directly to the trust funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">It may be true, as the Board observed, that the sixty-eight cents per hour \u201cwould in all likelihood not buy decedent\u2019s family similar kinds of protection,\u201d App. I at 52, but the possible inadequacy of the contributions is no reason to withhold them altogether. Moreover, we think the above quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tation from the <em>Carter </em>case supports the conclusion that the most reasonable course is to measure the value of the fringe benefits by the amount of the employer\u2019s contributions to the benefit funds. We are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s concern that \u201cif contributions to the various funds were included in the average weekly wage, it would appear that to [calculate compensation payments under] section 10B, one would have to find a fellow employee who not only worked similar hours at a similar wage scale, but who had a similar status vis a vis union funds as well.\u201d App. I at 52. Such fears are unfounded. The benefit fund contributions are made on a per-hour basis for each employee, without regard to the employee\u2019s \u201cstatus vis a vis union funds.\u201d Thus, the contributions may be included in the average weekly wage under section 10(b) simply by determining the amount of the contributions made on behalf of the fellow employee who, having worked similar hours, serves as the referent in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Finally, Morrison-Knudsen\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Embassy Restaurant, </em>359 U.S. 29, 79 S.Ct. 554, 3 L.Ed.2d 601 (1959), is misplaced. There the Court held that, under the Bankruptcy Act, benefit fund contributions are not entitled to the priority given to \u201cwages .. . due to workmen.\u201d The Court emphasized, however, that the Bankruptcy Act gave priority strictly to wages, and that it was not intended to include additional forms of compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 79 S.Ct. at 557. Here, by contrast, the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is expressly defined to include many forms of compensation within the concept of \u201cwages.\u201d Further, the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to set a formula for distributing too few assets among too many creditors. Part of the Court\u2019s concern in <em>Embassy Restaurant </em>was that if contributions were given priority along with wages, \u201cthe workman [would] have to share with the welfare plan, thus reducing his own recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 79 S.Ct. at 557. Such a consideration is wholly absent in the present context. The purpose of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is to provide prompt compensation for injured employees or their families. Congress chose to carry out this design by including in the compensation formula <em>all </em>of the identifiable value, in whatever form it may appear, that the employee was receiving in return for his labor at the time of the injury. The Act is remedial, and we are obliged to construe it liberally, resolving doubts in favor of the claimant. <em>See, e.g., Friend </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>220 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir.1955). The strict construction given to the term \u201cwages\u201d in <em>Embassy Restaurant </em>is therefore inappropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In conclusion, it is clear that if the value received by the employee is reasonably identifiable and calculable, then it must be included in the average weekly wage of the employee. We hold that the fringe benefits at issue here amount to value received by the employees, and that it is reasonable to measure such value by the amount of the employer\u2019s contributions to the various fringe benefit funds. Therefore, those contributions must be included as part of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage in computing the compensation due under the Act. Accordingly, that part of the Board\u2019s decision concerning fringe benefits is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In its cross-petition for review of the Board\u2019s order, the company contends that the Board erred in modifying the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the administrative law judge. As the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">After careful review and consideration of the entire record . . ., we find that the administrative law judge\u2019s award of the attorney\u2019s fee herein is an abuse of discretion and contrary to law. Normally, the Board would remand this case to the administrative law judge for a second time for reconsideration; however, since Judge Thomas\u2019 Decision was of necessity based only upon a review of the records, as would be any subsequent decision he could render, in the interest of administrative economy the Board modifies the attorney\u2019s fee award to $6215.00. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The fee award made by the administrative law judge was for services performed in connection with the proceedings before him. The pertinent regulation provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">An attorney or other representative seeking a fee for services performed on behalf of a claimant with respect to claims filed under the Act <em>shall make application thereof to the persons, administrative body, or court before whom the services were performed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 701.132 (emphasis added). The company contends that the Board, in modifying a fee award for services performed before the administrative law judge, violated its own regulation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Initially, we note that the claimant\u2019s attorney complied with the requirement set out in the regulation: her attorney applied to the administrative law judge for attorney\u2019s fees for services performed before him, and to the Board for services performed before it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nothing in the regulation prohibits the Board from reviewing or revising the award set by the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">It is clear that the Board has the authority to review and reverse an administrative law judge\u2019s fee award if that award was an abuse of discretion. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. United States Steel Corp., </em>606 F.2d 53, 55 (3d Cir. 1979). The issue presented in the instant case is, however, more difficult: can the Board modify a fee award set by an administrative law judge rather than remand the case if the Board finds that award to be erroneous and an abuse of discretion. \u2022 We find that the Board had such authority in this case where the determination of attorney\u2019s fees was properly based solely on the record, and the complete record was before the Board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In its order, the Board discussed the factors to be considered in determining a fee award and applied those factors to the information contained in the record regarding attorney\u2019s fees. We therefore agree with the Board that since the full record was before it, the policies of administrative economy and a speedy resolution of this claim were furthered by the Board\u2019s decision to modify the fee award rather than remand for a second time to the administrative law judge. Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The order appealed from is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the Benefits Review Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. Morrison-Knudsen\u2019s insurer, the Argonaut Insurance Company, is also a respondent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">.

The original administrative law judge had since left the Department of Labor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\">. Similarly, transportation provided by the employer has been held to constitute \u201cwages\u201d under a state workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Leslie v. Reynolds, </em>179 Kan. 422, 295 P.2d 1076, 1083 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\">. In <em>W. W. Cross v. NLRB, </em>174 F.2d 875 (1st Cir. 1949), the First Circuit held that contributions to a group health insurance plan were \u201cwages\u201d for purposes of the mandatory bargaining provision of the NLRA as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">[T]he word \u201cwages\u201d in \u00a7 9(a) of the Act embraces within its meaning direct and immediate economic benefits flowing from the employment relationship.

NLRB, </em>170 F.2d 247 (7th Cir. 1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">. We have discovered only one other state court case that addresses the issue whether benefit fund contributions are part of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage for purposes of a workers\u2019 compensation statute. That case, <em>Still v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>27 Ariz.App. 142, 551 P.2d 591 (1976), is in direct conflict with the Michigan court\u2019s holding in <em>Hite, </em>quoted in the text above. In <em>Still, </em>the Arizona court viewed benefit fund contributions as akin to year-end bonuses, in that the amount the employer paid per hour worked by each employee remained the same without regard to the employee\u2019s rank or rate of pay. The court concluded that the contributions did not constitute wages because they were not the result of the employee\u2019s \u201cindividual effort,\u201d but rather resulted from the \u201ccollective effort\u201d of the union\u2019s negotiations with the employer. With respect, we find this \u201cindividual effort\u201d analysis unhelpful. It is immaterial that the benefits were obtained through the collective bargaining process, or that the benefits do not change according to job classification or seniority while rates of pay do change according to those criteria. The fact remains that the employer has agreed to furnish the employees with valuable benefits, in addition to hourly rates of pay, in return for the employees\u2019 services. The contributions are an important part of the employees\u2019 total compensation, and an equally important part of the employer\u2019s labor cost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">. The fees awarded by the Board for services performed in connection with proceedings before it are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\">. The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. United States Steel Corp., </em>606 F.2d 53 (3d Cir. 1979). In that case, the Board modified the fee award set by the administrative law judge, and the court of appeals reversed, finding that the Board exceeded its authority in modifying the award because the record did not contain \u201csufficient findings\u201d on which the Board could have based its determination of the award. The court noted, however, that it was not deciding \u201cthe question of whether the Board may, when presented with a full factual record, draw an appropriate conclusion from that record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The other cases cited by the company are also inapposite. In <em>Ayers S.S. Co. v. Bryant, </em>544 F.2d 812 (5th Cir. 1977), the claimant\u2019s attorney apparently applied to the court for fees for services performed before the court and the administrative law judge. The court refused to award fees for work performed before the administrative law judge. The court did not discuss the question whether a fee award is subject to modification by the reviewing body. Similarly, in <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>594 F.2d 986 (4th Cir. 1979), the court held that, according to the regulation, the claimant\u2019s attorney must apply separately to the deputy commissioner, administrative law judge, Board, or the court for fees generated by services performed before that person or body.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
