Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976), the Supreme Court left undecided the question whether Exemption 2 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>mits a federal agency to withhold documents whose \u201cdisclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case we are presented squarely with that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">This appeal involves a claim by the Government that portions of an agent\u2019s training manual of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms (BATF) should not be released pursuant to FOIA since to do so \u201cwould benefit those attempting to violate the law and avoid detection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Careful analysis of the statutory language of FOIA, its legislative history, and the ease law leads us to conclude that Congress enacted Exemption 2 to shield from disclosure materials such as the portions of the BATF manual at issue here. Accordingly, we hold that since the document for which disclosure is sought meets the test of \u201cpredominant internality,\u201d and since its disclosure significantly risks circumvention of federal statutes or regulations, the document is exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Nothing in this decision should be taken to question the result reached in our previous decision in <em>Jordan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753 (D.C.Cir.1978) <em>(en banc). </em>While our decision may appear inconsistent with one of the bare legal holdings in <em>Jordan, see id. </em>at 771, we nevertheless believe that from the facts as presented in <em>Jordan, </em>the <em>result </em>in that case would be identical under the test we announce today. It is the rationale in <em>Jordan </em>we reject insofar as it suggests that virtually all law enforcement manuals must be disclosed under FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-18\">In mid-1978 Michael Crooker filed a FOIA request with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, seeking a copy of an agency manual entitled \u201cSurveillance of Premises, Vehicles and Persons \u2014 New Agent Training.\u201d Complaint If 5, <em>located in </em>Record (R.) at 1. BATF initially denied Crooker\u2019s request in its entirety; however, following an administrative appeal, G. R. Dickerson, the Director of BATF, ordered the release of the manual except for portions of pages eight through twenty-nine. In his affidavit to the District Court, Director Dickerson wrote that \u201c[t]he deletions which appear in the document released to Mr. Crooker are all based on 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) and (b)(2) [Exemption 2],\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that portions of the manual were withheld because their release \u201cwould benefit those attempting to violate the law and avoid detection.\u201d Affidavit of G. R. Dickerson, R. at 10.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">After receiving Director Dickerson\u2019s decision on his administrative appeal, Crooker filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in the District Court seeking to compel BATF officials to produce the entire BATF manual. Complaint 115, R. at 1. Crooker subsequently moved for summary judgment, but did not support his motion with any affidavits or other documents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">In response, the Government filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment.\u201d R. at 10. In support of its motion, the Government included Dickerson\u2019s affidavit, as well as original and updated versions of the BATF manual for <em>in camera </em>inspection. The Government\u2019s \u201cStatement of Material Facts As to Which There Is No Genuine Issue\u201d consisted solely of the first eight paragraphs of Dickerson\u2019s affidavit. <em>See </em>R. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">Crooker responded to the Government\u2019s motion by filing a memorandum of points and authorities, and renewing his own plea for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Reply Memorandum, R. at 12. Crooker submitted no affidavits with his Reply Memorandum, and he made no attempt to contest the assertion in Dickerson\u2019s affidavit that release of the entire BATF manual \u201cwould benefit those attempting to violate the law and avoid detection.\u201d Rather, Crooker argued that \u201cwe are dealing with a manual that directly affects the public at large: surveillance of members of the public by federal authorities. The citizenry certainly has a significant interest in the manner in which they are spied on by agents of the federal government.\u201d Reply Memorandum, R. at 12.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">After examining the BATF manual <em>in camera, </em>the District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Crooker\u2019s motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>mary judgment as well as his request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In its brief order, the court held the material to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 2, citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cox v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>601 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1979). <em>See </em>Order, R. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">Crooker appealed the District Court\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a three-judge panel of this court decided without argument on November 12, 1980, that, under the holding of <em>Jordan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753 (D.C.Cir.1978) (en <em>banc), </em>the withheld portions of the BATF manual were not protected from disclosure by Exemption 2. On January 30, 1981, a majority of the full court of appeals voted to vacate the panel opinion and rehear the case <em>en banc. </em>The only issue on appeal before this court is whether certain portions of the BATF manual \u2014 \u201cSurveillance of Premises, Vehicles and Persons \u2014 New Agent Training\u201d \u2014 are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2 of FOIA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">II. EXEMPTION 2 AND ITS LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">A. <em>The Structure of FOIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979), in 1966 to replace section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, finding the existing statute to be \u201cfull of loopholes which allow agencies to deny legitimate information to the public.\u201d S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1965). It is clear that FOIA was designed to embody \u201ca general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language and to provide a court procedure by which citizens and the press may obtain information wrongfully withheld.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">As presently enacted, FOIA contains three distinct subsections setting forth the circumstances under which an agency must release information to the public.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section (a)(1) covers information that must be published in the Federal Register, and section (a)(2) covers materials that must be made \u201cavailable for public inspection and copying . . . unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale.\u201d Section (a)(3), under which Crooker requested the BATF manual, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-14\">Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request for records which (A) reasonably describes such records and (B) is made in accordance with published rules . . . shall make the records promptly available to any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-15\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-16\">Section (b) of the FOIA sets forth nine exemptions to disclosure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>section (b)(2), commonly called Exemption 2, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-4\">(b) This section [FOIA] does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-5\">(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5S\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(2). Whether or not portions of the BATF manual are exempt from disclosure depends on the scope of Exemption 2. To answer that question, we examine the language and legislative history of Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">B. <em>The Language and Legislative History of Exemption 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">Resort to the legislative history of a statutory provision is not necessary when the meaning of the provision is plain from its language. <em>See Markham v. Colonial Mortgage Service Co., Associates, Inc., </em>605 F.2d 566, 569 (D.C.Cir.1979). In this case \u2014 at least at first blush \u2014 the BATF manual appears to be encompassed by the literal language of Exemption 2. Nonetheless, we recognize that other interpretations of the brief language of Exemption 2 are possible. Accordingly, after examining the language of Exemption 2, we will turn to its legislative history to determine the underlying congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">In <em>Jordan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753, 763 (D.C.Cir.1978) <em>(en banc), </em>this court held that the phrase \u201cpersonnel rules and practices\u201d in Exemption 2 refers only to \u201cpay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking etc.\u201d Yet, in cases similar to the present one, involving requests for disclosure of a BATF \u201cRaids and Searches\u201d manual, the Second and Ninth Circuits have come to the opposite conclusion. In denying disclosure, these courts have held that, \u201c[fjrom its wording, [Exemption 2] would appear to apply to the contested portions of the [BATF] manual.\u201d <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>631 F.2d 653, 655 (9th Cir. 1980). <em>See Caplan v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>587 F.2d 544, 546 (2d Cir. 1978). We agree with the conclusions reached by the Ninth and Second Circuits regarding the meaning to be attributed to the statutory language. We thus hold that the words \u201cpersonnel rules and practices\u201d encompass not merely minor employment matters, but may cover other rules and practices governing agency personnel, including significant matters like job training for law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">The word \u201cinternal\u201d in Exemption 2 plainly limits the exemption to those rules and practices that affect the internal workings of an agency. \u201cRelated solely to\u201d limits the exemption to those matters that are truly internal, and not of legitimate public interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In his concurring opinion in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen (Vaughn II), </em>523 F.2d 1136 (D.C.Cir.1975), Judge Leventhal aptly observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-12\">In some attenuated sense, virtually everything that goes on in the Federal Government, and much that goes on outside of it, could be said to be \u201crelated\u201d through some chain of circumstances to the \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d The potentially all-encompassing sweep of a broad exemption of this type undercuts the vitality of any such approach. The legislature added the qualification that limited the exemption to items \u201crelating solely\u201d to internal personnel practices. Various opinions have relied on \u201csolely\u201d as a means of limiting the range of the (b)(2) exemption. That phrase too is open to an all-or-nothing interpretation; there are few events in our society today that occur without so much as a tiny ripple effect outside their area of prime impact. Thus pushed to their logical ends, \u201crelating\u201d is potentially all-encompassing while \u201csolely\u201d is potentially all-excluding. It seems unlikely that Congress intended either extreme, and that \u201csolely\u201d in this context has to be given the construction, consonant with reasonableness, of \u201cpredominantly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1150-51 (Leventhal, J., concurring) (footnote omitted). Pursuing this rationale in his concurring opinion in <em>Jordan, </em>Judge Leventhal, joined by Chief Judge Robinson, concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-4\">Exemption 2 is applicable where the document consists of internal instructions to such government officials as investigators and bank examiners. In such a case disclosure would permit circumvention of the law, and there is no substantial, valid external interest of the community at large in revelation. That composite presents a matter that involves solely internal personnel rules and internal practices of an agency for purposes of making Exemption 2 applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\"><em>Jordan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>591 F.2d at 783 (Leventhal, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">We agree with this interpretation of the literal meaning of Exemption 2. Aceord-ingly, we believe that the disputed portions of the BATF manual for new agents \u2014 setting forth law enforcement investigatory techniques \u2014 fall within the compass of Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">Despite our conclusion regarding the reasonable interpretation to be given the language of Exemption 2, we recognize that other interpretations are plausible. Consequently, we look to the legislative history of the exemption to determine whether it is possible to find a congressional intent that is plainly contrary to the meaning that we ascribe to Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">Exemption 2 was a part of the original FOIA enacted in 1966. Despite amendments to FOIA in 1967, 1974, 1976, and 1978, the language of Exemption 2 has remained unchanged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, the principal sources of legislative history concerning the exemption are the congressional hearings, reports, and debates prior to the 1966 enactment of FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">1. <em>FOIA in the Senate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">\u201cFreedom of Information Act\u201d bills were introduced in both the House and the Senate during the First Session of the Eighty-ninth -Congress.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In mid-May 1965, the Senate held extensive hearings on its version of the new FOIA, S. 1160, receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>comments from numerous private groups and federal agencies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As with an earlier version, S. 1666, which had been introduced and passed by the Senate in the previous Congress,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> several federal agencies vigorously opposed passage of the bill.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Senators themselves, however, made no comments on the witnesses\u2019 objections or on the scope of Exemption 2.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, the Senate hearings provide little enlightenment as to Congress\u2019 intent concerning Exemption 2.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">The principal expression of the Senate\u2019s understanding of FOIA, and in particular Exemption 2, is found in the Senate Report, S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965). In the section outlining the purpose of the bill, the Senate Report identified the inadequacies of the existing section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and claimed that the new bill would \u201cestablish a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. But, the Report also took note of certain \u201ccross-currents\u201d explicitly enacted into the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-10\">At the same time that a broad philosophy of \u201cfreedom of information\u201d is enacted into law, . . . [i]t is also necessary for the very operation of our Government to allow it to keep confidential certain material, such as the investigatory files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-11\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the Senate Report clearly recognized that the broad policy of full disclosure must be tempered in order to protect the \u201coperation of our Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">The Senate Report\u2019s description of Exemption 2 is brief, providing only a non-exclusive list of examples of matters exempt from disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-13\">Exemption No. 2 relates only to internal personnel rules and practices of an agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>cy. Examples of these may be rules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A28z\"><em>Id. </em>at 8. There is no additional discussion of Exemption 2 in the Senate Report, and there was absolutely no debate in the Senate on S. 1160.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">2. <em>FOIA in the House</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">During the First Session of the Eighty-ninth Congress, several bills to amend section 3 of the APA were introduced in the House. The House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Government Information held hearings on these bills from March 30 to April 5, 1965, <em>nearly a month and a half before the Senate hearings on S. 1160.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The principal House measure under consideration was H.R. 5012,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-6\">(c) This section does not authorize withholding information from the public or limiting the availability of records to the public except matters that are ... (2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-15\"><em>House Hearings on H.R. 5012, supra </em>note 21, at 3. In all material respects the language of Exemption 2 in H.R. 5012 was identical to the language in the Senate bill that later became law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-16\">The House hearings unequivocally reveal that Exemption 2 was intended to cover investigatory materials. During an exchange involving Congressman Moss, the principal sponsor of the bill and chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearings, Mr. Kass, counsel to the subcommittee, and Mr. Schlei, Assistant Attorney General, Congressman Moss said, in response to Mr. Schlei\u2019s objection that Exemption 2 \u201cdid not go far enough:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-17\">What [Exemption 2] was intended to cover was instances such as the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner \u2014 a bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an FBI agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 29,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-19\">Several months after completion of the Moss hearings on H.R. 5012, the House Committee on Government Operations took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>up consideration of S. 1160,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and reported the bill without amendment on May 9,1966. <em>See </em>112 Cong.Rec. 10053 (1966). The House Report on S. 1160, H.R.Rep.No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1966), reiterates the general view expressed in the Senate Report that section 3 of the APA \u201chas become the major statutory excuse for withholding Government records from public view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">In its description of Exemption 2, the House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-16\">2. Matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency: Operating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure, but this exemption would not cover all \u201cmatters of internal management\u201d such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 10. Plainly, the House Report\u2019s brief description of Exemption 2 differs from the Senate Report\u2019s description in important respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">This deviation has been discussed in other opinions,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and it comes to this: The Senate Report expressly states that documents concerning minor matters of employment \u2014 like sick leave policy \u2014 are exempt from disclosure, whereas the House Report indicates that such matters should be released. The so-called contradiction between the House and Senate Reports, however, exists only with respect to the exemption of trivial employment matters. The House Report\u2019s statement that Exemption 2 permits exemption of more substantive matters \u2014 such as \u201cmanuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners\u201d \u2014 is uncontro-verted by the Senate Report.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Another important source of congressional intent is the House debate on S. 1160.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Congressman Moss, who had introduced similar legislation (H.R. 5012) in the House, and had conducted hearings on S. 1160, carefully noted the cross-currents of congressional concern expressed in the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0y\">[T]he committee has, with the utmost sense of responsibility, attempted to achieve a balance between a public need to know and a necessary restraint upon access to information in specific instances. The bill lists nine categories of Federal documents which may be withheld to protect the national security or permit effective operation of the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asq-dedup-0\">112 Cong.Ree. 13641 (1966) (remarks of Rep. Moss). Representative Dole also spoke in support of S. 1160, indicating his belief that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aza-dedup-0\">the bill takes into consideration the right to know of every citizen while affording the safeguards necessary to the effective functioning of Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 13655 (remarks of Rep. Dole). Representative Gallagher was even more specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMi\">I would like to reiterate that the bill also prevents the disclosure of other types of \u201csensitive\u201d Government information such as . . . income tax auditors\u2019 manual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-9\">Income tax auditors\u2019 manual would be protected under No. 2 \u2014 \u201crelated solely to internal personnel rules and practices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajv-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 13659 (remarks of Rep. Gallagher).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">From these brief, but uncontradicted, statements in the House debate on S. 1160, we can see that the members of the House recognized that the unrestricted release of government documents might interfere with the \u201ceffective operation of the Government,\u201d and that the nine exemptions were included in S. 1160 to prevent such interference. More specifically and importantly, supporters of S. 1160 were not challenged in their claim that government investigatory manuals were protected under Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">We believe that the remarks from the debate are highly instructive. Particularly because in the present case Crooker has not disputed that release of the BATF manual will help individuals to evade the law, we are loathe to construe the statute in a way contrary to the express feelings of one house, on a point on which the other house made no comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">III. OTHER INDICATIONS OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"A88V\">The legislative history of Exemption 2 is not the only source of congressional intent regarding its scope. Indeed, it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADoY\">fundamental that a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>context of the whole Act, and that in fulfilling our responsibility in interpreting legislation, \u201cwe must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but [should] look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\"><em>Richards </em>v. <em>United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 11, 82 S.Ct. 585, 591, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As this court stated in <em>Certified Color Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Mathews, </em>543 F.2d 284, 296 (D.C.Cir.1976), \u201c[i]t is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that legislative enactments be construed in a manner designed to give effect to all parts while avoiding a result contrary to the apparent intent of Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aq0-dedup-0\">As we have seen above, Congress believed that FOIA resolved two crucial but potentially conflicting interests: the right of the citizenry to know what the Government is doing, and the legitimate but limited need for secrecy to maintain the effective operation of Government. Two other subsections of FOIA, section (a)(2)(C) and section (b)(7)(E) [Exemption 7(E) ], reinforce the conclusion that Congress was aware of the need to protect investigative techniques from disclosure, and that Congress took action to prevent their disclosure. In short, these provisions reveal that Congress did not intend that FOIA would frustrate law enforcement efforts. While the congressional purpose behind these two sections is not dispositive to the question regarding Exemption 2, their inclusion in FOIA points to the conclusion that Congress believed that FOIA would not mandate release of materials containing law enforcement investigative techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">A. <em>Section (a)(2)(C)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">Section (a)(2)(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-11\">(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-12\">(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-13\">unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-14\">When S. 1160 was originally introduced in the Senate, the provision that was later to become section (a)(2)(C)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> referred to \u201cstaff manuals\u201d and not \u201cadministrative staff manuals.\u201d During Senate hearings on S. 1160, several witnesses expressed their fears that this language would mandate release of information that could damage or hinder law enforcement efforts. For example, Professor Kenneth C. Davis stated that the provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-15\">goes too far and needs to be cut back. For instance, one who is investigated may be affected by instructions to the investigator about how to investigate, but some such instructions are properly confidential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-16\"><em>Senate Hearings on S. 1160, supra </em>note 15, at 178 (statement of Kenneth C. Davis). The Securities and Exchange Commission, while declining to give an opinion on the scope of the provision, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-17\">we fear its possible effect on our investigative and other enforcement activities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>We agree that the public should have access to such materials as will facilitate compliance with the law and transactions with the agency. But disclosure of investigative techniques set out in staff training manuals, for example, would virtually provide a blueprint for evading the law to prospective violators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 292 (Memorandum of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Comm, on the Judiciary). The Department of Agriculture concurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-6\">The Department is strongly opposed to this provision. There are many types of staff manuals and instructions to staff that may affect members of the public but should not be published or made available for public inspection and copying. For example, staff manuals concerning investigation procedures or techniques to develop evidence of alleged violations of regulatory statutes . . . may affect members of the public but they are internal in nature and should not be published or made available to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 381 (Detailed Analysis of S. 1336 by the U. S. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">Although the members of the Senate subcommittee did not respond directly to these comments, the committee report recommended adding the word \u201cadministrative\u201d to the expression \u201cstaff manual.\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1965). In discussing the proposed amendment to S. 1160, the Senate Report stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-9\">The limitation of the staff manuals and instructions affecting the public which must be made available to the public to those which pertain to administrative matters rather than to law enforcement matters protects the traditional confidential nature of instructions to Government personnel prosecuting violations of law in court, while permitting a public examination of the basis for administrative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-13\">The House Report explained in more detail the scope of the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-14\">[A]n agency may not be required to make available those portions of its staff manuals and instructions which set forth criteria or guidelines for the staff in auditing or inspection procedures, or in the selection or handling of cases, such as operational tactics, allowable tolerances, or criteria for defense, prosecutions, or settlement of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-15\">H.R.Rep.No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-8 (1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, pp. 2418, 2424.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-16\">Clearly, one of the \u201ccross-currents\u201d apparent from reviewing section (a)(2)(C) and its legislative history is Congress\u2019 deep concern that manuals setting forth guidelines for auditing or inspection procedures should not be released to the public. Moreover, Congress acted specifically to prevent such a result, consistent with the secondary emphasis in the statute \u2014 that FOIA not be drafted so as to interfere with the effective operation of Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-17\">B. <em>Section (b)(7)(E)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-18\">Similar indications of congressional intent are apparent from the 1974 amendments to FOIA. Following the Act\u2019s passage in 1966, it became clear to many members of Congress that a number of federal agencies were using Exemption 7 to block legitimate requests for information.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In response to the intransigence of these agencies, Congress revised Exemption 7 as a part of the 1974 amendments to FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-19\">As reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the original version of S. 2543, which later emerged as the 1974 legislation amending FOIA, left Exemption 7 intact. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> During the Senate debate, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>ever, Senator Hart offered an amendment listing the specific circumstances under which a document would be exempt under Exemption 7. In part, his proposal provided that records need not be disclosed if they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-4\">(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would . . . (D) disclose investigative techniques and procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\"><em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 17033 (1974). In this amendment, Senator Hart recognized the legitimate law enforcement need for withholding some materials from disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akh3\">[T]he amendment would protect against the release of investigative techniques and procedures where such techniques and procedures are not generally known outside the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 17034 (remarks of Sen. Hart).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">Senator Kennedy, speaking in support of the amendment, made it clear that Senator Hart\u2019s addition was necessary to force courts to follow the <em>original </em>intent of Congress in enacting FOIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-8\">[W]hether or not this amendment is adopted, I would like to make it clear that I believe the courts have, in narrowly and mechanically interpreting the seventh exemption, strayed from the requirements and the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act .... I thus want the record to show that by accepting the Senator\u2019s amendment <em>we will be reemphasizing and clarifying what the law presently requires.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 17034-35 (remarks of Sen. Kennedy) (emphasis added). After the debate, the Senate adopted Senator Hart\u2019s amendment and the entire bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-16\">The House, meanwhile, considered a similar bill, H.R. 12471. As reported out of committee, the House bill included no changes to Exemption 7. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No. 876, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974/ p. 6267; 120 Cong.Rec. 6814 (1974) (remarks of Rep. Fas-cell) (\u201cThe pending legislation, therefore, does not change the language of eight of the nine exemptions.\u201d) The bill, as reported, was passed in the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-17\">The conference committee appointed to iron out the differences between the Senate and House bills<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> adopted the Senate amendment to Exemption 7 and added an additional provision,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>see </em>H.R.Rep.No.1380, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1974), but its explanation of Exemption 7(E) adds little to the language of the amendment.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Both the House and the Senate passed the bill, as reported by the conference committee, which now included Senator Hart\u2019s amendments to Exemption 7.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-18\">Again, the legislative history of Exemption 7(E) is not dispositive of the issue before this court, but it is instructive.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>cause Exemption 7(E) was not added to change FOIA but to \u201creemphasize and clarify\u201d Congress\u2019 original intent, the 1974 Amendments provide valuable insight into Congress\u2019 intent when it enacted FOIA, and Exemption 2, in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\">IV. CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">At this point in the discussion, it is appropriate to set forth certain critical conclusions distilled from the legislative history of FOIA. Clearly, FOIA was primarily envisioned as a workable disclosure statute that would eliminate the pervasive secrecy of the Federal Government. But our recognition of this explicit purpose should not obscure a secondary, but nevertheless fundamental, aspect of the <em>bill </em>\u2014 i.e. to exempt certain limited categories of documents from mandatory disclosure in order to protect individual rights and to permit the effective operation of the Government. In order to implement this secondary purpose, Congress included in FOIA nine exemptions from mandatory disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">From the House, we have unequivocal statements in the hearings, the House Report, and the debate that Exemption 2 was intended to shield internal instructions to law enforcement agents from mandatory disclosure.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Senate gives us less guidance since the Senators made no useful comments during the Senate hearings, and held no debate at all on FOIA. The Senate Report indicates that Exemption 2 covers minor employment matters, but it does not expressly limit the scope of Exemption 2 to such matters. Thus, the legislative history from the Senate and House is not contradictory as regards materials that would \u201caid in circumvention of the law.\u201d Instead the Senate was silent on this point, and the House stated that such materials would be exempt from mandatory disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">Other provisions of FOIA also demonstrate the \u201ccross-currents\u201d of concerns that Congress hoped to resolve in FOIA. In both sections (a)(2)(C) and (b)(7)(E) [Exemption 7(E)], Congress acted to block the production of materials that would result in the disclosure of investigatory techniques. In attempting to interpret FOIA as a consistent whole, we must recognize that these two sections are at least indicators of what Congress believed FOIA would do. It would be inconsistent to no small degree to hold that Exemption 2 would not bar the disclosure of investigatory techniques when contained in a manual restricted to internal use, but that Exemption 7(E) would exempt the release of such techniques if contained in an \u201cinvestigatory record.\u201d We see no reason, absent some persuasive evidence in the legislative history, to attribute such confused motives to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">Furthermore, upon reflection, it would appear that the Senate and House interpretations of Exemption 2 may be reconcilable. The Senate\u2019s concern in Exemption 2 was with matters so minor as to be of no genuine public concern, as opposed to \u201cmore substantial matters which might be the subject of legitimate public interest.\u201d <em>Vaughn v. Rosen (Vaughn II), </em>523 F.2d at 1142. The House, however, felt that certain substantial matters were not \u201cthe subject of legitimate public interest,\u201d notably investigatory techniques used by law enforcement agencies. \u2022 From <em>both </em>houses, however, comes the common intent to use Exemption 2 to exempt from disclosure those internal personnel matters not \u201cthe subject of legitimate public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">This is not to say that it is up to the courts to decide what matters are of legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>mate public interest. <em>Congress </em>has made the determination that except for certain specified materials, all government documents are of legitimate public interest. In the present case we are not deciding what is in the public interest. Rather, by application of the statutory language, and direct reference to the legislative history, we must determine what matters Congress sought to exempt from disclosure. It will not do to apply individual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to Congress\u2019. intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforcement efforts. Rather it is our job to interpret the law as we believe Congress meant it to be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">V. THE CASE LAW ON EXEMPTION 2</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">Several courts of appeals have considered whether to release documents similar to the BATF manual sought by Crooker in the present case. A review of these cases shows that each of these circuits, except for the District of Columbia Circuit, has refused to order the release of such materials. Some of these decisions have rested on Exemption 2, others on section (a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">A. <em>Supreme Court Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The starting point for most circuit court decisions on Exemption 2 is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Department of the Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). In <em>Rose </em>the respondents sought to obtain case summaries of honor and ethics hearings at the Air Force Academy. Although the District Court ruled that Exemption 2 protected the summaries from disclosure, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the summaries must be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">In its discussion of Exemption 2, the Supreme Court recognized the explicit contradiction in the House and Senate Reports concerning whether minor employment matters are exempt from disclosure. The Court concluded that, \u201cin this regard,\u201d the Senate Report was the more authoritative. <em>See id. </em>at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 1602. But the Court was also careful to note the emphasis in the House Report on the availability of Exemption 2 to prevent the release of materials that would result in the disclosure of investigative techniques. In this regard, the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-12\">Those cases relying on the House, rather than the Senate, interpretation of Exemption 2, and permitting agency withholding of matters of some public interest, have done so only <em>where necessary to prevent the circumvention of agency regulations </em>that might result from disclosure to the subjects of regulation of the procedural manuals and guidelines used by the agency in discharging its regulatory function. . . . Moreover, the legislative history indicates that <em>this was the primary concern of the committee drafting the House Report.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 364, 96 S.Ct. at 1600 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Later in the opinion the Court repeated that it accepted the Senate interpretation of the exemption on minor employment matters in part \u201cbecause we think the primary focus of the House Report was on exemption of disclosures that might enable the regulated to circumvent agency regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 96 S.Ct. 1601-02. Finally, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXB\">In sum, we think that, <em>at least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation, </em>Exemption 2 is not applicable to matters subject to such a genuine and significant public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 1603 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">Clearly, <em>Rose </em>left open the question that faces us in the present case. At the same time, it is equally clear that the Supreme Court considered as substantial the argument that Exemption 2 might be construed to cover internal agency materials where disclosure might risk circumvention of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">B. <em>D.C. Circuit Case Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFS\">The first significant case in this circuit dealing with the scope of Exemption 2 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number><em>Vaughn v. Rosen (Vaughn II), </em>523 F.2d 1136 (D.C.Cir.1975). In <em>Vaughn II, </em>the plaintiff had sought the release of \u201cEvaluation of Personnel Management\u201d reports, prepared by the Civil Service Commission, to provide advice to agencies on how to improve their personnel programs. After considering the conflict between the Senate and House Reports, the court of appeals concluded \u201cthat the Senate Committee Report is authoritative and that Exemption 2 exempts from disclosure only routine \u2018house-keeping\u2019 matters in which it can be presumed the public lacks any substantial interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1141. The court believed that \u201cthe Senate Report indicates that the line sought to be drawn is one between minor or trivial matters and those more substantial matters which might be the subject of <em>legitimate </em>public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1142 (emphasis added). As a consequence of its analysis, the court ordered the reports released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Part of the rationale underlying the decision in <em>Vaughn II </em>is that FOIA is a broad disclosure statute, and that any uncertainty in interpreting the Act \u201crequires us to choose that interpretation most favoring disclosure.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet this interpretative approach may be too superficial, for it fails to take into account all of the \u201ccross-currents\u201d of concerns expressed by those members of Congress supporting the enactment of FOIA.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">Judge Leventhal, who concurred separately in <em>Vaughn II, </em>considered the majority\u2019s . analysis \u2014 that the Senate Report should be given greater weight than the House Report because the bill was passed first in the Senate \u2014 to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae5\">a novel and totally unpersuasive canon of statutory construction .... The argument that the Senate Report was \u201cavailable\u201d to the House members is theoretical: The members of the House committee did have the Senate Report, but they departed from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1148.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Moreover, he believed that even if the Senate Report afforded more disclosure, and thus was \u201cmore in keeping with the overall purpose of disclosure^] that does not answer questions about the construction of any particular provision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">In considering Exemption 2, Judge Lev-enthal reasoned that it \u201capparently signified a determination that the public interest would not be furthered by a requirement of public disclosure of certain \u2018internal\u2019 matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150. Since, however, the documents sought in <em>Vaughn II </em>were neither solely nor even predominantly<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> related to the internal practices of an agency, he believed that they should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">In 1978, this court decided <em>Jordan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1978) <em>(en banc).</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff, Jordan, sought from the Justice Department two documents relating to guidelines for prosecutorial discretion. In an affidavit, the United States Attorney stated that release of these documents would permit individuals to \u201cexploit these policies [of prosecutorial discretion] by committing crimes within these select categories, thereby escaping prosecution.\u201d 591 F.2d at 758.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Examining the language of Exemption 2, the majority in <em>Jordan </em>held that the \u201c[t]he Manual or Guidelines of the type at issue are simply not \u2018personnel\u2019 rules or practices,\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cfrom the face of the statute . . . the Guidelines at issue here are not within the specific language of Exemption 2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. Apparently in partial justification of this holding, the majority opinion added that \u201cExemption 2 was not designed to protect documents whose disclosure might risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Regarding the legislative history of Exemption 2, the majority in <em>Jordan </em>concluded that the interpretations of Exemption 2 in the House and Senate Reports conflicted, and that the Senate Report gave the preferred construction. The majority accepted the Senate Report to the exclusion of the House Report because it believed that the Senate Report was more consistent with the language of Exemption 2, that the House Report offered no useful guidelines for agency officials, that the House interpretation was too sweeping (and thus inconsistent with the overall purpose of FOIA), and that \u201cthe House Report was the product of last minute chicanery by interested members of the House.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">A total of five judges signed the majority opinion. One of them, Judge Bazelon, also wrote separately to emphasize his belief that \u201can important feature of [the] decision\u201d was to eliminate \u201csecret law,\u201d such as the guidelines for prosecutorial discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 781 (Bazelon, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">Judge Leventhal, with Chief Judge Robinson joining him, concurred separately. Judge Leventhal wrote that where \u201cdisclosure would permit circumvention of the law, and there is no substantial, valid external interest of the community at large in revelation,\u201d internal instructions to investigators would be exempt under Exemption 2. <em>Id. </em>at 783. He argued that while the House Report was not as persuasive generally as the Senate Report, it was \u201cnot a nullity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, he and Chief Judge Robinson joined in affirming the District Court since they believed that <em>Jordan </em>was not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-9\">a case of predominant internality, but rather a case of substantial public interest in disclosure that is not offset by an interest in preventing circumvention of law or regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">Judge MacKinnon, joined by Judge Robb, dissented, largely on the basis that section (a)(2)(C) exempted the documents from disclosure. <em>See id. </em>at 785-96 (MacKinnon, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">Following <em>Jordan, </em>this circuit issued <em>Cox v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>601 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1979). In a brief <em>per curiam </em>opinion,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the court held that a \u201cMarshal\u2019s Manual\u201d \u2014 which gave details concerning the U. S. Marshals\u2019 weapons and handcuffs, and their transportation of prisoners \u2014 was protected from disclosure under Exemption 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>since the \u201cdeleted portions of the Manual unquestionably fall within subsection (b)\u2019s exemption for routine matters of merely internal interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The court sought to distinguish <em>Jordan </em>in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-4\">The undisclosed material [sought by Cox] does not purport to regulate activities among members of 'the public. Nor does it set standards to be followed by agency personnel in deciding whether to proceed against or to take action affecting members of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">In <em>Lesar v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>636 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1980), the plaintiff sought reports and documents from the Justice Department concerning the FBI\u2019s investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther King. On the basis of Exemption 2, the Department resisted disclosure of \u201csymbols used to refer to FBI informants in FBI documents and records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. This court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-7\">We also find that the informant codes plainly fall within the ambit of Exemption 2. The means by which the FBI refers to informants in its investigative files is a matter of internal significance in which the public has no substantial interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 485-86. In support of the proposition that \u201cthe public has no legitimate interest in gaining information that could lead to the exposure of confidential sources,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 486, the court cited Exemption 7(D), which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation that would disclose the identity of a confidential source in investigatory records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.78. Thus, in <em>Lesar, </em>the court referred to the language of another FOIA provision in order to determine the congressional intent underlying Exemption 2. It is also significant that <em>Lesar </em>does'not restrict the scope of Exemption 2 to minor employment matters, as the court did in Jordan.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-13\">From these cases it is plain that there is some uncertainty in this circuit regarding the scope of Exemption 2: While <em>Cox </em>purports to follow the analysis in <em>Jordan, </em>its result seems inconsistent with the rationale of <em>Jordan </em><footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Moreover, the logic and even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>result of <em>Lesar </em>seem at odds with that in <em>Jordan. </em>In <em>Lesar </em>the court referred to Exemption 7(D) to decide whether the public had a legitimate interest in disclosure sufficient to overcome Exemption 2. To the extent <em>Jordan </em>holds that Exemption 2 does not exempt law enforcement training or investigative manuals, despite the language of Exemption 7(E), it would appear to be inconsistent with the approach followed in <em>Lesar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">C. <em>Case Law in Other Circuits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The cases from other circuits may be divided into two categories: those that have exempted law enforcement investigatory manuals under section (a)(2)(C); and those that have used Exemption 2 to exempt internal law enforcement manuals whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">1. <em>Cases Relying on Section (a)(2)(C)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-10\">The first court of appeals decision to consider the conflict between the Senate and House Reports was <em>Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>467 F.2d 787 (6th Cir. 1972). In <em>Hawkes </em>the appellant sought an IRS tax manual in order to prepare his defense on charges of criminal tax fraud. The Sixth Circuit held that the Senate and House Reports were in complete contradiction, and that the language of the Senate Report was controlling.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> As a result, the court concluded that it was unlikely that Exemption 2 barred the disclosure of the manual since \u201cwe believe that the internal practices and policies referred to in (b)(2) relate only to the employee-employer type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>concerns upon which the Senate Report focused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Despite its ruling on Exemption 2, the court in <em>Hawkes </em>found that the Senate had added the word \u201cadministrative\u201d in section (a)(2)(C) of FOIA, see note 1, supra, \u201cto bar disclosure of information which, if known to the public, would <em>significantly impede </em>the enforcement process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Thus, although the Sixth Circuit held that Exemption 2 does not exempt certain internal manuals describing investigative techniques, it ruled that Congress had exempted the manuals under another section of FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">In 1978, the Eighth Circuit decided <em>Cox v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice (Cox I), </em>576 F.2d 1302 (8th Cir. 1978), in which federal agencies cited Exemption 2 and section (a)(2)(C) to resist disclosure of a \u201cDrug Enforcement Agency [DEA] Agents Manual.\u201d The court quoted extensively from the Sixth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>467 F.2d 789 (6th Cir. 1972) , and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Stokes v. Brennan, </em>476 F.2d 699 (5th Cir. 1973) , in holding that materials that may aid in evasion of the law would be exempt under section (a)(2)(C). The court also wrote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-9\">(b)(7) does not apply directly to the present case. It does, however, demonstrate an intention by Congress to restrict public access to some law enforcement information, and the section serves as a practical guide for determining which information in the DEA Agents Manual may be withheld from the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1308. The court\u2019s sole reference to Exemption 2 was to state that \u201c(b)(2) exempts only \u2018housekeeping\u2019 matters in which \u2018the public could not reasonably be expected to have an interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309-10, quoting <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 369-70, 96 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-15\">This opinion was followed one year later by <em>Cox v. Levi, </em>592 F.2d 460 (8th Cir. 1979), in which the plaintiff sought the \u201cFBI Manual of Rules and Regulations\u201d and the \u201cFBI Manual of Instructions.\u201d The District Court had held that Exemption 2 exempted those portions of the Manual of Instructions that related to FBI investigative techniques and procedures, \u201cthe disclosure of which would impede the agency in its efforts to carry out its law enforcement responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court holding, however, that those pages whose disclosure would impede law enforcement efforts were exempt not under Exemption 2, but under section (a)(2)(C). The court expressly noted that in <em>Cox I, </em>it had \u201cadopted the narrow interpretation of exemption (b)(2) contained in the Senate Report on the FOIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a footnote, the court stated that <em>Cox I </em>\u201cimplicitly rejected\u201d the House Report. <em>Id. </em>at n.6.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-16\">Thus, the Sixth and Eighth Circuits have rejected the argument that Exemption 2 exempts agency manuals whose disclosure may risk circumvention of the law. However, both of these circuits have found that section (a)(2)(C) exempts such materials from disclosure, thus lending support to the proposition that Congress did not want these materials released.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-17\">2. <em>Cases Relying on Exemption 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-18\">After the Eighth Circuit decided <em>Cox I, </em>the Second Circuit issued <em>Caplan v. Bureau </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number><em>of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>587 F.2d 544 (2d Cir. 1978), in which the plaintiff had sought a BATF pamphlet entitled \u201cRaids and Searches.\u201d The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\u2019s specific finding that \u201cthe release of such parts of the pamphlet would hinder investigations, enable violators to avoid detection and jeopardize the safety of Government agents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545. The Second Circuit relied heavily on language in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rose </em>where the Court had qualified its holding: \u201cat least <em>where the situation is not one where the disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation, </em>Exemption 2 is not applicable to matters subject to such a genuine significant public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, quoting <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 1603 (emphasis in Caplan). The Second Circuit opinion reasoned that the disputed pamphlet did not involve \u201csecret law,\u201d but focused \u201con the techniques for apprehending those who engage in breaking the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. Considering \u201cthe full Senate Report,\u201d including its discussion of section (a)(2)(C), the court was \u201cpersuaded that the (b)(2) exemption, as the Supreme Court suggested in <em>Rose, </em>includes internal material such as the withheld portions of the BATF manual where disclosure may .risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">Following <em>Caplan, </em>the Ninth Circuit issued <em>Hardy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>631 F.2d 653 (9th Cir. 1980). As in <em>Caplan, </em>the plaintiff sought portions of a manual entitled \u201cRaids and Searches.\u201d In an affidavit, BATF \u201cexplained how disclosure would enable violators to evade or hinder law enforcement personnel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. The court wrote that, but for the conflicting House and Senate Reports, \u201c[fjrom its wording, [Exemption 2] would appear to apply to the contested portions of the manual here.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">The court in <em>Hardy </em>specifically rejected the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits\u2019 reliance of section (a)(2)(C) to exempt the material. It also rejected the D. C. Circuit\u2019s rationale in <em>Cox v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>601 F.2d 1, 4 (D.C.Cir.1979), denying disclosure because the materials were those \u201cin which the public could not reasonably be expected to have a legitimate interest,\u201d since such a rule \u201cplaces courts in the difficult position of determining when the interest of the public in governmental matters is \u2018legitimate.\u2019 \u201d 631 F.2d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">Instead, the Ninth Circuit followed the rationale in <em>Caplan </em>that materials were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2 if \u201cthe disclosure . . . may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court believed that Exemption 2\u2019s language was fully applicable since \u201c[mjaterials instructing law enforcement agents on how to investigate violations concern internal personnel practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court remanded the case to the District Court \u201cto determine whether [deleted portions of the manual] involve law enforcement material, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">From this survey, it appears that the case law on Exemption 2 is scattered. It is important to note, however, that every circuit that has considered the issue, except the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Jordan, </em>has held that FOIA does not mandate the release of investigatory manuals where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">VI. DISPOSITION OF THE PRESENT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">Our review of the statutory language of Exemption 2,. its underlying legislative history, and the other provisions in FOIA leads us to agree with the Second and Ninth Circuits that the portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>BATF manual withheld in this case are protected from disclosure under Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">We stress that the language of Exemption 2 supports our conclusion of nondisclosure. The instructions to BATF agents contained in the BATF manual are not written to regulate the public. Likewise, the manual does not embody any \u201csecret law\u201d of the agency.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Rather, the deleted portions of the manual refer to investigative techniques, in the form of prescribed rules and practices for agency personnel. Indeed, it is uncontroverted that the disputed rules here have been developed predominantly for internal uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Obviously, the deleted portions of the manual, as with any \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency,\u201d have some effect on the public-at-large. As Judge Leventhal noted in <em>Vaughn II, </em>\u201cthere are few events in our society today that occur without so much as a tiny ripple effect outside their area of prime impact.\u201d 523 F.2d at 1150 (Leventhal, J., concurring). The critical considerations here, however, are that the manual is used for predominantly internal purposes; it is designed to establish rules and practices for agency personnel, j.e., law enforcement investigatory techniques; it involves no \u201csecret law\u201d of the agency; and it is <em>conceded </em>that public disclosure would risk circumvention of agency regulations. Given these considerations, we hold that the deleted portions of the BATF manual are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">Although the majority opinion in <em>Jordan </em>stated that the language of Exemption 2 \u201cwould seem to refer to those rules and practices that concern relations among the employees of an agency,\u201d 591 F.2d at 763, and that \u201cpersonnel\u201d \u201cnormally connote[s] matters relating to pay, pension, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc.,\u201d <em>id., </em>we feel that the meaning of Exemption 2 is not so limited. In fact, as observed above, two other circuits agree that \u201c[fjrom \u2022its wording, [Exemption 2] would appear to apply to the contested portions of the manual here.\u201d <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>631 F.2d 653, 655 (9th Cir. 1980). Thus, while we recognize that the language of Exemption 2 alone may not answer the issue presented in this case, we conclude that it supports our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">To the extent that the legislative history underlying FOIA is helpful, it also supports our conclusion. In both the House hearings and the House debates, members of the House spoke without contradiction that Exemption 2 was designed to protect law enforcement investigatory manuals from disclosure. The House Report reiterates that point. The Senate hearings give little indication of congressional intent and there were no Senate debates. The Senate Report, while helpful in providing some guidance in interpreting the language of Exemption 2, is <em>not </em>inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>House Report with respect to the question of investigative manuals.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">We are also concerned that every other circuit considering the issue has barred the mandatory release of these materials, whether through the use of Exemption 2 or section (a)(2)(C). In particular, the Second and Ninth Circuits have specifically held such materials exempt under Exemption 2. Embracing the language of the Supreme Court in <em>Rose, </em>they have held \u201cthat law enforcement materials, disclosure of which may risk circumvention of agency regulation, are exempt from disclosure.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>631 F.2d 653, 657 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Caplan v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>587 F.2d 544, 548 (2d Cir. 1978). These decisions are hardly surprising since the overall design of FOIA, the explicit comments made in the House, the cautionary words of the Supreme Court in <em>Rose, </em>and even common sense, would seem to belie any suggestion that Congress enacted a statute whose provisions undermined its criminal statutes and the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">It is not up to this court to balance the public interest in disclosure against any reason for avoiding disclosure.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Congress has done the necessary balancing and enacted FOIA to represent the \u201ccross-currents\u201d of concern.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Rather, our job is to determine congressional intent. In determining that intent, we, of course, look to the statute, its structure, and its purpose as expressed in the legislative history. Consequently, we must construe Exemption 2 narrowly in or-</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">der to be consistent with congressional intent that FOIA be a disclosure statute. Yet, it will not do for us to act on the primary purpose of the statute to the exclusion of all other express congressional concerns. As we have shown above, Congress evidenced a secondary purpose when it enacted FOIA of preserving the effective operation of governmental agencies. We must consider this purpose, too, when we construe Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">Accordingly, we hold that if a document for which disclosure is sought meets the test of \u201cpredominant internality,\u201d and if disclosure significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes, then Exemption 2 exempts the material from mandatory disclosure. In this formulation, we adopt the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Rose </em>as well as the expression \u201cpredominant internality\u201d as used by Judge Leventhal in his concurring opinion in <em>Vaughn II. </em>We add the word \u201csignificantly\u201d to stress the narrow scope of our construction of Exemption 2; in all cases in which the Government relies on Exemption 2, it remains the Government\u2019s burden to prove the \u201csignificant risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">While our decision may appear inconsistent with one of the bare legal holdings in <em>Jordan, see </em>591 F.2d at 771, we nevertheless believe that from the facts as presented in <em>Jordan, </em>the <em>result </em>in that case would be identical under the test we announce today. It is the rationale in <em>Jordan </em>we reject insofar as it suggests that virtually all law enforcement manuals must be disclosed under FOIA.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>We turn away from the rationale of <em>Jordan </em>because it does not appear to comport with the full congressional intent underlying FOIA. The approach suggested in <em>Jordan, </em>rather than seeking to reconcile the Senate and House understandings of Exemption 2 in FOIA, chooses one report to the absolute exclusion of the other. We find this approach unacceptable in the context of this case.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\"><em>Jordan </em>goes farther than is necessary to reach its result. While it may have been possible that release of the prosecutorial documents in <em>Jordan </em>would help some individuals to evade the law, that fact is not clear from the opinion. First, even though the Government argued the point on appeal, there was no finding in the District Court or the Court of Appeals that release of the documents would risk circumvention of the law.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Second, it is not clear that release of such documents would actually risk circumvention. As Judge Leventhal pointed out in his concurrence in <em>Jordan, </em>federal prosecutors who resign to go into private practice as defense attorneys \u201ctake with them their knowledge of such guidelines [on pros-ecutorial discretion].\u201d 591 F.2d at 784.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Disclosure of the manual in <em>Jordan </em>would not help individuals evade detection by law enforcement authorities, but release of the BATF manual in the present case might. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">But even assuming that the guidelines in <em>Jordan </em>may aid some individuals in evading the law, the guidelines are not \u201cpredominantly internal.\u201d They are, as Judge Bazel-on emphasized in his concurring opinion in <em>Jordan, </em>a source of \u201csecret law,\u201d as important to the regulation of public behavior as if they had been codified. As this court stated in <em>Scott v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 264, 277 (D.C.Cir.1969),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD4L\">the standard's which guide prosecutors in the exercise of their discretion are as much a part of the law as the rules applied in court. Indeed, the impact of such standards is more decisive for many defendants than that of any other legal rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">The guidelines on prosecutorial discretion are instructions to agency personnel <em>(e.g., </em>prosecutors) on how to regulate members of the public. Knowledge of those regulations may be as significant to members of the public as is knowledge of statutory sentencing provisions. The BATF manual, on the other hand, is not concerned with regulating the behavior of the public, but consists <em>solely </em>of instructions to agency personnel. There is no attempt to modify or regulate public behavior \u2014 only to observe it for illegal activity. Accordingly, under the rule we announce today, the result in <em>Jordan </em>\u2014release of the documents on prosecutorial discretion \u2014 would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the District Court in holding that portions of the BATF manual are exempt under Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-42\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (1976).

If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-16\">In other words, failure to raise a genuine issue as to a material fact constitutes a concession that the uncontested fact is true for purposes of summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">.

Whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>language and legislative history of \u00a7 (a)(2)(C) shed light on the congressional intent underlying Exemption 2 is another matter. See section III.A, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">. As we discuss later in this opinion, it is not for the courts to determine when disclosure is in the public interest; rather, the courts are to decide what Congress intended with respect to the scope of Exemption 2. <em>See </em>note 60, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">. In 1967 Congress amended FOIA so that \u00a7\u00a7 (a)-(d) appeared in \u00a7\u00a7 (a)(l)-(a)(4), respectively. Section (e), which originally contained the exemptions, became \u00a7 (b). See Pub.L.No. 90 -23, 81 Stat. 54 (1967). Thus, although the formal designation of Exemption 2 changed, its language did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">. The Senate bill, S. 1160, was introduced on February 17, 1965. <em>See </em>111 Cong.Rec. 2780 (1965). The principal House bill, H.R. 5012, was introduced the same day. <em>See id. </em>at 2946.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">Prior to the Eighty-ninth Congress, several bills, including S. 1666, were introduced in the Senate to amend \u00a7 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-4 (1965). During the Eighty-eighth Congress, the Senate passed S. 1666, but not in time for full consideration by the House. Nonetheless, S. 1666 is useful in determining the congressional intent behind Exemption 2 since the Senate Report accompanying S. 1160, which eventually became FOIA, asserted that \u201c[t]he present bill [S. 1160] is substantially S. 1666, as passed by the Senate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">S. 1666 contained two \u201cExemption 2\u2019s.\u201d The first one, which applied only to materials to be published in the Federal Register, was identically worded to the original Exemption 2 of the discredited \u00a7 3 of the APA: materials need not be disclosed \u201cto the extent there is involved ... (2) any matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency.\u201d The second Exemption 2, which applied to agency opinions, orders, rules, and records, was identical to the current Exemption 2 as enacted in FOIA. The language of this second Exemption 2 is \u201csimilar to [the exemption] in subsection (a) [for Federal Register materials], but more tightly drawn.\u201d S.Rep.No.1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1964). The only conclusion we may fairly draw from the language in S.Rep.No.1219 and the language of Exemption 2 as it evolved to its present form is that the current Exemption 2 is more narrow than the original Exemption 2 of \u00a7 3 of the APA. How much more narrow, however, depends on the congressional intent as expressed in the reports, debates, and hearings preceding enactment of FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-17\">During the Senate hearings on S. 1666, the subcommittee members made only one comment in response to fears expressed by some witnesses that S. 1666 would impede law enforcement efforts. When Paul Dixon, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, spoke in opposition to the bill, Senator Long reassured him that: \u201cThe committee, I am sure, and the Congress, wouldn\u2019t want to do anything that would seriously hurt the law enforcement pro vision of any agency.\u201d <em>See Freedom of Information: Hearings before the Subcommittee on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number><em>Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Committee on the Judiciary on S. 1666 and S. 1663, </em>88th Cong., 1st Sess. 166 (Oct. .28-31, 1963) (statement of Paul R.

Some witnesses specifically objected to Exemption 2. For example, Edwin Raines, the Assistant General Counsel of the Department of the .Treasury stated that: \u201cThe second exemption .. . [does not go] far enough. There are many other internal agency documents which should not be released. The investigative manuals of the Secret Service and the Bureau of Narcotics, for example, contain information the release of which would only be of assistance to criminals in telling them how to plot their crimes so as best to escape detection. Surely such information should be protected.\u201d <em>Senate Hearings on S. 1160, supra </em>note 15, at 34 (statement of Edwin F.

Of course, a decision not to act on the objections to Exemption 2, especially on those raised by witnesses who opposed the entire bill, does not create an inference that the exemption would have permitted disclosure of all law enforcement manuals. The Senators may have felt that the existing language of Exemption 2 adequately dealt with the expressed fears of these witnesses. <em>Cf.

The entire exchange is reprinted here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-14\">Mr. Kass. Mr. Schlei, what is your interpretation of exemption No. 2? What information would fall under those records relating solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency? How does your agency interpret that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-21\">Mr. Schlei. Well, we\u2019re inclined to be critical of that exception because it did not seem to us actually that the personnel rules and practices of an agency, many of them, ought to be exempt. They ought to be public. How you handle various personnel problems and where somebody goes to complain if he is treated wrongly by his superior, and so on. All those things I would suppose should be public. They should be upon a bulletin board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-22\">And there are some personnel rules and practices that ought to be exempt, and I think that \u2014 let\u2019s see\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-23\">Mr. Kass. It is No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-24\">Mr. Schlei. And so that exception, it seemed to us, protected from disclosure things that did not need protection, as well as perhaps not going far enough as to some aspects of information that the Government gets about its employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-25\">Mr. Kass. Where an individual is, let\u2019s assume, fired from the agency \u2014 for cause we hope \u2014 would the facts and circumstances surrounding this discharge fall 'within the personnel practices of an agency as you read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-26\">Mr. Schlei. I should not think so, although you are talking here about records that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>related to the \u201cpractices\u201d of an agency, and conceivably a record, although it contained only a summary of some facts, say, might be related to the \u201cpractices, personnel practices,\u201d of the agency, part of a file, part of a series of documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-6\">I am just talking off the top of my head about that problem, but I would say that you could get a situation where a factual statement or document came within that exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-7\">Mr. Kass. We are all talking, as you say, off the top of our heads. We are trying to create legislative history to determine what we intend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-8\">Mr. Moss. What this was intended to cover was instances such \u00e1s the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner \u2014 a bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an FBI agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-9\">Mr. Schlei. Ah! Then the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d should be stricken. Because \u201cpersonnel\u201d I think connoted certainly to use the employee relations, employee management rules and practices of an agency. What you meant was material related solely to the internal rules and practices of any agency for the guidance of its employees \u2014 something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-10\">I do agree that there should be protection for the instructions given to FBI agents and bank examiners; people who, if they are going to operate in expectable ways, cannot do their jobs. Their instructions have to be withheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-11\">But I think that word \u201cpersonnel\u201d does not do the job well enough, Mr. Chairman. I am sure it can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-12\">Mr. Moss. We will hope to seek a way of doing the job without, exempting internal rules and practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-13\">Mr. Schlei. I suppose that could cover quite a lot of ground, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-14\">Mr. Moss. Because I am afraid that we would there open the barn door to everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-15\">Mr. Schlei. Well, it is one of those things, Mr. Chairman, that just shows how hard it is to cover the whole Government with a few words. There are a number of problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-17\">Mr. Moss. Oh, we recognize the difficulty and the complexity, but we are perfectly willing to work at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-18\">Mr. Schlei.

Would a definition of personnel rules include, in your estimation, instructions to FBI agents, or instructions to Secret Service agents, as exempt from disclosure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-23\">Mr. Mollenhoff.

I don\u2019t think that that particular area is something that we should want to get into. The only time that that should be gone into is extraordinary circumstances where a proper committee of Congress would feel there is something wrong with the way it is being handled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-26\">Mr. Kass.

The Supreme Court, however, carefully limited its approval to matters where disclosure would <em>not </em>risk circumvention of the law. <em>See </em>425 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1131-13\">.

The District Court, however, made no factual finding that release of the documents would aid individuals in circumvention of the law. <em>See Jordan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>C.A. No. 76-0276 (D.D.C. Jan. 18, 1977). Moreover, unlike in the present case, the plaintiffs disputed the Government\u2019s assertion that release of the prosecutorial guidelines would hinder law enforcement in that the guidelines did not involve law enforcement techniques and methods. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, at 6-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b1132-14\">.

There is one other case of some significance in this circuit. In <em>Allen v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>636 F.2d 1287 (D.C.Cir.1980), the court held that portions of agency documents that contained \u201cfiling and routing instructions\u201d were not exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2. <em>See id. </em>at 1289-90. Although the court noted that the narrow scope of Exemption 2, as reflected in the Senate Report, would not exempt the filing and routing instructions from disclosure, it also noted that it \u201cis even doubtful that the filing and routing instructions would be exempt under the broader reading of the exemption given in the House report,\u201d since disclosure \u201cwould not cause such \u2018circumvention of agency regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290 n.20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">. One case that apparently has caused some confusion is <em>Ginsburg, Feldman &amp; Bress v. Federal Energy Administration, </em>591 F.2d 717 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>vacated and affd by an evenly divided court, </em>591 F.2d 752 (D.C.Cir.1978) <em>(en banc). </em>In <em>Ginsburg </em>the appellant sought an agency manual containing guidelines and instructions to agency employees who audit oil refineries. The District Court had denied the manual to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-10\">Because the panel opinion was vacated (on the same day <em>Jordan </em>was issued), and the District Court decision was affirmed by an equally divided court, there is no opinion of the court. The confusion arises largely because the five judge majority in <em>Jordan </em>(which ordered release of the document) shrank to four judges in <em>Ginsburg. </em>Moreover, Judge Leventhal, who wrote a concurrence in <em>Jordan, </em>did not take part in the decision of <em>Ginsburg. </em>For whatever reason, the court felt differently about the release of the FEA auditor\u2019s manual in <em>Ginsburg </em>than it did about the United States Attorney\u2019s prosecutorial discretion guidelines in <em>Jordan. </em>We do not rely on <em>Ginsburg </em>in deciding the case before us, but we feel that the apparent inconsistency in the <em>results </em>in <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Ginsburg </em>indicates the need to resolve any doubts about the law of Exemption 2 in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-15\">Further evidence of confusion about the meaning of <em>Jordan </em>may be found in several recent unpublished District Court decisions. <em>See Zamnik v. United States Dep\u2019t of State, </em>C.A. No. 79-1072 (D.D.C.

A third- category of cases involves those circuits that have not decided whether Exemption 2 applies to documents whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law. <em>See Ma-roscia v. Levi, </em>569 F.2d 1000 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Nix v. United States, </em>572 F.2d 998, 1005 (4th Cir. 1978) (using Exemption 2 to exempt \u201cfile numbers, routing stamps, cover letters and secretary initials\u201d from disclosure since these matters \u201care ordinarily not of such genuine and significant public interest as to require FOIA disclosure\"). Significantly, neither of these circuits has interpreted \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices\u201d strictly to mean \u201cthose rules and practices that concern relations among the employees of an agency,\u201d as did this court in <em>Jordan. </em>Thus, even the Fourth and Seventh Circuits do not appear to follow <em>Jordan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">In <em>Ferri v. Bell, </em>645 F.2d 1213 (3d Cir. 1981), the court rejected the Government\u2019s argument that information regarding procurement and control of electronic surveillance services involved \u201ctrivial housekeeping matters\u201d and thus were exempt under Exemption 2. <em>Id. </em>at 23. Nonetheless, the court did not reject the applicability of Exemption 2. \u201cIt remains open to the government on remand to demonstrate by detailed affidavit that disclosure would impede the agency\u2019s law enforcement effectiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. The court, however, declined to rule definitively on the legal issue \u2014 involving the applicability of Exemption 2 where disclosure risks circumvention of the law \u2014 until after the Government \u201chas demonstrated on remand <em>how </em>its effectiveness would be threatened by disclosure in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-11\">In <em>Stokes v. Brennan, </em>476 F.2d 699 (5th Cir. 1973), the plaintiff sought disclosure of a manual entitled \u201cTraining Course for Compliance Safety and Health Officers.\u201d The District Court ordered the materials released under \u00a7 (a)(2)(C), and the appellate court affirmed that decision, largely on the basis of <em>Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>467 F.2d 787 (6th Cir. 1972), and its finding that disclosure of the manual would not help the public to evade the law. <em>Id. </em>at 701-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-12\">In a subsequent case, <em>Sladek v. Bensinger, </em>605 F.2d 899, 902 (5th Cir. 1979), the Fifth Circuit held that since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-13\">disclosure of the sections of the DEA manual [on handling confidential informants and search warrant procedures] requested by Sla-dek would not impede law enforcement efforts there is no need for us to choose between the Second Circuit\u2019s and the D.

The <em>Hawkes </em>court felt that the Senate Report was controlling since \u201cthe plain import of the (b)(2) language clearly favors the Senate\u2019s interpretation\u201d 467 F.2d at 797, and because only the Senate interpretation was before both Houses of Congress. \u201cTo adopt the statutory interpretation put forward in the House Report would be to allow a single house of the Congress to effectively alter the meaning placed on proposed legislation by the other house without altering a word of the text.

Rosen (Vaughn II), </em>523 F.2d at 1150, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-12\">there is still a legislative inclination that while the public has a right to know all the activities of an agency that bear on its intentions concerning outsiders, whether formal or informal interpretations and instructions, when purely \u201cinternal\u201d matters are involved there is a combination of diminished valid interest in the outsiders relative to the administrative burden imposed, plus a recognition that management of government needs some elbow room in developing and revising internal practices, so as to achieve efficiency, without becoming embroiled in continuous public discussion. The problem is to give effect to both of these policy goals without rendering either of them nugatory by a too broadly sweeping construction of the statutory provisions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">.

Nor is it for this court to decide which disclosures are in the public interest. Thus, to this extent we reject language in <em>Cox v.

We note that in two other exemptions, 7(C) and 6, \u201cthe court is called upon to balance the conflicting interests and values involved; in other exemptions Congress has struck the balance and the duty of the court is limited to finding whether the material is within the defined category.\u201d <em>Lesar v.

The <em>Jordan </em>opinion chose the Senate Report over the House Report in part to prevent \u201clast minute chicanery\u201d in the House from dictating the meaning of the statute. The expressed fear is that Senate intent will never become law if the House writes a conflicting report, but avoids a conference committee by passing the bill without amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Yet, in its vigorous efforts to protect the Senate, the majority in <em>Jordan </em>has gone to the opposite extreme, in a sense doing the very thing it feared might happen. Under the <em>Jordan </em>interpretation, congressional intent expressed in the House is given no weight at all. Particularly since both houses were considering bills with identical Exemption 2 provisions, and some of the House legislative history predates the Senate legislative history, we should avoid if possible the extreme approach taken in <em>Jordan. </em>Instead, we believe the proper route is to try to reconcile legislative intent expressed in the House with that in the Senate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">. <em>See </em>note 46, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b1139-14\">.

In addition it is my opinion that the dissent is largely based on certain factual inaccuracies and flawed analyses that should be pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">I. THE DISSENT PLACES UNWARRANTED RELIANCE UPON OUR EN BANC OPINION IN JORDAN V. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">The most pervasive flaw in the dissent, as I perceive it, is the excessive reliance it places on its construction of the <em>en banc </em>opinion in <em>Jordan v. United States Department of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753 (D.C.Cir.1978). This reliance largely overlooks the rationale expressed by the concurring opinions of three of the seven judges that formed the majority. The case was heard <em>en banc </em>by nine judges, but only <em>four </em>judges concurred in the opinion without some comment or reservation. Thus, there was never a majority of the court in full support of the entire rationale of <em>Jordan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">Judge Bazelon\u2019s concurrence stressed the \u201csecret law\u201d aspect of the case, 591 F.2d at 781 \u2014 2. The documentary matter at issue in <em>Jordan, </em>as Judge Bazelon noted, set forth \u201cthe settled standards which guide the United States Attorney\u2019s [prosecutorial] discretion.\u201d In his opinion this caused \u201csecret law\u201d to effect the decision. His concurring opinion would indicate that <em>Jordan </em>would not necessarily control with respect to a law enforcement manual that did not involve secret law. Judge Leventhal filed a concurring opinion, in which Judge Robinson concurred, voicing material reservations about the majority\u2019s opinion concerning Exemption 2. His opinion relied more on the absence of \u201cpredominant internality\u201d in <em>Jordan. </em>Such \u201cinternality\u201d however, is present here. Judge Robb also joined in my dissent and Judge Leventhal expressed agreement with respect to the weight given in my dissent to exemption 7 in interpreting the Act, 591 F.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">My dissent was based in part on the statement in the Senate Report that the legislative intent was to \u201cprotect[] the traditional confidential nature of <em>instructions to government personnel prosecuting violations of Jaw . . . </em>S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1965) ...\u201d 591 F.2d at 786. It was my judgment that this statement of congressional intent covered the prosecuto-rial instructions to United States Attorneys like a glove, and hence they were exempt. I recognize, however, that the Act also sought to make \u201csecret law\u201d discloseable and that the prosecutorial instructions did, to a certain extent, include some \u201csecret law\u201d \u2014 but no secret law is involved here. <em>Jordan </em>is thus distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">This court\u2019s disposition of the companion case heard <em>en banc </em>with <em>Jordan </em>also indicates the limited effect which can be given to the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jordan. </em>The case was entitled <em>Ginsburg, Feldman &amp; Bress v. Federal Energy Administration, </em>591 F.2d 717 (opinion vacated and reheard <em>en banc, </em>district court affirmed by equally divided court, four to four) 591 F.2d 752 (D.C.Cir.1978). <em>Ginsburg </em>involved a law enforcement manual, which set forth law enforcement matter consisting essentially of <em>internal </em>auditing instructions for investigators examining the large oil companies to determine if they were complying with government price regulations. Billions of dollars were involved. The instructions did not constitute secret law but knowledge of the instructions could assist those violating the law to evade detection. Judge Leventhal was recused in <em>Ginsburg, </em>but his concurring opinion in <em>Jordan </em>indicates quite clearly that had he participated he would have voted to hold that the law enforcement manual involved in <em>Ginsburg </em>was exempt from disclosure. The critical sentence in his concurring opinion in <em>Jordan </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-13\">\u201cAnd when what is involved are <em>internal </em>instructions to such officials as bank ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>aminers and <em>investigators, </em>and revelation would permit circumvention of law and regulations by the regulated and there is no substantial valid external interest, there is the essential quality of predominant internality<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contemplated by Exemption 2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Leventhal, J., concurring, 591 F.2d at 783 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">Judge Leventhal\u2019s vote would have provided the fifth vote necessary to affirm the holding of the panel opinion that law enforcement manuals were exempt. The opinion in <em>Ginsburg </em>is thus entitled to substantial consideration. This does not mean that I am contending it constitutes controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Of course, the precedential value of a panel opinion under ordinary circumstances is practically nil when the case is placed <em>en banc, </em>but when the votes of the judges in <em>Ginsburg </em>are coupled with the views expressed by the concurring and dissenting judges in <em>Jordan, </em>it is clear that decisive votes in <em>Jordan </em>really turned on the <em>secret law </em>and <em>predominant internality </em>aspects of the facts in that case. Such votes also indicate that a <em>majority </em>of all the judges in <em>Jordan </em>would exempt a law enforcement manual, such as we have here, where secret law is not involved and where revelation of its contents would permit individuals who were the subjects of investigatory surveillance to evade detection of their criminal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">Thus, even though the dissent here is not willing to recognize the extent to which secret law and predominant internality provided the controlling votes in <em>Jordan, </em>the votes of the concurring judges in <em>Jordan </em>and those who voted to affirm <em>Ginsburg, </em>and those who compose the majority here, do distinguish the prosecutorial instructions in <em>Jordan </em>from the Surveillance Training Manual in this case on factual grounds that are clearly distinguishable. <em>Jordan </em>is thus limited to cases involving secret law and predominant internality where the disclosure would not endanger law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">II. THE HOUSE AND SENATE REPORTS ON THE 1966 AMENDMENTS TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT WERE NOT CONTRADICTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">Exemption 2 of the Freedom of Information Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-12\">(b) This section [The FOIA Act] does not apply to matters that are \u2014 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-13\">(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayp-dedup-0\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (1970), 81 Stat. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">The dissent takes the rigid position that the Committee Reports in the House and Senate are contradictory with respect to the intent expressed in Exemption 2. Dissent at 1093, 1096-1106. In my opinion they are not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-15\">The Senate Committee Report stated: Exemption No. 2 relates only to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. <em>Examples </em>of these may be rules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akb-dedup-2\">S.Rep.No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (October 4, 1965) (emphasis added). This sparse statement giving only four \u201cexamples\u201d of \u201crules\u201d was all the direct comment in the Senate Report on that exemption. The subsequent House Report on the Senate bill (which was the same as the House Bill), and which was filed during the next session of the 89th Congress, was more detailed as to the intent of Exemption 2. It explained that Exemption 2 was also intended to cover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-16\">2. Matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency: Operating rules, guidelines, and <em>manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners </em>would be exempt from disclosure, but this exemption would <em>not </em>cover all \u2018matters of internal management\u2019 such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>H.R.Rep.No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (May 9, 1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1966, p. 2427 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">The dissent and some others contend that Exemption 2 is to be construed as though it read: \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and <em>internal personnel </em>practices of an agency. . . . \u201d Such construction, however, would construe the exemption to say essentially the same thing twice as there may be little or no difference between an agency\u2019s \u201crules\u201d and \u201cpractices.\u201d In my opinion, a sounder interpretation would be to read the exemption as extending \u201cinternal,\u201d but not \u201cpersonnel,\u201d to modify \u201cpractices.\u201d Then \u201cinternal personnel rules\u201d would refer to the agency\u2019s relations with its employees as an employer, as described in the Senate Report, and the <em>\u201c[internal] </em>practices of an agency\u201d would encompass the matters described in the House Committee Report which limited the \u201cpractices\u201d that were not exempted. This would also conform to the intent expressed by Congressman Moss, the principal author of the Freedom of Information Act, when he presided as Chairman on the opening day of the House Committee hearings in 1965:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8b-dedup-0\">Mr. Moss. What this [Exemption 2] was intended to cover was instances such as the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner \u2014 a bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an F.B.I. agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">591 F.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">However, the dissent and some judges and commentators perceive what they consider to be a contradiction between the intent expressed in the Senate and House Committee Reports. In my judgment there is no contradiction expressed or intended. The Senate Committee Report merely gave several \u201c[ejxamples\u201d of the \u201crules\u201d it intended to exempt and the House Committee report gave several examples of the \u201c[internal] practices of agenc[ies]\u201d that it intended to be exempt. There is nothing in the Senate Report indicating an intent to limit the exempt rules and practices to the few stated \u201cexamples.\u201d In fact characterizing them as \u201cexamples\u201d indicates that the examples given are not the exclusive exempt matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">To construe the act as not providing for the exemption from disclosure of \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d would also do violence to the intent of the <em>Senate </em>Committee expressed in \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) to <em>completely exclude </em>\u201claw enforcement matters\u201d from inspection. What the dissent and many others forget, or never realize, is that the Senate <em>and the House </em>were in agreement on this phase of the bill that has been recognized as the \u201claw enforcement exemption.\u201d See discussion, <em>infra. </em>This exemption was accomplished by amending the bill to provide that only <em>\u201cadministrative </em>staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\u201d (emphasis added) should be available for public inspection and copying. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">In enacting this statute, <em>both </em>houses of Congress stated in their Reports that they distinguish between manuals relating to (1) \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d and manuals relating to (2) <em>\u201cadministrative </em>matters,\u201d and <em>indicated that they did not intend to require disclosure of the former.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">The Senate Committee Report on this section of the bill repeats the statutory language that only <em>\u201cadministrative </em>staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\u201d (emphasis added) are to be made available, and explains that its reference to <em>\u201cadministrative\u201d </em>was intended specifically to <em>exclude </em>\u201claw enforcement matters\u201d from any disclosure requirement, i.e.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">The limitation of the staff manuals and instructions affecting the public which must be made available to the public to those which pertain to . <em>administrative </em>matters <em>rather than to law enforcement matters </em>protects the <em>traditional confidential nature of instructions to Government personnel prosecuting violations of law in court, </em>while permitting a public examination of the basis for administrative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">S.Rep.No.713, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 7 (1965) (emphasis added). If we are to rely exclusively on the Senate Report, as the dissent suggests, this comment is determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>native and excludes \u201cconfidential\u201d law enforcement matter from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">The House Committee Report <em>on this portion of the bill, </em>moreover, reflects the same intent as the Senate Report, but expresses its intent in greater detail. The House Report specifically states that the legislative intent was to require disclosure of <em>secret law, </em>and <em>not </em>Agency \u201cguidelines for . . . auditing or inspection,\u201d i.e. law enforcement matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-5\">In addition to the orders and opinions required to be made public by the present law, subsection (b) of S. 1160 would require agencies to make available statements of policy, interpretations, staff manuals, and instructions that affect any member of the public. This material is the end product of Federal administration. It has the force and' effect of law in most cases, yet under the present statute these Federal agency decisions have been kept secret from the members of the public affected by the decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-6\">As the Federal Government has extended its activities to solve the Nation\u2019s expanding problems \u2014 and particularly in the 20 years since the Administrative Procedure Act was established \u2014 the bureaucracy has developed its own form of case law. This law is embodied in thousands of orders, opinions, statements, and instructions issued by hundreds of agencies. This is the material which would be made available under subsection (b) of S. 1160. However, under S. 1160 an agency may <em>not </em>be required to make available for public inspection and copying any advisory interpretation on a specific set of facts which is requested by and addressed to a particular person, provided that such interpretation is not cited or relied upon by any officer or employee of the agency as a precedent in the disposition of other cases. <em>Furthermore, an agency may not be required to make available those portions of its staff manuals and instructions which set forth criteria or guidelines for the staff in auditing or inspection procedures, or in the selection or handling of cases, such as operational tactics, allowable tolerances, or criteria for defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aby-dedup-0\">H.R.Rep.No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-8 (1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, pp. 2424-2425 (emphasis added). The italicized comment tracks the Senate Report in reflecting an intent to exempt law enforcement matter when the disclosure would enable law violators to escape detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">The Senate Report thus clearly indicates that \u201cstaff manuals .. . which pertain to law enforcement matters\u201d need not be \u201cmade available to the public\u201d and the House expresses a similar general intent to the extent that the matter constitutes <em>internal </em>practices not directly affecting the public and is not <em>secret </em>law. It would be difficult to find a more precise basis for exempting staff manuals relating to law enforcement matters than the congressional intent expressed by the statements in both the Senate and House Committee reports set forth above. Therefore, it must be concluded, when both reports are read in their entirety, that there is no contradiction between the two houses that \u201cstaff manuals . . . which pertain to law enforcement matters . . . [need not be] made available to the public.\u201d If we are to rely <em>only </em>on the Senate Report, as some suggest, such construction could not be plainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">The <em>specific </em>agreement of the House and Senate Committee Reports to exclude from disclosure \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d and \u201cstaff manuals and instructions which set forth criteria or guidelines for the staff in auditing and inspection procedures\u201d forecloses appellant\u2019s claim for disclosure regardless of ambiguities alleged to exist in some of the more <em>general </em>portions of the statute and the Committee Reports,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>cific statements of legislative intent usually prevail over more general provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This forecloses an interpretation of the Act that would exclude law enforcement matter from disclosure under (a)(2)(C) and then turn about and require disclosure by \u00a7 552(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">It is thus foolhardy to look to the Senate Committee Report on Exemption 2 and conclude that a staff manual on a, \u201claw enforcement matter\u201d that would endanger law enforcement is not exempt because the portion of the Senate Report that gave some <em>examples </em>of matter covered by Exemption 2 did not <em>repeat </em>its <em>prior </em>exclusion of \u201claw enforcement matter.\u201d The Senate Report on Exemption 2 did not need to state that staff manuals on \u201claw enforcement matters\u201d were excluded by Exemption 2 because <em>the Senate report had already specifically excluded them from all \u201cinspection \u201d </em>and stated that they were not required to be \u201cmade available to the public.\u201d See S.Rep.No.713, p. 6, <em>supra. </em>Since <em>law enforcement matters </em>were <em>never included </em>in material that could be inspected there was no necessity for excluding them by Exemption 2, or by any other provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">Having said this, it must be recognized that both committee reports treated law enforcement matter the same in (a)(2)(C), <em>but </em>the House Report also was specific in indicating that such matter was excluded by Exemption 2. Actually there was no necessity for Exemption 2 excluding \u201claw enforcement matter.\u201d The net result, however, was the same, albeit the exemption was accomplished by two comments in the House Committee Report and one in the Senate Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">A comparison of the House Report on Exemption 2 in the Freedom of Information Act and the Sunshine Act does not reflect, as the dissent indicates, that the House repudiated its 1966 report. The two reports provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">FOIA Act 1966 House Report</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">2. Matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency: Operating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure, but this exemption would not cover all \u201cmatters of internal management\u201d such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">(H.R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10(1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">Sunshine Act House Report</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\">(2) This exemption includes meetings relating solely to an agency\u2019s internal personnel rules and practices. It is intended to protect the <em>privacy of staff memlxirs </em>and to cover the handling of <em>strictly internal matters. It does not include discussions or information dealing with agency policies governing employees' dealings with the public, such as manuals or directives setting forth job functions or procedures. </em>As is the case with all of the exemptions, a closing or withholding permitted by this paragraph should not be made If the public interest requires otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-16\">H.R. Rep. No. 94-880, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess., 9 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>What appears most outstanding about the House Report on the Sunshine Bill is that it recognized and defines two categories of matters. First, \u201cstrictly internal matters\u201d and, second, directions setting forth job functions or procedures. Confidential instructions to investigators and examiners addressed to them in their law enforcement function, the disclosure of which would allow circumvention of law, are clearly internal matters. While directions setting forth general job functions and procedures for employees dealing directly with the public are in the second category. The Sunshine Bill Report, dated 1976, reflects the same point as Judge Leventhal\u2019s 1978 interpretation of \u201cpredominant internality\u201d by stating its intent \u201cto cover the handling of <em>strictly internal matters.\" </em>That was not as explicit in the 1966 Report. Thus, if anything, the Committee Report on the Sunshine Act instead of repudiating the 1966 House Report indicates the same interpretation as that later placed on the FOIA by Judge Leven-thal, and the same result was reached with respect to the law enforcement matter in the contemporaneous panel opinion in <em>Ginsburg, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">The resulting situation explained above also explains why, as the dissent admits, <em>no federal court </em>has ever required the disclosure of a law enforcement manual, such as we have here, where the court found that disclosure would enable violators to escape detection. Dissent at 1112. <em>Hardy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>631 F.2d 653, 656-57 (9th Cir. 1980) (\u201cMaterials that solely concern law enforcement are exempt under Exemption 2 if disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d) We reached the same result in <em>Cox v. United States Department of Justice, </em>601 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1979) (withholding disclosure of United States marshal\u2019s manual under Exemption 2); as did the Second Circuit in <em>Caplan v. BATF, </em>587 F.2d 544 (2d Cir. 1978) (BATF Manual describing techniques for apprehending law violators, equipment used in making raids, methods of gaining entry to buildings used by law violators and methods used by law violators to conceal contraband was exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2). The same result is reached in the Eighth, Fifth and Sixth Circuits by applying the \u201claw enforcement exception\u201d implicit in \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C). <em>Cox v. Levi, </em>592 F.2d 460, 463 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>Cox v. United States Dept. of Justice, </em>576 F.2d 1302, 1307-09 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>Sladek v. Bensinger, </em>605 F.2d 899 (5th Cir. 1979) (recognized the \u201claw enforcement exception\u201d under (a)(2)(C) but held the contested material in the DEA Manual dealing with informants and search warrants would not obstruct its law enforcement efforts); <em>Stokes v. Brennan, </em>476 F.2d 699, 701-02 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>467 F.2d 787, 794-95 (6th Cir. 1972). See 1 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 5.4 (2d ed. Supp.1980). 631 F.2d at 656-7. Courts can use the (a)(2)(C) provision or Exemption 2 and conform to the intent expressed by both the Senate and House Reports. Such application of the statute also would not be contrary to <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 369, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1603, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) which based its decision to not apply Exemption 2 on the ground that the requested disclosure would \u201cnot risk circumvention of agency regulations\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that there was a \u201cgenuine and significant public interest\u201d in the matter, i.e., not \u201cpredominately internal\u201d as Judge Leventhal later phrased it. The results in the above cited decisions support the conclusion that the Reports of the two houses are <em>not </em>contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">III. THE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY BY THE DISSENT IS ALSO FLAWED WITH RESPECT TO THE REASON SLATED FOR PREFERRING THE SENATE REPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\"><em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>523 F.2d 1136, 1142 (D.C.Cir.1975) favored \u201creliance upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Senate Report . . . [because] <em>it was the only-report that was before both houses of Congress.\" </em>The Supreme Court thereafter in <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 366-67, 96 S.Ct. at 1601-02 (1976) also stated that such fact was one of the reasons why it relied on the Senate Report but added that it \u201cneed not consider in [Rose]\u201d the applicability of Exemption 2 in circumstances where such exemption from disclosure might be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUF\">necessary to prevent the circumvention of agency regulations that might result from disclosure to the subjects of regulation of the procedural manuals and guidelines used by the agency in discharging its regulatory function. See, <em>e.g., Tietze v. Richardson, </em>342 F.Supp. 610 (S.D.Tex.1972), <em>Cuneo </em>v. <em>Laird, </em>338 F.Supp. 504 (D.C.1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds <em>sub nom. Cuneo v. Schlesinger, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 484 F.2d 1086 (1973); <em>City of Concord </em>v. <em>Ambrose, </em>333 F.Supp. 958 (N.D.Cal.1971) (dictum). Moreover, the legislative history indicates that this was the primary concern of the committee drafting the House Report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">425 U.S. at 364, 96 S.Ct. at 1600. The Supreme Court in <em>Rose </em>thus did not rule out the House Committee Report because it was not before both houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Jordan </em>also points out that the remark quoted from Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion does not support an interpretation that the House Report is to be disregarded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-6\">The Supreme Court was hospitable to the House Report insofar as it provided an \u201cexemption of disclosures that might enable the regulated to circumvent agency regulation.\u201d That feature may not be determinative but it is material. And when what is involved are internal instructions to such officials as bank examiners and investigators, and revelation would permit circumvention of law and regulations by the regulated and there is no substantial valid external interest, there is the essential quality of predominant internality contemplated by Exemption 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">591 F.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\"><em>Jordan </em>admits that the Supreme \u201cCourt cautiously left open the question of what to do about any exemption where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d 591 F.2d at 771. That caution was well advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">The argument that the Senate Report was the only report before two houses possesses a surface plausibility to those unfamiliar with the practical workings of Congress. To others it is unknowledgeable, but because of the ascendancy it has obtained in some of these Exemption 2 cases it should be analyzed. As my colleague Judge Mikva remarked at oral argument in this case: \u201cA Senate report in the House is <em>functus offi-cio.\" </em>Each House legislates on its own committee report. <em>Neither </em>report can be denied. If they are in irreconcilable conflict, then to the extent of the conflict neither report can be given any effect except as support may come from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-11\">The situation with respect to the two committee reports in this case is fully discussed in my opinion in <em>Ginsburg, Feldman &amp; Bress v. FERC, </em>591 F.2d at 727, in which the district court was subsequently affirmed by an equally divided <em>en banc </em>court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-12\">It is foreign to the normal practices and customs of either House to legislate on the basis of a printed report of the other House when it has a printed report of its own, and there is no indication in the legislative record of this bill that reference was made in the House proceedings to the Senate Report or that the letter was actually \u201cbefore both houses. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1146-13\">591 F.2d 727. The contention that the Senate Report must prevail because it was \u201cbefore both Houses,\u201d and the House Report was presumably only before the House, is at war with the actual workings of Congress. Thus, to the extent that the dissent relies upon <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Vaughn </em>it is flawed insofar as it claims that only the Senate Report reflects the true congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>IV. THE DISSENT MISCONSTRUES THE SENATE REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE RESTRICTIVE EFFECT OF THE WORD \u201cONLY\u201d IN EXEMPTION 2</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">The dissent at page 1097 asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-5\">The Senate Report states that Exemption 2 relates <em>only </em>to \u201crules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">However, the Senate Report that. is referred to does <em>not </em>support such a restrictive construction. The Senate Report actually states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-7\">Exemption No. 2 relates <em>only </em>to the internal' personnel rules and practices of an agency. <em>Examples </em>of these may be rules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965) (emphasis added). Merely by comparing the dissent\u2019s statement with the actual language of the Committee Report it is plain that the dissent misstates and overstates the effect of the limiting word \u201conly\u201d so as to give the impression that the Senate Report supported a more restrictive construction to Exemption 2 than it actually expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">In this manner the dissent would read out of the Senate Report .the statement that \u201cpersonnel\u2019s use of parking facilities [and] regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like\u201d were merely <em>\u201cexamples\u201d </em>of exemptions and replace it with the incorrect statement that the Senate Report had stated that they were the <em>\u201conly\u201d </em>matters exempted from disclosure by Exemption 2. This misstatement of legislative intent is vital and material and is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-11\">V. THE DISSENT IMPROPERLY CHARGES THE HOUSE COMMITTEE WITH \u201cCHICANERY\u201d IN DRAFTING ITS COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXEMPTION 2. (DISSENT 1098-1099)</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">Duplicate bills to amend the Freedom of Information Act were introduced during the 89th Congress, 1st Session in both houses on the same date. Their principal author was Representative Moss who is known in Congress and nationwide as the author of the Freedom of Information Act. The House hearings were held <em>first, </em>beginning on March 30, 1965 \u2014 six weeks before the Senate hearings. Congressman Moss presided as Chairman. Early during the first day of the House Sub-Committee hearings Representative Moss stated, as above set forth, that the intent of Exemption 2, <em>inter alia, </em>was to exempt \u201cmanuals of procedure [for] . . . examiner[s], or the guidelines given to an FBI agent,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>law enforcement manuals. <em>House Hearings on H.R. 5012, </em>89th Cong. 1st Sess. at 29. As the principal author of the law this statement is definitive. In contrast, contrary testimony adduced from a witness admittedly \u201ctalking off the top of my head\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Schlei, Kass) is no indication of congressional intent. The Senate hearings on the companion bill did not begin until some six weeks later on May 14th, and the Senate Committee Report, which is so much relied upon by the dissent, was not filed until October 4, 1965. This was over six months after the House hearings began before Congressman Moss in which he made his statement quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">If there were anything to the argument that the separate Houses of Congress legislated upon expressions of legislative intent in the other House, then the House hearings which preceded the Senate Report by seven months would be entitled to as much, or more credence than the Senate Report. However, as explained above, in the <em>en banc </em>opinion here and in my opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number><em>Ginsburg, </em>when the two reports are closely analyzed they are <em>not </em>inconsistent, 591 F.2d 723-725. And there was no \u201cchicanery\u201d since the House Report, which issued <em>after </em>the Senate had passed the bill, indicated the <em>same intent </em>with respect to Exemption 2 as Congressman Moss had stated publicly at the very first hearing which antedated the Senate hearings and the Senate Report. This matter is discussed in full detail in my opinion in <em>Ginsburg, </em>591 F.2d 723-725, which upheld the district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">Therefore, in general, law enforcement manuals, for reasons set forth above, are exempted from disclosure by (b)(2) as well as by (a)(2)(C). Some documents having some relationship to law enforcement, but with special peculiarities such as in <em>Jordan, </em>may be treated differently, but this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">VI. THE SUBSEQUENT ENACTMENT OF THE SUNSHINE ACT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE DISSENT\u2019S CONSTRUCTION OF EXEMPTION 2 OF FOIA</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">In its far fetched search for support for its position the dissent asserts that its construction of Exemption 2 is supported by the subsequent inclusion in the Government in the Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act) P.L. 94-409, Act of September 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 1241 <em>et seq., </em>of a provision similar to Exemption 2 in the Freedom of Information Act. Specifically the dissent asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-7\">[I]t is highly significant that the Government in the Sunshine Act, enacted in 1976, carries over verbatim most of the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act, including the specific language of Exemption 2. Thus, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(2) exempts from the Act\u2019s open meeting requirement portions of meetings likely to \u201crelate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d <em>The House Report to the Sunshine Act gives the same narrow interpretation to this exemption as the Senate did in 1965:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-8\">(2) This exemption includes meetings relating solely to an agency\u2019s internal personnel rules and practices. It is intended to protect the privacy of staff members and to cover the handling of strictly internal matters. <em>It does not include discussions or information dealing with the public, such as manuals or directives setting forth job functions or procedures. </em>As is the case with all of the exemptions, a closing or withholding permitted by this paragraph should not be made if the public interest requires otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-10\">It thus appears that by 1976 the House of Representatives had repudiated the sweeping language concerning Exemption 2 contained in its 1966 report on the Freedom of Information Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">Dissent at 1107 (Emphasis in original). Such construction is' not supported by the Act \u2014 the Sunshine Act. The operative provisions of Exemption 2 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-12\">(b) Members shall not jointly conduct or dispose of agency business other than in accordance with this section. Except as provided in subsection (c), every portion of every meeting of an agency shall be open to public observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-13\">(c) Except in a case where the agency finds that the public interest requires otherwise, the second sentence of subsection (b) shall not apply to any portion of an agency meeting . . . where the agency properly determines that such portion or portions of its meeting or the disclosure of such information is likely to \u2014 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-14\">(2) relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-15\">We have already seen above that Exemption 2 of the FOIA extends to law enforcement manuals. As Judge Leventhal succinctly noted in <em>Jordan, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-16\"><em>. . . </em>Exemption 2 is applicable where the document consists of internal instructions to such government officials as investigators and bank examiners. In such a case disclosure would permit circumvention of the law, and there is no substantial, valid external interest of the community at large in revelation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>591 F.2d at 783. This interpretation is. supported by <em>Hardy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, supra, Cox v. United States Department of Justice, </em>601 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>Caplan v. BATF, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">Such an analysis of Exemption 2 of the FOIA readily applies to Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act as well. Where, as in the instant case, a law enforcement manual is involved, we are, as in the Leventhal quotation, dealing with \u201cinternal instruction to such government officers as investigators . . .\u201cdisclosure,\u201d that \u201cwould permit circumvention of the law.\u201d As such, it must not by the term of Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act, be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">It is also clear from the face of the Act itself that in addition to Exemption 2, additional exceptions to the general rule of open meetings have been made in Exemption 7 of the Act that would apply to law enforcement matter. The dissent\u2019s failure to read these two exemptions <em>in pari materia </em>undercuts its argument from the start.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">Under Exemption 7 (\u00a7 552b(c)(7)), the disclosure requirements of the Act do not require meetings to be open that would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7y\">(7) disclose <em>investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, </em>or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records <em>or </em>information would (A) <em>interfere with enforcement proceedings, </em>(B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the court of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (E) <em>disclose investigative techniques and procedures, </em>or (F) <em>endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement </em>personnel;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aha\">According to the dissent, were the contested contents of the BATF manual to be read or discussed at a meeting covered by the Sunshine Act, such information would not qualify for Exemption 2 protection and would be required to be disclosed in full to the public. Whether such construction is correct or not, it ignores the plain language of Exemption 7, which provides in definite terms that an agency need .not disclose any information that would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings; (E) disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or (F) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel. Since the BATF manual covers agent \u201csurveillance of premises, vehicles, and persons,\u201d it thus contains matter coming within the purview of <em>all </em>of the aforementioned subsections. Consequently, if the BATF Manual were the subject of a meeting covered by the Sunshine Act, by the terms of the above quoted clauses of subsection 7, the meeting would be exempt from disclosure. Thus, the Sunshine Act like the Freedom of Information Act does not rely exclusively on Exemption 2 to exempt law enforcement matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">A specific example is indicated by considering the application to a concrete case of subsection (F) which provides that any meeting need not be open if it would \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\u201d Such exemption would protect a meeting from being open to the \u201cSunshine\u201d if it was likely to disclose matter in a United States</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APYb\">marshals\u2019 manual which dealt with the caliber of weapons and length of barrels on weapons used by marshals, the type of ammunition used and the number of rounds issued, the type of handcuffs used by marshals, the place where handcuff keys are secured, the radio transmission and receiving frequencies of operational units or with arrangements for prisoners during transportation such as procedures for inspecting prisoners during transport for objects to break open handcuffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">In <em>Cox v. United States Department of Justice, </em>601 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1979) we upheld the exemption of such printed matter from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The dissent criticizes such decision, Dissent, 1110, but such matter is ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>actly the type of information that, if it were to become public, would \u201cendanger the life [and] physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\u201d In this respect the Sunshine Act like the Freedom of Information Act is <em>specifically </em>protective of law enforcement matters. The dissent\u2019s reliance on the Sunshine Act is accordingly groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the dissent\u2019s assertion that the Sunshine Act and its Exemption 2 supports disclosure of the BATF manual is without foundation. Indeed, those provisions of the Sunshine Act that provide for the exemption of information from disclosure that is integrally related to law enforcement matters mandate precisely the opposite result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">. I would also rule that the effect of the recognized \u201claw enforcement exception\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(C) would exclude the law enforcement matter here involved from disclosure.

United States Department of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753 (D.C.Cir.1978) (en banc). Dissent at 1093, 1118. The composition of this court is different, but so is the nature of the materials whose release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is at issue here. <em>Jordan </em>concerned \u201cmanuals, rules, and guidelines used by a United States Attorney to guide his staff in deciding questions of prosecutorial discretion . . . . \u201d K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 5.4, at 18 (2d ed. 1980 Supp.).

Michael Crooker, the litigant, is a federal prisoner. He has not disputed that release of the BATF manual will help individuals evade the law. There is a vast difference between the secret substantive and procedural law involved in <em>Jordan </em>and \u201cinformation that would impede law enforcement efforts\u201d such as the BATF material at issue here. <em>See Cox v. Department of Justice, </em>576 F.2d 1302, 1309 (8th Cir. 1978). It may not always be a simple matter to analyze particular materials at the margin, of course, but the general distinction is sound. \u201cLines are not the worse for being narrow if they are drawn on rational considerations.\u201d <em>10 E. 40th St. Building, Inc. v. Callus, </em>325 U.S. 578, 584, 65 S.Ct. 1227, 1230, 89 L.Ed. 1806 (1945) (Frankfurter, J.). The release of material in <em>Jordan </em>served fundamental public interests and helped police those who police others. Disclosure of the BATF manual would not serve the same interest, and would unquestionably promote \u201ccircumvention of agency regulation.\u201d <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 369, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1603, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). As the majority opinion emphasizes, nothing in this decision undercuts the result reached in <em>Jordan. </em>It is pejorative to suggest that the court \u201cis playing a legislative game\u201d and engaging in \u201cimproper\u201d conduct, dissent at 1093, when the composition of the case is so strikingly different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">It may fairly be asked, of course, whether the factual distinctions between <em>Jordan </em>and this case also justify different dispositions under the law. The portions of Judge Wil-key\u2019s dissent that probe the legislative his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>tory and subsequent commentators are praiseworthy. His careful analysis makes some solid arguments, and the fact that a majority of the court disagrees with his conclusion does not diminish their force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, disputes oyer what is relevant evidence of congressional intent are to be expected when the words of the statute are ambiguous and the legislative history is contradictory. In the end, I concur because I agree with Judge Wilkey\u2019s statement for the court in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>523 F.2d 1136, 1142 (D.C.Cir.1975), that even the Senate Report \u201cindicates that the line sought to be drawn is one between minor or trivial matters and those more substantial matters which might be the subject of legitimate public interest.\u201d If Judge Wilkey simply disagreed as to which side of this line the BATF manual falls, there would be no need for this concurrence. There is another side to his dissent, however, that invites challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">I find implicit in the dissent a lamentable tendency to scorn the legislative process, an indictment that Judge Wilkey has himself leveled at the majority. He emphasizes \u201cthe contradictory Senate and House interpretations of Exemption 2,\u201d and contends that they cannot be reconciled. Dissent at 1093. He relies on several commentators who have charged that the House Report was an \u201cabuse of legislative history,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1099-1100; he calls it \u201cthe product of last minute chicanery,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1099. Most importantly, he seems to attribute to Congress an obstinate irrationality. Although it \u25a0 is patent that \u201ca reasonable Congress could not have intended to require disclosure of information that would impair law enforcement,\u201d K. Davis, <em>supra </em>at 21, Judge Wilkey concludes that the swarms of witnesses who warned of this effect seemingly to no avail shows that Congress intended exactly the opposite. Dissent at 1100-1104. Hurling judicial invective at legislators and their product hardly squares with respect for the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">Admittedly, as Judge Leventhal observed in his concurring opinion in <em>Vaughn, </em>the legislative history of Exemption 2 is both \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cobscure.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 523 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>1147. This provides no excuse for picking with condescension at bits and pieces of the legislative history, however. For example, nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s offhand statements in <em>Rose </em>forecloses doubt as to whether the Senate Report or the House Report is more reliable. Judge Leventhal, whose expertise on issues of legislative history was second to none, thoroughly demonstrated the error in the argument Judge Wilkey tries to make from their chronology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"as8-dedup-0\">The argument that the Senate Report was \u201cavailable\u201d to the House members is theoretical: The members of the House <em>committee </em>did have the Senate Report, but they departed from it... . As to the mass of members of the House, the realities of the legislative process advise that what they had furnished to them for floor consideration is the bill (here there' were no differences from the Senate bill) and the House Report. They could theoretically send for the Senate Report, but what occasion would there be for such a rare step . . . ? Again as a matter of the legislative reality of the legislative process, each House regards its own position as distinctive, and its members rarely if ever refer to reports of the other chamber.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">523 F.2d at 1148 (emphasis added). I suspect that entirely too much has been made of the apparent conflict between the House and Senate Reports both by courts and scholarly commentators, certainly more than any reasonable perspective on the legislative process can support. May not judicial notice be taken of the fact that committee reports are often authored entirely by staff members, and that in the rush and flurry of events active congressmen may never have an opportunity to read these reports at all? As Justice White observed in <em>Cass v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 72, 83, 94 S.Ct. 2167, 2173, 40 L.Ed.2d 668 (1974), \u201cIn resolving ambiguity, we must allow ourselves some recognition of the existence of sheer inadvertence in the legislative process\u201d (quoting <em>Schmid v. United States, </em>436 F.2d 987, 992 (Ct.Cl.1971)). <em>Cf. Perry v. Commerce Loan Co., </em>383 U.S. 392, 401, 86 S.Ct. 852, 857, 15 L.Ed.2d 827 (1966) (inclusion of section in statute found to have been \u201ca legislative oversight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">Congress is composed of two bodies and 535 individuals; it is too much to expect that it will always speak with flawless consistency and clarity. When it does not, however, the task of courts is to reconcile ambiguous words with congressional policies in order to find a result consonant with what Congress intended to do.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThere is no invariable rule for the discovery of that intention. To take a few words from their context and with them thus isolated to attempt to determine their meaning, certainly would not contribute greatly to the discovery of the purpose of the draftsmen of a statute . . . . \u201d <em>United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns., </em>310 U.S. 534, 542, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940). If there is a general precept, however, it is that courts must strain to interpret the results of the legislative process as reasonable and not ridiculous. \u201cAll laws should receive a sensible construction. General terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence. It will always, therefore, be presumed that the legislature intended exceptions to its language, which would avoid results of this character.\u201d <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 482, 486-87, 19 L.Ed. 278 (1868); see <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts, </em>197 U.S. 11, 39, 25 S.Ct. 358, 366, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-9\">The canon in favor of strict construction is not an inexorable command to override common sense and evident statutory purpose. ... No rule of construction necessitates our acceptance of an interpretation resulting in patently absurd consequences. And the absence of any signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>cant legislative history, other than has been related, may be indicative that Congress considered that there was no such problem as is now sought to be injected in the statutory wording ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><em>United States v. Brown, </em>333 U.S. 18, 25-27, 68 S.Ct. 376, 379-380, 92 L.Ed. 442 (1948). In the instant ease, it is irrefutable that Congress did not intend the Freedom of Information Act to provide criminals with the means to evade detection and arrest. \u201cGranted that the present problem could have been obviated by even more astute draftsmanship,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 25, 68 S.Ct. at 379, there is no excuse for a court to strain to reach such an absurd and unreasonable result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I agree with Judge Wilkey that it is not for us to correct errors of Congress, dissent at 1119, but neither may we ascribe to Congress errors that it clearly did not intend. Judge Wilkey urges a result that makes seofflaws of the Congress, or at least some of its members, and such contumely is unnecessary, unwise, and injudicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">My second difficulty with Judge Wilkey\u2019s dissent grows out of the first. He tells us that \u201c[t]he test of a judge who has taken an oath to uphold the law is the objectivity with which he interprets and enforces laws of which he thoroughly disapproves.\u201d Dissent at 1121. Where the meaning of legislation is plain, \u201cit must be obeyed.\u201d <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805) (Marshall, C.J.). It is an equally venerable principle, however, that courts have the duty discussed above to reject constructions that are \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cto expound [the words of a statute] so as to give some effect to the legislative will. Some latitude of construction, then, must be used.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Mason, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 45, 102, 2 L.Ed. 29 (1801) (Marshall, C. J.). See <em>Huidekoper v. Douglass, </em>7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 1, 66, 2 L.Ed. 347 (1805). \u201cThe interpretation of the meaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable controversies, is exclusively a judicial function.\u201d <em>United States v. American Trucking Ass'ns., supra, </em>310 U.S. at 544, 60 S.Ct. at 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">If statutory interpretation were the simple, even mechanical task that Judge Wil-key implies, there might be a stronger basis for his dissent. There also would be a need for fewer judges, and appeals, and opinions. Unfortunately, our work is not that simple, and his statement that the majority is \u201cplaying ... a legislative game,\u201d dissent at 1093, may come across as a denunciation of far more distinguished judges than we. As Justice Frankfurter explained in <em>Carpenters\u2019 Union v. NLRB, </em>357 U.S. 93, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-11\">The problem raised by these cases affords a striking illustration of the importance of the truism that it is the business of Congress to declare policy and not this Court\u2019s. The judicial function is confined to applying what Congress has enacted after ascertaining what it is that Congress has enacted. But such ascertainment, that is, construing legislation, is nothing like a mechanical endeavor. It could not be accomplished by the subtlest of modern \u201cbrain\u201d machines. Because of the infirmities of language and the limited scope of science in legislative drafting, inevitably there enters into the construction of statutes the play of judicial judgment within the limits of the relevant legislative materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 100, 78 S.Ct. at 1016. See <em>United States v. American Trucking Ass'ns., supra, </em>310 U.S. at 544, 60 S.Ct. at 1064 (Justice Reed); <em>United States v. Kirby, supra, </em>74 U.S. at 487 (Justice Field) (\u201cThe reason of the law in such cases should prevail over its letter\u201d); <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3, 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>3 S.Ct. 18, 32, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883) (Justice Harlan) (\u201cIt is not the words of the law but the internal sense of it that makes the law: the letter of the law is the body; the sense and reason of the law is the soul\u201d); <em>Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States </em>143 U.S. 457, 472, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892) (Justice Brewer) (\u201cthe act, although within the letter, is not within the intention of the legislature, and therefore cannot be within the statute\u201d). Judge Wilkey\u2019s test is either simplistic, or tars so many distinguished judges that the brush is wider than he could possibly defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Put another way, Judge Wilkey misapprehends the true distinction between the legislative and the judicial function. An appellate judge as much as a legislator, in Edmund Burke\u2019s words, owes his society \u201cnot his industry only, but his judgment.\u201d There are similarities between the two roles that cannot be denied. <em>See, e.g., </em>B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921); Hazard, The <em>Supreme Court as a Legislature, </em>64 Cornell L.Rev. 1 (1978). Both roles require application of reason to statutes, analysis of facts, and the rational treatment of complex issues. This by no way means that appellate judges and legislators are the same, of course, although polemicists with hidden agendas may try to twist the point. The judge becomes an illicit legislator when he goes beyond a dispassionate interpretation of the intent and meaning of the legislature that enacted the law before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">This observation must raise the question of who it is that truly seeks to legislate here. The majority opinion has applied the Freedom of Information Act in view of the intent of the several legislatures that passed, amended, or resisted amending it. We may have judged erroneously, of course. To paraphrase Justice Jackson, we are neither infallible nor final. Nevertheless, although our judgment may be wrong, it is no less a judgment in good faith. Judge Wilkey rejects any attempt to judge the intent of Congress, and woodenly focuses only on the words of the statute: \u201cIts literal meaning should be given effect.\u201d Dissent at 1104. His version of the literal meaning leads to an absurd result that could not have been contemplated by Congress. Indeed, as Judge Wilkey stated in his decision for the panel that has been vacated, \u201cwe may regret that Congress has mandated the disclosure . .. . \u201d <em>Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>No. 80-1278 (D.C.Cir. November 12, 1980). He commends the literal application of the statute with an eye toward \u201can effort to rewrite substantially the Freedom of Information Act\u201d now underway in Congress, dissent at 1120, and confides that \u201c[a]s a policy matter, I hope the Congress does a complete job of revision . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120. Who, then, actually exceeds the bounds of the judicial role and seeks to legislate instead? Who, then, is truly diminishing public confidence in the work of our court?</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">Finally, I regret that Judge Wilkey chooses to \u201ctest\u201d the bonafides of judicial oaths \u201cto uphold the law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1121. I think Judge Wilkey can be true to his oath and the rest of the court can be true to theirs even though we disagree as to whether an adjudged felon is authorized by FOIA to utilize the BATF Manual on \u201cSurveillance of Premises, Vehicles and Persons\u201d for his own ends. I wish it had not been necessary to concur in a separate opinion, but the ironies of Judge Wilkey\u2019s dissent should not go unremarked.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">. Several of Judge Wilkey\u2019s arguments are less strong than his ardent expression suggests, however. He notes that \u201cthe <em>majority </em>of persons who spoke on the subject before the House indicated their belief that Exemption 2 did <em>not </em>cover law enforcement manuals,\u201d dissent at 1105 (emphasis in the original), but none of these witnesses were Members of the House. \u201cCongress has not delegated to unofficial individuals or organizations, which may appear before one of its committees advocating legislation, the authority to construe for it and the public statutes which it enacts.

Kung Chen Fur Corp., </em>188 F.2d 577, 584 (C.C.P.A.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The dissent also makes much of the fact that the 1976 Government in the Sunshine Act carries over verbatim most of the FOIA exemptions, including the specific language of Exemption 2, but that the House Report to that Act \u201cgives the same narrow interpretation to this exemption as the Senate [Report] did in 1965.\u201d Dissent at 1107 (italics omitted). Judge Wilkey concludes that \u201cby 1976 the House of Representatives had repudiated the sweeping language concerning Exemption 2 contained in its . 1966 report\u201d on FOIA, <em>id. </em>and that under the majority\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d interpretation either \u201cthe two identically worded exemptions have precisely opposite meanings\u201d or else we must interpret Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act \u201cin a manner contradictory to the unequivocal intent expressed in both committee reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109. Aside from the debatable wisdom of construing legislation that is not now before the court, it is not at all clear that the Sunshine Act \u201cwould have to be interpreted\u201d in a contradictory or absurd manner. Did Congress truly intend to open agency meetings held to approve investigative manuals of the sort whose release under FOIA is at issue here? Even if both Houses provided clear, uniform guidance on Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act, of course, that does not bind our interpretation of legislation whose application is invoked in entirely different contexts. \u201cThe tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them, runs all through legal discussions.

United States Department of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753 (D.C.Cir.1978). The court, again sitting en banc, now turns away from the <em>Jordan </em>rationale but adheres to the result reached in that case. Maj. op. at 1053, 1074-75. I find the current opinion a plausible interpretation of the language of Exemption 2, consistent with decisions in other circuits, \u201cthe overall design of FOIA, the explicit comments made in the House, the cautionary words of the Supreme Court in <em>Rose, </em>and even common sense.\u201d Maj. op. at 1074. I therefore concur in the opinion, with reservations limited to the explanation the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>court offers for preserving the <em>Jordan </em>judgment. The court concludes that \u201cthe <em>result </em>in <em>[Jordan] </em>would be identical under the test we announce today.\u201d Maj. op. at 1053, 1074. The manner in which the court\u2019s opinion spares the <em>Jordan </em>judgment while abandoning the <em>Jordan </em>rationale, in my view, clouds an otherwise clear pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><em>Jordan </em>held that Exemption 2 does not shield documents whose disclosure might risk circumvention of the law. 591 F.2d at 771. It was immaterial, in the view of the <em>Jordan </em>district court, <em>id. </em>at 758,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and this court\u2019s majority on appeal, whether disclosure of the guidelines for prosecutorial discretion there in question \u201cwould \u2018tip off\u2019 potential violators on how to break the law and avoid prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780. Even if release of the documents would significantly risk circumvention, the <em>Jordan </em>majority held, disclosure was required. Hence, as the court now points out, no fact finding on circumvention attended the <em>Jordan </em>disposition. Maj. op. at 1068 n.46, 1075 &amp; n.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">The court holds today that Exemption 2 protects documents from mandatory disclosure if a two-pronged test is met: the document is used for predominantly internal purposes, maj. op. at 1073, <em>and </em>disclosure significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes. Maj. op. at 1074. Therefore, to hold that \u201cthe result in <em>Jordan </em>\u2014 release of the documents on prosecu-torial discretion \u2014 would be the same,\u201d maj. op. at 1075, the court must have determined that (1) the guidelines for pros-ecutorial discretion are <em>not </em>used for predominantly internal purposes, <em>see </em>maj. op. at 1073, or (2) disclosure of the prosecutorial documents would <em>not </em>significantly risk evasion of the law. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">The second of these two Jordan-sparing determinations can be quickly dispatched. This court of review did not resolve in the first instance the fact it identifies as disputed and unresolved in <em>Jordan </em>\u2014 whether, as the United States Attorney contended, release of the prosecutorial discretion guidelines would benefit \u201cthose who seek to circumvent the law.\u201d 591 F.2d at 780. No factual finding was made by the <em>Jordan </em>district court on that point, and no such finding can be decreed by this court <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">Since the court cannot say one way or the other whether disclosure of the <em>Jordan </em>documents significantly risked evasion of the law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> its assurance that the <em>Jordan </em>result \u201cwould be the same\u201d under the test announced today must rest on a conviction that the prosecutorial discretion guidelines were <em>not </em>used (should not have been used?) for predominantly internal purposes. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 1073, 1074. On this score, the court suggests, with scant elaboration, that the guidelines are not \u201cpredominantly internal\u201d because they are a source of \u201csecret law.\u201d Maj. op. at 1075. <em>See also id. </em>at 1068, 1072 &amp; n.58, 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">The BATF manual, the court points out, instructs agency personnel on observation, not regulation, of public behavior, while the guidelines on prosecutorial discretion instruct personnel on \u201chow to regulate members of the public.\u201d Maj. op. at 1075. But the prosecutorial guidelines do not regulate public behavior by distinguishing legal from illegal conduct; they do not inform law-abiding citizens how to conform their conduct to statutory or regulatory requirements. The United States Attorney in <em>Jordan </em>urged that public announcement of prosecution policy, far from bearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>propriety of actions of members of the public, would give \u201ccarte blanche\u201d to and encourage \u201ccertain criminal activity.\u201d 591 F.2d at 780. Specifically, the Department of Justice stressed in <em>Jordan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-4\">Public disclosure of these materials would alert members of the public to those situations, persons, and offenses for which prosecution is withheld, selectively applied, or disposed of by pre-trial diversion. Individuals could then successfully exploit these policies by committing crimes within these select categories, thereby escaping prosecution. For example, publication of a policy of non-prosecution (or prosecution at a lesser degree of seriousness) for possession of certain quantities of specific narcotic drugs would serve only to encourage dealers and users of narcotics to carry lesser quantities of the drug than those specified in our guidelines .... [A]n offender could avoid full prosecution merely by stealing property valued at less than our <em>de minimus </em>[sic] standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 758. I find unavoidable the conclusion that the guidelines for prosecution are like the BATF Manual to this extent: both instruct agency personnel how to do their job; neither instructs the public on the propriety of contemplated activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">It may be that the result in <em>Jordan </em>should be the same and that an opinion could be written explaining why. I believe the court hints at, but has not written, such an opinion. <em>Jordan </em>and this ease cannot be distinguished on the ground that <em>Jordan </em>involved no significant risk of law circumvention, or on the ground that the prosecutorial guidelines, unlike the BATF Manual, are public conduct-regulating rules not designed for predominantly internal use. To the extent that the court' points to these factors as separating <em>Jordan </em>from <em>Crooker, </em>the opinion muddles where it should illuminate. The court does say <em>Jordan </em>involved, as this case does not, \u201csecret law\u201d of an agency. Maj. op. at 1075.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Had the opinion focused on that point, and offered more by way of elaboration,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court, which must decide whether future cases are governed by the <em>Crooker </em>reasoning or by the <em>Jordan </em>result, might have had a more secure guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">OUTLINE</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-17\">Page</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">I.

United States Department of Justice.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The rationale in <em>Jordan </em>\u2014 endorsed without reservation by five judges, a majority of the court \u2014 was one of strict construction of the exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), consonant with the avowed overall intent of Congress and a long line of our own decisions. The result compelled disclosure of documents whose publication may arguably handicap the Government\u2019s law enforcement efforts, a fact which was openly recognized by both majority and dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-16\">Now this court has decreed a remarkable reversal in both rationale and result. Yet the words of the statute remain the same; and the actions of the Congress in enacting and amending the FOIA are undeniable historical facts, as certain in 1978 as in 1981. Indeed, not one additional <em>fact </em>in the legislative history is relied on in Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion, although there is a great deal of new <em>interpretation. </em>The <em>Jordan </em>majority opinion itself has been virtually ignored, as if it were natural and proper for this court to conduct an entirely de novo determination of the issue resolved decisively by a majority in the <em>Jordan </em>case. And, of course, if this court can switch its interpretation of Exemption 2 so completely in three years, it would not be difficult to <em>switch back </em>again in, say, ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-17\">What this court is playing is a legislative game. The role it has assumed, years after the event, is that of a conference committee to reconcile the contradictory Senate and House interpretations of Exemption 2. Because of the legislative situation in 1966, such a reconciliation could not be achieved. Only one of these interpretations is correct; to my mind all evidence shows it must be the Senate version, a conclusion reached by virtually all commentators who have addressed the issue, and one we reached in <em>Jordan </em>three years ago. Clearly this court should not attempt to perform the omitted legislative act and work out a compromise which it <em>thinks </em>years after the event <em>might have been </em>acceptable to both houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-18\">It is not only improper for this court to work out a legislative compromise between the two houses as of 1966, it is also superfluous, because in practical effect that legislative compromise was worked out in 1976 with the enactment of the Government in the Sunshine Act containing the identical language in its Exemption 2 as in Exemption 2 of the Freedom of Information Act. What happened in 1976 was that <em>both </em>houses of Congress adopted the Senate interpretation of the identical phraseology used in both the FOIA and the Sunshine Act. In effect, the House determined that the meaning to be attributed to these words was that specified in the original Senate Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-19\">If the House is now in accord with the Senate interpretation of the English lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>guage used in Exemption 2 of <em>both </em>the FOIA and the Sunshine Act, then it is the height of presumption for this court to go back to the House position of 1966 and assert that position today over the position of the Senate maintained in both 1966 and 1976. Such an assertion of legislative power, combined with the disregard shown for the decision issued by a majority of this en banc court a mere three years ago, can serve only to undermine the prestige of this court and diminish the respect which will be paid its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">I. ANALYSIS OF EXEMPTION 2</p>\n<p id=\"ani-dedup-1\">A. <em>The Language of Exemption 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">Exemption 2 provides that mandatory disclosure under the FOIA does not apply to matters that are \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Jordan </em>the majority conducted an in-depth analysis of this language and concluded that its meaning was quite clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX1\">It is almost impossible to look at this short, simple exemption on its face, \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,\u201d and say that this description was intended to cover the Manual and Guidelines here. The word \u201cpersonnel\u201d would normally connote matters relating to pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc. \u2014 precisely the kind of trivia that was indeed described by the Senate\u2019s comment on the coverage of this particular exemption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">Today the majority asserts, without any explanation whatsoever, that \u201cat least at first blush ... the BATF manual appears to be encompassed by the literal language of Exemption 2.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From where comes this new interpretation, directly counter to that of Jordan? Judge Edwards cites two circuit court decisions adopting a similar reading, apparently implying that he is simply following the weight of federal authority. He makes no mention of the other courts which have read Exemption 2 as <em>Jordan </em>did. The Sixth Circuit, for example, held that \u201cthe plain import of the (b)(2) language\u201d supported a narrow interpretation and that the \u201cemphasis on personnel rules and practices suggests concern with conditions of employment and the like.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-14\">What is worse is that the majority makes no attempt to refute the analysis of <em>Jordan. </em>Given that <em>Jordan </em>found that \u201cpersonnel\u201d was the real problem for the Government agency seeking to avoid disclosure by virtue of Exemption 2, one might have thought that the majority would confront <em>Jordan\u2019s </em>reading of the word and explain why it rejects that reading. But the majority opinion says nothing about what the specific word \u201cpersonnel\u201d means in Exemption 2 or why Congress used it, and it fails even to indicate a recognition that the word was central to <em>Jordan\u2019s </em>analysis. The majority merely holds that \u201cthe words \u2018personnel rules and practices\u2019 encompass not merely minor employment matters, but may cover other rules and practices governing agency personnel, including significant matters like job training for law enforcement personnel.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This detailed definition, it turns out, derives entirely from two passages written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>by Judge Leventhal in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen (Vaughn II)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Jordan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\">The first passage is used obviously to alter the meaning of the words used by Congress. \u201cRelated solely to,\u201d under this novel construction, actually means \u201crelated <em>predominantly </em>to.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, the actual language of the exemption turns out to indicate a meaning contrary to that preferred by the majority; so the unambiguous word \u201csolely\u201d is changed to \u201cpredominantly,\u201d a much more malleable word that enables a court to support whatever result it finds desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">That this construction is wrong was made quite clear by the Supreme Court in <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court had before it the <em>Vaughn II </em>decision, and it chose to adopt the reasoning of the majority rather than that of Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurring opinion. In determining that the Senate Report better comported with the intent underlying Exemption 2, the Court cited with approval the <em>Vaughn II </em>majority\u2019s finding that the distinction between exempt \u201c \u2018minor or trivial matters\u2019 \u201d and nonexempt \u201c \u2018substantial matters\u2019 \u201d was \u201c \u2018a standard, a guide, which an agency and then a court, if need be, can apply with some certainty, consistency and clarity\u2019.... \u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This unequivocal Supreme Court endorsement is precisely why <em>Jordan </em>rejected the vague and uncertain standard of \u201cpredominant internality\u201d suggested by Judge Leventhal. And not only did Rose adopt this clear interpretation of Exemption 2, it specifically stated that the materials at issue could not be withheld because \u201c[tjhey are not matter with <em>merely </em>internal significance\u201d and \u201cdo not concern only <em>routine </em>matters.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Had the Court meant to adopt Judge Leventhal\u2019s standard it obviously would have used the word \u201cpredominantly\u201d rather than \u201cmerely.\u201d That the Court chose \u201cmerely,\u201d which is a close approximation of the actual word \u201csolely,\u201d shows that the Court preferred a literal interpretation. Thus the Court followed the view of the <em>Vaughn II </em>majority. By resurrecting Judge Leventhal\u2019s standard, the majority today has adopted what the Supreme Court in <em>Rose </em>demonstrated is an erroneous interpretation of Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">The second passage quoted by the majority is from Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurrence in <em>Jordan :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-15\">Exemption 2 is applicable where the document consists of internal instructions to such government officials as investigators and bank examiners. In such a case disclosure would permit circumvention of the law, and there is no substantial, valid external interest of the community at large in revelation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-16\">Apparently content that this passage is sufficient explanation, Judge Edwards simply concludes by saying that \u201c[w]e agree with this interpretation of the literal meaning of Exemption 2.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">I submit that the latter passage is manifestly <em>not </em>an interpretation of the <em>literal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>meaning of Exemption 2. The first sentence simply <em>asserts </em>that Exemption 2 covers internal instructions to government officials, and the second sentence is purely a statement of one view of what the appropriate <em>policy </em>should be, i.e., not to permit disclosure where it would allow circumvention of the law and where there is no important external interest in revelation. There is no hint in Exemption 2 that the goal is to keep instructions secret to prevent circumvention of the law. \u201cLaw <em>enforcement\u201d or a similar phrase would convey such an intent, but \u201cpersonnel\u201d does not.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such concerns can be derived only from certain aspects of the legislative history, not from an analysis of the specific language of Exemption 2. The result is that the majority has side-stepped <em>Jordan\u2019s </em>analysis of the language of Exemption 2. In its place the court has simply inserted, without further elaboration or justification, a different definition which was rejected in <em>Jordan </em>and in <em>Rose.'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">B. <em>The House and Senate Reports</em></p>\n<p id=\"aro-dedup-0\">1. <em>The conflict between the two reports</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5K\">The heart of the controversy over the meaning of Exemption 2 is the conflict between the House and Senate Reports on the FOIA. The Senate Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-13\">Exemption No. 2 relates only to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. Examples of these may be rules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A76X\">The House Report\u2019s statement on Exemption 2 is completely different:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-14\">Operating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure, but this exemption would not cover all \u201cmatters of internal management\u201d such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures which are withheld under the present law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-15\">The <em>Jordan </em>majority declared that \u201crarely can there be found two such contradictory explanations of a statute\u2019s meaning than in the Senate and House Reports.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit found that \u201c[t]he disagreement between the houses is total.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Many other commentators have called the two reports \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and have joined the <em>Jordan </em>majority in determining that the background of the two reports indicates that the Senate Report should be given effect.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>In today\u2019s opinion, however, the majority comes up with a startling new conclusion: the two reports are not really contradictory at all. Judge Edwards declares that \u201c[t]he so-called contradiction between the House and Senate Reports . . . exists only with respect to the exemption of trivial employment matters. The House Report\u2019s statement that Exemption 2 permits exemption of more substantive matters \u2014 such as \u2018manuals of procedure for government investigators or examiners\u2019 \u2014 is uncontroverted by the Senate Report.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because the Senate Report provides \u201conly a non-exclusive list of examples of matters exempt from disclosure,\u201d and because \u201cit does not expressly limit the scope of Exemption 2 to [minor employment] matters,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the majority determines that the two different statements can simply be added together to form one coherent explanation of the intent behind Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\">This is one of the most remarkable and novel principles of construction I have seen in a long time. Apparently the majority believes that if a report is silent on matter X, then that report fails to create even an inference that matter X is not within the legislative intent \u2014 even where the report lists examples of what it <em>does </em>cover which are quite different than matter X. I submit that the implausibility of this view in general is obvious.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And applied here it flies in the face of all other existing interpretations of these two reports.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Senate Report states that Exemption 2 relates <em>only </em>to \u201crules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s interpretation it would be perfectly natural for the Report to have contained the phrase \u201cinstructions on conducting surveillance\u201d in place of the phrase \u201cand the like.\u201d Perhaps my colleagues believe there is no difference between rules regarding parking facilities, lunch hours, and sick leave and those regarding covert surveillance by federal agents, but I think the difference between the two could not be greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">Not only does the majority attempt to find no material conflict between the House and Senate Reports, it actually goes on to imply that the House Report should be given <em>greater </em>weight. Judge Edwards asserts that \u201cthe Senate gives us less guidance since the Senators made no useful comments during the Senate hearings, and held no debate at all on FOIA.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The implication is that the Senate Report should be given little weight because of this lack of debate. Such a holding is directly contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rose. </em>The Court noted that \u201c[a]lmost all courts that have considered the difference between the Reports have concluded that the Senate Report more accurately reflects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>congressional purpose,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and it relied upon the Senate Report in reaching its decision. If, as the majority opinion implies, the Senate Report should be given little weight because of the lack of senatorial debate on the issue, surely it should have been disregarded in <em>Rose </em>as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Judge Edwards seeks to explain his reliance on the House Report on the ground that \u201c[ujnder the <em>Jordan </em>interpretation, congressional intent expressed in the House is given no weight at all.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To avoid this \u201cextreme approach\u201d he asserts that \u201cthe proper route is to try to reconcile legislative intent expressed in the House with that of the Senate.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>But under the majority opinion the central thrust of the Senate Report is utterly repudiated. </em>Quite to the contrary of the majority\u2019s interpretation, the clear meaning of the Senate Report is not that minor employment matters are <em>among </em>those exempted under Exemption 2, it is that <em>only </em>such minor matters are covered. No fair reading of the Senate Report can lead to the conclusion that it meant to include investigative manuals within Exemption 2. It is true that under <em>Jordan </em>the House Report is disregarded. <em>But that is a result of the House\u2019s own attempt to amend the meaning of the Senate version of Exemption 2 without actually changing the words of the statute. </em>If the House had intended that Exemption 2 have a different meaning from that given to it by the Senate Report, it should have made changes in the legislation and then attempted to resolve the differences in conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">2. <em>The background on passage of the FOIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">Crucial to this court\u2019s holding in <em>Jordan </em>was analysis of the background surrounding the issuance of the two committee reports, especially the fact that the House Report was prepared only <em>after </em>the Senate had unanimously adopted the FOIA, including Exemption 2, based on the Senate Report. As the Supreme Court found in <em>Rose, </em>quoting with approval from <em>Vaughn II, </em>\u201c \u2018The second major consideration favoring reliance upon the Senate Report is the fact that it was the only committee report that was before both houses of Congress. The House unanimously passed the Senate Bill without amendment, therefore no conference committee was necessary to reconcile conflicting provisions\u2019 . ...\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As Professor Davis has said, \u201cno one will ever know whether the Senate Committee or the Senate would have concurred in the restrictions written into the House committee report.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>Rose </em>adopted <em>Vaughn </em>IT\u2019s statement of the significance of this fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-13\">\u201c. . . [W]e as a court viewing the legislative history must be wary of relying upon the House Report, or even the statements of House sponsors, where their views differ from those expressed in the Senate. As Professor Davis said: \u2018The basic principle is quite elementary: The content of the law must depend upon the intent of both Houses, not of just one.\u2019 By unanimously passing the Senate Bill without amendment, the House denied both the Senate Committee and the entire Senate an opportunity to object (or concur) to the interpretation written into the House Report (or voiced in floor colloquy). This being the case, we choose to rely upon the Senate Report.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">How does the majority respond to this key argument in <em>Jordan, </em>which was specifically adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Rose </em>? It only cites Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Vaughn II </em>(five months before <em>Rose), </em>which found this \u201c \u2018a novel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>and totally unpersuasive canon of statutory construction.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Though Judge Edwards does not specifically adopt this view, he appears to agree with it as he cites it directly following his criticism of the <em>Vaughn II </em>majority. <em>And he makes no mention of the fact that </em>Rose <em>specifically quoted the </em>Vaughn II <em>majority with approval on this point, thus necessarily rejecting Judge Lev-enthal\u2019s position. Thus the majority has either taken </em>a <em>position directly contrary to the Court in </em>Rose <em>or, recognizing that the Court\u2019s view refutes its own interpretation of the legislative history, it has chosen to avoid commenting on the analysis entirely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">This analysis becomes even more powerful when it is recognized that \u201cthe expansive gloss placed on Exemption 2 and other sections of the Act by the House Report was the product of last minute chicanery by interested members of the House <em>after </em>the Senate had passed the bill and just as the full Committee in the House was about to report out the bill.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Professor Davis has aptly termed this an \u201cabuse of legislative history.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Another commentator noted that the House Report \u201cdiffered so substantially from its Senate counterpart . . . that it, in effect, amended the bill,\u201d and cited the House Report\u2019s discussion of Exemption 2 as the \u201cmost blatant example\u201d of the House\u2019s attempt to restrict the FOIA by committee report.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> And the most damning evidence of all was provided by the testimony of Benny L. Kass, who was counsel to the Foreign Operations and Government Operations Committee from 1962 to 1965. In 1973 testimony at the Senate hearings on proposed amendments to the FOIA, Mr. Kass explained \u201cwhy the House report is so different from the rest of the bill\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-7\">The basic reason that the House bill is different was after the Senate passed the Freedom of Information Act and it was about to be reported out of the House Government Operations Committee, the Justice Department \u2014 Mr. Katzenbach, Mr. <em>Wozencraft </em>\u2014 came <em>up and talked to Congressman Moss and said, look, we cannot support the bill. There are a number of changes that have to be made.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">I kind of appeared as an emissary on behalf of the former chairman of this subcommittee to Congressman Moss and I said it is our reading from the Senate that the <em>Senate has already passed this bill twice, that there should be no amendments. </em>We wanted to move forward with it. We have played with it long enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-9\">So basically what was done under really almost an implied veto \u2014 I don\u2019t think they ever specifically said they would veto it but there was an implied threat\u2014 <em>we tried to compromise a number of the specific objections into the House report. </em>I don\u2019t think time permits going into these details. I have a very brief analysis which I was going to submit. I have to type it and I will submit it for the record, pointing out where the <em>House kind of gave in to what the Justice Department wanted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Mr. Kass then pointed out eight sections in the House Report in which the Justice Department was able to get the language it wanted. Not surprisingly, the seventh area was the Report\u2019s description of Exemption 2. Mr. Kass concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-4\">I don\u2019t think it was a sellout but in any event it was really the price of getting the bill. It was my legal advice to both the chairman of this committee and the chairman, Congressman Moss, that <em>the legislative history only interprets and does not vitiate in any way the legislation and that the legislation was strong and was there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-5\">I think this is important just for the record to point out why the House report is different. Fortunately, as Mr. Dobrovir said, there have been a number of cases all of which have said that the House report is so different that we have to look to the statute and that <em>the House report should not in any way undermine the basic statute that was passed by Congress in 1966.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">How do my colleagues respond to this compelling evidence that the House Report was an effort to change the meaning of the bill the Senate had already passed, not by amending the language but by inserting a contradictory legislative intent? <em>They ignore it. </em>Mr. Kass\u2019 testimony, which was so central to the opinion in. <em>Jordan, </em>is not quoted, cited, or rebutted in any point of Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion. Professor Davis\u2019 strong views condemning the House\u2019s ae-tions as \u201can abuse of legislative history\u201d are ignored as well. The majority merely asserts that since \u201cthe House hearings were completed before the Senate held hearings on and passed S. 1160,\u201d \u201cit is hardly sensible to disregard other consistent indications of House intent occurring after passage of the Senate bill on the speculative grounds that some members of the House engaged in \u2018last minute chicanery\u2019 to undermine the Senate\u2019s action.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This use of the word \u201cspeculative\u201d highlights the majority\u2019s unwillingness to join issue with the reasoning of the <em>Jordan </em>opinion. Mr. Kass\u2019 testimony, which is not contradicted by the majority nor by the testimony of any other person involved in the congressional activities leading to the enactment of the FOIA, leaves no doubt that such an \u201cabuse of legislative history\u201d did in fact occur. Faced with this uncontroverted fact, so damaging to its position, the majority pretends it does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">3. <em>The significance of the House and Senate hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">In addition to ignoring evidence supporting the <em>Jordan </em>majority\u2019s rationale, the majority misconstrues the legislative history in attempting to demonstrate that the House actually expressed its intent on Exemption 2 prior to the Senate\u2019s actions. The opinion asserts that \u201c[t]he House hearings unequivocally reveal that Exemption 2 was intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>ed to cover investigatory materials.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> When one checks closely the discussions cited by Judge Edwards, one finds that this \u201cunequivocal\u201d intention of \u201cthe House\u201d actually derives from a single statement by Congressman Moss: \u201cWhat [Exemption 2] was intended to cover was instances such as the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner \u2014 a bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an FBI agent.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The majority quotes the statement in text standing alone, as if it indicates beyond all doubt that this was the intent behind Exemption 2. It relegates to a footnote and fails even to discuss the exchange <em>subsequent </em>to Congressman Moss\u2019 statement, an exchange which makes clear that while Congressman Moss may in fact have <em>wanted </em>Exemption 2 to cover such manuals, he recognized that its language would have to be changed to accomplish that purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-4\">Mr. Moss. <em>What this was intended to cover was instances such as the manuals of procedure that are handed to an examiner </em>\u2014 a <em>bank examiner, or a savings and loan examiner, or the guidelines given to an FBI agent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-5\">Mr. Schlei. <em>Ah! Then the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d should be stricken. </em>Because \u201cpersonnel\u201d I think connoted certainly to us the employees relations, employee management rules and practices of an agency. What you meant was material related solely to the internal rules and practices of any agency for the guidance of its employees \u2014 something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-6\">I do agree that there should be protection for the instructions given to FBI agents and bank examiners; people who, if they are going to operate in expectable ways, cannot do their jobs. Their instructions have to be withheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-10\">\n<em>But I think that word \u201cpersonnel\u201d does not do the job well enough, Mr. Chairman. I am sure it can be done.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-11\">Mr. Moss. <em>We will hope to seek a way of doing the job </em>without exempting internal rules and practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-12\">Mr. Schlei. I suppose that could cover quite a lot of ground, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-13\">Mr. Moss. Because I am afraid that we would there open the barn door to everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-14\">Mr. Schlei. Well, it is one of those things, Mr. Chairman, that just shows how hard it is to cover the whole Government with a few words. There are a number of problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-15\">Mr. Moss. Oh, <em>we recognize the difficulty and the complexity, but we are perfectly willing to work at it.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-16\">The <em>Jordan </em>opinion makes clear the significance of this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-17\">[Congressman Moss] apparently wanted investigative manuals covered by the exemption, <em>but he was told flatly that the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d precluded such interpretation. </em>He acknowledged this, but stated his concern that excising \u201cpersonnel\u201d would \u201copen the barn door\u201d by leaving a broad exemption for all \u201cinternal rules and practices.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aoc-dedup-1\">The majority\u2019s response is simply that \u201c[s]ince in this ease we are seeking <em>congressional </em>intent, we cannot follow the suggestion [in <em>Jordan] </em>that Mr. Schlei\u2019s interpretation of Exemption 2 is to be given predominant weight over that of a congressman and chief sponsor of the bill.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"agd-dedup-0\">This reflects an obvious misunderstanding of the significance of Mr. Schlei\u2019s testimony. The end result of the discussion between Mr. Schlei and Congressman Moss was that the latter indicated that he understood that the language of Exemption 2 did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>not accord with his preferred interpretation of the purpose of the exemption. He most certainly did not in any way indicate that he thought the present language was satisfactory. Had he done so and thus disagreed with Mr. Schlei, his statement would be much. stronger evidence of the legislative intent underlying the specific words ultimately enacted into law. But all he said, and all that the majority concedes that he said, was that he <em>wanted </em>to protect investigatory records and that he would be \u201cwilling to work at it.\u201d Thus this is not at all a question of deciding to give greater weight to the interpretation of a witness than to that of a congressman. It is rather one of relying on the fact that a witness\u2019 interpretation of the exemption was <em>not </em>controverted by the congressman, who rather indicated that he would try to see if changes could be made to correct the deficiencies in the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">This understanding is made even stronger by the fact that many other witnesses at the House hearings gave uncontroverted testimony that Exemption 2\u2019s language did <em>not </em>extend far enough to protect sensitive internal information necessary to carry out agency functions. The Department of Defense submitted the following commentary on Exemption 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-5\">Although the second exception for \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices of any agency\u201d is desirable as far as it goes, it makes no provision for the many other kinds of internal rules and practices equally deserving of protection and of no legitimate interest outside the agency. Moreover, it raises a question concerning the status of matters which cannot satisfy the requirement of relating \u201csolely\u201d to personnel rules and practices but involving other matters as well. It appears to be the intent of the provision to give no protection to those portions of records which relate to internal rules and practices of an agency when they are mixed with other information. An example of the kind of internal management rule that would receive no protection under section 1(c)(2) of H.R. 5012 is found in DOD Directive 4105.46 which prescribes the permissible price latitudes for DOD negotiators in cost-plus-fixed-fee contract negotiations. The undesirability of making such information generally available is obvious, but H.R. 5012 provides no basis for not doing so.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">The Treasury Department shared the same basic concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-11\"><em>Exemption </em>(2). \u2014 This exemption reduces the existing exemption for matters \u201crelating solely to the internal management of an agency\u201d to matters related \u201csolely to internal personnel rules and practices.\u201d It reflects the view that all other internal management operations of the Government should be disclosed to any person at all. But internal operations include many matters which are of no public interest or which should not be made readily available, as a few examples will illustrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-12\">As we read the present exemption, it would not protect the Treasury Department if it refused to detail in advance the method it intended to employ in protecting the movement of currency from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to its own cash room in the main building. Apparently, upon demand, the Treasury would have to supply the records of how it proposed to use its guard force. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-13\">The Department recommends that this exemption be revised to exempt any matter relating solely to the internal management or procedure of an agency.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>Both of these departments thus read Exemption 2 as applying only to minor personnel matters. Both gave specific examples of documents that might have to be disclosed even though they contained key instructions to agency personnel as to how to carry out their duties; and the Treasury Department example clearly involves the possibility of disclosure resulting in circumvention of the law. Combined with Mr. Schlei\u2019s responses to Congressman Moss, these statements should have made clear to the House that the language of Exemption 2 did not appear to outside observers to encompass information such as instructions to agency personnel. If there had been anything close to what the majority calls an \u201cunequivocal\u201d indication that the members of the House wanted to exempt such materials,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the Representatives would have responded either by asserting that the proposed language <em>did </em>cover them or by subsequently amending the language to do so. They did neither, leading to the conclusion that they agreed with the witnesses\u2019 interpretation of the statute as it then stood\u2014 and still stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\">As in the House, testimony in the Senate hearings showed that Exemption 2 was not read by any witness as applying to investigative manuals. Mr. Edwin Rains, the Assistant General Counsel of the Treasury Department, objected to Exemption 2 on the specific ground that it would not apply to these documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-5\">The second exemption protects matter \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency.\u201d This is good so far as it goes. But, we don\u2019t believe that it goes far enough. There are many other internal agency documents which should not be released. The investigative manuals of the Secret Service and the Bureau of Narcotics, for example, contain information the release of which would only be of assistance to criminals in telling them how to plot their crimes so as best to escape detection. Surely such information should be protected.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-11\">And another independent observer, Mr. Robert Benjamin, Chairman of the ABA Committee on the Code of Federal Administrative Procedure, commented on Mr. Rains\u2019 concern about protecting investigative manuals and stated that \u201cwe think that if anywhere besides in specific statutes it should be treated in [Exemption] 7, which has to do with investigative matters.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">This testimony is fully in accord with that before the House subcommittee. Mr. Rains specifically stated that Exemption 2 did not cover investigative materials, and Mr. Benjamin agreed that Exemption 2 did not cover them and that reference should instead be made to them in Exemption 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">My colleagues are forced to recognize the existence of this testimony, but they then proceed to contend that it is irrelevant. Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion dismisses the Plouse testimony on the ground that Congressman Moss\u2019 initial statement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>purpose of Exemption 2 is controlling. And the Senate hearings are given equally short shrift:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-4\">The Senators themselves, however, made no comments on the witnesses\u2019 objections or on the scope of Exemption 2. Consequently, the Senate hearings provide little enlightenment as to Congress\u2019 intent concerning Exemption 2.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"acm-dedup-0\">The majority further asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-5\">Of course, a decision not to act on the objections to Exemption 2, especially on those raised by witnesses who opposed the entire bill, does not create an inference that the Exemption would have permitted disclosure of all law enforcement manuals. The Senators may have felt that the existing language of Exemption 2 adequately dealt with the expressed fears of these witnesses.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">This argument is totally implausible. An inference certainly <em>is </em>created about the meaning of proposed statutory language when a house of Congress fails to change the language in the face of uncontradicted testimony by witnesses that such language would have a given result. On the majority\u2019s view legislative hearings are irrelevant. What witnesses say about the proposed bill can be completely ignored, while a single congressman\u2019s statement about what he would <em>like </em>the bill to accomplish can be seized upon as an unequivocal expression of the meaning to be given to specific statutory words. Judge Edwards has not cited a single person present at either the House or Senate hearings who contradicted the testimony of the many witnesses who declared that the wording of Exemption 2 did not protect investigative manuals. If congressmen had \u201cfelt that the existing language of Exemption 2 adequately dealt with the expressed fears of these witnesses,\u201d surely one of .them would have said so. None did, and yet the language was not changed. Its literal meaning should be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">4. <em>The House debates</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARu\">The majority also claims that the House debates are \u201chighly instructive\u201d in showing that the House intended Exemption 2 to cover investigative manuals.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Yet two of the three quotes it relies upon are irrelevant to this specific issue. The statements by Representatives Moss and Dole are general statements to the effect that the bill was attempting, as Representative Dole put it, to take \u201cinto consideration the right to know of every citizen while affording the safeguards necessary to the effective functioning of Government.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Such quotes simply state the obvious and prove nothing about the intent underlying Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">The third quotation relied upon by the majority does support its position. Representative Gallagher stated that \u201cthe bill also prevents the disclosure of other types of \u2018sensitive\u2019 Government information such as ... income tax auditors\u2019 manual. . . . Income tax auditors\u2019 manual would be protected under No. 2 \u2014 \u2018related solely to internal personnel rules and practices.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The majority concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-12\">From these brief, but uncontradicted, statements in the House debate on S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>1160, we can see that the members of the House recognized that the unrestricted release of government documents might interfere with the \u201ceffective operation of the Government,\u201d and that the nine exemptions were included in S. 1160 to prevent such interference. More specifically and important, supporters of S. 1160 were not challenged in their claim that government investigatory manuals were protected under Examination 2.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYv\">The majority\u2019s claim that \u201cthese statements\u201d by \u201csupporters\u201d of the bill were important is misleading given that there was only <em>one </em>such statement. Only Representative Gallagher, in an extremely brief remark, asserted that income tax auditors\u2019 manuals would be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 2. His remark was not echoed by anyone else and it was not made during any specific debate over Exemption 2. Thus it is not surprising that no one \u201cchallenged\u201d the claim. There is no obligation on the part of congressmen to challenge one representative\u2019s isolated statement in order to keep it from becoming the definitive expression of the intent of the entire House. Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion characterizes this single comment as constituting \u201cthe express feelings of one house,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> when actually the <em>majority </em>of persons who spoke on the subject before the House indicated their belief that Exemption 2 did <em>not </em>cover law enforcement manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\">C. <em>Section (a)(2)(G) of the FOIA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\"><em>Jordan </em>held that section (a)(2)(C), which provides that agencies shall make available for public inspection \u201cadministrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public,\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> does not operate to exempt law enforcement manuals from disclosure under the FOIA. The majority explicitly affirms that part of the <em>Jordan </em>holding, yet goes on to argue that section (a)(2)(C)\u2019s legislative history supports the finding that Exemption 2 covers such manuals. Judge Edwards notes that \u201cseveral witnesses expressed their fears that [the phrase \u201cstaff manuals\u201d] would mandate release of information that could damage or hinder law enforcement efforts,\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and that the Senate Report then recommended adding the word \u201cadministrative\u201d to the expression \u201cstaff manuals\u201d in an apparent effort to protect law enforcement information. The majority concludes that this indicates \u201cCongress\u2019 deep concern that manuals setting forth guidelines for auditing or inspection procedures should not be released to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a8o-dedup-0\">In my view the legislative history of section (a)(2)(C) works against the majority\u2019s conclusion. It is ironic that substantial reliance is placed on the testimony of witnesses at hearings on section (a)(2)(C) to the effect that its language would require release of information damaging to law enforcement efforts; the majority dismisses similar testimony about the language of Exemption 2 as indicative of nothing whatsoever. Moreover, the fact that the Senate subcommittee responded to these concerns by adding the word \u201cadministrative\u201d and by including specific discussion of the need for protecting law enforcement information in the committee reports only goes to point out that there was an easily available way for Congress to implement its desire to protect law enforcement manuals. In sharp contrast to its actions in response to the testimony on section (a)(2)(C), neither house responded to the many witnesses who complained about the language of Exemption 2. Thus, the fact that \u201cCongress acted specifically to prevent such a result\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>gard to section (a)(2)(C) provides a strong indication that, in the last analysis, it did not provide similar protection in Exemption 2, as it made no effort to change the latter\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">D. <em>The Overall Purpose of the FOIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">In <em>Jordan </em>the majority addressed the fact that the House Report on Exemption 2 cuts strongly against the overall purpose of the FOIA. It noted that \u201cthe sweeping interpretation of Exemption 2 favored by the House Report was incompatible with Congress\u2019 expressed intent to cut back on the previous exemption for \u2018internal management\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cthe language of the House Report seemed less consonant with the overall scheme and general purpose of the Act than did the Senate Report.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Quoting <em>Vaughn II, </em>the majority in <em>Jordan </em>concluded that \u201cfaced with a conflict in legislative history, the recognized principal purpose of the FOIA requires us to choose that interpretation most favoring disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Other commentators have observed the same thing about the House Report.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">The basic principle of construction of the FOIA has been enunciated by the Supreme Court, by this court, and by virtually all other courts on so many occasions that it is now quite familiar: disclosure is by far the overriding purpose of the FOIA. Indeed the Supreme Court in <em>Rose </em>quoted with approval the exact same passage relied on by <em>Jordan </em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-10\">\u201c[W]e have repeatedly stated that \u2018[t]he policy of the Act requires that the disclosure requirements be construed broadly, the exemptions narrowly.\u2019 Thus, faced with a conflict in the legislative history, the recognized principal purpose of the FOIA requires us to choose that interpretation most favoring disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">Apparently undaunted by the Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of this principle of construction from <em>Vaughn II, </em>the majority proceeds to criticize it as \u201ctoo superficial\u201d because \u201cit fails to take into account all of the \u2018cross-currents\u2019 of concerns expressed by those members of Congress supporting the enactment of FOIA.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Thus, in direct contrast to the expressed view of the Supreme Court itself, the majority has chosen to emphasize not disclosure but rather the \u201ctwo crucial b\u00fat potentially conflicting interests: the right of the citizenry to know what the Government is doing, and a legitimate but limited need for secrecy to maintain the effective operation of Government.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The phrase \u201ccross-currents\u201d is repeated again and again in Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion, and the need for effective Government operation is held to be \u201cfundamental\u201d to the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The majority finally concludes that \u201ceven common sense . . . would seem to belie any suggestion that Congress enacted a statute whose provisions undermined its criminal statutes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.\"<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">If the approach taken by the majority \u2014 \u25a0 with the emphasis on \u201ccommon sense\u201d and on the \u201ccross-currents of concern\u201d \u2014 had been followed consistently with regard to all nine exemptions, the FOIA would have had little impact on the Government of this nation. Simply put, \u201ccommon sense\u201d is not the standard for judicial construction of the FOIA. It is an extraordinary strong statute requiring disclosure of information even where balancing of the costs and benefits would indicate to most people that the Government should be permitted to withhold the information. It is <em>the Congress </em>which has made this balancing of costs and benefits, and this court has no higher duty than to carry out what Congress has enacted as law, our personal judgments to the contrary notwithstanding. For this court now to start emphasizing the FOIA\u2019s dual purposes rather than its mandate for disclosure is nothing short of a dramatic revision of the intent underlying the Act as well as of fifteen years of judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">II. SIGNIFICANCE OF LATER CONGRESSIONAL ACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">A. <em>The Government in the Sunshine Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"ahg-dedup-0\">The majority in <em>Jordan </em>supported its interpretation of the meaning of Exemption 2 by reference to the action of the House of Representatives in enacting a provision identical to the wording of Exemption 2 as part of the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> <em>Jordan </em>stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-8\">The position of this Court in <em>Vaughn II </em>has recently been vindicated by the action of the House of Representatives itself in passing the \u201cGovernment in the Sunshine Act of 1976.\u201d Professor Davis has recently suggested the relevance of the Sunshine Act to interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-9\">The Freedom of Information Act, Advisory Committee Act, Privacy Act, and Government in the Sunshine Act all deal with the subject matter of openness of records and of meetings. Each of the four statutes has its own function. Each provision of each statute may be interrelated to one or more provisions of the other statutes. Furthermore, the various statutes often use language that is identical with the language of another statute. The meaning of that language may depend not only on legislative history and interpretations with respect to the language of the one statute, but it may depend upon legislative history and interpretations with respect to the identical language that is used in one of the other statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">Of course, Professor Davis is correct, for it is a well established principle that courts may look to subsequent legislation as an aid in the interpretation of prior legislation dealing with the same or similar subject matter. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall stated the principle that, if it can be gathered from a subsequent statute <em>in pari materia </em>what meaning the legislature attached to the words of a former statute, this will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">Applying this principle, it is highly significant that the Government in the Sunshine Act, enacted in 1976, carries over verbatim most of the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act, including the specific language of Exemption 2. Thus, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(2) exempts from the Act\u2019s open meeting requirement portions of meetings likely to \u201crelate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d <em>The House Report to the Sunshine Act gives the same narrow interpretation to this exemption as the Senate did in 1965:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-13\">(2) This exemption includes meetings relating solely to an agency\u2019s internal personnel rules and practices. It is intended to protect the privacy of staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>members and to cover the handling of strictly internal matters. <em>It does not include discussions or information dealing with agency policies governing employees\u2019 dealings with the public, such as manuals or directives setting forth job functions or procedures. </em>As is the case with all of the exemptions, a closing or withholding permitted by this paragraph should not be made if the public interest requires otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-6\">It thus appears that by 1976 the House of Representatives had repudiated the sweeping language concerning Exemption 2 contained in its 1966 report on the Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">The majority\u2019s only response is to \u201cnote that we do not find it particularly significant that Congress enacted in 1976 a provision in the Government in Sunshine Act identically worded to Exemption 2 of FOIA. ...\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This is remarkable given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>that the Senate Report to the Sunshine Act expressly noted the relationship: \u201cThis wording parallels the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2). This exemption does not include directions to agency personnel concerning their responsibility vis a vis the public, such as manuals explaining job functions.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> If both the Senate and the House thought that FOIA Exemption 2 covered instruction manuals, is it conceivable that they would use exactly the same language in the Sunshine Act Exemption 2, which quite clearly does not extend to such manuals? Obviously the answer must be no. Yet under the majority\u2019s interpretation <em>either the two identically worded exemptions have precisely opposite meanings </em>or else <em>the Sunshine Act Exemption 2 would have to be interpreted in a manner contradictory to the unequivocal intent expressed in both committee reports. </em>Either result is absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Rather than attempt to contradict this aspect of the <em>Jordan </em>opinion, the majority misconstrues the argument: \u201cWe cannot follow the suggestion in <em>Jordan . . . </em>that the House, in an entirely different act, repudiated its understanding of a provision in FOIA. Had the House meant to invest Exemption 2 in FOIA with a different meaning, it would have done so at any of the several times Congress amended FOIA.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> This reflects a failure to consider a basic principle of statutory construction which, as <em>Jordan </em>indicated, dates back to the beginning of the American judicial system. The point is that a clear statement by Congress of the meaning of a statutory phrase sheds considerable light on what Congress intended when it used that phrase in an earlier statute. What we have here are <em>four committee reports on one specific statutory phrase, three of which are in basic agreement. </em>By opting for the interpretation contained in the first (and second) Senate Report, <em>the House in 1976 indicated that it agreed that FOIA Exemption 2 did not extend to instruction manuals. </em>Thus it is not a question of investing Exemption 2 with a new meaning, it is one of explaining what Exemption 2 meant in the first place. The majority does not respond to this argument because no response is possible. Congress\u2019 act in 1976 is clear evidence that <em>Jordan </em>was correct and that the majority here is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">B. <em>Section (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-10\">Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion also relies on the congressional intent he derives from the 1974 amendments to the FOIA, one of which revised Exemption 7 to provide that records need not be disclosed if they are \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would . . . disclose investigative techniques and procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The majority points out that the purpose of this amendment was to \u201cforce the courts to follow the <em>original </em>in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>tent of Congress in enacting FOIA.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> It then draws the conclusion that the 1974 amendment showed that Congress wanted to protect law enforcement information, and that since the amendment was characterized as merely embodying Congress\u2019 original intent, Congress necessarily must have desired Exemption 2 also to protect law enforcement manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">This argument has several grave defects. First, the majority has stated the history of the 1974 amendments so as to make it seem to have been motivated by a desire to protect law enforcement information. In fact, the direct opposite is true: <em>the 1974 amendments were a response to broad judicial construction of the exemptions. The motivating pressures to amend were thus in favor of more disclosure. </em>Congress\u2019 purpose in 1974 was to <em>limit </em>the law enforcement exemption, not strengthen it, as witness what happened precisely to Exemption 7 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Moreover, there is no necessary connection between a congressional intent to protect law enforcement information under Exemption 7 and a similar intent under Exemption 2. As one commentator has declared, \u201cThe fact that Congress decided to protect information on investigatory techniques used in specific investigations does not imply that Congress wished to protect all such information regardless of the context in which it arose.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The majority tries to counter this by finding that Exemptions 2 and 7 necessarily go together: \u201cIt would be inconsistent to no small degree to hold that Exemption 2 would not bar the disclosure of investigatory techniques when contained in a manual restricted to internal use, but that Exemption 7(E) would exempt the release of such techniques if contained in an \u2018investigatory record.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">Far from being \u201cinconsistent to no sm\u00e1ll degree,\u201d such a construction is perfectly logical. Indeed, Senator Hart, the primary sponsor of the 1974 amendment to Exemption 7, introduced during the floor debates a report of a key bar association committee which explains why <em>only </em>techniques in investigative records should be exempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-13\">The fear that disclosure of investigative technique <em>in general </em>will hinder an agency\u2019s operations appears to be illusory. The methods used for such investigations are widely known and relatively limited in type and scope. The realistic problems are those we have already met \u2014 the need to preserve the identity of sources of information <em>in particular cases, </em>the need to assure an impartial trial and to protect reasonable personal privacy.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATCT\">Not only does this indicate that Exemption 7(E) is compatible with the <em>Jordan </em>interpretation of Exemption 2, it provides yet another independent opinion that Exemption 2 does not apply generally to investigatory techniques; if this had been the reasonable explanation, surely the bar committee or some other observer would have discussed the relationship between the two exemptions.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> They did not for the simple reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>that Exemption 2 was not considered a law enforcement exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">The relationship between Exemptions 2 and 7 ultimately proves precisely the opposite of the majority\u2019s argument. I have shown why it is logical to exempt specific investigatory records while allowing disclosure of general investigatory techniques; the majority has not and, I submit, cannot show why Exemption 7(E) is necessary at <em>all </em>if Exemption 2 works to exempt all information regarding investigatory techniques. Under the court\u2019s holding today, all such information can be withheld because it is necessarily internal and has the possibility of allowing circumvention of the law. Accordingly, Exemption 7(E) is redundant, and Congress need not have bothered with a long and heated debate on its amendment. That Congress did so bother suggests that it saw Exemption 7(E) as the chief source of protection for law enforcement information and Exemption 2 as unrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">III. CASE LAW ON EXEMPTION 2</p>\n<p id=\"A4l\">A. <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">In <em>Rose </em>the Supreme Court quoted extensively from this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Vaughn II </em>and decided that the Senate Report should prevail over the House Report in resolving the facts of that case. As Judge Edwards states, <em>\u201cRose </em>left open the question that faces us in the present case.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> He goes on to assert that \u201cthe Supreme Court considered as substantial the argument that Exemption 2 might be construed to cover internal agency materials where disclosure might risk circumvention of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> It is true that the Supreme Court deliberately avoided deciding the issue, but the opinion in no way implied that the Court would come out as this court has today. On the contrary, as one commentator. has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-10\"><em>Rose, </em>while stopping short of applying the <em>Vaughn </em>rationale to law enforcement cases, nonetheless endorsed that reasoning. Even if <em>Rose </em>did not mandate applying the Senate Report to cases involving law enforcement information, the logic of <em>Rose </em>supports such an application.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">And, as noted earlier, <em>Rose </em>specifically adopted <em>Vaughn </em>II\u2019s narrow reading of the words of Exemption 2 rather than Judge Leventhal\u2019s construction, revived today by the majority, of the word \u201csolely\u201d as meaning \u201cpredominantly.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Thus although <em>Rose </em>did not decide the issue before us today, its logic and reasoning are directly in accord with the <em>Jordan </em>majority opinion which has now been repudiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">B. <em>D.C. Circuit Case Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">There is not much that need be said here. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Vaughn II </em>and its en banc decision in <em>Jordan </em>completely repudiated the House Report in favor of the Senate Report. The subsequent panel decision in <em>Cox v. United States Department of Jus</em>tice,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> was an attempt by the two dissenters in <em>Jordan </em>to distinguish <em>Jordan </em>in a manner utterly inconsistent with the specific hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>ing of the case.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> And the decisions in <em>Lesar v. United States Department of Just</em>ice<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and <em>Alien v. CIA</em><footnotemark><em>86</em></footnotemark><em> </em>both relied on <em>Jordan </em>and in no way indicated that its reasoning was faulty. The majority\u2019s assertion that <em>Lesar\u2019s </em>\u201clogic and even result . . . seem at odds with that in <em>Jordan </em>\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> cannot survive a fair reading of <em>Lesar. </em>The symbols used in FBI records unquestionably were solely of internal significance for administrative convenience and were routine \u201cminor or trivial matters\u201d of no public interest.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> <em>Jordan, </em>in contrast, involved matters of substantive agency policy that clearly were of substantial public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">C. <em>Case Law In Other Circuits</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGq\">From the majority\u2019s presentation of the Exemption 2 decisions of other circuits one would think that its position had the overwhelming support of the existing case law. Judge Edwards does admit at the end of the discussion that the case law on Exemption 2 is \u201cscattered,\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> a rather unusual word to describe a situation <em>in which the circuits are split four to two against his position on the issue. </em>He goes on to state that \u201c[i]t is important to note, however, that every circuit that has considered the issue, except the District of Columbia in <em>Jordan, </em>has held that FOIA does not mandate the release of investigatory manuals where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> This perhaps better than any other part of the opinion exemplifies the approach to this case taken by the majority \u2014 what matters to them is that their <em>result </em>be consistent with that in other circuits, even if many of those cases relied on a rationale that their own opinion repudiates!</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">That is precisely what has happened in this case. (The majority states that \u201c[w]e are also concerned that every other circuit considering the issue has barred the mandatory release of these materials, whether through the use of Exemption 2 or section (a)(2)(C).\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> It thus finds significance in the fact that the <em>Sixth and Eighth Circuits </em>have found that section (a)(2)(C) exempts law enforcement manuals from disclosure\u2014 even though these courts <em>explicitly repudiated the analysis of Exemption 2 adopted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number><em>today </em>and agreed with the analysis set forth in <em>Jordan </em>and even though Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion <em>expressly rejects their interpretation of section (a)(2)(C). </em>This truly is a new step in our jurisprudence. \u25a0 Reliance is placed upon a decision merely because it reaches the same result, even though it is based on an absolutely contradictory analysis of the issues.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">What should of course be clear is that the only relevance of these precedents is what they say about the meaning of Exemption 2. An analysis of this issue demonstrates not merely a split in the circuits, but that prior to today\u2019s decision <em>four circuits </em>had found that Exemption 2 exempts only minor housekeeping matters, while <em>only two circuits </em>had held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">The Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have all ruled that Exemption 2 does not apply to instruction manuals. In <em>Hawkes v. Internal Revenue </em>Service<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> the Sixth Circuit found that the Senate and House Reports could not be reconciled and that the Senate Report should be given effect. In a holding similar to that of <em>Jordan, </em>the court ruled that Exemption 2 relates \u201conly to the employee-employer type concerns upon which the Senate Report focused.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> This decision was relied upon by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Stokes v. Brennan</em><footnotemark><em>95</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which required disclosure of a training manual for safety and health officials.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> And the Eighth Circuit relied on <em>Vaughn II, Rose, </em>and <em>Jordan </em>in two opinions adopting the interpretation contained in the Senate Report and holding that Exemption 2 does not exempt law enforeement manuals.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-20\">Prior to today\u2019s decision, therefore, the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and District of Columbia Circuits had all ruled that the Senate Report should prevail over the House Report and that Exemption 2 relates only to routine employment matters. The opposite conclusion has been reached by two circuits, the Second and Ninth. The major decision was <em>Caplan v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms,</em><footnotemark><em>98</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which, as Judge Edwards notes, \u201crelied heavily on language in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Rose.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Moreover, the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion makes clear that its decision was based primarily upon the policy consideration that \u201cindividuals embarked upon clandestine and illicit operations\u201d would be enabled through disclosure to frustrate government investigation.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The court\u2019s analysis of legislative history consisted solely of citing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Senate and House Reports, and its entire reasoning seems to be that the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to decide the issue in <em>Rose </em>left the Second Circuit \u201cfree to give weight to the House Report.\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> The major independent commentary on law enforcement manuals and Exemption 2 concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">the <em>Caplan </em>opinion\u2019s reasoning is suspect. Based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to proscribe use of the House Report in the interpretation of exemption 2 in all cases, <em>the court apparently concluded that it need not justify its preference for the House interpretation of the exemption over that of the State. </em>The opinion thus failed to deal with the arguments for preferring the Senate Report advanced in <em>Vaughn . . . </em>.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"avc-dedup-0\">Thus while <em>Caplan </em>is precedent in support of the majority opinion today, its reasoning is not at all persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">The same is true of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Hardy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; </em>Firearms.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> The <em>Hardy </em>court engaged in even less analysis of legislative history than <em>Caplan. </em>Like <em>Caplan </em>and the majority opinion today, <em>Hardy\u2019s </em>approach was explicitly result-oriented. The court noted that five circuits had refused to release similar materials but that three different rationales were employed; its response was simply to pick which of the three it preferred, without engaging in any substantial analysis of the background of the FOIA. Indeed, the court did not feel that it needed even to acknowledge that the <em>Caplan </em>interpretation of Exemption 2 was a minority view, rejected by four other circuits. The reason was that, like the majority today, it felt that reaching the preferred result was all that mattered.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">In sum, even after today\u2019s decision, the circuits are completely split on the meaning of Exemption 2. Only if one accepts the majority\u2019s result-oriented approach can one find it significant that no circuit has yet found that a law enforcement manual must be disclosed. The issue before us is Exemption 2. In rejecting the <em>Jordan </em>rationale, this court will not create a greater consistency among the circuits, but rather will further increase the division that currently exists. If this precedent has any meaning at all, it is that <em>Jordan </em>should have been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">IV. THE MAJORITY\u2019S NEW TEST</p>\n<p id=\"Adz\">The majority today holds that \u201cif a document for which disclosure is sought meets the test of \u2018predominant internality,\u2019 and if disclosure significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes, then Exemption 2 exempts the material from mandatory disclosure.\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark> This standard\u2014 which is contrary to the standard specifically adopted in Rose<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> \u2014 is drawn primarily from Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurring opinions in <em>Vaughn II </em>and <em>Jordan. </em>As Judge Leven-thal saw it, the distinction was between documents that were for predominantly internal purposes and documents that were of legitimate public interest. The majority adopts this test but then immediately asserts that \u201cit is not for the courts to determine when disclosure is in the public inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>est.\u201d <footnotemark>107</footnotemark> This latter statement is certainly right, and it may be possible to avoid this kind of judicial policymaking if the <em>Rose </em>and <em>Jordan </em>approaches are followed and the inquiry is limited by a clear line as to whether the materials are related <em>solely </em>to internal personnel rules and practices. As <em>Rose </em>found, quoting with approval from <em>Vaughn II, </em>the line drawn \u201c \u2018between minor or trivial matters and those more substantial matters which might be the subject of legitimate public interest ... is a standard, a guide, which an agency and then a court, if need be, can apply with some certainty, consistency and clarity\u2019 . ...\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">In contrast, there is simply no way to employ a fuzzy standard of \u201cpredominant internality\u201d without introducing enormous discretion for judges to make their own assessments of the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d If something is predominantly internal, it therefore has only a limited impact on the public. But this can be determined only if the court makes a value judgment that the public has no important interest in disclosure \u2014 -a judgment which this court has repeatedly held has already been made by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Moreover, the two parts of the majority\u2019s test \u2014 both of which must be satisfied if the documents are to be withheld \u2014 contradict one another. If certain materials satisfy the test of \u201cpredominant internality,\u201d meaning they do not have a substantial external impact, how can their disclosure result in circumvention of agency regulations? It makes no sense to suggest that a member of the public could evade the law by acquiring documents which have no external impact on the public. If the information disclosed is important enough and of the type to permit persons to circumvent the law, it by definition must have a direct external impact on the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">It is thus apparent that the majority\u2019s standard actually can <em>never </em>be met: a document cannot <em>both </em>be predominantly internal <em>and </em>lead to circumvention of agency regulations, it can only be one or the other. Since the two standards contradict one another, the judge must choose between them. For the majority the choice is clear: the circumvention standard is the crucial one, while the \u201cpredominant internality\u201d standard is simply manipulated to support the desired result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">This is made clear by the lengths to which the majority goes in attempting to find that the BATF manual at issue here has only a predominantly internal effect. Judge Edward\u2019s opinion asserts that \u201c[t]he instructions to BATF agents contained in the BATF manual are not written to regulate the public.\u201d Instead, he claims, it \u201cconsists <em>solely </em>of instructions to agency personnel. There is no attempt to modify or regulate public behavior \u2014 only to observe it for illegal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> To find the majority arguing fervently that instructions on covert surveillance techniques for federal agents to use on members of the public do not have an external impact is astonishing. Have my colleagues been asleep for the past ten years while controversy has raged over the investigative practices of the FBI and CIA? Have they failed to observe the controversy over the BATF itself which has been brewing in the past few months, a controversy centering specifically on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>tactics. used by BATF agents? <footnotemark>110</footnotemark> This is not merely a case in which \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices have ... a tiny ripple effect outside their area of prime impact.\u201d <footnotemark>111</footnotemark> <em>On the contrary these instructions have an absolutely direct and substantial impact on members of the public.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">The distinction drawn between regulating or modifying public behavior and observing it is ludicrous. Do my colleagues mean to say that if this BATF manual contained instructions on how to use illegal bugging techniques to spy on members of the public they would still find that it was of only predominantly internal concern, since all that would be going on is mere \u201cobservation\u201d? If, on the other hand, this manual instructed agents on how to make arrests, would my colleagues thereby allow it to be disclosed because this constitutes a \u201cmodification\u201d of public behavior, even though disclosure clearly could result in circumvention of the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">This is not merely a hypothetical example. Both <em>Caplan </em>and <em>Hardy, </em>the two precedents on which the majority relies heavily, involved a request for a BATF manual entitled \u201cRaids and Searches.\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The district judge in <em>Caplan </em>\u201cfound that the withheld portions of the pamphlet in issue included descriptions of the <em>equipment used by agents in making raids, </em>the <em>methods of gaining entry to buildings </em>used by law breakers, factors relating to the <em>timing of raids, </em>and the <em>techniques used by suspects to conceal contraband.\u201d </em><footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Surely the majority would not contend that such techniques are mere forms of \u201cobservation\u201d rather than methods of \u201cmodifying\u201d public behavior. Surely there is not a more direct and extreme form of government regulation of the public than breaking into a building and searching persons suspected of criminal activity. But the majority would have to deny this unless it would decide <em>Caplan </em>and <em>Hardy </em>differently, ruling that disclosure is required because the documents in question involve regulation and modification of public behavior and therefore is not predominantly internal. I cannot believe my colleagues intend to reach such a result, but to avoid it they would have to repudiate the very standard they create today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">This example makes clear that the distinction proposed by the majority is untenable. Presumably it has been used as a means of buttressing the decision to disclose this particular manual and of appearing to place some limits on the breadth of Exemption 2. But I suspect that it is sufficient for the majority that this can be called a \u201claw enforcement manual\u201d and that these are instructions to agency personnel. Pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>sumably the BATF and similar agencies will in the future not make the mistake of disclosing a substantial part of their manuals, as the BATF did here, but will rather withhold everything remotely relating to how agency personnel conduct their jobs, at least where those personnel are responsible for enforcing some law or regulation \u2014 a large category indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">Of course this does not mean that Exemption 2 will always be applied by this court. This new standard leaves this court with enormous discretion in defining what constitutes a sufficient risk of circumvention of agency regulations and what is predominantly internal, thus enabling the court to pick and choose those documents it wants disclosed and those it wants withheld. Predictably, this judicially discretionary standard may become popular with judges who prefer these public policy choices to be made by courts and not the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">V. THE MAJORITY\u2019S ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH THE RESULT IN <em>JORDAN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">After repudiating the rationale of <em>Jordan, </em>Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion goes on to assert that the result there would be \u201cidentical under the test we announce today.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The majority attempts to support this assertion first by noting that no finding had been made in <em>Jordan </em>that disclosure would risk circumvention of the law. As Judge Ginsburg forthrightly acknowledges in her concurring opinion, however, there is no basis for the implication that release of the documents in <em>Jordan </em>would not help individuals evade detection by law enforcement agents.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> On the contrary <em>Jordan </em>specifically noted that the Justice Department had warned of the pernicious consequences that would result from disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-12\">Public disclosure of these materials would alert members of the public to those situations, persons, and offenses for which prosecution is withheld, selectively applied, or disposed of by pre-trial diversion. Individuals could then successfully exploit these policies by committing crimes within these select categories, thereby escaping prosecution. For example, publication of a policy of non-prosecution (or prosecution at a lesser degree of seriousness) for possession of certain quantities of specific narcotic drugs would serve only to encourage dealers and users of narcotics to carry lesser quantities of the drug than those specified in our guidelines.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">Not content to rely on the circumvention distinction, the majority goes on to assert that the materials in <em>Jordan </em>are distinguishable because they were a source of \u201csecret law,\u201d and thus were related to regulation of the members of the public. In contrast, it asserts, the manual in this case relates only to observing public behavior rather than modifying or regulating it.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>find this distinction preposterous. As Judge Ginsburg notes in her concurring opinion, the prosecutorial guidelines in <em>Jordan </em>also did not inform citizens as to how to conduct their activities in conformance with statutory requirements, they simply described how government prosecutors go about enforcing the law.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> As one commentator put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-4\">The reasons behind requiring the disclosure of \u201csecret law\u201d \u2014 giving members of the public full knowledge of their rights and obligations under the substantive law of the federal government \u2014 are inapplicable to enforcement guidelines at issue in Jordan. The guidelines do not inform members of the public of their rights under the law, but rather, their chances of evading the consequences for breaking the law.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">This attempt to reinterpret <em>Jordan </em>as hinging upon the existence of \u201csecret law\u201d is startling, given that only Judge Bazelon saw fit to raise the point in the <em>Jordan </em>decision. And the attempt to preserve Jordan on this basis is the final and clearest evidence of the majority\u2019s willingness to ignore precedent in implementing its preferred result. Not willing to refute the <em>Jordan </em>rationale directly or to reverse the decision completely, this court has determined to hold that a three-year-old en banc decision was based on a ground that only one out of nine members of the court thought important enough even to mention at the time. So much for the binding weight of our en banc decisions, so much for the respect earned and deserved by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion for the court expressly repudiates the rationale of the <em>Jordan </em>majority. In this dissent I have argued that the majority\u2019s construction of the language and legislative history of Exemption 2 is erroneous and that the interpretation adopted by the five-judge majority in <em>Jordan </em>should prevail. In conclusion it is worth reiterating a most remarkable fact about Judge Edwards\u2019 opinion: he repudiates the rationale of the <em>Jordan </em>opinion without refuting or even addressing its critical bases. Why doesn\u2019t the majority refute or offer an alternative to the <em>Jordan </em>majority\u2019s definition of \u201cpersonnel\u201d in Exemption 2? Why doesn\u2019t it challenge or even cite the many commentators who argue, along with the <em>Jordan </em>majority, that the House Report constituted an abuse of legislative history and that its interpretation of Exemption 2 should be disregarded in favor of the interpretation contained within the Senate report? Why doesn\u2019t the majority challenge or offer any. contrary evidence to <em>Jordan\u2019s </em>finding that the House Report was concocted as an effort to placate the Justice Department without having to go through the appropriate process of amending the language of Exemption 2? And why doesn\u2019t it explain why Congress used the same language in Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act as in the FOIA? (When this court is presented with a Sunshine Act Exemption 2 case, will it follow today\u2019s interpretation of the language, thereby rejecting the express intent of Congress declared in <em>both </em>committee reports? Or will it follow the two committee reports and read the exemption very narrowly, thus holding that Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act and Exemption 2 of the FOIA \u2014 identically worded provisions in two statutes enacted for the same fundamental purpose \u2014 have directly contradictory meanings?)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">Surely if the rationale of a three-year old majority opinion for an en banc court is to be discarded, there is an obligation on the part of the new majority to challenge directly and refute the analysis of the exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>ing opinion. Yet the court essentially ignores <em>Jordan\u2019s </em>majority opinion during its lengthy discussion of the legislative history, stating that \u201c[t]he legislative history of Exemption 2 has been recounted by this court in <em>[Jordan </em>and <em>Vaughn II],\u201d </em>but that \u201cbecause the case before us was heard <em>en banc, </em>and because the outcome of the case turns on congressional intent as expressed in the legislative history, we feel that the history merits a fresh review.\u201d <footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Quite obviously neither of these \u201creasons\u201d explains at all why a \u201cfresh review\u201d is necessary. The fact that this case turns on an interpretation of the legislative history is not a sufficient reason for ignoring a dispositive en banc interpretation of that history; precisely to the contrary, the very purpose of determining issues en banc is to set forth binding precedents for the future. And the fact that this case was heard en banc certainly does not imply that the work of a previous en banc court can be readily discarded. This is especially true given that the majority has not based its reversal on any new evidence bearing on the meaning of Exemption 2, but has rather just rehashed the same evidence that was before the <em>Jordan </em>court in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">The true explanation unfortunately is all too evident from the majority\u2019s opinion. A \u201cfresh review\u201d is undertaken \u2014 no matter at what sacrifice to logic, our own precedent, or specific congressional action in 1966, 1974, and 1976 \u2014 because applying the <em>Jordan </em>rationale would lead to a result disfavored by the majority. This explains why some of the judges who sat in <em>Jordan </em>so casually have altered their positions in only three years. <em>None </em>of them saw fit three years ago to echo Judge Bazelon\u2019s concern about \u201csecret law\u201d; now they agree it was central to the <em>Jordan </em>decision. The rest of <em>Jordan </em>lies in shambles: the dissenting opinion\u2019s major argument there remains decisively rejected; the \u201cpublic interest\u201d test which was crucial to Judge Leventhal\u2019s concurring opinion has been rejected, thus rendering his approach unworkable; and the majority opinion has been repudiated. Yet these judges are content to see these opinions they once joined rejected, because today\u2019s decision promises to support the result they prefer as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">I also prefer that result as a matter of policy, but Congress did not agree in 1966 or in 1976, and it is not my place or that of my colleagues to amend Congress\u2019 work.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> My colleagues have made much of the fact that they find it hard to believe Congress would have intended to allow FOIA to impede law enforcement activities. The answer to that position was given by the Supreme Court in <em>TVA v. Hill,</em><footnotemark><em>122</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was similar to this case in that it involved another extremely powerful statute, the Endangered Species Act, that mandated a foolish result, the enjoining of the operation of a virtually completed dam in order to save a small number of three-inch fish. Chief Justice Burger noted the strong argument that \u201cthe burden on, the public through the loss of millions of unrecoverable dollars would greatly outweigh the loss of the snail darter,\u201d but he responded that \u201cneither the Endangered Species Act nor Art. Ill of the Constitution provides federal courts with authority to make such fine utilitarian calculations.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">This principle applies with equal force here. Respect for the acts of Congress cannot be an on-again off-again affair. It is not for this court to correct the errors Congress has made, no matter how egregious they might be.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> There is underway in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>Congress an effort to rewrite substantially the Freedom of Information Act, including the problems under Exemption 2 which were recognized but not solved in 1966. As a policy matter, I hope the Congress does a complete job of revision, but as a judge I can never join in the rewriting of this or any other law by this court.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>My colleagues\u2019 concern, expressed both in the majority opinion and in Judge Mikva\u2019s concurring opinion,, that \u201cabsurd\u201d results would occur if the <em>Jordan </em>rationale were applied to this and similar cases bespeaks a lack of confidence in the ability of Congress to overcome its prior mistakes. The recent experience regarding a case similar to the one before us shows this view to be mistaken. In <em>Long v. Bureau of Economic Analysis, </em><footnotemark>126</footnotemark> the Ninth Circuit ruled that plaintiffs were entitled under the FOIA to receive copies of computer tapes prepared by the Internal Revenue Service for use with its Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program, a program designed to aid the IRS in enforcing the income tax laws. When the decision was announced, the Government argued forcefully that release of the data would enable income tax evaders to circumvent the law. While disclosure was stayed pending Supreme Court review, Congress acted swiftly. It attached to a major bill a provision stating that no provision of law \u201cshall be construed to require the disclosure of standards used or to be used for the selection of returns for examination, or data used or to be used for determining such standards, if the Secretary [of the Treasury] determines that such disclosure will seriously impair assessment, collection, or enforcement under the internal revenue laws.\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> The Supreme Court subsequently vacated and remanded <em>Long </em>for reconsideration in light of the new provision.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> Surely this is the preferable way of correcting policy mistakes. Congress responded directly to the policy problem and cleared up the ambiguity that had previously existed. The courts were left to construing the law, not determining what it should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">The test of a defender of free speech is his willingness to defend the right to speak of a person with whom he emphatically disagrees. The test of a judge who has taken an oath to uphold the law is the objectivity with which he interprets and enforces laws of which he thoroughly disapproves. By trying to implement their own vision of appropriate policy, in this case attempting to find a \u201ccompromise\u201d between what they perceive as conflicting policy goals, my colleagues have adopted an approach which can only diminish public confidence in the work of our court.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1157-20\">. 591 F.2d 753 (D.C.Cir.1978) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">. <em>Jordan, </em>591 F.2d at 763.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">.

Maj. op. at 1062 n.30. Apparently unsatisfied with the majority opinion\u2019s failure to respond directly to the Sunshine Act arguments, Judge Mikva makes three responses. First, he complains of \u201cthe debatable wisdom of construing legislation that is not now before the court.\u201d Concurring opinion of Judge Mikva at 1087 n.1. The answer is that consideration of the Sunshine Act is important because it has a direct bearing on the meaning of the words used in Exemption 2 of the FOIA: \u201c[I]f a subsequent act on the same subject affords complete demonstration of the legislative sense of its own language, the rule which has been stated, requiring that the subsequent should be incorporated into the foregoing act, is a direction to courts in expounding the provisions of the law.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Alexandria, </em>9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 1, 7, 3 L.Ed. 19 (1809) (Marshall, C. J.). Judge Mikva\u2019s response is that Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act is unhelpful because its language \u201cis invoked in entirely different contexts.\u201d Concurring opinion of Judge Mikva at 1087 n.1. But the FOIA and the Sunshine Act are anything but \u201centirely different.\u201d Both are disclosure statutes designed for the same basic purpose; the drafters of the Sunshine Act clearly recognized the close similarity when they modeled it after the FOIA. Judge Mikva\u2019s third and final point evinces a willingness to conclude that the Sunshine Act Exemption 2 <em>does </em>cover job function manuals, <em>even though both committee reports say precisely the contrary. See id. </em>By asking whether Congress \u201ctruly\u201d intended to open meetings discussing investigative manuals he apparently suggests an entirely subjective test under which committee reports can be safely ignored. Indeed, he suggests as much elsewhere in the opinion by asking, \u201cMay not judicial notice be taken of the fact that committee reports are often authored entirely by staff members, and that in the rush and flurry of events active congressmen may never have an opportunity to read these reports at all?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1088. In a case of clear legislative mistake I might agree, but that is not the case here since the Senate Report is consistent with all the testimony before the Senate committee. In my view, Judge Mikva\u2019s attempt to obtain a \u201creasonable perspective on the legislative process,\u201d <em>id., </em>is dangerously unconstrained and invites judges to ignore the objective evidence in front of them about what Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">Judge MacKinnon also responds to the Sunshine Act arguments. He begins by asserting that \u201cthe statutory provisions of the Sunshine Act which precede Exemption 2 provide that agency meetings are open \u2018Except in cases where the agency finds that the public interest requires otherwise\u2019 ... 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c). This statutory provision provides an obvious basis for an agency to refuse to disclose law enforcement matter that would permit law violators to evade detection.\u201d Concurring opinion of Judge MacKinnon at 1084: This reading of the statute is simply wrong. Section 552b(b) provides that meetings shall be open except as provided in subsection (c), which lists exemptions; subsection (c) contains the further exception, however, that even if an exemption applies the agency may open the meeting if it finds that the public interest so requires. \u201c[Ejven if a matter falls within an exemption, the discussion must be open where the public interest so requires . . . . \u201d H.R.Rep.No.880, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1976). The \u201cpublic interest\u201d provision thus enables the agency to open a meeting which could be kept closed; it does not, as Judge MacKinnon asserts, provide a blanket public interest exception to the open meeting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">Judge MacKinnon then goes on to assert that my argument is undercut by the fact that Exemption 7 of the Sunshine Act would allow meetings to be closed if the BATF manual here were discussed. In particular he thinks that Sunshine Act Exemption 7(F), exempting law enforcement material that would \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel,\u201d would apply to the BATF manual. Consequently, he reasons, Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act would not have to be read to cover the manual. <em>Id. </em>at 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">I am at a complete loss in trying to comprehend the conclusion Judge MacKinnon draws from this: \u201c[Tjhe Sunshine Act can be said to be even more <em>specifically </em>protective of law enforcement matters than the Freedom of Infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>mation Act. The dissent\u2019s reliance on the Sunshine Act is accordingly groundless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1086 (emphasis in original). This conclusion is startling given that Exemption 7 of the FOIA provides <em>exactly </em>the same protection for law enforcement matters as does Sunshine Act Exemption 7: disclosure is not required where it might \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552b(c)(7)(A), \u201cdisclose investigative techniques and procedures,\" <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(E); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552b(c)(7)(E), or \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(F); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552b(c)(7)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">The Sunshine Act provides no more protection for law enforcement information than does the FOIA. Thus, if Exemption 7 of the Sunshine Act demonstrates that Exemption 2 of the Sunshine Act does not cover law enforcement manuals, then FOIA Exemption 7 demonstrates equally well that FOIA Exemption 2 does not cover law enforcement manuals. Indeed, I argue below that reading FOIA Exemption 2 as broadly as does the majority makes FOIA Exemption 7(E) entirely unnecessary. See p. 1111 <em>infra. </em>Perhaps Judge MacKinnon is correct that the BATF manual would have been exempt under the language of Exemption 7(F), but that issue is not before us because the Government did not, for whatever reason, choose to defend its refusal to disclose on the basis of Exemption 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">.

Throughout his concurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>Judge Mikva repeatedly asserts, without elaboration, that Congress could not have intended to permit disclosure of investigative manuals. He finds it \u201cpatent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1087, and \u201cirrefutable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1086, that Congress did not intend \u201csuch an absurd and unreasonable result,\u201d <em>id., </em>and he urges that this result would make \u201cscofflaws of the Congress, or at least some of its members,\u201d <em>id. </em>No explanation is given other than that Crooker \u201cis a federal prisoner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1086, and \u201can adjudged felon\u201d who seeks to use FOIA \u201cfor his own ends,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1090. Yet surely Judge Mikva is aware that the FOIA is available without exception to any person who seeks to invoke it; the fact that Crooker or any other information requester is a criminal is irrelevant to the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Apparently Judge Mikva feels qualified to decide when a statute\u2019s <em>policy </em>is erroneous and therefore invalid; the majority of the Supreme Court expressed the opposite view in <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>as noted above. And he also feels that it is unnecessary even to respond to arguments showing that the policy has a logical and reasonable basis. During the 1974 debates on amending the FOIA, Senator Hart introduced the argument that information on general investigative techniques need not be kept secret even though information on specific investigations should be made exempt. See p. 1110 &amp; note 77 <em>supra. </em>Judge Mikva has not attempted to counter this argument. Moreover, he declares that the BATF manual in question here falls in the category of trivial matters in which there is no public interest in disclosure, see concurring opinion of Judge Mikva at 1087, without commenting on the incontrovertible fact that the subject of investigative techniques of BATF agents is in fact one of heated public controversy and debate. <em>See </em>pp. 1115-1116 &amp; note 110 <em>supra. </em>Far from being absurd, then, disclosure of this manual might well contribute to the resolution of this public issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">More generally, Judge Mikva argues that the views of \u201cmany distinguished judges\u201d demonstrate that my analysis must be wrong. Concurring opinion of Judge Mikva at 1090. Although perhaps Judge Mikva believes that a mere mortal judge like myself should fall silent in the face of allegedly contrary views of judges who are distinguished, I venture to suggest that the many passages he cites are inapplicable to the facts of this case. I am in hearty agreement that courts should not reach ridiculous results, but I strongly disagree with Judge Mikva\u2019s apparent view that attempting to judge the reasonableness of a statute is the most basic principle of statutory construction. Judges should attempt to find the congressional intent by considering the objective evidence before them. Certainly they should use sound judgment in assessing that evidence, but only in rare and extreme circumstances should they override that evidence in order to implement a more reasonable, from their perspective, policy result. Judge Mikva appears to advocate frequent resort to his principle of judging what is reasonable policy and implementing the same. Indeed, in this case he has joined the majority in ignoring \u2014 not refuting, but simply ignoring \u2014 critical evidence concerning the actions of the House in preparing the House Report. <em>See </em>p. 1100 &amp; note 38 <em>supra. </em>The only conclusion I can reach is that determining what the \u201creasonable\u201d policy should be is, under the princi- \u25a0 pies of the majority, by far the overriding concern. I am confident that this is far from what Justices Frankfurter, Reed, Field, Harlan, and Brewer had in mind. <em>See </em>concurring opinion of Judge Mikva at 1089-1090.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"125\">\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">. Judge Mikva suggests that I am the one who seeks to legislate here and that by stating my personal views on the substantive policy matter at issue I have exceeded \u201cthe bounds of the judicial role.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 1090. By implying that I have reached my decision so as to cause Congress to reach a certain legislative result, Judge Mikva ignores the unequivocal record of my views on Exemption 2. In <em>Vaughn II </em>(1975), <em>Jordan </em>(1978), and again today (1981) I have adhered to a consistent interpretation of the meaning of the words and legislative history of Exemption 2. Those views lead inexorably to the result I would reach in this case. Had I been concerned about reaching a certain legislative result I never would have interpreted Exemption 2 as I did; for Judge Mikva now to imply that that is my goal is rather odd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Judge Mikva also implies that it is improper for a judge to state publicly his views on a matter of legislative policy. If so, this is a strikingly new conception of the judicial role. American judges have long spoken out on public issues, not only in articles and speeches, but in their judicial opinions as well. <em>See, e.g., Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 369, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2792, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Marshall, J., concurring) (\u201cAssuming knowledge of all the facts presently available regarding capital punishment, the average citizen would, in my opinion, find it shocking to his conscience and sense of justice.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 375, 92 S.Ct. at 2796 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (\u201cIf we were possessed of legislative power, I would either join with Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL or, at the very least, restrict the use of capital punishment to a small category of the most heinous crimes.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 405-06 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\u201cI yield to no one in the depth of my distaste, antipathy, and, indeed, abhorrence, for the death penalty ....

Indeed, it is ironic that Judge Mikva makes this criticism, since his own opinion expresses the unequivocal view that it would be absurd for a legislature to vote to permit disclosure of investigative manuals, a view disputed by arguments introduced by the late Senator Hart, one of the principals in the FOIA debate. <em>See </em>p. 1110 &amp; note 77 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"126\">\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">. 646 F.2d 1310 (9th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"127\">\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">.

Rose.\u201d </em>S.Rep.No. 1178, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1976) (conference report). It therefore is nonsense to argue that the Sunshine Act Report in any way reflects the reasoning advocated by Judge Leven-thal. Second, the argument that manuals of law enforcement instructions are not encompassed within \u201cdiscussions or information dealing with agency policies governing employees\u2019 dealings with the public, such as manuals or directives setting forth job functions or procedures,\u201d see concurring opinion of Judge Mac-Kinnon at 1081, is obviously implausible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
