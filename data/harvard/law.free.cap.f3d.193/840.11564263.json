He argues that the sentence must be vacated because the district court erred in sentencing him within the applicable guideline range after granting the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. We affirm Hashimoto\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Hashimoto was convicted in 1996 of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute and for conspiracy to launder money. His total offense level of 31 included an addition of two levels because Hashimoto was an organizer and supervisor of the drug trafficking. Combined with his Category I criminal history, Hash-imoto\u2019s guideline sentencing range was 108-135 months. However, because Hash-imoto was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten (10) years, the guideline range was revised to 120-135 months. Hashimoto objected to the two-level increase for his alleged role as a manager or supervisor. The objection was overruled. The district court then granted the government\u2019s motion for downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, based on Hashimoto\u2019s substantial assistance. It intended to depart downward ten percent (10%) from Hashi-moto\u2019s minimum sentence of 120 months, and thereby sentenced him to 108 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">On appeal, we found that the two-level enhancement for offense role did not apply. Hashimoto\u2019s original sentence was vacated and his case remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Hashimoto, </em>139 F.3d 898 (5th Cir.1998)(unpublished). At resentencing, the district court found that Hashimoto\u2019s guideline range was TO-ST months, based on a total offense level of 2T and a criminal history category I. The government again filed a motion for downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1. The district court again granted the motion. In its Statement of Reasons for imposing the T2-month sentence (Statement of Reasons), the district court noted that its previous departure had been 10% of the \u201cguideline sentence,\u201d presumably meaning the statutory minimum of 120 months, \u201cor about one offense level.\u201d Intending to duplicate that departure, the district court reduced the offense level to 26, producing a guideline sentence range of 63-T8 months. The court then sentenced Hashi-moto to T2 months. Hashimoto filed a motion to correct his sentence under Fed. R.Crim. P. 35(c). He contended that the first sentence had represented a 10% departure from the minimum guideline sentence of 120 months. But, despite the district court\u2019s stated effort to duplicate the prior result, the new T2-month sentence was not a 10% departure from the minimum guideline sentence of TO months. In fact, it was not a deviation from the sentencing range of T0-8T months at all. Hashimoto claimed this \u201cin effect, negates the granting of the 5K1.1 motion.\u201d Hashi-moto assumed that the district court had made an arithmetical error and asked that the sentence be revised to 63 months, which would have been a 10% departure from the minimum guideline sentence of TO months.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The district court denied Hashimoto\u2019s Rule 35(c) motion. It denied that an arithmetical error had been made. The district court explained the T2-month sentence by stating that it \u201cintended to reduce ten percent from the middle of the applicable [guideline sentencing] range, rather than the minimum of the range, taking into account the overall reduction in sentence the defendant received on resentencing.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The district court\u2019s reasoning in denying Hashimoto\u2019s motion to correct conflicts with its explanation in the Statement of Reasons that the resentence was designed to duplicate the departure represented by the vacated 108-month .sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Hashimoto appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 35(c) motion. He claims that, having granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for departure, the district court was required to impose a sentence which was below the low end of the original guideline range (70 months). By not doing so, he claims, it fails to follow its own order granting the departure, requiring reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">District courts have almost complete discretion to determine the extent of a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>51 F.3d 36, 41 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he decision as to the extent of the departure is committed to the almost complete discretion of the district court.\u201d). The only ground on which the defendant can appeal the extent of a departure is that the departure was a violation of law. <em>See id. </em>at 39 (\u201c[T]he district court has the discretion to choose the appropriate sentence within the applicable Guideline range, and to determine the appropriate extent of a departure; thus a defendant cannot appeal the extent of a departure made pursuant to section 5K1.1 unless the departure was made in violation of law.\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (West 1999) (limiting defendant\u2019s right to appeal his sentence to certain categories of cases, of which <em>Alvarez </em>found only \u201csentence imposed in violation of law\u201d applied to appeals of extent of downward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The district court <em>also </em>has almost complete discretion to deny the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Myers, </em>150 F.3d 459, 463 (5th Cir.1998). The refusal to depart downward can be reversed only if the refusal was in violation of law. <em>See United States v. Miro, </em>29 F.3d 194, 198-99 (5th Cir.1994) (expressly holding that jurisdiction over denial of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion exists only if in refusal is violation of law); <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1410 (5th Cir.1989) (establishing lack of jurisdiction in this situation).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Hashimoto does not allege that the district court\u2019s sentence was a violation of law. We would thus clearly lack jurisdiction over Hashimoto\u2019s case if he was challenging either 1) the extent of a departure that was made or 2) the denial of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. But Hashimoto does neither. Hashimoto admits that the district court granted his \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Thus our rule that we will not review the denial of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion does not apply. Hashimoto\u2019s assertion is that the trial court failed to follow its own order \u2014 that <em>it did not in fact grant a departure, </em>because it sentenced him within the applicable guideline range. The <em>Alvarez </em>holding that we lack jurisdiction to review the extent <em>of a departure </em>presumes that a departure has been made. If Hashimoto is correct that no departure has been made, <em>Alvarez </em>does not apply. We have not addressed this situation, in which the district court granted a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure, expressly stated that it was granting a departure pursuant to the motion, and yet handed down a sentence which was within the original sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">While Hashimoto does not support his assertion, he is correct that his 72-month sentence did not represent a downward departure under the guidelines. A departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 is a departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range. <em>See United States v. Faulks, </em>143 F.3d 133, 135-36 (3d Cir.1998) (holding that a sentence within the applicable sentencing range is not a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure and explaining \u201c[t]he departures provided for in Part K of the Guidelines manual are departures from \u2018the range established by the applicable guidelines\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (1998)(policy statement) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>(cited in <em>Faulks </em>and implying that departure is \u201csentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines\u201d). In this case, the district court\u2019s sentence of 72 months was within the sentencing guideline range of 70-87 months. It was therefore not a departure, and not a proper response to granting the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure. The district court used a flawed methodology in relying on reducing Hashimoto\u2019s offense level to accomplish a departure. Even though reducing the offense level clearly resulted in a reduced sentence, it did not ensure that the sentence was outside \u2014 and therefore a departure from \u2014 the guideline range of 70-87 months. Rather, the reduced offense level produced a new sentencing range (63-78 months) which overlapped with the original range (70-87 months), allowing the district court to choose a 72-month sentence which, although a 10% reduction from what it otherwise would have been, was not a departure from the original 70-87 month range, and therefore not consistent with its statement granting the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The district court erred. But we hold that its error does not require us to vacate Hashimoto\u2019s sentence. Hashimoto presents no case law in support of his position that reversal is required. He merely claims that this is an issue of first impression. But in <em>Faulks, </em>143 F.3d 133, the Third Circuit addressed this same situation. Defendant Faulks\u2019 original guideline range was 87 to 108 months. The district court granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, yet still sentenced Faulks to 95 months \u2014 within the original guideline range. The Third Circuit recognized the issue before it as whether \u201ca sentencing judge who has granted a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is powerless to impose a sentence within the guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136. <em>Faulks </em>accepted that the district court had erred in stating that it was granting the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure. <em>See supra; see also id. </em>at 135 (\u201cthere is an inconsistency between what the district court said and what it did\u201d). But it found the error \u201charmless\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 136 (\u201cWe conclude that the district court\u2019s statement that it was granting a departure should be regarded as harmless error, and we hold that it, accordingly, does not mandate a sentence below the guideline range.\u201d) The Third Circuit then held that the district court\u2019s sentence should stand because 1) the sentencing judge recognized his authority to depart below the guideline range and 2) there was no ambiguity about the intended sentence. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe conclude that this claim [that reversal was required] should be rejected where, as here, the record provides assurance that the sentencing judge recognized his authority to depart below the guideline range and there is no ambiguity about the intended sentence.\u201d). <em>Faulks </em>also relied on the fact that the district court was authorized to impose the sentence it in fact imposed. <em>See id. </em>at 137 (referencing fact that, under Third Circuit law, district court could have denied departure anyway).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">In this case, the district court clearly recognized its authority to depart from the statutory guidelines. The court\u2019s explanations of the 72-month sentence, while inconsistent, both reflect 1) an attempt to grant a departure for substantial assistance pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1; 2) an awareness of its discretion thereunder to reduce Hashimoto\u2019s sentence as much as it saw fit; 3) an explanation for the reduced sentence actually chosen. Thus, both reflect a recognition of the authority to depart from the guidelines. The sentence was also unambiguous. <em>See Faulks, 143 F.3d </em>at 137 (noting lack of ambiguity because court \u201clistened at great length\u201d to discussion of issue and \u201cclearly decided that it would warrant an in-range reduction but not a sentence below the guideline range\u201d). Finally, like the district court in <em>Faulks, </em>the district court here had the discretion to impose the sentence it in fact imposed. <em>See, e.g., supra; Myers, </em>150 F.3d at 463 (in Fifth Circuit, district court has discretion not to grant downward departure). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>cording to <em>Faulks, </em>the only authority on point, we should not disturb the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Moreover, in the Fifth Circuit, the district court\u2019s discretion in this general area is well established. <em>See supra; see also Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 91-99, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2043-47, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (discussing discretion due sentencing court and noting that departure decisions are generally reviewed at most for abuse of discretion). While Hashimoto\u2019s situation is novel, the general principle that we defer to a district court\u2019s sentencing decision clearly still applies. Particularly when the limited authority available supports upholding the sentence, we will not vacate it. The district court\u2019s denial of Hashimoto\u2019s Rule 35(c) motion is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. The district court\u2019s sentence did not actually represent a 10% departure from the minimum sentence for which Hashimoto was eligible. Once it granted the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for departure, the court could have reduced Hashimoto\u2019s sentence from the low end of the actual guideline range (108-135 months). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Underwood, </em>61 F.3d 306, 311 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that \u00a7 5K1.1 motion authorizes greater departure from statutory minimum sentence and lesser departure from guideline range and that extent of departure is entirely within district court\u2019s discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">. Hashimoto expressly disclaims vindictiveness as an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\">. Like the <em>Faulks </em>court, we encourage district court judges presented with this situation in the future to avoid confusion and achieve the same outcome by denying the government's motion for a departure and acknowledging the defendant's substantial assistance by sentencing lower in the guideline range than it otherwise would have. <em>See Faulks, 143 F.3d </em>at 136-37. This is well within the district court's discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
