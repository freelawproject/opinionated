Appellant DiGiorgio also claims the court erred in failing to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. We hold that \u201cransom\u201d as that term is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>used in the Sentencing Guidelines includes a demand for money the kidnappers believe is owed them and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s application of the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(1). In addition, we find no other sentencing error and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">In November 1994, Stephen Cavano and several of his associates were arrested during a drug sting operation. While in jail, the group identified Hugo Catano as a potential Government witness. From jail, Cavano sought to force Catano to pay $220,000 Cavano believed Catano owed him, to reveal the names of other Government witnesses, and to file a false affidavit regarding the charges against Cavano and his associates. In a series of telephone calls recorded between November 29,1994, and December 4, 1994, Cavano discussed his plans regarding Catano with Appellants DiGiorgio and Nocerino and his ex-wife, Suzanne Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">In one conversation between Cavano and Gordon, Cavano told her he was desperately trying to reach DiGiorgio and No-cerino because he heard Catano was leaving the country. Cavano told Gordon to \u201ctell Mattie [Nocerino] he\u2019s got to grab [Catano] and hold him.\u201d In another call, Cavano tells DiGiorgio \u201cwhat I need is I need help to grab them, grab this kid. This kid, regardless of anything else, or regardless of the position I am in right now, owes me and us, two hundred twenty thousand dollars. He, I do not want him to leave this country until that ... money is paid and he straightens this out.... I can give you a phone number where the, where, where we can work this out, but they must grab him ... and prevent him from leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">At DiGiorgio\u2019s sentencing, the Government and defense attorneys agreed that the jury\u2019s verdict was ambiguous as to what acts of racketeering the jury relied upon in reaching its guilty verdicts. The parties agreed, applying <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 994 (11th Cir.1997), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 119 S.Ct. 258, 142 L.Ed.2d 212 (1998), that the court should determine which acts were proven for sentencing purposes. The district court determined that while the Government had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that DiGiorgio conspired to murder, it had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that DiGiorgio conspired to kidnap Catano. The court therefore sentenced DiGiorgio under the Sentencing Guideline for kidnapping, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">In addition, the court found DiGiorgio intended to demand a ransom from Catano, and therefore assessed a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(1). The Court rejected DiGiorgio\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a three-level reduction because he had not completed all acts necessary to commit the crime, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(2), and rejected DiGiorgio\u2019s request for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">At Nocerino\u2019s sentencing, the court granted Nocerino\u2019s motion to adopt DiGiorgio\u2019s sentencing arguments. As it did for DiGiorgio, the court found the Government had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Nocerino had conspired to murder, but had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Nocerino conspired to kidnap Catano for ransom. The court therefore sentenced Nocerino under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1, and applied the six-level ransom enhancement of \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">The district court properly sentenced Appellants under the kidnapping guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1. Under both racketeering guidelines applicable to the offenses of conviction, the court is instructed to apply the greater of a given base offense level or \u201cthe offense level applicable to the underlying crime or racketeering activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.1(a)(2) (Guideline applicable to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962 conviction), \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(2) (Guideline applicable to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959 conviction). Because the jury\u2019s general verdict did not indicate which of the charged predicate acts it believed Appellants had committed, the district court was required to \u201cfind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant conspired to commit [a] particular object offense\u201d and sentence Appellants accordingly. <em>Ross, </em>131 F.3d at 994 (quoting <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>995 F.2d 1020, 1026 (11th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Here, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants were guilty of conspiracy to commit kidnapping as charged in Counts 1 and 6 of the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reviewing the sentencing court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error, <em>United States v. Howard, </em>923 F.2d 1500, 1503 (11th Cir.1991), we find the court did not clearly err in making such a finding based on the evidence presented at trial. Given the district court\u2019s factual findings, we conclude the court did not err in applying the kidnapping guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Moreover, the district court correctly. applied the six-level enhancement for a ransom demand found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(l). This appeal raises the issue of whether the definition of \u201cransom\u201d as used by the Sentencing Guidelines includes money the kidnapper believes is owed to him by the victim. We conclude that it does. Although \u201cransom\u201d is not defined by the Guidelines, we are bound to give the term its ordinary meaning. <em>United States v. Rutkowski, </em>814 F.2d 594, 599 (11th Cir.1987). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines ransom as \u201c[t]he money, price, or consideration paid or demanded for redemption of a kidnapped person or persons; a payment that releases from captivity.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1260 (6th ed.1990). Nothing in that definition excludes previously-owed money from qualifying as the \u201cpayment that releases from captivity.\u201d The only other circuit to directly address this issue agrees. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Posado, </em>112 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.1997) (expressly holding that a prior debt can be considered a ransom demand).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Appellants were correctly sentenced under the kidnapping guideline. In addition, the six-level enhancement for a ransom demand was appropriate since Appellants intended to kidnap their victim to force him to pay a debt owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1212-15\">. Appellant Nocernio also appeals his convictions, arguing they should be overturned because (1) the district court erred in denying his motion for severance, (2) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, (3) the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct, and (4) the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing. We affirm his convictions without discussion. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 36-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">. We note the district court declined to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants were guilty of conspiracy to murder as charged in Counts 1 and 6 of the indictment. Had the court made such a finding, Appellants would have been sentenced under the guidelines for murder, and their sentences would have undoubtedly been greater.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">. Appellants' final contentions are easily rejected. The district court was not required to adjust the sentence downward because the conspiracy was incomplete where, as here, the court found \u201cbut for apprehension or interruption by some similar event beyond [their] control\" Appellants would have completed the acts necessary to carry out the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(2). DiGiorgio\u2019s contention that the district court erred in failing to give him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 is negated by this Court's affirmance of the district court\u2019s determination that the Government proved the conspiracy to kidnap Catano beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
