Olson, as Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, was caught up in a separation of powers contest between the Congress and the Executive Branch and subjected, by an Independent Counsel appointed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq., </em>to a protracted investigation into the truthfulness of his Congressional testimony. Along the way, the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of the Independent Counsel provision of the Ethics in Government Act. <em>Morrison v. Olson, </em>487 U.S. 654, 108 S.Ct. 2597, 101 L.Ed.2d 569 (1988). The Independent Counsel exonerated Olson of any offense and, as authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act, he petitions the Special Division of the court to award him $1,259,072.69 in compensation for the attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred. We order an award of $861,589.28 in reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">I. \u201cBUT FOR\u201d ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The statute provides that \u201cthe division of the court <em>may, </em>if no indictment is brought ... award reimbursement for those reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred ... during that investigation which would not have been incurred <em>but for </em>the requirements of this chapter____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1) (emphasis added). If the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement is satisfied the court is called upon to exercise its judicial discretion in awarding reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. As the Senate Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">The court should award only that portion of the fees, if any, which it determines would not have been incurred in the absence of the special prosecutor law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ali\">S.Rep. 97-496, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 18 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, pp. 3537, 3554. The \u201cbut for\u201d requirement and the standard of reasonableness for attorneys\u2019 fees are discussed where relevant in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">Our opinion in <em>In Re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 984-986 Div. No. 85-1 at 1-5 (D.C.Cir. 1989), outlines the history of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and its progeny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The premise from which the Ethics Act springs is that the Department of Justice cannot, and cannot be perceived to, conduct a full and impartial investigation of allegations of criminal wrongdoing by high Executive Branch officials in the same administration that controls the Department of Justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Independent Counsel Act seeks to remedy the problem by providing a mechanism through which an investigation into allegations of criminal misconduct by high officials in the Executive Branch may b\u00e9 conducted in major respects \u201cseparate from and independent of the Department of Justice____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">In the 1982 Act, Congress first authorized the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by unindicted subjects of independent counsel investigations where, under normal Justice Department procedures, the subject would not have incurred such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">The 1982 remedial amendments provided, with some notable exceptions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>dependent counsel investigation should not commence where an ordinary Justice Department investigation would not be initiated,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that an unindicted subject of an independent counsel investigation may-recover the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees which he would not have incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the operation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">A. <em>The Attorney General\u2019s Preliminary Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Petitioner requests reimbursement for \u201cPreliminary Investigation (Jenner &amp; Block) \u2014 $30,028.34.\u201d This request is for attorneys\u2019 fees at his attorneys\u2019 \u201cC\u201d rate incurred for representation \u201cduring the preliminary investigation [January 2, 1986 \u2014April 22, 1986] conducted by the Department of Justice____\u201d <em>Petition </em>at p. 18. This phase of the investigation followed the Department\u2019s receipt of a request from the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and preceded the Attorney General\u2019s decision to request the Special Division of the court to appoint an independent counsel and define jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The evaluation of the fee petition by the Attorney General opposes petitioner\u2019s request for fees incurred during this period. We agree. As the Senate Report states: \u201cThe bill does not authorize reimbursement for expenses incurred during the preliminary investigation____\u201d S.Rep. 97-496, <em>supra, </em>at 18, U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1982, p. 3554. The statute is also specific on this point. As set forth above, it provides that: \u201can individual who is the <em>subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel </em>... .may [be] award[ed] reimbursement for those reasonable attorneys\u2019 <em>fees incurred by that individual during that investiga</em>tion____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">Moreover, this \u201cpreliminary\u201d phase of the investigation would not satisfy the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement. Given the accusation, any person would have been investigated. As it turned out, the investigation at this incomplete stage produced ample support for the appointment of an independent counsel from the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, two separate evaluations prepared independently by two highly experienced lawyers in the Department (one a highly qualified United States attorney on temporary assignment for the purpose), and the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. The reports of all three analyses within the Department of Justice recommended that the Attorney General apply for the appointment of independent counsel to investigate some of the allegations against Olson as set forth in the House Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">We thus reject this part of the petition. The fees were not \u201cincurred ... during [the] investigation ... conducted by an independent counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">B. <em>The Independent Counsel Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">The remainder of the fees for which reimbursement is requested total $1,229,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>044.35. Such fees were incurred during four separate periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">1. The Initial Investigation by Independent Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In the <em>First </em>period (April 23, 1986 to November 14, 1986) the Attorney General applied for the appointment of independent counsel, such counsel was appointed, the initial investigation followed, and the period ended with the announcement on November 14,1986 by Independent Counsel of her determination that \u201cstanding in isolation ... Mr. Olson\u2019s testimony of March 10, 1983, probably does not constitute a prosecutable violation of any federal criminal law____\u201d Letter from Independent Counsel to Attorney General Meese (Nov. 14, 1986) at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The greater portion of her investigation necessarily <em>duplicated </em>ground that had been covered by the preliminary investigation of the Department of Justice that had been based on the exhaustive investigation outlined in the Report of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. The 1982 Senate Committee Report on the Ethics in Government Act considered such situations and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeq\">Thus, the Committee believes that reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees would be warranted, if at all, in only rare instances. This amendment is included, however, as a safeguard to compensate officials in the event that they do incur <em>extraordinary expenses </em>during a special prosecutor investigation which eventually absolves them of any wrong doing. Reimbursement may be warranted, for example, in instances where the special prosecutor <em>duplicates </em>actions which have been taken by the Attorney General during the preliminary investigation. The Committee stresses, however, that the court should award attorneys\u2019 fees sparingly, and that reimbursement should not become a routine event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">S.Rep. 97-496, P.L. 97-409, July 14, 1982, p. 19, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, p. 3555 (emphasis added). The court is admonished to award reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cin only rare instances\u201d for \u201cextraordinary expenses,\u201d \u201csparingly,\u201d and duplication by the Independent Counsel of \u201cactions ... taken by the Attorney General during the preliminary investigation\u201d is given as one instance where \u201c[Reimbursement may be warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We thus conclude it is the expressed intent of Congress that \u201creasonable\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Olson during this period satisfy the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement and are compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">2. The Request by Independent Counsel for Expanded Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The <em>Second </em>period (November 14, 1986 until April 2, 1987) encompassed the request by Independent Counsel for expanded jurisdiction to investigate others in the Department of Justice, primarily on conspiracy charges. It ended on April 2, 1987 in the decision by the Special Division of the court refusing to authorize the additional jurisdiction. <em>In re Olson, </em>818 F.2d 34, 47 (D.C.Cir.1987). The court\u2019s opinion also pointed out that the defined jurisdiction of Independent Counsel authorized her to investigate <em>Olson\u2019s </em>participation in any conspiracy which violated \u201cany federal criminal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47. The Attorney General\u2019s application had requested the court to so define the jurisdiction of Independent Counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">This period was devoted exclusively to the successful opposition by Olson\u2019s attorneys to the request by Independent Counsel for expansion of her prosecutorial authority. We find for this period that the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement is clearly satisfied. The Attorney General initially denied the request, except as to Robert M. Perry, General Counsel of the Environmental Protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tion Agency,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the ground that he had already considered and denied the principal request as to Edward Schmults, former Deputy Attorney General, and Carol Din-kins, former Assistant Attorney General. The Independent Counsel then applied to the Special Division for the expansion of the authority that had been denied her by the Attorney General. The court ruled that, under the statute, the Attorney General\u2019s prior decision denying further investigative authority in the matter left \u201cthe division of the court [with] no power to appoint a[n] independent counsel.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 592(b)(1) (1983). Thus, having once been denied by the Attorney General, it is clear that no fees for opposing the independent counsel\u2019s request for expanded jurisdiction would have been incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">3. Constitutional Litigation in the Supreme Court</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The <em>Third </em>period (April 2, 1987 to June 29, 1988) covers counsel\u2019s activity from the decision in <em>In re Olson, supra, </em>until the Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Morrison v. Olson, </em>487 U.S. 654, 108 S.Ct. 2597, 101 L.Ed.2d 569 (1988). During this period the attempt by Independent Counsel to subpoena Olson, Schmults and Dinkins in her investigation of a possible conspiracy with others to obstruct the congressional hearing was resisted by Olson who filed an action alleging that the Act violated the separation of powers doctrine of the Constitution. The constitutionality of the Independent Counsel statute was thus challenged, but subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals. <em>See In re Sealed Case, </em>838 F.2d 476 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Legal services during this period uniquely satisfy the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement, being devoted almost exclusively to the constitutional challenge to the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Attorney General\u2019s evaluation reaches the same conclusion. As Olson\u2019s petition points out, this test could have been avoided by Independent Counsel accepting a parallel appointment by the Attorney General, but she based her refusal to accede to such request on the ground, subsequently upheld, that placing herself \u201cunder the control of the Department [of Justice]\u201d would directly conflict with the intent of the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The whole purpose of the Independent Counsel Act was to separate Independent Counsel from control by the Department of Justice and the statute had been so interpreted by the Department of Justice since its enactment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">4. The Concluding Investigation and Final Report</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">The <em>Fourth </em>period (June 29, 1988 to February 21,1989) following the decision in <em>Morrison v. Olson, supra, </em>encompasses Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation by interviews and grand jury proceedings, the filing by Independent Counsel of her Final Report, and Olson\u2019s submission of his comments thereto on February 21, 1989. We have previously held that attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the subject of an investigation in the preparation of comments to the Report are reimbursable where they are reasonably related to the substantive defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The statute specifically provides for such comments. <em>See In re Donovan, supra, </em>at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In addition, during this period inquiry into Schmults\u2019 and Dinkins\u2019 possible conspiratorial relationship with Olson was pursued with negative results. Since the Attorney General had initially reached the conclusion that no conspiracy existed, this phase of the investigation was duplicative and, for that reason, satisfies the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement. We also take note of the fact that Independent Counsel had concluded as early as November 14, 1986 that Olson\u2019s testimony \u201cstanding in isolation probably did not constitute a prosecutable violation of any federal criminal law____\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This statement indicates that attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defense of any <em>subsequent </em>investigation into the charge that alleged false statements by Olson obstructed Congress satisfies the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">II. The Reasonable Fee Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Having found that some of the fees were incurred by Olson under circumstances that satisfy the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement, the court must now ascertain what portion of such fees were reasonably incurred and thus qualify for a compensation award. In evaluating the reasonableness of a fee request, the court must focus on two questions: 1) Whether the attorneys charged a reasonable hourly rate. 2) Whether the applicant has sustained the burden of proving that the amount of time expended by the attorneys on the case was reasonable, <em>i.e., </em>can the court conclude from the application that the services were efficient, devoted to necessary subjects and not excessive in the amount of hours logged on the case. <em>See In Re Donovan </em>at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Olson was represented by lawyers from the Washington, D.C. office of Jenner &amp; Block. Olson\u2019s principal attorneys at the firm were Thomas S. Martin, David E. Zerhusen, David W. DeBruin and Anthony C. Epstein; several other Jenner &amp; Block attorneys, law clerks, paralegals and support staff logged time on the case. Additionally Jenner &amp; Block retained James F. Neal of Nashville, Tennessee during the last stage of the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morrison v. Olson, supra. </em>Olson seeks an award of compensation for the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">Preliminary Investigation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">(Jenner &amp; Block)\u2014 $30,028.34</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">Morrison Investigation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">(Jenner <em>&amp; </em>Block)\u2014 $1,214,198.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANi\">Morrison Investigation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALt\">(Neal &amp; Harwell)\u2014 $14,846.35</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">TOTAL- $1,259,072.69</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">In support of the fee application, Olson submits affidavits of many of his attorneys as well as the affidavit of Irvin B. Nathan of the Washington Bar, and other exhibits: attorneys\u2019 time sheets, affidavits of various individuals who worked on Olson\u2019s behalf during the investigation, and an elaborate memorandum Jenner <em>&amp; </em>Block submitted to the Independent Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">Under Section 593(f)(1), the court is vested with discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees <em>i.e. </em>\u2014 \u201cthe division of the court may ... award reimbursement for those reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred____\u201d Congress has provided the court with some guidance for the exercise of our discretion. This House Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-20\">In determining the proper [hourly] rate, the special court should consider the prevailing community standards and any helpful case law____ [T]he special court should pay particular attention to the reasonableness of the underlying items____ Attention should also be paid to the number of hours claimed for performing particular services ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-25\">H.Rep. No. 452, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 31 (1987), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1987, p. 2197.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-26\">We construe \u201cincurred\u201d to refer to \u201cactual fees which the subject has paid or for which he is liable.\u201d <em>In re Donovan </em>at 991. In determining whether a fee is reasonable we look to the specific require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ments of the Act and general case law as to what constitutes a reasonable fee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), the Court, citing its decision in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), and the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, \u201cconcluded that the \u2018product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate\u2019 normally provides a \u2018reasonable\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee within the meaning of the statute [\u00a7 1988].\u201d <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 887, 104 S.Ct. at 1543 (quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. at 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">This Circuit has summarized the <em>Blum </em>formulation as constituting a three part analysis: \u201c(1) determination of the number of hours reasonably expended in litigation; (2) determination of a reasonable hourly rate ...; (3) the use of multipliers as merited.\u201d <em>Save Our Cumberland Mountains Inc. v. Hodel, </em>857 F.2d 1516, 1517 (D.C.Cir. 1988) <em>(en banc). </em>The use of multipliers for exceptional cases, attorneys and results, etc., especially in attempting to recover fees from the government, is not countenanced in most cases and a party\u2019s recovery is typically limited to a reasonable lodestar figure. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>483 U.S. 711, 107 S.Ct. 3078, 97 L.Ed.2d 585 (1987).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">A. Hourly Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Olson's attorneys, Jenner &amp; Block, have requested hourly rates which are somewhat higher than the firm\u2019s normal rates for attorneys\u2019 services. In addition, the firm charged \u201cmarket\u201d rates for some support staff <em>functions </em>\u2014 i.e., clerical and library personnel. \u201c \u2018[Reasonable fees\u2019 under \u00a7 1988 are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. at 895, 104 S.Ct. at 1547. <em>See also Bebchick v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Com\u2019n, </em>805 F.2d 396, 402 (D.C.Cir. 1986); <em>Jordan v. Multnomah County, </em>815 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th Cir.1987). Noting the \u201cinherent[ ] difficulty]\u201d in determining the prevailing community rate, the <em>Blum </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">In seeking some basis for a standard, courts properly have required prevailing attorneys to justify the reasonableness of the requested rate or rates. To inform and assist the court in the exercise of its discretion, the burden is on the [fee] applicant to produce satisfactory evidence \u2014 in addition to the attorney\u2019s own affidavit \u2014 that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-15\"><em>Blum </em>465 U.S. at 895-96 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 1547 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">In the instant case, as support for the application, Olson has provided the affidavit of competent local counsel stating that he reviewed Jenner &amp; Block\u2019s partner and associate fees and found them to be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the fee schedule at Arnold &amp; Porter. Nathan Affidavit at 3-4.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Jenner &amp; Block attorney rates in the main ranged from $75 per hour to $220 per hour.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We find fault with Jenner &amp; Block\u2019s practice of billing Olson at its premium \u201cC\u201d rate as opposed to its normal \u201cA\u201d rate. The \u201cC\u201d rate ranged from $5-$20 higher per hour than the \u201cA\u201d rate. The firm seeks to justify this billing practice on two grounds. First, Jenner &amp; Block asserts that Olson was billed at the \u201cC\u201d rate because \u201che was unable to meet his financial obligations to the firm on a basis consistent with the firm\u2019s normal requirements____\u201d Martin Affidavit at 6. Second, the \u201cC\u201d rate compensated for the \u201cnecessarily ... significant delay\u201d in payment. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cA\u201d rate is the normal rate charged on all matters where billing occurs monthly and for which payment can be expected within 30 days of billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Olson, having been billed by Jenner &amp; Block at the \u201cC\u201d rate, now requests that the government pay him for fees incurred at that rate. In accordance with the retainer agreement, Olson has advanced over $30,000, at the rate of $1,000.00 per month, for expenses incurred in his defense but he has not made any other payment for attorneys\u2019 fees. In fact, the retainer agreement did not contemplate that attorneys\u2019 fees would be paid until the investigation was completed and Independent Counsel had made her Final Report. Under such circumstances, for reasons discussed later, we conclude that any award to be paid by the United States for attorneys\u2019 fees must be based upon the \u201cA\u201d rate and the award ordered is so computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">1. Contingency</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">The first ground for the higher \u201cC\u201d rate appears, on analysis, to be a contingency fee argument. The basis for the contention is that Jenner &amp; Block relied on Olson\u2019s inability to meet his financial obligations to the firm and agreed to \u201caccept <em>any </em>resulting court award as full and complete satisfaction of your obligation to the firm____\u201d Retainer Agreement at 1 (emphasis added). The firm contends it assumed a risk of nonpayment if Olson had been indicted and thus became ineligible for reimbursement under the Act. The terms of the Olson-Jenner &amp; Block retainer agreement, however, belie this contention. While the fee agreement does provide that Jenner &amp; Block will accept any fee award this court makes pursuant to the Act as \u201ccomplete and full satisfaction\u201d of Olson\u2019s obligations for fees arising under the covered period, the fee agreement plainly states that Olson is liable for fees incurred where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">(a) Independent Counsel brings an indictment against him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">(b) the court refuses to award fees; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">(c) fees are incurred on your behalf outside the time period covered by a \u00a7 593(g) award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">Retainer Agreement at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">The Supreme Court has recently held that a risk of nonpayment is not present where an attorney preserves a right of recourse against a client for unpaid fees. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>483 U.S. 711, 107 S.Ct. 3078, 97 L.Ed.2d 585 (1987), the Court found that \u201cwhen the plaintiff has agreed to pay its attorney, win or lose, the attorney has not assumed the risk of non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>payment and there is no occasion to adjust the lodestar fee because the case was a risky one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716, 107 S.Ct. at 3082 (citing <em>Jones \u00b6. Central Soya Co., </em>748 F.2d 586, 593 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cA lawyer may not preserve a right of recourse against his client for fees and still expect to be compensated as if he had sacrificed completely his right to payment in the event of an unsuccessful outcome.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In the instant case, Jenner &amp; Block has not renounced its right to payment from Olson, but rather has entered into a carefully drafted contract designed to preserve its rights to payment no matter what the outcome. Under the fee agreement, Jenner &amp; Block would collect its fees from the United States in the event that Olson qualified for reimbursement under \u00a7 593(f) \u2014 with Olson still liable for any fees the court determined to be outside the scope of the Act \u2014 or Jenner &amp; Block would collect its fees from Olson in the event that Olson was not eligible for reimbursement under the Act. The foregoing indicates that Jenner &amp; Block had not \u201cassumed the risk of nonpayment\u201d and thus there \u201cis no occasion to adjust the lodestar\u201d for a contingency enhancement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">2. Anticipated Delay in Receiving Payment</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Jenner &amp; Block asserts that the anticipated delay in receiving payment is a second factor justifying its billing Olson at a higher than normal rate. The Supreme Court, however, has found that a fee enhancement based on delay is equivalent to recovering prejudgment interest which is generally prohibited in claims against the United States absent an express congressional waiver. In our view, this rule applies not only to explicit interest but also where compensation for delay is an implicit component.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">The government\u2019s no-interest rule is of long standing. \u201cThe no-interest rule is expressly described as early as 1819, in an opinion letter [of] the Attorney General____\u201d <em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>478 U.S. 310, 316, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 2962, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986). Many earlier cases state the same rule. <em>Angarica v. Bayard, </em>127 U.S. 251, 260, 8 S.Ct. 1156, 1160-61, 32 L.Ed. 159 (1888) (\u201c[It is a] well-settled principle that the United States are not liable to pay interest on claims against them, in the absence of express statutory provisions to that effect.\u201d). <em>Tillson v. United States, </em>100 U.S. 43, 47, 25 L.Ed. 543 (1879) (\u201c[Ijnterest is recoverable between citizens if a payment of money is unreasonably delayed [but] with the government the rule is different, and ... the practice has long prevailed in the departments of not allowing interest on claims presented, except in some way spe-. cifically provided for.\u201d) (citing earlier cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-23\">The Court has most recently stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-24\">Interest and a delay factor share an identical function. They are designed to compensate for the belated receipt of money. The no-interest rule has been applied to prevent parties from holding the United States liable on claims grounded on the belated receipt of funds, even when characterized as compensation for delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-25\"><em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, supra, </em>478 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2965 (1986) (citing <em>United States v. Sherman, </em>98 U.S. 565, 568, 25 L.Ed. 235 (1879). Interest may only be recovered from the United States where \u201cthe award of interest was <em>affirmatively and separately contemplated by Congress.\u201d Id. </em>478 U.S. at 315, 106 S.Ct. at 2961-62 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Angarica v. Bayard, </em>127 U.S. 251, 260, 32 L.Ed. 159 (1888). <em>Accord Missouri v. Jenkins, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>U.S. -, -, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2467-68, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In applying these rules to the Title VII case at bar, the <em>Shaw </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">[W]e [do not] find the requisite waiver of immunity from interest in the statutory requirement of awarding \u201creasonable\u201d attorney\u2019s fees. There is no basis for reading the term \u201creasonable\u201d as the embodiment of a specific congressional choice to include interest as a component of attorney\u2019s fees, particularly where the legislative history is silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\"><em>Shaw </em>478 U.S. at 320, 106 S.Ct. at 2964. The instant case closely parallels <em>Shaw </em>because \u00a7 593(f) merely provides for the award of \u201creasonable\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees in the appropriate case and the legislative history is silent on the question of awarding interest. Accordingly, there is <em>no basis </em>to assert that Congress in the Independent Counsel Act even contemplated waiving the no-interest rule, much less took affirmative steps to so act.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">We thus hold that Jenner &amp; Block may not recover its enhanced \u201cC\u201d rate. Rather, it must apply its hourly rate in its claim against the United States at its normal \u201cA\u201d level. This result is particularly appropriate since the retainer agreement contemplated that fees would not be currently paid beyond the $1,000 per month to be paid by Olson, that the United States would be looked to as the ultimate payee, and that \u201cany resulting court award [will be accepted] as full and complete satisfaction of [Olson\u2019s] obligation____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">When all the circumstances are considered, it is obvious that the retainer agreement was deeply predicated upon the anticipation that the United States would eventually pay Olson\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a court award under the Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In such circumstances, to permit the parties to <em>agree in advance </em>that the United States should be required to pay a fee based on implicit interest for delay would be allowing indirectly what could not be done directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">3. Law Clerks, Paralegals, and Staff</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">The fee application also requests reimbursement for work done by law clerks and paralegals at their market rates. The Nathan affidavit supports the reasonableness of the requested rates as being in line with prevailing community rates. Nathan Affidavit at 4. This Circuit \u201cholds that paralegals and law clerks are to be compensated at their market rates.\u201d <em>In re Donovan </em>at 992-993 n. 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">Recently, in <em>Missouri v. Jenkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that a State, as a defendant in a successful 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 action, was required to pay the market rate of law clerks and paralegals in an award of reasonable attorneys' fees. The Court found that the relevant inquiry in determining what constitutes a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee is a \u201ccalculatpon] on the basis of rates and practices prevailing in the relevant market____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 109 S.Ct. at 2470-72. We find that the rates Jenner &amp; Block billed for law clerks and paralegals comported with community practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-22\">The court, however, disallows Jenner &amp; Block\u2019s asserted market rate billing for work done by librarians, clerical personnel and other support staff. There is nothing in the Act or its legislative history indicating that Congress intended to in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>elude such billings in an award of \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Such services are generally considered within the overhead component of a lawyer's fee. We need not, however, reach that question here because the fee application fails to adequately document that such fees are \u201cin line\u201d with community practice as required by <em>Blum v. Stenson, supra, </em>465 U.S. at n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at n. 11.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B. Reasonable Amount of Time Expended by Attorneys</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In considering the reasonableness of the hours billed, we first examine the fee application in view of the specific provisions of the Act \u201cto determine whether the fees charged were incurred during the independent counsel investigation and were reasonably related to a defense to such investigation.\u201d <em>In re Donovan </em>at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We shall exclude from Olson\u2019s award hours logged preparing the fee application since we interpret \u00a7 593(f) as prohibiting the award of fees for that purpose. Although the Act provides for the possibility of recovery of fees incurred through submission of a fee application, we do not consider that <em>preparation </em>of such application is an \u201cextraordinary expense\u201d for which the Congress intended the United States should be obligated. H.Rep. No. 452, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 31 (1987), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1987, p. 2197.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d event for a lawyer to be required to prepare a petition for his fees and expenses particularly when they exceed $1,000,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Also, fees incurred for preparation of the fee application, in our analysis of congressional intent, were not \u201cincurred ... <em>during </em>[the independent counsel\u2019s] investigation\u201d in the sense that Congress indicated in \u00a7 593(f)(1) that attorneys\u2019 fees were to be compensated by the United States. (Emphasis added.). We interpret the limiting provision, \"during the investigation\u201d in \u00a7 593(f)(1) to refer to attorneys\u2019 services rendered in asserting the <em>merits </em>of the subject\u2019s defense against the criminal charges being investigated. Thus, the fees incurred in preparation of the fee application were not \u201creasonably related to a <em>defense </em>to ... [the Independent Counsel\u2019s] investigation.\u201d <em>In re Donovan </em>at 993 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is a close question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>but since any waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed, we resolve the question in favor of no recovery for the time spent in preparing the petition and memorandum. <em>See United States v. Mottaz, </em>476 U.S. 834, 851, 106 S.Ct. 2224, 2234, 90 L.Ed.2d 841 (1986) (\u201c[A] waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be lightly implied____\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Lehman v. Nakshian, </em>453 U.S. 156, 161, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 2701, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981) (\u201c[T]his Court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>United States v.

Stenson, supra. </em>In this connection we require that the applicant submit \u201ccontemporaneous time records of hours worked and rates claimed\u201d which sufficiently document the services rendered and prove their reasonableness. <em>In re Donovan </em>at 994 (citations omitted); <em>see also Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433-34, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (Where \u201cdocumentation of hours is inadequate, the ... court may reduce the award accordingly____ [Additionally, the court should] exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary____\u201d); <em>United States Tile &amp; Composition v. G &amp; M Roofing, </em>732 F.2d 495, 502, n. 2 (6th Cir.1984) (Supporting documentation \u201cmust be of sufficient detail and probative value to enable the court to determine <em>with a high degree of certainty </em>that such hours were actually and <em>reasonably, </em>expended____\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Examination of the application reveals numerous instances where the billing entries were not adequately documented. This defect in adequate record keeping is most prevalent among the lawyers billing at the highest rates. For example, there are multitudinous billing entries, included among other entries for a particular day, that wholly fail to state, or to make any reference to the subject discussed at a conference, meeting or telephone conference. Some examples of imprecise documentation are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Such deficient specifications make it impossible for the court to determine, with any degree of exactitude, the amount of time billed for a discreet activity where the lawyer in question billed for more than one activity in a day. The time sheets were itemized on a daily basis, not by the task. Thus, when an attorney billed for more than one task in a day, the court is left to approximate the amount of time which should be allocated to each task. With such inadequate de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>scriptions the court cannot \u201cdetermine with a high degree of certainty,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as it must, that the billings are reasonable.' Therefore, the court must estimate the reduction to be made because of such insufficient documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The attorneys also engaged in a plethora of conferences, most often denoted simply as \u201cstrategy\u201d conferences, consuming the time of several attorneys who bill at very high rates. The hourly rates charged are of such magnitude as to indicate that the attorneys should have been able to decide on the proper strategy without the great number of strategy conferences attended by numerous firm lawyers. <em>See Laffey v. Northwest Airline, </em>746 F.2d 4, 29-30 (1984) <em>(partially overruled on other grounds), Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel, supra; Norman v. Housing Authority of the City of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292,1302 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cRedundant hours generally occur when more than one attorney represents a client.\u201d). We recognize that the case was very important, protracted, unique and was very ably handled, but we find that the number of conferences among the twenty-one attorneys who did some work on the matter were excessive.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">[J]ust as a criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial and not a perfect one, a litigant is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for an effective and completely [competent] representation <em>but not one of supererogation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>Grendel\u2019s Den v. Larkin, </em>749 F.2d 945, 953-54 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The court will combine the <em>intra-firm conferences that were excessive or redundant with those that are insufficiently documented, </em>as referred to above, and reduce the fee request by ten percent of all fees incurred at the \u201cA\u201d rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">We are also compelled to specifically exclude several billing entries as \u201cexcessive, redundant or unnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such exclusion include work done preparing grand jury instructions, for which the firm billed $11,127.50. Because United States prosecuting attorneys are thoroughly competent to instruct grand juries and rarely accept or use proffered grand jury instructions from a target of a grand jury investigation, we find these billings unnecessary and therefore unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">We also find that \u201cin-city transportation\u201d in the amount of $880.00 is not sufficiently documented. This ran as high as $190.20 on a single day with 22 trips billed mostly as subway rates. Our reduction is limited to days where the undocumented billings exceeded $30.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">We also do not consider that $3,581.75 in \u201csecretarial overtime,\u201d or $280.30 for \u201covertime dinner expense\" are part of a \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fee.\u201d Prudent planning could have eliminated the need for secretarial overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">We also disallow the fees billed from November 3 to November 25, 1987, principally by one attorney, in an attempt to defeat the \u201creauthorization\u201d of the Independent Counsel Act. Congress hardly intended, in authorizing the reimbursement of defense fees for cleared subjects of Independent Counsel proceedings, to pay expenses for lobbying against its legislation \u2014 particularly in its later stages when the bill was practically certain of enactment. The billings include lobbying Senate staffers and the Department of Justice. We deduct $2,208.75 billed for these services. We also disallow a minor expense of $155 billed for \u201cpress release.\u201d <em>See In re Donovan, supra, </em>at 993-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">In sum, in accordance with the above analysis we conclude that the award shall reflect the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>1. Reduce all attorneys\u2019 fees to the \u201cA\u201d rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">2. Disallow fees for preliminary investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">3.

The <em>tee </em>application also contains an affidavit of James F. Neal which appears to be offered, at least in part, as support for the reasonableness of the fees charged by Jenner &amp; Block. Neal Affidavit at 4-5. Neal was retained by Olson in the latter stage of the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation. Since Neal was retained in the case, we cannot, despite his well known national experience, credit his affidavit as helping to discharge Olson's burden of demonstrating through <em>independent evidence </em>that the fees charged were reasonable. In <em>Blum, </em>as quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>above, the Court clearly stated that a fee applicant must \"produce satisfactory <em>evidence </em>\u2014 in <em>addition to the attorney\u2019s own affidavits </em>\u2014 that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community____\u201d <em>Blum </em>465 U.S. at 895-96, n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 1547 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Also, there are no independent affidavits supporting the reasonableness of Neal\u2019s rates. Such a defect would ordinarily foreclose the possibility of reimbursement. However, the court takes judicial notice, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, that Neal\u2019s billing rate of $260 per hour constitutes a reasonable rate for his legal services. <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>201(c) and (f). Neal\u2019s legal abilities are generally well known within this Circuit. He was the special prosecutor in the principal Watergate Case, served as Chief Counsel in the Senate Select Committee to Study Undercover Operations of the Department of Justice, as a Justice Department attorney he successfully prosecuted James Hoffa, and later served as United States Attorney in Tennessee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b242-19\">.

Had the Olson fee agreement called for a true contingency arrangement, there would have been serious questions as to the compensability of such fees. Section 593 states that a subject may only seek reimbursement for fees \"incurred\u201d during an independent counsel investigation. This court has interpreted incurred as \"requir[ing] that the <em>subject be legally liable </em>for the fees____\u201d In re Donovan at 992-93 (emphasis added). When a client enters a true contingency fee retainer agreement he is not liable for legal fees in the event of an unsuccessful outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\">. The retainer agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">2. Jenner &amp; Block will not expect payment from you on these bills prior to the Independent Counsel\u2019s decision to either (a) dismiss the action or (b) return an indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">3. Should Independent Counsel dismiss or otherwise terminate this action prior to an indictment, Jenner &amp; Block will seek to recover from the appropriate court those attorneys\u2019 fees allowable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(g). Jenner &amp; Block will accept any resulting court award as full and complete satisfaction of your obligations to the firm arising during the time period for which the award covers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-24\">With respect to Olson\u2019s required $1,000 monthly payments the agreement provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-26\">5. You will make $1,000.00 monthly payments to Jenner &amp; Block commencing May 1, 1987. Those payments will be applied against disbursements as incurred, and then against your fees currently outstanding. These payments will be refunded in full upon receipt by Jenner &amp; Block of any court award of fees pursuant to paragraph 3 of this letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. The only arguably independent support demonstrating that charging market rates for a firm\u2019s non-legal support personnel is community practice is a passing statement in the Nathan affidavit which contends that Jenner &amp; Block\u2019s clerical staff rates are comparable to \"those charged by Arnold &amp; Porter.\u201d Nathan Affidavit at 4. We find, however, that the isolated billing practice of two law firms in Washington, D.C. do not, a community practice, make. The fee application does not attempt to document that market rate billing for support staff is common among the area law firms. Moreover, our experience with past fee petitions has indicated that such billing practice is not common.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">. As we interpret the statute and its legislative history, Congress indicated that it only contemplated paying compensation for fees incurred <em>in defending </em>the target from the independent counsel\u2019s substantive investigation. In 1982, Congress stated that the court, if the subject meets other statutory conditions, may award fees which \"would not have been incurred by a private citizen in an <em>investigation </em>of the same allegations.\u201d S.Rep. No. 409, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 18 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, p. 3554 (emphasis added). This language indicates that Congress was focusing on compensating only for fees incurred in a substantive, \"on the merits\u201d defense against the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">This intent is underscored by the inclusion in the Committee Report of testimony given by Lloyd Cutler on the need for a reimbursement provision in the Act. Cutler stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABL4\">We should not excuse or relieve a public official of the cost of <em>defending </em>himself that any other person would be subjected to---- I don\u2019t want to suggest that government officials are indigent, but their salaries in proportion to the costs of counsel of the quality necessary to <em>defend </em>them in cases of the type that are brought against a high public official come very, very close to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 991-92 (emphasis added). Cutler\u2019s testimony on the need for compensating high officials for the cost of defending against an independent counsel investigation is clearly directed at an on the merits defense, not the fees incurred for a collateral fee application. Therefore, we find that the Olson request for fees incurred in preparation of the fee application is outside the scope of reimbursement that Congress intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b245-16\">. As in <em>Donovan, </em>we shall permit Olson to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in the preparation of comments to the Independent Counsel\u2019s Final Report.
