J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAq\">These consolidated appeals raise the question of the type and extent of coverages afforded under eight different insurance policies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Kondrack, the permissive driver of a vehicle rented from Hopkins by the plaintiff, George P. Lovy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we have concluded that the declaratory judgment in No. 43504 must be reversed, and the summary judgment in No. 41981 affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The basic underlying facts are not in dispute. So far as here pertinent, on May 25, 1973, Lovy rented a 1973 Honda from Hopkins for a pleasure trip to Yosemite National Park. At the time of the one-car accident on May 27, the Honda was driven by Kondrack with Levy\u2019s permission. Lovy sustained catastrophic injuries, for which a jury in a subsequent separate personal injury action rendered a judgment in favor of Lovy against Kondrack in excess of $1 million. Additional facts will be added as required in our discussion of each policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\n<em>No. 43504</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">As the major issues on this appeal pertain to the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions that no coverage was afforded to Hopkins, the named insured, by three of the policies issued by Farmers Group, we turn first to these three policies: 1) Truck Insurance Exchange No. 9464-04-39, a comprehensive liability policy with limits of $500,000; 2) Farmers Insurance Exchange No. 9111-04-39, an automobile dealer\u2019s \u2018'unitized\u201d policy with limits of $500,000; and 3) Truck Insurance Exchange No. 9372-04-79, an \u201cumbrella\u201d policy with limits of $2 million, which all parties agree afforded coverage only if the above mentioned automobile dealer\u2019s policy did so. As indicated above, the trial court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>each of the above policies afforded no coverage here for a variety of different reasons discussed in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Preliminarily, we note that in doing so, the trial court did not mention the applicable statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the 1971 version of Insurance Code section 11580.1 (Stats. 1971, ch. 1564, \u00a7 3, pp. 3135-3137). The court below also based its findings and conclusions on the inadmissible postaccident hearsay testimony of Farmers Group that in each policy, the insurer and its insured, Hopkins, intended to exclude coverage for a permissive user of a rental automobile. <em>(Pepper Industries </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1012, 1017 [134 Cal.Rptr. 904].)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We turn first to the pertinent parts of Insurance Code section 11580.1, as it read at the time of the May 27, 1973, accident.  The statute, a part of this state\u2019s financial responsibility law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is to be liberally construed to provide monetary protection for \u201cthat ever changing and tragically large group of persons who .. . suffer grave injury\u201d <em>(Metz </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 45, 51-53 [109 Cal.Rptr. 698, 513 P.2d 922]; <em>Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 142, 152-153 [23 Cal.Rptr. 592, 373 P.2d 640]).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The statute in clear and unambiguous terms compels all issuers of automobile liability policies to provide coverage for permissive users by stating, so far as here pertinent, that <em>no policy </em>of automobile liability insurance <em>covering liability arising out of the use of any motor vehicle shall be issued </em>in this state on any motor vehicle principally used in this state <em>unless it contains the provisions set forth in subdivision (b).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Subdivision (d) provides as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph <em>(4) of subdivision (b), </em>or the provisions of Article 2 (commencing with Section 16450) of Chapter 3 of Division 7, or Article 2 (commencing with Section 17150) of Chapter 1 of Division 9, of the Vehicle Code, <em>the insurer and any named insured </em>may, by the terms of any policy of automobile liability insurance to which subdivision (a) applies, or by a separate writing relating thereto, <em>agree as to either or both of the following limitations, </em>such agreement to be binding upon every insured to whom such policy applies and upon every third party claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201c(1) That coverage under such policy shall not apply nor accrue to the benefit of any insured or any third party claimant while any insured motor vehicle is being used or operated by a natural person or persons designated by name. Such agreement shall remain in force as long as the policy remains in force, and shall apply to any continuation, renewal, or replacement of such policy by the named insured, or reinstatement of such policy within 30 days of any lapse thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201c(2) <em>That with regard to any such policy issued to a named insured engaged in the business of selling, repairing, servicing, delivering, testing, road-testing, parking, or storing automobiles, coverage shall not apply to any person other than the named insured or his agent or employee, except to the extent that the limits of liability of any other valid </em>and collectible <em>insurance available to such person are not equal to the limits of </em>liability specified in subdivision (a) <em>of Section 16059 of the Vehicle Code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As the above quoted statutory provisions are part of a well entrenched sound rule of public policy, any attempt to exclude coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>for permissive users of insured automobiles is viewed with disfavor. All ambiguities and doubts must be resolved in favor of coverage <em>(Metz, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 45; <em>Interinsurance Exchange, </em>supra, 58 Cal.2d 142, 152; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Merlo </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 855, fn. 13 at p. 872 [106 Cal.Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212, 66 A.L.R.3d 505]; <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gewirtz </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 246 [95 Cal.Rptr. 617, 486 P.2d 145]; <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Manley </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 126, 133-134 [125 Cal.Rptr. 513]; <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Consolidated Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 26, 40-42 [130 Cal.Rptr. 446]; <em>Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 649, 656-657 [146 Cal.Rptr. 648]). Exclusions must be construed strictly against the insurer <em>(Phelps </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 752, 758-759 [165 Cal.Rptr. 263]).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Given the unchanged public policy and law of this state on the subject, the intention of the parties to the insurance contract is immaterial <em>(Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>supra, 58 Cal.2d 142; <em>City of Mill Valley </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 595 [159 Cal.Rptr. 635]; <em>Fratis </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund American Ins. Companies </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 339, 343-344 [128 Cal.Rptr. 391]; <em>Home Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 251 Cal.App.2d 942, fn. 6 at p. 955 [60 Cal.Rptr. 544]; <em>Malmgren </em>v. <em>Southwestern A. Ins. Co. </em>(1927) 201 Cal. 29, 33-34 [255 P. 512]). <em>Wint </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 257 [107 Cal.Rptr. 175, 507 P.2d 1383, 90 A.L.R.3d 1185],<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> cited for the first time at oral argument is not apposite here, as there, no permissive user of a vehicle was involved. Surely, Farmers Group cannot maintain that the collusive intent of the insurer and the insured can prevent coverage mandated by statute. We agree that the questions before us are purely legal and reject the Farmers Group contention that the trial court\u2019s factual determination of the intent issue is relevant and binding on appeal if supported by substantial evidence. In this connection, we hold that the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence on the intent of the parties was erroneous as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Pepper Industries, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.3d 1012.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In the light of the above mentioned rules favoring coverage, we proceed to analyze and discuss each of the three Farmers Group policies in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>We turn first to Truck Insurance Exchange \u201cComprehensive Liability Policy\u201d No. 9464-04-39.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The court below concluded that this policy did not cover Kondrack based on its findings, as follows: \u201c45. The Truck comprehensive policy <em>was designed to protect Hopkins in the event that a lessee </em>or rentee (pursuant to an agreement with Hopkins) <em>failed to procure insurance which would protect not only the lessee or rentee, but Hopkins as well.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201c46. <em>It was the intent of Hopkins and Truck Insurance Exchange that the Truck comprehensive policy would protect Hopkins in the event that a lessee or rentee defaulted on his obligation to procure insurance protecting Hopkins as well as the lessee </em>or rentee.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">These findings were based on the testimony of Hopkins and a Farmers Group employee (Aballi) that the policy was designed to provide coverage only where there was a gap in insurance coverage, i.e., the rental customer failed to obtain insurance on the leased vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">\u201c47. <em>In the instant case, there was no default by Lovy or Kondrack </em>in connection with the procurement of insurance; to the contrary, <em>Kondrack had two insurance policies available to him </em>for the circumstances of the May 27, 1973, accident, namely, the insurance coverage through <em>the State Farm policy </em>and the insurance coverage through <em>the Carriers combination automobile policy.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201c48. <em>Under Endorsement No. 2 </em>of the Truck comprehensive policy, <em>there is no coverage under the Truck comprehensive policy if the lessee or rentee has procured or has available to him insurance equal to the minimum financial responsibility requirements.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201c49. <em>It was never the intent of either Hopkins or Truck Insurance Exchange that the Truck comprehensive policy provide any insurance coverage to lessees or rentees.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">\u201c50. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange collected a premium of only approximately $100 a year for coverage under the Truck comprehensive policy; in view of the large volume of Hopkins\u2019 business, this indicates that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>the intention of Hopkins and Truck Insurance Exchange was that exposure under the Truck comprehensive policy would only come into effect on the rare occasion when there had been a default </em>on the part of the lessee or rentee in procuring or having available insurance which would protect Hopkins. As stated above, no such event is present in this case.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s.conclusion was based on its erroneous assumption that the intent of the parties was controlling, whether or not it was expressed in the policy. We note that if, in fact, the intent of the parties was to provide only \u201cstop-gap\u201d coverage, no express language in the policy so states. Rather, Farmers Group argues that the exclusion is to be gleaned from endorsement 2, discussed below. The courts have frequently reiterated the rule that to be effective, an exclusion clause in a policy must follow precisely the language of the statute <em>(Phelps </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d 752, at pp. 758-759; <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Teachers Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 804, 810 [161 Cal.Rptr. 738]). We, of course, focus on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the exclusion of lessees or rentees was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Neither Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (d), discussed above, nor the language of the policy permits such an interpretation. As we have previously indicated, the Truck Insurance Exchange comprehensive policy was designated as a comprehensive liability policy with limits of $500,000 for <em>\u201cliability arising out of the ... use of an automobile.\u201d </em>The persons insured were defined, so far as here pertinent, as: \u201c(1) vhe named insured; . . . (3)(b) <em>any other person while using ... a hired automobile with the permission of the named insured, providing his actual operation </em>... <em>is within the scope of such </em>permission.. . . \u201d (Italics added.-)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Farmers Group does not assert that Kondrack was not covered under the above quoted terms of the policy but, like the court below, relies on endorsement 2, set forth in full below.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Endorsement 2, by its terms, attempts to limit the coverage of the policy as to certain classes of permissive users. On its face, the limitation is invalid since, contrary to the Farmers Group contention, no provision of Insurance Code section 11580.1 expressly or impliedly permits such an exception from the basic requirement of subdivision (b)(4) quoted above, at footnote 5 on page 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\">In <em>Metz </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>supra, 10 Cal.3d 45, one of the exclusions under consideration purported to remove coverage for vehicles \u201cwhile rented to others\u201d (p. 50), a phrase substantially similar to the language of endorsement 2. After first unanimously reiterating the established public policy of this state requiring coverage for permissive users (pp. 50-51), our Supreme Court rejected the insurer\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cwhile rented to others,\u201d did not exclude a class of users, but a class of automobiles, \u201cnamely, those rented to persons other than the named insured,\u201d as follows at page 52: \u201cThe right of the insurer to limit its coverage of automobiles . . . <em>does not go so far as to permit the insurer by adroit wording </em>to evade <em>the statutory requirement for coverage of permissive users.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In doing so, the court discussed <em>Republic Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Liab. Assur. Corp. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 121 [72 Cal.Rptr. 718]. In <em>Republic Indemnity, </em>a policy issued to an automobile repair shop provided that the insurance did not apply \u201c\u2018\u201cto any automobile used by the insured for the purpose of loaning to customers\u201d\u201d\u2019 <em>(Metz, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d, p. 52), which was construed as \u201ca restriction against permissive users such as has been continually held to be violative of public policy\u201d <em>(Republic Indem., supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d, p. 126, quoted with approval in <em>Metz, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d, at pp. 52-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The court further stated that both in <em>Metz, supra, </em>and in <em>Republic Indemnity, supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d 121, <em>\u201cthe policies spoke superficial</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number><em>ly of excluding only a class of automobiles. But in both cases the definitive characteristic of the excluded class of vehicles lies in the fact that they are operated by a class of permissive users; hence, in practical effect the exclusion denies coverage to this class of permissive </em>users\u201d <em>(Metz, supra, </em>p. 53; italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The court then held that former Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (d) (i.e., subd. (b)(4) of the 1971 version of the statute here applicable) <em>\u201cinvalidated provisions which, by defining a class of excluded vehicles in terms of their operation by permissive users, serves effectively to deny coverage to those </em>users\u201d <em>(Metz, supra, </em>p. 53; italics added). Such a clause therefore is ineffective to deny coverage. Also in accord is <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Consolidated Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>59 Cal.App.3d 26, 46, which held that where a policy covered the named insured for all uses, but attempted to limit permissive user coverage to situations where the automobile was being used in the business of the named insured, the attempted limitation was invalid because the law requires that permissive users be covered to the same extent as the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the small amount of the premium paid validates an illegal exclusion was rejected specifically in <em>Home Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Mission Ins. Co., supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 942, footnote 6 at page 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Endorsement 2 states that the coverages of the policy do not apply to an automobile used by others under a valid written rental agreement, the terms and conditions of which have been fully complied with by the renter or lessee (See fn. 11 at pp. 847-848 above.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The terms and conditions of the applicable rental agreement (in which the owner of the vehicle (Hopkins) is referred to as the \u201clessor\u201d and the rentee (Lovy) is awkwardly referred to as the \u201crenter\u201d) are set forth below, so far as pertinent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>As is readily apparent, none of the terms and conditions of the rental agreement state that the renter has the obligation to obtain insurance of any kind. Rather, section 4, (quoted above at fn. 12), implies that the lessor (Hopkins) has the obligation of providing insurance, and states that the lessor is covered by a policy which has limits equal to or in excess of the statutory limits. The record indicates Hopkins\u2019 general manager testified that as a matter of custom and usage, Hopkins did not require the renter to carry insurance (except for long-term leases) and that Hopkins did not care whether or not the renter carried insurance. Hopkins\u2019 obligation to provide insurance is also consistent with the box on the upper part of the lower left part of the one-page agreement, which states over Lovy\u2019s signature that: \u201cThis vehicle covered with Full Coverage Collision Protection for which Renter agrees to pay.\u201d Left blank next to this is a box stating that \u201cThe Renter Does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Not want Full Coverage Collision and accepts full responsibility for all damage to the vehicle up to $250.00 per collision or other incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The only other reference to insurance in the rental agreement are the two remaining boxes on the bottom of the agreement stating: \u201cThis rental is covered with trip insurance for which the Renter agrees to pay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201c$_per day</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\u201c$_per week</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201c$_per month over and above rental charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cBy_Renter\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">The blank below it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">\u201cRenter does not want trip insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">\u201cBy_\u201d Renter</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Neither of these blanks was completed in Lovy\u2019s rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">Thus, our examination of endorsement 2 and Lovy\u2019s rental agreement provides no basis for the trial court\u2019s construction that endorsement 2 of the policy afforded coverage only if the renter did not obtain insurance as required by the rental agreement. As we read endorsement 2, it provides that any failure of the renter to comply with any of the terms and conditions of the rental agreement will exclude coverage under the comprehensive liability policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">In view of the above, we can only conclude that the attempted exclusion of coverage to Kondrack found by the trial court was not only contrary to the law of this state but also not based on any language in endorsement 2, the rest of the policy or the rental agreement. Accordingly, we can only conclude that as a matter of law, Truck Insurance Exchange comprehensive liability policy No. 9464-04-39 afforded coverage to Kondrack. We defer to a subsequent portion of this opinion our discussion of whether this coverage was primary or excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>We turn next to Farmers Insurance Exchange policy No. 9111-04-39 with limits of $500,000, the dealer\u2019s \u201cunitized policy.\u201d As to this policy, the trial court concluded that the coverage of Kondrack was properly excluded pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.1, subd. (d)(2) (which we have quoted above at page 844) as Hopkins was engaged in some of the eight specifically enumerated business activities for which the statute expressly permits exclusion, namely, \u201cthe business of selling, repairing and servicing automobiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The court further found that Hopkins also was engaged in the business of renting and leasing automobiles through a rental department. There was no separate rental corporation. The rental department was located in the same building and on the same floor in which the automobile sales operation was conducted by Hopkins, and the rental business was a part of Hopkins\u2019 sales operations. The rental department was staffed by a full-time employee of Hopkins who was paid exclusively by Hopkins and who was the person who arranged the May 25, 1973, lease with Lovy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court further found that in 1973, \u201cthe great bulk of Hopkins\u2019 income was derived from the business of selling, repairing, and servicing automobiles, and less than 1% of Hopkins\u2019 income!<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>! was derived from the rental of automobiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The court further found, so far as pertinent, that the unitized policy provides no insurance coverage to Kondrack for the circumstances of the May 27, 1973, accident. <em>Neither Farmers nor Hopkins intended </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>that the Farmers unitized policy provide any coverage for the rental operations of Hopkins or for rentees of vehicles owned by Hopkins.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201c25. <em>Hopkins paid no premiums under the Farmers unitized policy </em>for Hopkins\u2019 rental operation. <em>The premium paid was based upon total sales and servicing operations of Hopkins\u2019 business.^</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201c26. The insuring agreement portion of the Farmers unitized policy defines the term \u2018insured\u2019 as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201c\u2018The term \u201cinsured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201c\u2018(1) The named insured; ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201c\u2018(4) Any other person while using an automobile covered by the policy, with the permission of the name insured, <em>but only if no other valid and collectible liability insurance, either primary or excess, </em>with limits of liability at least equal to the minimum limits specified by the financial responsibility law ... is available to such person.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">\u201cKondrack is not an insured under the Farmers unitized policy because he did have other valid and collectible insurance available to him equal to the minimum financial responsibility requirements, . . . other valid and collectible insurance was available to Kondrack in the State Farm policy and in the Carriers combination policy\u201d (italics partially added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Thus, the court\u2019s conclusion that the unitized policy afforded no coverage was based on three factors: 1) the intent of Hopkins and Farmers (which, as we have discussed above, is not relevant); 2) the express statutorily permitted exclusion for \u201cselling, repairing and servicing automobiles,\u201d and 3) the exclusion of other drivers covered by other insurance from the definition of named insured, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Neither the history of the limited exclusions permitted by Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(2) nor its interpretations (or that of the other Ins. Code provisions <em>in pari materia, </em>discussed below) support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. In its original enactment, the predecessor of the provision (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, former subd. (f), Stats. 1963, ch. 1259, \u00a7 1, pp. 2780-2781) permitted the exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number><em>all permissive users </em>(other than agents or employees of the named insured) as long as there was other insurance to cover the loss with limits at least equal to the requirements of the financial responsibility law <em>(Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 496, fn. 4, p. 508 [99 Cal.Rptr. 617, 492 P.2d 673]). Two years later, the statute was amended to limit the permitted exclusions to persons engaged in the eight specifically enumerated activities (Stats. 1965, ch. 1968, \u00a7 1, p. 4496; <em>Metz, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 45, fns. 14 and 15 at p. 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Identically worded permissive exclusions limited to the same eight activities are also set forth in Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4)(ii)(B), (quoted above in fn. 5 on p. 843) and Insurance Code section 11580.9, which deals with the order of coverage when two or more policies cover a loss. As originally enacted, subdivision (a) of section 11580.9 (Stats. 1970, ch. 300, \u00a7 7, p. 576) referred to the same eight activities as section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4)(ii)(B) and subdivision (d)(2). Insurance Code section 11580.9, subdivision (b) provides for a policy affording coverage to a named insured engaged in the business of renting or leasing commercial vehicles or the leasing of a vehicle for a period of six months or longer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Significantly, each of the eight specifically enumerated activities (selling, repairing, servicing, delivering, testing, road testing, parking or storing motor vehicles) involves a use of the vehicle that occurs over a short period of time, within a limited area, and for a particular and narrow purpose. Over the years, the parallel provisions of Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivisions (b)(4)(ii)(B) and (d)(2) and Insurance Code section 11580.9, subdivision (a) consistently and uniformly have been narrowly construed <em>(Atlantic Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 100 [52 Cal.Rptr. 569, 416 P.2d 801]; <em>Financial Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 689 [38 Cal.Rptr. 249]; <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Manley, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 126 (decided by Div. Four of this court); <em>Cal-Farms Ins. Companies </em>v. <em>Firemen\u2019s Fund American Ins. Companies </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1063 [102 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>568]; <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Carrier Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 223 [119 Cal.Rptr. 116]).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The most recent construction by our Supreme Court in <em>Metz, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 45, involved the application of section 11580.1, former subdivision (f), the predecessor of the here applicable version of section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(2), to the following fact situation: the named insured (National) had leased the vehicle for a 36-month period to Hamlin. The insurer argued (at p. 55) that, in fact, National was engaged in \u201cselling\u201d the car to Hamlin as National\u2019s standard form lease was a conditional sales contract. Our Supreme Court noted that the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against National as the imputed owner in the personal injury action conclusively established that there had been no conditional sale as to the particular leased accident vehicle.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In rejecting the insurer\u2019s contention, our Supreme Court, at pages 55-56, relied on the specific terms of the particular contract between National and the lessee of the accident vehicle. The court concluded that National had not been in the business of selling automobiles for the purpose of the exclusion. Similarly, in <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Manley, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 126, this court (Div. Four) held that the statutory exclusion did not apply to a rented trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Further illustrations of the purpose of the exclusionary clause of subdivision (d)(2) are <em>Zurich-American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 481 [149 Cal.Rptr. 472]; <em>Tilley v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 263 [148 Cal.Rptr. 520]; and <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 554 [80 Cal.Rptr. 197], <em>Zurich-American, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d 481, involved an accident which occurred while the permissive user was en route to deliver the accident vehicle after repairing it. The appellate court concluded that this use came within the statutory phrase with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>insureds engaged in one of the eight enumerated businesses or activities. The court, however, at page 488, refused to follow a literal reading of the statute and held that the fact that the owner of the vehicle happened to be engaged in one of the enumerated businesses could not be used to produce a result not intended by the statute. In <em>Tilley, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 263, the accident vehicle was an automobile loaned to the permissive driver by an automobile repair business for use while the driver\u2019s automobile was being repaired. The appellate court held that the policy\u2019s exclusion as to \u201cgarage customers\u201d was valid pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(2). In <em>Travelers Indemnity, supra, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 554, Travelers issued to Feigin an automobile policy that excluded coverage to an \u201cowned automobile while used in the automobile business;\u201d the latter term was defined in terms of the statute. The accident occurred while the vehicle was being road tested by the employee of the dealer to whom Feigin had taken it for repairs. In rejecting Travelers\u2019 contention that the automobile was being used \u201cin the automobile business\u201d within the terms of the policy exclusion, the court noted at page 560 that such an exclusion for the particular transaction could not be logically deduced from the language of the policy and also was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In <em>Great American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Globe Indem. Co. </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 938 [87 Cal.Rptr. 653], the court in rejecting the insurer\u2019s contention that a servicer, installer and repairer of two-way radio equipment was within the statutory exclusion, stated, at page 946, that <em>legislative enactments purporting to modify the public policy requiring coverage of permissive users must be strictly construed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The same is true of the parallel provisions of section 11580.9, subdivision (a) where the operative fact is the \u201cuse of accident vehicles.\u201d <em>(Zurich-American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d 481, 488; <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Carriers Ins. Co., supra, </em>45 Cal.App.3d 223, p. 228; cf. <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Manley, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d, p. 131.) Contrary to the Farmers Group contention, the approach of <em>Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 142, is still the appropriate one: the statute requiring coverage of permissive users is a \u201csound rule of public policy,\u201d and no intention to overturn that policy will be attributed to the Legislature without the most cogent and convincing evidence. The Legislature\u2019s continued retention of the same eight narrow types of short-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>activities in the above discussed statutes in the light of the consistent narrow and strict interpretations by the courts, speaks for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In <em>Cal-Farm Ins. Companies </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund American Ins. Companies, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d 1063, cited by Farmers Group here, the leasing company\u2019s insurer successfully invoked the exclusion of section 11580.9, subdivision (b) to a two-year written lease. The trial court specifically found that the leasing company was engaged in the enumerated businesses since the automobiles were \u201c\u2018usually sold .. . under and by means of a lease plan whereby the prospective purchaser took possession of said automobile under a lease pending the completion of said sale\u2019\u201d (p. 1071). The Court of Appeal, in affirming, also noted, at page 1072, that \u201cThe <em>lease was a vehicle </em>for selling. In <em>all cases </em>the <em>car </em>was <em>ultimately sold before the lease </em>obligations <em>were </em>terminated.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Here, of course, there is no contention that the short-term rental to Lovy was, in fact, a sale of the vehicle. Rather, Farmers Group attempts to justify the application of the exclusion on the ground that the major portion of Hopkins\u2019 business was in the specifically enumerated permissible activities. This contention, of course, overlooks the fact that as to the lease with Lovy for the particular accident vehicle, Hopkins was in the <em>rental </em>business, which is not one of the eight enumerated types of activities. We can only conclude that the court erred in applying the narrow exception of section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(2) to a use that arose out of a different and nonenumerated business, the rental of the accident vehicle. In view of this exclusion, we need not discuss in detail the third factor (i.e., exclusion of other drivers covered by other insurers from the definition of named insured, see p. 853 above), on which the trial court based its conclusion of no coverage. We merely note that the trial court\u2019s reading of clause 4 of the definitions (quoted above at p. 853) to exclude renters cannot be justified when the policy is read as a whole. The very next page of the policy lists exclusion 5 for automobiles \u201cwhile rented or leased to others\u201d with certain exceptions not here relevant. Farmers Group has conceded the illegality of exclusion 5. However, paragraph (4) of the definitions of insured cannot logically be read to create indirectly an exclusion which duplicates the admittedly illegal exclusion of rented vehicles by exclusion 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court also erred in concluding that Farmers unitized policy No. 9111-04-39 did not provide coverage on the ground that Hopkins was engaged in one of the eight specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>business activities listed in section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We hold that the unitized policy also afforded coverage to Kondrack and defer to a subsequent portion of this opinion our discussion of whether its coverage was primary or excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Next, we direct our attention to Truck Insurance Exchange policy No. 9372-04-79, the \u201cumbrella\u201d policy. Farmers Group concedes, and the trial court found, that there would be no coverage pursuant to the provisions of the umbrella policy unless the unitized policy, discussed above, afforded coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The trial court\u2019s pertinent findings as to the umbrella policy are set forth below.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In view of the above mentioned concession, we conclude that since the unitized policy affords coverage to its limits, the umbrella policy also does. However, we are constrained to comment briefly on the court\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the \u201cconditions\u201d of the umbrella policy and its purported definition of \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">A careful reading indicates that the portion of the conditions of the umbrella policy on which the court relied, set forth below,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> dealt with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number><em>limits </em>of liability rather than \u201cexclusions,\u201d which are set forth in a different portion of the policy. We note that in interpreting the phrase \u201cunderlying limits\u201d in the conditions clause of the umbrella policy, the court defined the phrase \u201cunderlying limits\u201d of the conditions clause by referring <em>only </em>to subdivision (a) and totally ignored subdivision (b). Thus, the court concluded that the \u201cunderlying limits\u201d referred to by subdivision (a) meant only the limits of the unitized policy. However, subdivision (b) of the umbrella policy conditions clause contains an alternative definition of \u201cunderlying limits,\u201d namely, the retained limit (an amount of $10,000, a form of self-insurance) which applies <em>if the occurrence is not covered by such underlying insurance. </em>Thus, the insurance afforded by the umbrella policy is excess over: 1) the underlying insurance defined in the policy; <em>or </em>2) the retained limits of $10,000 if the underlying insurance does not cover the occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">We also note that the construction of the conditions clause which results in a conclusion of no coverage is contrary to Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (a), which requires that every policy must contain the provisions set forth in subdivision (b), including affording the same coverage to permissive users as that afforded to the named insured. So far as here pertinent, Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cNo policy of automobile liability insurance described in Section 16057 of the Vehicle Code covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in this state on or after the effective date of this section unless it contains the provisions set forth in subdivision (b). However, <em>none of the requirements of subdivision (b) shall apply </em>to the insurance afforded under any such policy (1) <em>to the extent that such insurance exceeds the limits </em>specified in subdivision (a) of Section 16059 of the Vehicle Code, or (2) <em>if such policy contains an underlying insurance requirement, or provides for a retained limit of self-insurance, equal to or greater than the limits specified in subdivision (a) of Section 16059 of the Vehicle Code.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Contrary to the contentions of Farmers Group, the circumstances for which clause 2, subdivision (a), quoted above, permits issuance of a policy that does not comply with subdivision (b) are that the policy must: 1) contain an underlying insurance requirement; <em>or </em>2) provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>a retained limit of self-insurance equal to, or greater than, the limits required by the Vehicle Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cunderlying insurance requirement,\u201d as used in the statute was defined by this court in <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 53 Cal.App.3d 126, at page 130, as follows: \u201c\u2018Underlying insurance\u2019 is <em>any other insurance purchased by the insured which covers the same losses </em>and which will be <em>primarily </em>liable therefor. (See <em>Otter </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 940, 945-946, 953 [109 Cal.Rptr. 831].)\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In <em>Manley, </em>supra, the insurer relied on two clauses of its policy to argue that it had met the underlying insurance requirement of the statute. The first stated the insurance afforded by the policy \u201cshall be excess over any other insurance available to the insured.\u201d Justice Christian held, at page 131: \u201cThe clause does not satisfy the underlying insurance requirement of the statute; rather, it is an attempt to establish that any other insurance which the insured Stevens should obtain would be treated as the underlying insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The second clause on which the insurer relied required that the insured trailer be rented only to persons who had automobile liability insurance. As to this provision, Justice Christian held, at page 131, that it \u201cappears to require underlying insurance coverage,\u201d but concluded that it was not operative as a result of Insurance Code section 11580.9. In <em>Manley, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 126, Justice Christian also firmly rejected, at pages 131 and 132, an argument identical to that made by Farmers Group here, namely, that there was no longer a public policy in this state against depriving permissive users of coverage under the policy of an insured owner of a vehicle and we see no need to repeat that language here.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The instant umbrella clause contained neither an underlying insurance requirement<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> nor a retained limit<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of self-insurance equal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Vehicle Code requirements. Thus, the umbrella policy did not meet the requirements of Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (a)(2), quoted above. We conclude, therefore, that the umbrella policy also afforded coverage to Kondrack up to its limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">As we have concluded that there is coverage under each of the three Farmers Group policies discussed above, we turn briefly to the other policies before resolving the question of primary and excess coverages and duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The court found, so far as pertinent, that: \u201cMid-Century Insurance Company had issued a policy entitled \u2018automobile dealer\u2019s special loan car policy\u2019 [a daily rental policy], Policy No. 9564-04-39, with Hopkins as named insured and with limits of $100,000 .. . hereafter ... the \u2018rental\u2019 policy..... The <em>Mid-Century </em>\u2018rental\u2019 <em>policy provides no coverage to Kondrack, Hopkins </em>or anyone else for the ... May 27, 1973 accident. The Mid-Century \u2018rental\u2019 policy was not designed to apply unless an automobile was rented pursuant to a written Mid-Century Insurance Company rental agreement form. . .. The 1973 Honda automobile rented by Lovy was not rented pursuant to a Mid-Century rental agreement form but was ... rented pursuant to an Allied Auto Rental Association form.... Hopkins never paid any premium ... to Mid-Century ... for coverage under the Mid-Century rental policy. .. . Hopkins chose to insure its rental operations through Carriers ... rather than Mid-Century .. . because the coverage under the Carriers policy was cheaper than coverage under the Mid-Century policy.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cAllied specifically represented that it could place insurance coverage for the Hopkins rental operations with Carriers ... and Hopkins consented to the placement of insurance coverage for the rental operations with Carriers.... Mid-Century never charged Hopkins any premium for coverage under the Mid-Century rental policy. The Mid-Century rental policy was a policy specifically designed by the Farmers . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Group to be made available to automobile dealers to cover rental operations, if . . . automobile dealerships chose to utilize . . . coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">\u201cThe Mid-Century rental policy contains a Paragraph 14 entitled \u2018Other Insurance\u2014Coverages A and B\u2019 [Coverage A .. . bodily injury liability . .. and Coverage B . .. property damage coverage], which provides as follows: \u2018However, as respects persons other than the named insured and the lessee or renter named in Daily Rental Agreements and Certificates of Insurance issued to form a part of this policy, Coverages <em>A and B shall not apply if there is other valid and collectible insurance applicable to the same loss covering such other person as a named insured </em>or as agent or employee of a named insured <em>under a policy with limits at least equal to the financial responsibility requirements specified in the motor vehicle laws or the state in which the Daily Rental Agreement and Certificate of Insurance is issued.'\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201cEven if the Mid-Century rental policy had been utilized, there would be no coverage available to Kondrack under the Mid-Century rental policy by reason of Paragraph 14 in light of the fact that Kondrack had other valid and collectible insurance available to him through State Farm and Carriers. . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cThe <em>Carriers \u2018combination policy\u2019 does provide coverage to Kondrack and Hopkins. ... </em> The <em>Carriers \u2018excess\u2019 </em>policy provides <em>no coverage to Kondrack </em>.... The Carriers excess policy does not insure a lessee or rentee or a permittee of such lessee or rentee as defined in the Carriers combination policy.. . . The Carriers excess policy specifically contains an underlying insurance requirement, and there was underlying insurance through the Carriers combination policy equal to the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201cThe Carriers excess policy, therefore, does not provide coverage to Kondrack, although the <em>Carriers excess policy does provide coverage to </em>Carriers\u2019 named insured, <em>Hopkins.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u201cThe <em>State Farm </em>policy <em>provides coverage </em>in the amount of $50,000 <em>to Kondrack . .. </em>[and].... <em>to Hopkins.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">We agree that the Mid-Century Insurance Company policy issued by the Farmers Group afforded no coverage for the reasons stated above by the trial court in its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>There has never been any dispute that the State Farm policy affords coverage to Kondrack and that the Carriers\u2019 combination auto policy No. ACU-103-1127 with limits of 15/30 covers both Kondrack and Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">We turn next to the question of whether the Carriers\u2019 excess policy covers both Kondrack and Hopkins or only Hopkins. The Carriers excess policy provides 85/270 limits of coverage for \u201cExcess Loss\u201d defined, so far as pertinent, as sums paid in settlements of losses for which the insured is liable after making deductions for all other insurance, including the policy of the primary insurer. Primary insurance is defined as the policy described by item 3 of the declarations, namely, Carriers\u2019 combination auto policy No. ACU-103-1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Carriers\u2019 excess policy also states conspicuously in capital letters that it does not apply to, and does not insure any lessee or rentee as defined in the primary policy and its endorsements or any permissive user of any automobile. This exclusion is valid under Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4), which is quoted above at footnote 5 on page 843. Although section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4) requires coverage of permissive users, 11580.1, subdivision (a), quoted above at page 859, provides that none of the requirements of subdivision (b) apply to a policy to the extent that its coverage exceeds the 15/30 limits specified by former Vehicle Code section 16059 (presently Veh. Code, \u00a7 16056; see fn. 23 at p. 859 above); <em>or </em>if the policy contains an underlying insurance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Carriers\u2019 excess policy applies only in excess of the 15/30 limits required by the Vehicle Code, and condition 2 of the Carriers policy provides that: \u201cIt is a condition of this insurance that the primary insurance shall be maintained in full effect during the currency of this insurance.\u201d As indicated above, the Carriers\u2019 excess policy specifically sets forth that the Carriers 15/30 combination auto policy as the underlying insurance. Accordingly, the Carriers excess policy affords coverage <em>only to </em>the named insured <em>Hopkins (National Indemnity </em>v. <em>Manley, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 126).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">To determine the issue of primary or excess coverage among all of the instant policies that provide coverage to Kondrack, we turn to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>then applicable version of Insurance Code section 11580.9, which is set forth below,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> so far as pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The trial court concluded that since Hopkins was engaged in the business of selling, repairing, and servicing, the statutory presumptions of Insurance Code section 11580.9, subdivision (a) became operative, and Carriers\u2019 obligation to indemnify under its combination policy was excess, as Kondrack, the operator of the accident vehicle, was afforded \u201cother\u201d (i.e., primary) coverage by his State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">However, as we have discussed above, section 11580.9, subdivision (a) is <em>in pari materia </em>with section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(2), and under the latter statute, as to the transaction with Lovy, Hopkins was <em>not </em>engaged in any of the enumerated businesses. Our conclusion is buttressed further by <em>Zurich-American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>supra, 85 Cal.App.3d 481. As indicated above, in <em>Zurich-American, </em>the owner of the accident vehicle was engaged in one of the eight enumerated occupations and the permissive operator, a mechanic, also was engaged in one of the eight occupations. The court rejected the argument of the owner\u2019s insurer that under a literal construction of Insurance Code section 11580.9, subdivision (a), its policy afforded no coverage. The court held, at page 488, that the mere fact that the owner happened to be engaged in one of the enumerated businesses could not be used to produce a result not intended by the statute. The court then applied subdivision (a) to conclude that the coverage afforded by the driver\u2019s policy was primary coverage, and that afforded by the owner\u2019s policy, secondary.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Here, of course, since Kondrack is not engaged in one of the enumerated businesses, subdivision (a) does not apply; subdivision (d), quoted above at footnote 26 on page 864, does.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The Truck Insurance Exchange comprehensive liability, the Farmer\u2019s unitized, and the Carriers\u2019 combination auto policies have no applicable excess provisions as to other insurance and, therefore, as the insurers of the \u201cowned automobile,\u201d afford primary coverage in proportion to the respective limits ($500,000; $500,000; and $15,000) of each policy and should prorate the first $1,015,000 of any judgment or settlement. The State Farm policy provides for excess coverage on nonowned automobiles and, therefore is next in order, as to its limits of $50,000. As the Truck Insurance Exchange umbrella policy provides that it is excess over all other valid and collectible insurance, it affords coverage for the remainder up to its limits of $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">As to the duty to defend, all of the policies provide for defense of the insured as to the coverage afforded by the policy. Thus, the Truck Insurance Exchange comprehensive liability, the Farmer\u2019s unitized, and the Carriers combination auto policies, as the primary coverage, share the duty of defense of <em>both </em>Hopkins and Kondrack. The costs of defense should be prorated in proportion to the amount paid by each insurer in settlement or judgment <em>(Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 791 [129 Cal.Rptr. 47]).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In view of the above, we cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion No. 11 that the provisions of the policies in issue restricting or limiting coverage on Kondrack are clear. To the contrary, the provisions of the policies here in issue present an eloquent argument for the enactment of legislation in this state requiring all insurance policies<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to be written in terms \u201cclear to the ordinary mind\u201d (see <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Indem. Co., supra, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 554, at p. 560, quoting from <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co. </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 201, at p. 207 [318 P.2d 94]). We reiterate that insurance policies should be written in terms that can be understood by ordinary and reasonable consumers instead of the monstrous convoluted legal gibberish present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>We conclude that in No. 43504, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>No. 41981</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We turn briefly to No. 41981, the appeal by Lovy, State Farm and the Farmers Group, from the summary judgment in favor of Employers Reinsurance Corporation (Employers),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the insurer on the eighth and last policy here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The Employers policy was issued to Allied, the corporation which assisted Hopkins in setting up its rental department. As explained above, Allied arranged for the insurance for Hopkins\u2019 rental operations. (See fn. 14, p. 852 above.) The effective date of the policy issued by Employers to Allied as named insured was November 1, 1972. Pursuant to an endorsement No. 1, as of that date, Hopkins was listed as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The Employers\u2019 policy was an \u201cexcess\u201d one, which provided that Employers would indemnify the insured against certain specified losses in excess of the applicable underlying limit of $100,000.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The policy provided that coverage was afforded for <em>\u201closs sustained by the insured on account of liability imposed upon the insured by law </em>for damages\u201d (italics added). As an excess policy, the Employers policy was not required to afford \u201comnibus\u201d coverage for permissive users of vehicles, pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (b), quoted above at footnote 5, page 843. As detailed above, the statute mandates coverage only as to those policies for which limits were prescribed by Vehicle Code section 16059.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Although Hopkins was added to the Employers policy by endorsement 1, effective November 1, 1972, the coverage for Hopkins as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d was <em>deleted </em>from the policy by endorsement 3, dated <em>March 26, 1973, </em>and effective November 1, 1972. As the instant accident occurred on May 27, 1973, two months after the date of endorsement 3, we do not have to reach the question of the validity of the retroactive deletion. There can be no question that after March 26, 1973, Hopkins was no longer an \u201cadditional insured\u201d on the Employers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The instant record indicates that Levy\u2019s complaint for declaratory relief did not name Allied as a defendant. As to Employers, Lovy alleged that the Employers policy afforded coverage on behalf of Hopkins as owner of the accident vehicle. Subsequently, Lovy conceded that pursuant to Vehicle Code section 17151, the liability of Hopkins as an owner was limited to $15,000.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Contrary to the contentions of Lovy, Farmers Group and State Farm, <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Manley, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 126, is not apposite, as the policy involved in <em>Manley, </em>unlike the instant Employers policy, was not an excess one.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The major contention on this appeal is that the trial court erred in concluding that the deletion of Hopkins as an additional insured by endorsement 3 was valid and, therefore, the Employers policy afforded no coverage to Hopkins. Lovy, Farmers Group and State Farm argue that endorsement 3 was ineffective, as it did not comply with the 10-day notice requirement of the cancellation provisions of the Employers policy; and that in any event, the provisions of the policy cancellation clause were so ambiguous that there were triable issues of fact as to its meaning and thus no basis for summary judgment in favor of Employers. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The cancellation clause of the Employers policy provided: \u201cThis <em>policy </em>may be cancelled by the Corporation by mailing to the Insured at the address shown in this policy written notice stating when <em>not less than 10 days thereafter such cancellation shall be effective.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The cancellation clause, by its terms, applied only to a cancellation of the policy and not to the mere deletion of an additional insured.  Ordinarily, as used in insurance policies, the term \u201ccancellation\u201d refers to: 1) an abrogation of the entire policy of insurance; or 2) that portion of the policy which remains unperformed on the date of cancellation <em>(Clauson </em>v. <em>Industrial Indem. Co. </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 440 [50 Cal.Rptr. 615]; <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Northwestern Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 204 [94 Cal.Rptr. 586]; <em>Spott Electrical Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indem. Co. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 797 [106 Cal.Rptr. 710]; cf. also Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 660-679.6). Consistently, the above authorities refer to the \u201ccancellation <em>of the policy.\u201d </em>The term cancellation is not used to refer to amendments, adjustments or modifications to any of the specific provisions within the policy. As stated in <em>Mamula </em>v. <em>McCulloch </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 184, at page 197 [79 Cal.Rptr. 571]: \u201c\u2018To <em>\u201ccancel\u201d </em>a contract means to <em>abrogate </em>so much of it [the contract] as remains unperformed. It differs from \u201crescission,\u201d which means to restore the parties to their former position. The one refers to the state of things at the time of cancellation; the other to the state of things existing when the contract was made.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Endorsement 3 was not a \u201ccancellation\u201d of the policy within the insurance usage of the term discussed above. Endorsement 3 did not purport to abrogate the policy, but only affected a modification of the policy by deleting an additional insured. The date of execution of endorsement 3 and its purpose were established by the uncontroverted declaration of John Pellat.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Lovy, Farmers Group and State Farm argue that Pellat\u2019s declaration did not establish proof that Hopkins had notice of the deletion. The record, however, indicates that Pellat\u2019s declaration, with its supporting points and authorities, was filed on December 17, 1977. The hearing on the motion for summary judgment was set for and occurred on January 19, 1977. Lovy, Farmers Group and State Farm submitted no counter-affidavits or other evidence to establish that endorsement 3 was a unilateral act on the part of Employers, and made no offer of proof to establish that Hopkins had no knowledge of the deletion. Further, there was no request for a continuance of the hearing for the purpose of adducing counteraffidavits. Thus, there was no factual showing to contradict Employers\u2019 showing that the coverage afforded to Hopkins as an additional insured by endorsement 1, subsequently was deleted properly from its policy by endorsement 3. Similary on this appeal, there has been no offer of proof or explanation for the delay. Thus, Employers met its burden of affirmatively showing that there were no triable issues of fact <em>(Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 285 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206]).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We can only conclude that in No. 41981, the trial court properly entered the summary judgment in favor of Employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In No. 43504, the judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to enter a judgment as follows: the Truck Insurance Exchange comprehensive (No. 9464-04-39), Farmers\u2019 unitized (No. 9111-04-39), and the Carriers combination (No. ACA-102-1127) policies afford primary coverage in proportion to the respective limits of each policy ($500,000; $500,000; and $15,000) and should prorate the first $1,015,000 of any judgment or settlement; the State Farm excess policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>is next in order as to its limits of $50,000; and the Truck Insurance Exchange umbrella policy (No. 9372-04-79) affords coverage for the balance to its limits of $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The Truck Insurance Exchange comprehensive liability, the Farmers unitized comprehensive liability, and Carriers combination policies as the instruments of primary coverage, share the duty of defense of both Hopkins and Kondrack.

Here, of course, there is no contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>or evidence that Hopkins met the requirements of Vehicle Code sections 16052 and 16053. Clause 1 of subdivision (b) of Insurance Code section 11580.1 also does not permit the total escape from liability here found by the trial court and claimed by Farmers Group. Clause 1 excuses compliance with the requirement of subdivision (b) to the extent that the automobile liability insurance exceeds the financial responsibility limits specified in subdivision (a) of former Vehicle Code section 16059. Here, the court found and Farmers Group contends that the umbrella policy provided no coverage at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\u201c(a) Where two or more policies affording valid and collectible automobile liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle in an occurrence out of which a liability loss shall arise, and one of such policies affords coverage to a named insured engaged in the business of selling, repairing, servicing, delivering, testing, road-testing, parking, or storing motor vehicles, then both of the following shall be conclusively presumed: [II] (1) <em>If. at the time of loss, the motor vehicle is being operated by any person engaged in any of such businesses, or by his employee or agent, the insurance afforded by the policy issued to the person engaged in such business shall be </em>primary, and the <em>insurance </em>afforded by <em>any other policy shall be excess. </em>[H] (2) If, at the time of loss, the <em>motor vehicle </em>is being <em>operated by any person other than as described in paragraph (I </em>j, the <em>insurance afforded </em>by the policy issued to any person engaged in any of such businesses <em>shall be excess over all other insurance available to such operator as a named insured or </em>otherwise\u201d (italics added).... \u201c(d) Except as provided in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), where two or more policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle in an occurrence out of which a liability loss shall arise, it shall be conclusively presumed that the insurance afforded by that policy in which such motor vehicle is described or rated as an owned automobile shall be primary and the insurance afforded by any other policy or policies shall be excess.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">We note that legislation of this type recently has been enacted in New York.
