We reject this contention. Argueta was linked to the enterprise on the basis of police surveillance, intercepted phone calls, and the statements of the informant. Additionally, Ar-gueta had been in contact with local police about the drug scheme; he had also been convicted of possession of contraband at his place of business earlier. Taken together, there was no lack of evidence presented to support the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause for issuance of the search warrant. Our conclusion is bolstered by our obligation to be deferential to a magistrate\u2019s issuance of a search warrant. <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>923 F.2d 1346, 1351 n. 9 (9th Cir.1991), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Ruiz, </em>257 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Argueta also contends that the district court improperly denied his motion to reconsider the denial based on an allegation of a <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>violation. We disagree. Argueta failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that there was a <em>Franks </em>violation. There was ample evidence to support the probable cause determination even if the affidavit included reference to Argueta\u2019s prior (but limited) cooperation with local police. Moreover, had the agent mentioned Argueta\u2019s prior cooperation in the'affidavit, the decision to find probable cause would have been strengthened because Argueta\u2019s prior cooperation focused on what he knew of the Nava-Banuelos Organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b993-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
