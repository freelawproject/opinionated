We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the dismissal, <em>Wyatt v. Terhune </em>280 F.3d 1238, 1244-45 (9th Cir.2002), and for abuse of discretion the denial of reconsideration, <em>Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-24\">The district court properly dismissed Gonzalez\u2019s action without prejudice because Gonzalez admitted in his complaint that he did not attempt to file an administrative grievance. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740-41, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Gonzalez\u2019s contentions that administrative procedures could not remedy his medical injuries, and that he could not have filed a timely grievance because he was incapacitated for 21 days following surgery are unavailing. Gonzalez has not shown that a late filing would have been rejected. The exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1017-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
