The first two concern adversary proceedings filed by two of Green\u2019s creditors, Massachusetts Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cMCIC\u201d) and LifeU-SA Insurance Company (\u201cLifeUSA\u201d). The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in part to MCIC and LifeUSA and in part to Green. Different district judges affirmed each case. The third appeal is from Green\u2019s civil rights suit against the law firm and two attorneys who represented the insurance companies in the bankruptcy proceedings (collectively \u201cthe attorneys\u201d). Magistrate Judge Nolan, hearing that case by consent, dismissed all but one of Green\u2019s claims for failure to state a claim and granted summary judgment to the attorneys on the remaining claim. We affirm all three judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">A. Green\u2019s Insurance Policies With MCIC and LifeUSA</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Green, a then-licensed clinical psychologist,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied in December 1993 for disability insurance from MCIC and life insurance from LifeUSA. The latter policy included a rider that would waive premium payments if Green were ever disabled. On each application Green represented that he had never been treated for mental, nervous, or emotional conditions and that in the previous five years he had not received or been refused disability or medical benefits. Green also authorized the release of his medical records to the companies, effective for two and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">In June 1994 Green suffered a stroke and began receiving disability benefits from MCIC. Pursuant to the policy rider, LifeUSA waived Green\u2019s life insurance premiums. Both companies investigated Green\u2019s benefit claims and learned that Dr. Patrick Israel had treated Green for stress, anxietv, and depression from 1985 until 1994. They also learned that Green had been receiving disability benefits from the United States Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs based on his 1968 diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">In September 1995 MCIC sued Green in Illinois state court seeking to rescind its disability coverage and receive payment of disbursed benefits because Green had materially misrepresented his medical history on his application forms. LifeUSA also sued in state court to rescind the rider (but not the life insurance policy) and receive payment of waived premiums. While these cases were pending, Green obtained his original medical records from Dr. Israel and destroyed them before MCIC and LifeUSA could obtain copies through discovery. As a discovery sanction, the Illinois court awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to MCIC and LifeUSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">B. Bankruptcy Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">In October 1997 Green filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, and the Illinois cases were automatically stayed under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. In March 1998 Green\u2019s case was converted under Chapter 7, and the trustee of his bankruptcy estate had the power to assume Green\u2019s executo-ry contracts until 60 days after the March conversion date. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>\u00a7 365(d)(1), (2). The trustee did not assume Green\u2019s insurance policies, and in August 1998 the bankruptcy court ordered that Green be released from all discharge-able debts, but left open the possibility that it could later deem specific debts non-dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">During the bankruptcy proceedings, MCIC and LifeUSA filed separate adversary complaints seeking a declaration that Green\u2019s debts to them were nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(a)(6). In response Green filed numerous counterclaims based on common law theories. Green did not schedule his counterclaims as assets under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521, and the bankruptcy court invited the trustee to move to vacate the estate\u2019s no asset report and pursue the counterclaims on the estate\u2019s behalf. The trustee declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Green then moved to exclude the medical information that MCIC and LifeUSA obtained through their investigations. He argued that the Illinois Mental Health and Development Disability Confidentiality Act (\u201cConfidentiality Act\u201d), 740 ILCS 110/1, prevented the use of his medical records. The bankruptcy court concluded that the Confidentiality Act allows the disclosure of such records when an individual\u2019s mental condition is material to a claim or defense in proceedings involving the validity of disability benefits. <em>See </em>740 ILCS 110/10(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">MCIC, LifeUSA, and Green filed cross motions for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court granted MCIC\u2019s motion regarding Green\u2019s obligation to repay the disability benefits because Green fraudulently omitted significant portions of his medical history in applying for disability coverage. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). The court, however, denied LifeUSA\u2019s motion and discharged Green\u2019s debt for waived premiums because the company had not disbursed any benefits to Green and thus held only a fully dischargeable, unsecured claim for insurance premiums. <em>See id. </em>The bankruptcy judge also concluded that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded to MCIC and LifeUSA during the Illinois litigation were dischargeable because the insurance companies did not allege, nor did the Illinois court find, that Green intended harm by destroying his medical records. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). Finally, relying on the Illinois Insurance Code, 215 ILCS 5/15, the bankruptcy court rescinded Green\u2019s disability coverage as well as the rider to the LifeU-SA policy, although the court refused to rescind the life insurance policy itself because LifeUSA had waived rescission by not seeking that relief in state court. <em>See </em>215 ILCS 5/224(c). But even though Li-feUSA could not rescind the policy, the court deemed it rejected because the trustee failed to assume it under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The bankruptcy court next dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction Green\u2019s counterclaims against LifeUSA and all but two of his counterclaims against MCIC, concluding that they were \u201cnon-core\u201d because the trustee\u2019s abandonment of them under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a) <em>&amp; </em>(d) rendered them unrelated to the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a), (b)(2)(C). The court determined, however, that the trustee\u2019s abandonment of Green\u2019s two breach-of-contract claims against MCIC had not deprived it of jurisdiction because they were compulsory and arose from the same transaction as MCIC\u2019s rescission claim, <em>see </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7013, though the bankruptcy court then granted summary judgment to MCIC on those counterclaims because Green\u2019s insurance policies with MCIC had been rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Green appealed both cases to the district court. Separate district court judges af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>firmed the judgments for substantially the same reasons as the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">C. Green\u2019s Civil Rights Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">While Green\u2019s appeals of the adversary proceedings were pending in the district court, he filed suit under various statutes and rules, alleging that the attorneys for MCIC and LifeUSA had violated his civil rights, improperly shared his confidential medical records, and made false representations to the bankruptcy court. Green also alleged various ethical violations by the bankruptcy judge. The magistrate judge dismissed Green\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 because he failed to allege racial discrimination and dismissed his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because the attorneys were not acting under color of state law. The magistrate judge granted the attorneys summary judgment on Green\u2019s claim under the Confidentiality Act, 740 ILCS 110, for the same reasons the bankruptcy judge admitted Green\u2019s medical records. <em>See </em>740 ILCS 110/10(a)(7). The magistrate judge dismissed Green\u2019s claims under the Restatement of Bill of Rights for Mental Health Patients. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10841. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, and the Rules of Professional Conduct for the Northern District of Illinois because they do not create enforceable federal rights or private rights of action. Lastly, the magistrate judge dismissed Green\u2019s claims against the bankruptcy judge because he failed to name the judge as a defendant, and, in any event, the judge would have been entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In addition to his appellate briefs, Green filed in this court a \u201cMotion for Judgement [sic] on the Merits,\u201d arguing that his debts to MCIC and LifeUSA were discharged by the bankruptcy court\u2019s August 1998 order of discharge. That argument, as well as most of Green\u2019s arguments in his appellate briefs, is unsupported by legal authority and fails to address the legal issues in the lower courts\u2019 orders. Although we construe <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally, <em>Greer v. Bd. of Educ., </em>267 F.3d 723, 727 (7th Cir.2001), even <em>pro se </em>litigants must provide a legal basis for their arguments, <em>see Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). Because Green has waived these undeveloped arguments, see <em>United States v. Lanzotti, </em>205 F.3d 951, 957 (7th Cir.2000), we address only the arguments for which Green provides a legal argument namely, Green\u2019s challenges to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fraud, to the rescission of the LifeUSA rider, to the dismissals of his counterclaims, and to the dismissal of his \u00a7 1981 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Green first argues that the bankruptcy court in the MCIC case erred in \u201cbasing any decision on fraud\u201d because he did not commit an affirmative act of fraud. Green\u2019s argument is somewhat difficult to discern, but it appears that he is challenging (1) the conclusion that his debt to MCIC for disability benefits is nondisehargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), and (2) the rescission of the MCIC disability coverage under 215 ILCS 5/154. In support of his argument Green cites three Illinois cases that explain the doctrine of fraudulent concealment-a doctrine that tolls the statute of limitations when an individual affirmatively acts to prevent the discovery of a cause of action. <em>See Lipscomb ex rel. Lipscomb v. Wells, </em>326 Ill.App.3d 760, 260 Ill.Dec. 374, 761 N.E.2d 218, 222 (Ill.App.Ct.2001). But fraudulent concealment is not at issue in this case. Moreover, an affirmative act of fraud is not required to declare a debt nondischargeable, <em>McClellan v. Cantrell, </em>217 F.3d 890, 892 (7th Cir.2000), or to rescind an insurance policy in Illinois, 215 ILCS 5/154; <em>Northern Life </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. Ippolito Real Estate P\u2019ship, </em>234 Ill.App.3d 792, 176 Ill.Dec. 75, 601 N.E.2d 773, 779 (Ill.App.Ct.1992). We thus perceive no error in ordering rescission of the MCIC disabihty coverage or in finding that Green\u2019s debt to MCIC for poHcy benefits was nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Green next argues that, because the LifeUSA rider was a fuUy executed contract, the bankruptcy court erred by deeming it rejected by the bankruptcy trustee. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. Green misconstrues the bankruptcy court\u2019s disposition of the LifeUSA rider. The bankruptcy court did not deem the rider rejected under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365; rather, it rescinded the rider under 215 ILCS 5/154 based on Green\u2019s misrepresentations, and 215 ILCS 5/154 does not limit rescission to executory contracts. But Green also argues that the district court erred in rescinding the rider because contracts may not be rescinded without mutual consent. That argument is unavailing because mutual consent is not necessary to rescind a contract under 215 ILCS 5/154. A11 that is required is a misrepresentation that either was made with an intent to deceive or was material to the risk assumed by the insurance company. <em>Golden Rule Ins. Co., v. Schwartz, </em>323 Ill.App.3d 86, 256 Ill.Dec. 70, 751 N.E.2d 123, 128 (Ill.App.Ct.2001). Thus, because Green\u2019s omissions materiaUy altered the risk that LifeUSA assumed, the bankruptcy court correctly rescinded the LifeUSA rider under 215 ILCS 5/154.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Green next chaUenges the dismissal of his counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that MCIC and LifeUSA waived any challenge to jurisdiction by fading to object in the bankruptcy court. But parties cannot waive subject matter jurisdiction, and district courts have a duty to determine that subject matter jurisdiction exists. <em>Weaver v. Hollywood Casino-Aurora, Inc., </em>255 F.3d 379, 381 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Green also challenges the dismissal of his counterclaims against LifeUSA on the ground that those claims were \u201ccore\u201d because the value of the LifeUSA poHcy could have been used to pay off his creditors. The bankruptcy court dismissed the counterclaims for lack of jurisdiction on the theory that the trustee had abandoned them and consequently rendered them unrelated to the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a), (b)(2)(C). Green, though, never scheduled his counterclaims under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521, and a bankruptcy trustee cannot abandon unscheduled assets. <em>See In re Cundiff, </em>227 B.R. 476, 479 (B.A.P. 6th Cir.1998); <em>Jeffrey v. Desmond, </em>70 F.3d 183, 186 (1st Cir.1995): <em>Vreugdenhill v. Navistar Int\u2019l Transp. Corp., </em>950 F.2d 524, 526 (8th Cir.1991). But even though the trustee never abandoned the counterclaims, the trustee rejected the LifeUSA policy on which the counterclaims were based, and those claims could no longer affect the amount of property in the bankruptcy estate. Thus, the bankruptcy court properly dismissed Green\u2019s counterclaims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a); <em>In re FedPak Sys., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 207, 213-14 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Finally, Green argues in his suit against the attorneys that Magistrate Judge Nolan failed to take into account his <em>pro se </em>status when dismissing his \u00a7 1981 claim for faHure to state a claim. Section 1981 protects the rights of all persons to make and enforce contracts, in addition to protecting \u201cpersonal rights to sue, to testify, and to equal rights under all laws for the security of persons and property.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., </em>482 U.S. 656, 661, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987). The most common type of \u00a7 1981 suit involves racial discrimination in the employment setting, <em>see, e.g., Rivers v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Roadway Exp., Inc., </em>511 U.S. 298, 301, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994); <em>Curry v. Menard, Inc., </em>270 F.3d 473, 475 (7th Cir.2001), though \u00a7 1981 also encompasses other wrongs such as discriminatory police conduct, see <em>Smith v. City of Chicago Heights, </em>951 F.2d 834, 836 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Mahone v. Waddle, </em>564 F.2d 1018, 1027-28 (3d Cir.1977). Upon review of Green\u2019s amended complaint and lengthy brief, it is clear that he is merely challenging the bankruptcy court\u2019s adverse rulings. Because the proper avenue for those challenges is a direct appeal, the dismissal of his \u00a7 1981 claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we Affirm the judgments in all three appeals and Deny Green\u2019s \u201cMotion for Judgement [sic] on the Merits.\u201d This does not, however, dispose of all pending business in Green\u2019s cases. For two independent reasons, we hereby issue an Order To Show Cause to Green to explain why he should not be sanctioned for his conduct before this court. First, Green has filed both an earlier meritless appeal in this court, <em>Green v. Bendon, </em>281 F.3d 661, <em>supra </em>n. 1 (making him a repeat offender with these three), and in a series of cases, including the present three, <em>Bendon, </em>and others, he has filed numerous frivolous motions. (See, in addition to the cases cited, Nos. 00-3798 and 00-3777.) This course of conduct merits sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38. <em>Bethesda Lutheran Homes and Servs., Inc. v. Born, </em>238 F.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Berwick Grain Co., Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Agriculture, </em>217 F.3d 502, 505 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Meeks v. Jewel Co., </em>845 F.2d 1421, 1422 (7th Cir.1988) (frivolous motions included). Second, Green\u2019s brief in No. 01-2812 is filled with utterly inappropriate slurs based on the race and religion of the lawyers and judges involved in that matter. It so far departs from the standards of courtesy and professionalism required by this court \u2014 even for a <em>pro se </em>litigant \u2014 that sanctions appear appropriate. Green has 10 days from the date of this order to file his response to this Order To Show Cause why he should not be fined or otherwise sanctioned.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-10\">. <em>See Green v.
