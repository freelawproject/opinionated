The district court certified for appeal Page\u2019s claim that civil commitment proceedings pursuant to California\u2019s Sexually Violent Predators Act (\u201cCalifornia\u2019s SVPA\u201d) would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">Sammy Page is a serial rapist who has been repeatedly incarcerated for crimes spanning three decades. Page was scheduled to be released on parole in 1997. One month before his scheduled release date, the state filed a petition seeking Page\u2019s civil commitment under California\u2019s SVPA. <em>See </em>Welf. &amp; Inst.Code, \u00a7 6600 <em>et seq. </em>The state court found probable cause for Page to stand trial on the civil commitment proceedings. Page is currently in custody at a state mental hospital awaiting trial under California\u2019s SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">The district court noted that pre-trial habeas relief is generally precluded by <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), which requires federal courts to abstain from interfering with pending state proceedings. However, the court recognized that <em>Younger </em>does not prohibit pre-trial habeas review when the petitioner raises a colorable claim that the state proceeding will violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Mannes v. Gillespie, </em>967 F.2d 1310, 1312 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Hartley v. Neely, </em>701 F.2d 780, 781 (9th Cir.1983). The Double Jeopardy Clause states that \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. V. This has been interpreted as a prohibition \u201cnot against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy.\u201d <em>United States v. Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 669, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896), <em>quoted in Mannes, </em>967 F.2d at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">Page claims that a trial pursuant to California\u2019s SVPA would place him, for the second time, in jeopardy of punishment for his sexual offenses. The district court held that <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997), in which the Supreme Court rejected a double jeopardy claim against a Kansas statute \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to California\u2019s SVPA, \u201cforecloses any claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>the SVPA, on its face, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d In <em>Hendricks, </em>the Supreme Court held that the civil commitment authorized by Kansas\u2019s SVPA was not punitive and that therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. at 369. On the merits of Page\u2019s double jeopardy claim, we may grant habeas relief only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1). Page attempts to distinguish <em>Hendricks </em>in order to show that California\u2019s SVPA imposes punishment, but we find his arguments unpersuasive. The California State Supreme Court, following <em>Hendricks, </em>rejected similar arguments that California\u2019s SVPA civil commitment is punitive. <em>See Hubbart v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584, 611 (1999) (holding that California\u2019s SVPA does not impose punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause). In light of <em>Hendricks, </em>Page has not raised a colorable claim that California\u2019s SVPA is punitive. We must conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in applying <em>Younger </em>abstention to Page\u2019s double jeopardy claims. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Page\u2019s habeas claim does not, however, prejudice any constitutional claims that Page may bring at the end of a successful commitment proceeding by the state. We expect the state court will conduct the commitment proceeding in accordance with the constitutional requirements set forth in <em>Kansas v. Crane, </em>534 U.S. 407, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.Ed.2d 856 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The judgment of the district court denying Page\u2019s writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
