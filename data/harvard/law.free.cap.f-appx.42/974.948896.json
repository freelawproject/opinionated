We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Strubbe contends the district court erred by denying him the benefit of safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 because he maintained his innocence concerning his role in the offense at trial and sentencing. We review a district court\u2019s factual determination whether a defendant is eligible for safety-valve relief for clear error. <em>See United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996). The district court found Strubbe to be evasive about his role in the offense, even upon a third sentencing. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s findings were sufficient, and that they are not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, </em>163 F.3d 1142, 1143-44 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A2x\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
