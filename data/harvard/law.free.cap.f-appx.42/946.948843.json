At the time of his plea, a life sentence allowed for the possibility of parole. Brudos\u2019 biennial parole hearings were terminated in 1995, and he began receiving biennial consideration for a parole hearing in 1996. Brudos filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision\u2019s (\u201cParole Board\u2019s\u201d) decision to convert his parole hearings violated his due process rights. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">I. Facts and Prior Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">In 1969, when Brudos pled guilty, former Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 144.240 (repealed 1973) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-15\">No prisoner in the state penitentiary shall be paroled unless it is the opinion of the [Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision] that, within a reasonable probability, the prisoner will, after parole, remain outside the institution without violating the law and that such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">The Parole Board was required to bring \u201cbefore it all information regarding such convicted person\u201d within six months of incarceration, and after that from \u201ctime to time.\u201d Former Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 144.220 (repealed 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">In 1975, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 144.220 was repealed and replaced by former Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 144.221 (repealed 1977). The latter statute, made retroactive to previously convicted persons like Brudos, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-18\">In order to more accurately assess the status of a convicted person, the State Board of Parole ... shall personally interview each convicted person at least once every two years after his admission to a state penal or correctional institution until expiration of the convicted person\u2019s term of imprisonment. The interview shall not be characterized as a parole hearing and shall not be subject to parole hearing procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-19\">Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 144.221(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-20\">In 1979, Brudos began receiving biennial parole hearings. On June 21, 1995, the Parole Board issued an order denying Brudos parole and proclaiming, \u201cThere will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>be no further parole hearings.\u201d Brudos petitioned the Oregon Court of Appeals for judicial review of that order. After Bru-dos filed his brief in that proceeding, the Parole Board withdrew its order. On July 11, 1996, the Parole Board issued another order with respect to Brudos, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-4\">This review is to consider and clarify the statement in board action form # 8, (06/21/1995) in which it states there will be no further hearings. The rules in effect at the time of your crimes require the board to have you examined mentally and physically every two years, to review those reports and a report from the department of corrections, and determine if you should be considered for parole. Only if the board decides there is reason to believe you should be paroled, would a hearing be scheduled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Brudos filed an amended petition for review of this order. The Court of Appeals granted the Parole Board\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the July 11, 1996 order was non-reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">On August 5, 1996, Brudos filed a petition for state post-conviction relief contending that his convictions were wrongfully obtained in violation of his due process rights. He claimed that his trial counsel had advised him that he would be eligible for parole after ten years, and that his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because he \u201cwas unaware of the non-parolability of his sentence prior to the entry of his guilty plea.\u201d The state moved to dismiss on state procedural grounds. The Marion County Circuit Court granted the state\u2019s motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment without opinion. <em>See Brudos v. Thompson, </em>153 Or.App. 702, 957 P.2d 1230 (1998). The Oregon Supreme Court subsequently denied review. <em>See Brudos v. Thompson, </em>327 Or. 305, 966 P.2d 219 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">On December 7, 1999, Brudos filed in federal district court the amended petition for writ of habeas corpus that is presently before us (\u201cAmended Petition\u201d). Brudos contends in the Amended Petition that he was denied his right to due process when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ase-dedup-0\">in July 1995, the Oregon Parole Board decided that Petitioner would not receive any additional parole hearings. The Board took this action even though the relevant parole law in existence at the time of Petitioner\u2019s crime provided for periodic hearings by the Oregon Parole Board. The Board\u2019s action unlawfully converted Petitioners [sic] ordinary life sentences into life-without-parole sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">The state filed a motion to dismiss before the district court, arguing that the Parole Board\u2019s decision to grant biennial parole consideration rendered Brudos\u2019 claim moot. The district court agreed and granted the motion. The court also stated that even if the claim were not moot, Bru-dos\u2019 due process claim lacked merit because the statute in effect at the time Brudos was sentenced required only a review of his administrative file and a personal interview, both of which are provided by the biennial parole consideration. Bru-dos timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">A. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Brudos alleges in his Amended Petition that the Parole Board\u2019s 1995 order \u201cunlawfully converted his life sentences into life-without-parole sentences.\u201d The district court found that because the Parole Board rescinded its 1995 order and instated biennial parole consideration, \u201c[Brudos\u2019] sentence has not been altered to life without the possibility of parole,\u201d and his claim was therefore moot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution requires that \u201c \u2018the parties ... continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477-78, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA case is moot only if interim events have \u2018completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of an allegedly improper ruling.\u201d <em>In re Pintlar Corp., </em>124 F.3d 1310, 1312 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Wong v. Dept. of State, </em>789 F.2d 1380, 1384 (9th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The Parole Board\u2019s 1995 order in Bru-dos\u2019 case changed the procedure for considering Brudos\u2019 parole from providing full parole hearings to no consideration of parole eligibility. The 1996 \u201cclarifying\u201d order did not reinstate the former scale of consideration; rather it provided for a less formal process that <em>may, </em>depending on its results, allow for full parole hearings. The state does not dispute that in spite of the 1996 order, Brudos now receives less elaborate consideration for parole than he did before the 1995 order. Thus, interim events have not \u201ccompletely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of\u2019 the allegedly improper Parole Board order.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The Ninth Circuit stated in <em>In re Pint-lar </em>that \u201c[t]he party asserting mootness has a heavy burden to establish that there is <em>no </em>effective relief remaining for a court to provide.\u201d <em>In re Pintlar, </em>124 F.3d at 1312 (emphasis added). Brudos would attain greater relief than what the Parole Board has provided if we were to conclude that Brudos possesses a liberty interest in full parole hearings and order reinstatement of the full parole hearings. For these reasons, we hold that Brudos\u2019 claim is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">B. Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Brudos argues that because he pled guilty with the expectation of receiving biennial parole hearings, the 1995 order unconstitutionally deprived him of a liberty interest in those hearings and the 1996 \u201cclarifying\u201d order establishing the lesser parole review \u201cdid not fully cure the constitutional violation.\u201d The state claims that Brudos failed to present this due process claim to the state courts, and thus has failed to exhaust his state remedies. Regardless of whether Brudos exhausted his state remedies, we may deny his petition on the merits. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2) (\u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The actual statute in place at the time Brudos pled guilty was former Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 144.220 (repealed 1975), which only required that the Parole Board solicit \u201call information regarding such convicted person\u201d from \u201ctime to time.\u201d Former Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 144.221 (repealed 1977), which replaced Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 144.220 in 1975 and was retroactively applied to Brudos, mandated only a personal interview every two years, and specifically stated that the interview \u201cshall not be characterized as a parole hearing.\u201d We note that neither statute required a full parole hearing. Consequently we believe the biennial parole consideration provided by the 1996 \u201cclarifying\u201d order, entailing a biennial \u201cmentalf ] and physical ]\u201d examination and review of a report from the Department of Corrections, satisfies both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">Since the Parole Board\u2019s 1996 order, Brudos has been considered for parole on the basis of a \u201cpersonal interview\u201d and \u201ca full review of the boards file [sic] and the institution file.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that such a procedure for denying parole satisfies due process requirements. <em>See Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>442 U.S. 1, 14, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979) (holding that due process does not require \u201crepeated, adversary hearings in order to continue the confine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>ment\u201d). Brudos does not cite to any authority supporting the proposition that changing from one constitutionally permissible parole review method to another constitutionally permissible parole review method violates a prisoner\u2019s right to due process. There is also nothing in the record describing the exact nature or structure of the parole hearings Brudos received before 1996. Brudos has thus failed to show any material difference between his current parole review method and the former parole hearings. Without showing what he has allegedly lost in the transition to the current parole review method, Bru-dos cannot establish the constitutional significance of that alleged loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We hold, therefore, that the current form of parole consideration satisfies Bru-dos\u2019 rights to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b967-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
