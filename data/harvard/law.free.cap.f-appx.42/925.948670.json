We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Luis-Arias contends that the indictment was defective because it failed to allege the specific intent element of attempted reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Because Luis-Arias challenges the sufficiency of the indictment for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error and construe the indictment liberally in favor of validity. <em>See United States v. Godinez-Rabadan, </em>289 F.3d 630, 632 (9th Cir.2002). Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that Luis-Arias had sufficient notice that specific intent was an element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Alber, </em>56 F.3d 1106, 1111-12 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Luis-Arias next contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the existence and nature of a prior felony conviction used to enhance his sentence must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Luis-Arias contends that <em>Apprendi </em>limited <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) to its unique facts. Luis-Arias\u2019 contentions are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepada, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414-15 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001) and <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (applying de novo review).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Luis-Arias\u2019 final contention is that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 960, and 952 are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Luis-Arias\u2019 contention is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 565 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (concluding that \u00a7 841 is not facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002); <em>United States v. Varela-Rivera, </em>279 F.3d 1174, 1175 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>Buckland </em>also precludes a challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 952); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not render \u00a7 960 facially unconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b945-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
