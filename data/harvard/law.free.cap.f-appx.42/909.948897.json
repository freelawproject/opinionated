Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude dismissal was proper. There has been no express waiver of sovereign immunity, and the United States has not consented to suit. <em>See Gnotta v. United States, </em>415 F.2d 1271, 1276 (8th Cir.1969) (\u201cOne cannot sue the United States without its consent and a <em>court </em>has no jurisdiction against the United States to which it has not consented.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 934, 90 S.Ct. 941, 25 L.Ed.2d 115 (1970); <em>see also Doe v. Civiletti, </em>635 F.2d 88, 88 (2d Cir.1980) (observing \u201cwell-established rule that the federal courts do not have power to order specific performance by the United States of its alleged contractual obligations,\u201d in affirming dismissal of complaint seeking injunction requiring subsistence payments, protection, and re-enrollment in witness protection program). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-15\">. The Honorable Rodney W.
