(\u201cSea-foods\u201d) following a bench trial. The district court ruled that due to Courtney\u2019s intentional concealment and fraudulent misrepresentations of his pre-existing condition and his failure to follow his physician\u2019s instructions and treatment program, Seafoods was not hable for negligence under the Jones Act (46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 688) or for unseaworthiness under general maritime law. Due to these rulings, the district court refrained from making findings on whether Seafoods was negligent or Courtney\u2019s trawler was unseaworthy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>We have ruled that fraud bars maintenance and cure \u201cwhere a seaman conceals a medical condition that he knows or should know is related to the illness or injury for which maintenance and cure are requested.\u201d <em>Omar v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., </em>813 F.2d 986, 990 (9th Cir.1987). The district court erred when applying that same rule to Jones Act or unseaworthiness claims. We have held that a seaman who suffers injury in the course of his employment \u201cis not barred from suit under the Jones Act because he conceals a material fact in applying for employment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 989 <em>quoting Gypsum Carrier, Inc. v. Handelsman, </em>307 F.2d 525, 530 (9th Cir.1962). This same rule applies equally to claims for unseaworthiness. <em>Compton v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., </em>425 F.2d 1130, 1133 (2nd Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The district court also erred in barring Courtney\u2019s claims due to Courtney\u2019s failure to mitigate his damages by not following his physician\u2019s instructions and treatment program. Under the Jones Act and general maritime law, the harsh common law doctrines of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk have been replaced by one of comparative fault or negligence which operates to reduce the amount of the damage award. <em>Simeonoff v. Hiner, </em>249 F.3d 883, 892-93 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Kopczynski v. The Jacqueline, </em>742 F.2d 555, 558 (9th Cir.1984). To bar recovery based on a seaman\u2019s failure to mitigate damages before he is injured would inappropriately re-institute the bar to recovery that the abolished doctrines of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk formerly may have provided. See <em>Jenkins v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>22 F.3d 206, 210-211 (9th Cir.1994) (indicating that defenses which have been supplanted by a system of comparative fault may not be recast under a different label so as to produce a bar to recovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">Because Courtney\u2019s claims are not barred, the district court must determine whether Seafoods was negligent and, if so, whether Seafoods\u2019 negligence, however slight, caused Courtney\u2019s injury. <em>See Ribitzki v. Canmar Reading &amp; Bates, Ltd., </em>111 F.3d 658, 662 (9th Cir.1997). The district court must also determine whether Courtney\u2019s trawler was unseaworthy and, if so, whether that unseaworthiness caused Courtney\u2019s injury. <em>See id. </em>at 664-66, 111 F.3d 658. The district court must make such determinations without considering whether Courtney\u2019s misrepresentations or failure to follow his doctor\u2019s instructions also contributed to his injuries. If, after such an evaluation, the district court concludes, based on adequate findings, that Seafoods is not liable for negligence and unseaworthiness, the inquiry ends. If Courtney establishes that Seafoods is liable for negligence or unseaworthiness, the district court may then consider whether Seafoods\u2019 liability should be comparatively diminished due to Courtney\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">In fight of the district court\u2019s failure to provide the appropriate analysis and make adequate findings, we remand this case to afford the district court an opportunity to do so. Courtney shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">. The district court concluded that Courtney's trawler was seaworthy but made no findings to support that legal conclusion which we could review. <em>See Alpha Distrib. Co. v. Jack Daniel Distillery, </em>454 F.2d 442, 453 (9th Cir.1972) (holding Rule 52(a) requires the district court's findings to \"be explicit enough to give the appellate court a clear understanding of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>enable it to determine the grounds on which the trial court reached its decision!\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">.
