See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Appellants dentists (collectively \u201cthe dentists\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity in Sherman Jones\u2019 (\u201cJones\u201d) action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Taking the allegations in the light most favorable to Jones, we must consider whether the dentists\u2019 conduct violated a constitutional right. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, 533 </em>U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Then we must determine if that right was clearly established. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether the right is clearly established, we consider whether it would be clear to a reasonable official that his conduct was unlawful. <em>Id.; Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 910 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Taking the allegations in the light most favorable to Jones, he identifies a constitutional right under the Eighth Amendment to be free of cruel and unusual punishment, based on his allegations that he suffered a serious health deprivation due to the dentists\u2019 deliberate indifference to his medical needs. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Wallis v. Baldwin, </em>70 F.3d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Hunt v. Dental Dep\u2019t, </em>865 F.2d 198, 200-01 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">At the time of the dentists\u2019 alleged conduct, the law on deliberate indifference to medical needs was clearly established. It would be clear to a reasonable prison dentist that delaying a dental examination for three months in the face of an inmate\u2019s untreated pain was deliberately indifferent. <em>Hunt, </em>865 F.2d at 200-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>First Pac. Bank v. Giller-an, </em>40 F.3d 1023, 1024 (9th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the district court properly denied summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. <em>Saucier, </em>121 S.Ct. at 2156; <em>Jeffers, </em>267 F.3d at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
