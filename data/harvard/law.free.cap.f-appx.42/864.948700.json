Because an evidentiary hearing was not required, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">By the spring of 1991 Wilkinson\u2019s relationship with his wife, Gilda, had deteriorated to the point where the couple had decided to divorce. During the divorce proceedings, Wilkinson became so frustrated with his estranged wife that he talked to several friends about killing her and even drew up written plans in case he ever decided to murder her. On May 26, 1991, Wilkinson returned the couple\u2019s three-year-old daughter to his wife\u2019s home, when he and Gilda began arguing violently over the terms of the divorce settlement. He testified that during the fight Gilda bit him on the finger, and he responded by choking her with his free hand. Wilkinson alleges that because she would not release his finger from her mouth, he tightened his grip on her throat until she stopped moving. Realizing that she was dead, Wilkinson went to his car to retrieve a roll of plastic and his written murder plans. He attempted to dispose of the body, including amputating both of Gilda\u2019s legs, but became ill. He was also interrupted when his girlfriend, concerned because Wilkinson had missed a dinner date, arrived at Gilda\u2019s home. Once Wilkinson told his girlfriend he had killed Gilda, she removed Wilkinson\u2019s daughter from the home and contacted his parents. Later that same night, Wilkinson tried to commit suicide by flying a stolen airplane into a storm. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>was arrested at a nearby airport the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In August 1992 a jury convicted Wilkinson of first degree murder and concealing a homicide, and he was sentenced to a total of 90 years\u2019 imprisonment, which was later reduced to 85 years. He exhausted his state court appeals, and in 1998 filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the \u00a7 2254 petition because it determined that all of Wilkinson\u2019s claims were procedurally defaulted. We, however, held on appeal that Wilkinson had indeed presented his attorney ineffectiveness claim to the state courts and therefore had not defaulted on that claim. As a result we remanded the case so the district court could examine the merits of his ineffective assistance claim. <em>See Wilkinson v. Cowan, </em>231 F.3d 347 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">On remand the district court addressed the one issue Wilkinson had properly preserved: whether his attorney rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to investigate certain alleged \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report of the victim. He argued that there are so many mistakes in the report that it is questionable whether the body the medical examiner identified as Wilkinson\u2019s wife was really her. The district court concluded that Wilkinson failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his attorney\u2019s failure to investigate the autopsy report. The district court commented that because there was so much evidence of Wilkinson\u2019s guilt, he had not shown that the outcome of the trial would have been different had his attorney investigated the autopsy report. As a result the district court denied the \u00a7 2254 petition. Two months later, however, the district court granted a certificate of appeala-bility on the issue of whether it should have conducted an evidentiary hearing before denying Wilkinson\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">AEDPA generally bars a district court from conducting an evidentiary hearing on a claim for which a petitioner has failed to develop a factual basis unless the petitioner makes a detailed showing that a new rule of constitutional law or previously undiscovered facts warrant conducting such a hearing. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). But because the lack of a factual record in the state court with respect to the autopsy report cannot be attributed to Wilkinson, \u00a7 2254(e)(2) does not apply. <em>See Matheney v. Anderson, </em>253 F.3d 1025, 1039 (7th Cir.2001). Therefore, we determine whether Wilkinson warranted an evidentiary hearing by assessing whether he demonstrated that 1) the facts, if proven, would entitle him to federal habeas relief and 2) the state courts \u2014 for reasons beyond his control \u2014 never considered the claim in a full and fair hearing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">As the state argues, Wilkinson failed to present facts that if true would provide him with relief. His main factual assertion is that the medical examiner made several \u201cmistakes\u201d in the autopsy report. Specifically, he claims that 1) the medical examiner misidentified the victim\u2019s race, listing the victim as \u201cwhite,\u201d although his wife was Phillipino; 2) the autopsy report described the victim\u2019s gallbladder, even though Wilkinson claims that his wife had her gallbladder removed 14 months before the murder; and 3) the medical examiner described the victim\u2019s reproductive organs as \u201cunremarkable,\u201d despite Wilkinson\u2019s claim that his wife had two caesarean sections and two abortions. Wilkinson argues that because of these \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the autopsy report, the state never proved that he actually killed his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">To support that conclusion, Wilkinson highlights two faults with the state\u2019s case. First, he suggests that because the autop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>sy report was so riddled with errors, it is highly possible that the medical examiner fabricated the cause of death as strangulation. He even goes so far as to offer other medical solutions for why the victim died: she choked on a piece of flesh or went into cardiac arrest unrelated to the strangulation. Alternatively, Wilkinson suggests the state failed to meet its burden because it never proved that Wilkinson killed his <em>wife, </em>just that he killed the unknown victim on whom the autopsy was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Both of these arguments miss the mark. We remanded Wilkinson\u2019s case in order for the district court to evaluate the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which it did thoroughly. The district court examined trial counsel\u2019s performance and found that given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, even without a challenge to the allegedly faulty autopsy report, Wilkinson failed to show that he was prejudiced in any way by trial counsel\u2019s decision not to explore the autopsy issue. Conducting an evidentiary hearing is only necessary when a more extensive factual record must be compiled to decide an issue, <em>see Newell v. Hanks, </em>283 F.3d 827, 838 (7th Cir.2002), which was not the case here. The district court determined that because of the other evidence of his guilt Wilkinson would not be able to establish that he had been prejudiced by the failure to investigate the autopsy report. The district court did not err in deciding that further inquiry through an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary given the facts already before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Wilkinson also argues that the district court incorrectly decided the merits of his ineffective assistance claim, but the district court\u2019s certificate of appealability encompassed only whether an evidentiary hearing should have been conducted. Therefore, we construe Wilkinson\u2019s quarrel with the merits of the district court\u2019s decision as a request for a certif\u00edcate of appealability on the ineffective assistance claim itself. <em>See Rutledge v. United States, </em>230 F.3d 1041, 1047 (7th Cir.2000). A certificate of appealability on this issue will be granted only if Wilkinson makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right such that reasonable jurists could debate whether his ineffective assistance claim should have been resolved differently. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Applying the two-part standard announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984), as the district court did, Wilkinson does not show that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate the autopsy report. As the district court noted, the autopsy report was used only to corroborate Wilkinson\u2019s own testimony that he killed his wife by strangling her. Given this minor role of the autopsy report and the overwhelming amount of other evidence demonstrating his guilt, Wilkinson simply did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that had counsel objected to the autopsy report the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>See Bell v. Pierson, </em>267 F.3d 544, 558 (7th Cir.2001). Therefore, Wilkinson has not shown the substantial denial of a constitutional right with respect to his ineffective assistance claim, and a certificate of appealability will not now be granted on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Wilkinson also argues that the district court failed to follow the mandate of this court because it denied his ineffective assistance claim \u201cwithout giving any consideration to the merits of that claim.\u201d He seems to be arguing that the district court somehow failed to consider the ineffective assistance theory (concerning the autopsy report) because the court focused on the trial evidence showing Wilkinson\u2019s intent to kill. He reasons that because the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>tent-to-kill evidence was discussed by the <em>state </em>appellate court and this court\u2019s mandate instructed the district court to discuss issues raised in his <em>federal </em>habeas petition, the district court disregarded the mandate. But the district court did focus on the attorney ineffectiveness claim raised in the federal \u00a7 2254 petition. Wilkinson\u2019s confusion seems to rest with the district court\u2019s conclusion that because there was no prejudice from counsel\u2019s actions, it need not evaluate whether counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable. But we have often approved this method of analyzing the prejudice prong of the two-part <em>Strickland </em>standard before assessing counsel\u2019s performance and ending the discussion once the court determines no prejudice was shown. <em>See Matheney, </em>253 F.3d at 1042; <em>United States v. Ruzzano, </em>247 F.3d 688, 696 (7th Cir.2001). Thus, the district court did not ignore the mandate of this court as Wilkinson suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Wilkinson also contends that the district court was incorrect to focus on the intent-to-kill evidence because the \u201cquestionable\u201d autopsy casts doubt on whether the state proved he killed the victim and that the victim was his wife. But this argument suggests that the autopsy report was the only evidence used to convict him, which is simply not accurate. The state also presented to the jury Wilkinson\u2019s own statement to his girlfriend that he had killed his wife, the written plans to kill his wife that he had drawn up months before the murder, his statements to his Mends that he was going to kill her, and his attempt to conceal his crime by hiding her body and trying to kill himself. The state presented this evidence to allow the jury to infer that he had killed his wife, and none of this evidence has been challenged. Therefore, Wilkinson has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the alleged mistakes in the autopsy report had any impact whatsoever on the jury\u2019s decision to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
