Whelan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b988-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">Makhan Singh \u2014 whose real name is Ram Lubhaya \u2014 appeals the decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) denying his application for asylum and withholding \u00f3f deportation and his motion to reopen his application pursuant to the United States Convention Against Torture. Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">Lubhaya may be eligible for asylum either because he has suffered past persecution or because he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>accord Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1), 1101(a)(42)(A). Lubhaya waived on appeal his claim that he suffered past persecution, and the evidence in the administrative record does not compel the conclusion that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that Lubhaya will be persecuted if he returns to India. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i); <em>Salazar-Paucar v. INS, </em>281 F.3d 1069, 1073-74 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>290 F.3d 964 (9th Cir.2002). Rather, the evidence suggests that the Indian authorities will not target him if he returns. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s ruling that Lubhaya does not have a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-21\">Because Lubhaya cannot qualify for asylum eligibility, he also fails to satisfy the more stringent requirement for withholding of deportation. The evidence does not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that Lubhaya will be subject to persecution if he returns to India. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 424, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Finally, Lubhaya cannot satisfy his burden of showing that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed\u201d to India. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Contrary to the INS\u2019s assertion, no authority requires Lubhaya to prove a country wide risk of torture. <em>See generally 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c), 208.18. Nonetheless, evidence in the record before us indicates that Lubhaya may safely return to Punjab. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b988-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
