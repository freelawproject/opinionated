We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-23\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, <em>Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir.1996), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-24\">Based on the record before us, petitioner has not established exceptional cir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>eumstances because petitioner\u2019s misunderstanding concerning the time of his deportation hearing is not reasonable, and it does not appear that petitioner has a valid claim for relief from deportation. <em>See id; cf. Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2002) (finding exceptional circumstances where petitioner easily misunderstood the time of his hearing and petitioner was the beneficiary of an approved visa petition). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated lacks merit because petitioner was notified orally and in writing of the date and time of his deportation hearing. <em>See Sharma, </em>89 F.3d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1013-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
