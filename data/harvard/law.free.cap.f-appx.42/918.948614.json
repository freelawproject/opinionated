See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we review the legality of a sentence de novo, <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>65 F.3d 758, 762 (9th Cir.1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">Granger contends that because his indictment did not allege any drug quantity, the statutory maximum sentence was 20 years and accordingly his guideline sentence, based on a maximum term of life imprisonment, was calculated incorrectly under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, (9th Cir.2000). This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-21\">Relief is only available under <em>Apprendi </em>where a defendant receives a sentence that exceeds the lowest statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Saya, </em>247 F.3d 929, 942 (9th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001). Because Granger received a sentence well under the statutory maximum for an unspecified amount of methamphetamine, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated. <em>See Saya, </em>247 F.3d at 942 (finding harmless <em>Apprendi </em>error in calculation of career offender Guideline score). Further, <em>Apprendi </em>does not prevent a judge from making drug quantity findings for the purposes of applying the sentencing guidelines when the resulting sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 861-62 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b938-34\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
