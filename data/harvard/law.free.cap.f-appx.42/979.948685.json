He asserts that the district court (1) enhanced his sentence based on insufficient evidence and (2) erred by not departing further downward. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The district court found, over Barnes\u2019 objection, that he possessed a dangerous weapon in the course of the conspiracy, and enhanced his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). Barnes argues that this finding is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Medrano, </em>241 F.3d 740, 745 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 963, 121 S.Ct. 2622, 150 L.Ed.2d 775 (2001). We review the court\u2019s evaluations of evidentiary reliability for abuse of discretion and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 976-77 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">\u201cThe [\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) ] adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>U.S.S.G. Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) cmt. n. 3 (2000). Three of Barnes\u2019 co-conspirators told federal agents they saw Barnes possess a handgun during the conspiracy. Two of them said they saw him possess it while he was distributing methamphetamine. These hearsay statements, despite their \u201cself-serving\u201d nature, \u201cwere sufficiently corroborated by each other to provide the minimal indicia of reliability necessary to qualify [them] for consideration by the district court during sentencing.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>258 F.3d at 977. Together, they were more than sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for downward departure in light of Barnes\u2019 substantial assistance in a criminal investigation, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Barnes asserts that the district court\u2019s refusal to depart even further downward was an abuse of discretion because of (1) sentencing disparity and (2) punitive motive stemming from the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">We need not address either argument. We lack jurisdiction to review the extent of the district court\u2019s discretionary departure. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b999-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
