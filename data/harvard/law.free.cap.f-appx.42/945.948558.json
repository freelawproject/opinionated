Seawright\u2019s petition alleged he was not allowed to present defense evidence that the crime was committed by Catherine\u2019s husband. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Seawright\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-24\">A district court\u2019s decision to deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is reviewed de novo. <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001). Appellant\u2019s habeas petition was filed after the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Therefore, we apply the AEDPA in reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Appellant\u2019s petition. <em>Fuller v. Roe, </em>182 F.3d 699, 702 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Under AEDPA, a petitioner must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>See Penry v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 403-04, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Additionally, a state prisoner must exhaust federal claims through available state court remedies on direct appeal or through collateral proceedings before a federal court may consider granting habeas corpus relief. <em>See Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, </em>504 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 1715, 118 L.Ed.2d 318 (1992). Exhaustion is required by statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). \u201cTo satisfy the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 2254, habeas petitioners must \u2018fairly presen[t] federal claims to the state courts in order to give the State the opportunity to pass upon and to correct alleged violations of its prisoners\u2019 federal rights.\u201d \u2019 <em>Lyons v. Crawford, </em>232 F.3d 666, 668 (2000), <em>as modified by </em>247 F.3d 904 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Duncan v. Henry, </em>513 U.S. 364, 365, 115 S.Ct. 887, 130 L.Ed.2d 865 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">The arguments that Seawright raised in his state court petitions were couched solely in terms of California evidence law. The only time Seawright even referenced federal law was the statement in his Petition for Review to the State Supreme Court that he had been \u201cdenied due process\u201d by the lower court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. However, we have held that a \u201cnaked reference to \u2018due process\u2019 ... [is] insufficient to state a federal claim.\u201d <em>Shumway v. Payne, </em>223 F.3d 982, 987 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Accordingly, petitioner has failed to exhaust his federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
