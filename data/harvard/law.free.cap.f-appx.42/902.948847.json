For reversal, Nicholas argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) did not consider his mental impairment and should have ordered a consultative psychological examination, and that the ALJ did not propound an accurate hypothetical question to the vocational expert. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">We find substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Cunningham v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 496, 500 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review). First, the ALJ followed the proper procedure in evaluating Nicholas\u2019s mental impairment by concluding that Nicholas suffered from a recurrent depressive disorder which was improving and stabilized by medication, and by completing a psychiatric review technique form. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a (2001) (procedure ALJ must follow in evaluating claimant\u2019s mental impairments). The ALJ had no obligation to order a consultative examination because he had sufficient evidence from a treating physician and counselors to make a determination that Nicholas\u2019s depression was not disabling. <em>See Haley v. Massanari, </em>258 F.3d 742, 749-50 (8th Cir.2001) (ALJ may issue decision without obtaining added medical evidence if existing evidence provides sufficient basis for ALJ\u2019s decision). Second, the ALJ\u2019s first hypothetical adequately reflected the degree of functional limitations assessed by mental health professionals Drs. Gale and Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-17\">. The Honorable J. Thomas Ray, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
