A jury convicted Strain on two counts of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d)), one count of interference with commerce by robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a)), three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)), and three counts of using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). She requests a new trial on the ground that she received ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea-bargaining stage. She claims that her trial counsel did not advise her of the mandatory stacking provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which account for most of Strain\u2019s 650-month sentence. Had she known that this was the mandatory minimum sentence, she argues, she would not have rejected the prosecutor\u2019s offer of a 15-year (180-month) sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">After holding an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court find that Strain\u2019s trial counsel informed her of the mandatory and consecutive nature of sentencing under \u00a7 924(c) and that Strain adamantly refused the prosecutor\u2019s plea bargain knowing that she risked a far greater sentence by going to trial. The district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and concluded that Strain\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient and did not result in any prejudice to her. Because the district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous, we affirm. <em>See Seidel v. Merkle, </em>146 F.3d 750, 753 (9th Cir.1998) (reviewing factual findings for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Strain\u2019s trial counsel, Michael Dayan, testified at the evidentiary hearing. He recalled discussing with Strain that the sentences for the gun charges were \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cconsecutive\u201d and explaining to Strain that the judge lacked discretion to impose a lower sentence. Strain, on the other hand, testified that Dayan informed her only that she might receive a sentence of up to 50 years. The magistrate judge found Dayan\u2019s testimony credible and Strain\u2019s testimony not credible; the district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">Strain is correct that \u201ca court could conclude\u201d that she was not fully informed of her sentencing exposure and that she would have accepted the 15-year offer if she had been informed. But the fact that a different judge could weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses differently and find in Strain\u2019s favor does not render the district court\u2019s rejection of her testimony clearly erroneous. The distinct court\u2019s credibility determination is plausible in light of the evidence in the record, and, thus, the determination is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">Because the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that trial counsel informed her of the mandatory and consecutive nature of the \u00a7 924(c) sentences, we affirm the denial of Strain\u2019s motion for habeas relief. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (requiring proof that the attorney\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
