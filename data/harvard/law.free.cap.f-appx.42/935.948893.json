On May 29, 1996, Williams filed an application for disability insurance benefits, alleging disability beginning in May 1986 due to post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. Following a July 1998 Social Security Administration hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that the relevant adjudication period for Williams\u2019s application was from April 19, 1988 to March 31, 1992. Based on testimony by a vocational expert (VE) and documentary evidence submitted by several physicians, the ALJ found Williams not disabled during the relevant adjudication period because the VE testified that Williams could perform several jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national and state economies. Having carefully considered the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. The Commissioner\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>to deny benefits will be overturned only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error. Substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, it is the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that must be upheld.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Commissioner of Social Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Williams first argues that the ALJ improperly rejected Williams\u2019s testimony. The ALJ found Williams to be \u201cless than fully credible,\u201d and found \u201chis recollection as to his condition at his date last insured [to be] faulty.\u201d This court gives special deference to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations when they are adequately supported by specific findings. <em>Flaten v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1464 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Here, the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was adequately supported by her findings of inconsistencies between Williams\u2019s testimony and other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Williams also challenges the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of evidence produced by Dr. Carter, Williams\u2019s treating physician. Dr. Carter was Williams\u2019s treating physician during the entire adjudication period. Williams was also examined, but not treated, by two other physicians during the adjudication period for purposes of Williams\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. Dr. Carter did not personally testify at the administrative hearing. Rather, Williams submitted three letters written in 1996 by Dr. Carter for the purpose of Williams\u2019s claim for disability insurance benefits. In one of these 1996 letters, Dr. Carter stated that Williams was not able to engage in any regular remunerative work during the period from 1986 until 1996. Dr. Carter also performed psychiatric assessments of Williams in 1997 and 1998, and indicated that Williams\u2019s impairments were severe enough to qualify him as disabled under the Social Security Act. In addition, the ALJ reviewed Dr. Carter\u2019s contemporaneous clinical notes from his treatment of Williams during the adjudication period.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">The ALJ did not give full credence to Dr. Carter\u2019s 1996 letters and his 1997 and 1998 psychiatric assessments. The ALJ found those more recent opinions to be contradicted by Dr. Carter\u2019s records reflecting his contemporaneous clinical observations and documenting Williams\u2019s subjective statements during the adjudication period. The ALJ also found Dr. Carter\u2019s opinion that Williams was disabled during the entire period from 1986 until 1996 to be contradicted by the opinions of the two examining physicians, and by the Commissioner\u2019s 1988 decision that Williams was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">We uphold the ALJ\u2019s findings because they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 599. \u201cAs a general rule, more weight should be given to the opinion of a treating source than to the opinion of a doctors who do not treat the claimant. At least where the treating doctor\u2019s opinion is not contradicted by another doctor, it may be rejected only for \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 reasons. We have also held that \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 reasons are required to reject the treating doctor\u2019s ultimate conclusions. Even\u00bb if the treating doctor\u2019s opinion is contradicted by another doctor, the Commissioner may not reject this opinion without providing \u2018specific and legitimate reasons\u2019 supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995). Here, the ALJ gave \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons for rejecting Dr. Carter\u2019s opinions and ultimate conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Williams also contends that the ALJ\u2019s vocational hypothetical was legally inadequate. A vocational hypothetical must set forth all the limitations and restrictions of a particular claimant. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 756 (9th Cir.1989). Williams alleges that his hypothetical was legally deficient because it failed to incorporate (a) the limitations assessed by Dr. Carter, (b) the limitations alleged by Williams, and (c) the limitations found to exist by the ALJ. Therefore, Williams argues, the VE\u2019s testimony is of no evidentiary value. We hold that because the ALJ properly discounted Williams\u2019s testimony and the more recent documents prepared by Dr. Carter, there was no error in excluding the limitations alleged by Williams and Dr. Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Williams also alleges that the ALJ\u2019s vocational hypothetical did not reflect the ALJ\u2019s own findings that Williams \u201coften\u201d had \u201c[djeficiencies of concentration, persistence or pace resulting in failure to complete tasks in a timely manner (in work settings or elsewhere).\u201d In her vocational hypothetical to the VE, the ALJ specified: \u201cThis individual would be limited to medium work and would need to have jobs that were unskilled or semiskilled due to difficulties with concentration and attention. He should also have limited contact with the general public.\u201d We hold that the hypothetical presented to the VE adequately reflects the limitations found by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Finally, Williams alleges that the ALJ mischaracterized the jobs that she found Williams capable of performing. The VE testified that, based on the ALJ\u2019s vocational hypothetical, Williams would be able to perform four jobs. Williams claims that two of the jobs identified by the VE are in fact semi-skilled jobs for which he is not qualified, according to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. We not need resolve whether Williams is qualified for all four jobs, however, because the remaining jobs proposed by the VE \u2014 those not challenged by Williams \u2014 each exist in \u201csignificant\u201d number in the local economy. <em>See Meanel v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir.1999) (the existence of between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs in the local area is a \u201csignificant\u201d number) (citing <em>Barker v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Serv., </em>882 F.2d 1474, 1479 (9th Cir.1989) (1,266 was a \u201csignificant number\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
