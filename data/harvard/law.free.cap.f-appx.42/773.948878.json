On January 8, 2002, the INS, through the office located in Cleveland, Ohio, issued a notice of action stating that \u201cyour request for change of status from permanent resident to national of the United States is a frivolous filing and has been rejected.\u201d The petitioner asserts that he then wrote and asked how to appeal that notice, but that he received no further information. Therefore, he argues that he has exhausted his administrative remedies, and he seeks relief from this court. The petition filed in this court sets forth the petitioner\u2019s argument as to why his status should be changed to that of a \u201cnational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-23\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, the court of appeals is granted authority to review certain determinations of the INS, including orders of removal. The instant petition for review does not reference any reviewa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ble order that might fall within this court\u2019s jurisdiction. We note that- an alien may seek review of an immigration judge\u2019s denial of a proper application for naturalization in the appropriate district court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c). Here, however, the petitioner was advised only that his application was not accepted for filing. Insofar as the procedures for filing and the contents of an application for naturalization are prescribed by the Attorney General, <em>see e.g. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1448 and 1445, the rejection of the petitioner\u2019s filing appears to be a discretionary act within the authority of the INS. Even were there some basis for this court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, we would not interfere with the exercise of that discretion on the basis of the instant petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The petition for review hereby is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
