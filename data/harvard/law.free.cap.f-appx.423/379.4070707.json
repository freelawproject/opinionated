Elizondo argues that the sentence was unreasonable because the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based and, additionally, failed to account for his personal history and characteristics and the seriousness of his offense. Although some of these arguments were raised below, Elizondo did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence; therefore, review may be for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). We need not determine whether plain error review is appropriate in this case, however, because Elizondo is not entitled to relief even assuming he preserved these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">Elizondo argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not be afforded his within guidelines sentence because, without empirical basis, \u00a7 2L1.2 double-counts criminal history. He correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2009), and raises it to preserve the argument\u2019s further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">Elizondo\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry Guideline is not empirically based was rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Insofar as Elizondo argues that his personal history and characteristics entitled him to a piore lenient sentence, \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under [18 U.S.C.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Elizondo\u2019s mere disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within guidelines sentence. <em>Cf United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
