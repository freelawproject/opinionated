Duran contends that the within-guidelines sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was therefore substantively unreasonable. He specifically argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 was established in a problematic manner and effectively double-counts his criminal history. He contends that his offense constitutes a mere international trespass and that the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including his benign motive for reentering the United States. Duran further asserts that his sentencing range was unreasonable because the district court did not consider the unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendants sentenced in the Western District of Texas, which does not have a fast-track program, and defendants sentenced in districts that do have such a program.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">This court reviews the sentence for reasonableness, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Where, as in this case, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">The contention that a defendant is entitled to relief because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data and effectively double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). The \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument raised by Duran does not justify disturbing an otherwise presumptively reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Furthermore, as Duran concedes, we have held that the disparity between districts with fast-track programs and districts without them is not unwarranted. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The district court made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence is appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 379. We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence \"within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
