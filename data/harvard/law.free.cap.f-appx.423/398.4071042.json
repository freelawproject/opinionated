The motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Bazemore challenges the dismissal of his case as malicious, arguing that the claims here are not duplicative of those in prior case No. 3:10-CV-720. He has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his case as malicious, because both cases involve \u201cthe same series of events\u201d and contain allegations of \u201cmany of the same facts.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>see Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir.1993). Bazemore contended in both actions that Deen Abbott failed to give him proper notice of the seizure of property listed in No. 3:09-MJ-203 as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F). Furthermore, the remaining claims in both cases challenge the execution of the same seizure warrants in Nos. 3:09-MJ-200, 3:09-MJ-201, 3:09-MJ-202, and 3:09-MJ-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Bazemore\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal and the dismissal of Bazemore\u2019s complaint as malicious count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bazemore also has accumulated one additional strike. <em>See Bazemore v. Buie, </em>No. 10-11186. Because he has now received three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred under that statute from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
