Santiesteban raises six arguments on appeal, specifically that the district court: (1) should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal, or in the alternative, motion for a new trial; (2) erred in admitting, as expert testimony, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) Special Agent Matthew Parker\u2019s testimony as to the price aliens pay to be smuggled into the United States; (3) erred in restricting his cross-examination of Special Agent Parker; (4) should have given his requested cooperating witness jury instruction; (5) erroneously applied a two-level special skill enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; and (6) should have applied a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1) for committing the offense other than for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">Santiesteban first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal, or in the alternative, motion for a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">To prove that a defendant violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv), \u201cthe government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant encouraged or induced an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 413, 178 L.Ed.2d 322 (2010) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). A defendant may encourage or induce an alien by \u201chelping\u201d the alien come to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government,\u201d and we will affirm a conviction \u201cif a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1244 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted). In this ease, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Santiesteban guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed that Santiesteban helped an alien, Andrew Davis, come to the United States from the Bahamas by driving Davis to Florida on his boat. As to the knowledge requirement of the statute, a reasonable jury could have found that Santiesteban knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Davis could not legally enter the United States based on the fact that Santiesteban lied to the Coast Guard about the number of people who were onboard the boat, and told Davis to hide in the boat\u2019s cabin because of the Coast Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Nor can we say that the district court abused its discretion in denying Santieste-ban\u2019s motion for a new trial, because the evidence presented at trial did not preponderate against a guilty verdict. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1335 (11th Cir.2005) (a district court may grant a motion for a new trial where \u201cthe evidence preponderates sufficiently heavily against the verdict [such] that a serious miscarriage of justice may have occurred.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">II. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">1. <em>Testimony of ICE Special Agent Mat-thetv Parker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Santiesteban next argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of ICE Special Agent Matthew Parker about the price illegal aliens pay to be smuggled into the United States, because Parker was not qualified to testify as an expert.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the record reflects that the district court did not make an express finding that Parker was testifying as an expert witness, but instead admitted Parker\u2019s testimony as lay opinion testimony based on his experiences as an ICE agent. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence. Moreover, even if Parker\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted under Rule 701, Santiesteban fails to explain how he was harmed or prejudiced by this alleged error, and thus fails to establish that the testimony affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">2. <em>Cross examination of Special Agent Parker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">Santiesteban argues that the district court erred when it restricted his cross-examination of Special Agent Parker. We find no abuse of discretion. First, Santiesteban argues he should have been allowed to cross-examine Parker about inconsistent statements made by Davis to Parker. Before a party may impeach a witness using extrinsic evidence, however, \u201cthe court must be persuaded that the statements are indeed inconsistent.\u201d <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 176, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975). Here, the district court did not err in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>there were no inconsistent statements about which Santiesteban could impeach Davis through Parker\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Second, Santiesteban argues that the court should have allowed him to question Parker about his affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, because it contained Santiesteban\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements explaining the source of the money Santiesteban had in his possession at the time of his arrest. However, the district court found that Parker did not conduct or witness the <em>post-Miranda </em>interview described in the affidavit, and thus had no personal knowledge of Santiesteban\u2019s alleged statements. Accordingly, the district court did not err in prohibiting San-tiesteban from questioning Parker about those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Next, Santiesteban argues that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury that the testimony of a cooperating witness who has received a benefit for testifying should be considered with more caution than the testimony of other witnesses. According to Santiesteban, the district court should have given this instruction because Davis\u2019s credibility was at issue, and a reasonable jury could have concluded that he testified falsely because he was promised that he would not be prosecuted for illegal entry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">On this record, we cannot say that the failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. As an initial matter, Davis testified that he was not being promised anything in exchange for his testimony in this case. Moreover, the district court instructed the jury about the credibility of witness testimony generally, including that the jury should consider whether there was evidence tending to prove that a witness testified falsely. Finally, Santiesteban\u2019s counsel was able to call Davis\u2019s credibility into question during his cross-examination of Davis, and in closing arguments. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give Santiesteban\u2019s requested jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">IV. SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">1. <em>Two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">As to sentencing, Santiesteban argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 for the use of a \u201cspecial skill[ ] in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d He argues that no special skill was required to drive his boat from the Bahamas to Florida because it was a small pleasure boat, no license was required to drive it, and he was only traveling about 50 miles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">A skill is \u201cspecial\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 \u201c[i]f an average person off the street does not possess the skill.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>United, States v. De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1219 (11th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 393, 178 L.Ed.2d 157 (2010). This Court held in <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir.1997) that \u201ccaptaining a vessel on the high seas is the type of activity that requires skills not possessed by members of the general public and, therefore, requires \u2018special skills\u2019 within the meaning of section 3B1.3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339. Not only was San-tiesteban captaining a vessel on the high seas, but he was doing so at night with one inoperable engine. On this record, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in concluding that Santiesteban used a \u201cspecial skill\u201d in the commission of the offense, and thus the court did not err in applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">2. <em>Three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Finally, Santiesteban argues that he should have received a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1) because he did not commit the offense for profit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In his post-arrest statement, Santiesteban stated that he had brought $1,200 to Bimini and, once there, a friend gave him $2,000 for boat parts that he had purchased from Santiesteban.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">On this record, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in refusing to apply a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence at trial supported a finding that Davis paid $3,000 for his trip on Santiesteban\u2019s boat, and more than $3,000 was found in Santiesteban\u2019s wallet when it was inventoried following his arrest. Although Santiesteban presented another explanation for the money found in his wallet, the court was free to choose between the permissible explanations of the evidence, and the court did not err in believing the evidence presented at trial rather than Santiesteban\u2019s explanation. <em>See United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1305 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that where there is \u201cmore than one permissible way to view the evidence concerning profit, the district court\u2019s choice between permissible views cannot be clear error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Santiesteban\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\">.
