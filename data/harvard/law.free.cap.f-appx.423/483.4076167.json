He argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(14)(B)(i) based on a finding that he substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-22\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Juarez, </em>626 F.3d 246, 251 (5th Cir.2010). The Government presented unrebutted evidence that Verdin misrepresented the amount of the institution\u2019s reserves, leading to the payment of a dividend that placed the institution in a dire financial position from which it could not recover. This testimony, among other testimony from the witness called by the Government, thus supported a finding that the financial institution was rendered insolvent substantially on account of Verdin\u2019s actions, warranting the enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment (n,12(A)); <em>cf. United States v. Blocker, </em>104 F.3d 720, 736-37 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
