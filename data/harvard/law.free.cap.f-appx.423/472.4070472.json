The district court dismissed De-Bose\u2019s claims that challenge laws and policies up to and including 2002 as barred by res judicata or for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The district court dismissed DeBose\u2019s claims that challenge changes in policies and laws between 2005 and 2009 for want of jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e). To the extent that DeBose\u2019s claims could be construed as habeas claims, the district court dismissed them without prejudice to filing an application for habeas relief in a court with proper venue after he has exhausted his state court remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">DeBose\u2019s brief contains conclusional phrases and legal boilerplate, which indicates an intent to challenge the district court\u2019s determinations that particular claims were barred by res judicata, that his Due Process Clause claims lacked merit, and that he failed to establish an Ex Post Facto Clause violation. DeBose fails to provide any coherent argument, however, that adequately addresses the district court\u2019s analysis regarding these issues or other issues that were addressed by that court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). As DeBose has failed adequately to brief a challenge to the district court\u2019s decision, his appeal is without arguable merit and therefore is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-18\">Our dismissal of DeBose\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a strike. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We therefore warn De-Bose that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
