The district court granted Reed-man a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-20\">[Wjhether the application of <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010), to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case requires a finding that the Georgia Appellate Court, in evaluating the trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial, did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court and that, accordingly, habeas corpus relief is not available to Petitioner on the ground that his right to be free from double jeopardy was violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">This Court denied Reedman\u2019s motion to expand the COA. Our \u201creview is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-24\">Reedman contends that the state trial court erred by declaring a mistrial on one count at his first trial. During deliberations the jury asked the trial court to delay the lunch break because it was close to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>reaching a verdict. The trial court granted that request but later released the jury for lunch when a verdict had not yet been reached. After returning from lunch, the jury continued deliberations for almost an hour and then sent to the court a note asking what it should do if it could agree on only two of the three counts charged. The court declared a mistrial on the one count on which the jury was deadlocked and entered judgment on the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the other two counts. Reedman was later tried before a new jury and convicted of the one count on which the original jury could not agree. Reedman argues that the jury\u2019s note was \u201cambiguous\u201d and that the trial court should have asked the jury about the meaning of it. He contends that his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>450 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.2006). In 1996 AEDPA \u201cmodified a federal habeas court\u2019s role in reviewing state prisoner applications in order to prevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 693, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1849, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). When a state court has already adjudicated a claim on the merits, a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the decision of the state court (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the [sjtate court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">\u201cA state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in Supreme Court cases or confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme Court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to the Court\u2019s.\u201d <em>Allen v. Secretary, Florida Dept. of Corrections, </em>611 F.3d 740, 745 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law when it identifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). A state court\u2019s factual determinations are presumed correct unless the petitioner presents clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824), the Supreme Court held that when a trial court discharges a jury because the jury cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a new trial for the defendant before a new jury. 22 U.S. at 579-80. Trial courts may declare a mistrial \u201cwhenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity\u201d for doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 580. \u201cThe trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is ... accorded great deference by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 510, 98 S.Ct. 824, 832, 54 L.Ed.2d 717(1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The Supreme Court has refused to apply a \u201crigid formula\u201d when reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision about whether a jury deadlock warrants a mistrial. <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 690-91, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949) (explaining that the guiding principles of the <em>Perez </em>decision \u201ccommand courts in considering whether a trial should be terminated without judgment to take all circumstances into account and thereby forbid the mechanical application of an abstract formula\u201d) (quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>omitted). More recently the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">We have also explicitly held that a trial judge declaring a mistrial is not required to make explicit findings of manifest necessity nor to articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion. And we have never required a trial judge, before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock, to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with (or obtain the consent of) either the prosecutor or defense counsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means of breaking the impasse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-6\"><em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1863-64, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Reedman basically concedes that <em>Renico </em>resolves the matter, and his brief to this Court merely rants about the judicial system and judges. As judges, however, we apply the law. And the Supreme Court has clearly established that when a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a new trial. Further, the trial court is accorded great deference and there is no \u201crigid formula\u201d that it must follow when deciding whether a jury deadlock warrants a mistrial. The state trial court was not required to ask questions about the jury\u2019s note, force the jury to deliberate longer, consult with the parties, or issue an additional jury charge before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock. <em>See Renico, </em>559 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 1864, 176 L.Ed.2d 678. There was a reasonable basis for the trial court to conclude that the jury could not reach a verdict on one of the three counts and that further deliberations on that count would be useless. The state appellate court\u2019s decision, holding that there was no double jeopardy error, was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
