Williams appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for possession of a firearm by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) &amp; 924(e). Williams contends that his two 1990 Texas convictions for delivery of less than 28 grams of amphetamine were not \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act because the Government failed to prove that these convictions were for a state offense that, at the time of Williams\u2019s federal sentencing, was punishable by a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more at the time of his federal sentencing.' <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). But it is undisputed that Williams\u2019s convictions were for a state offense that, at the time Williams committed and was convicted of it, was punishable by a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more. Williams concedes that his argument is thus foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hinojosa, </em>349 F.3d 200 (5th Cir. 2003). He challenges <em>Hinojosa </em>as wrongly decided and seeks to preserve that challenge for further review. One panel of this court may not overrule the decision of a prior panel in the absence of en banc consideration or a superseding Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion <em>for </em>summary <em>affirmance is </em>GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file its brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
