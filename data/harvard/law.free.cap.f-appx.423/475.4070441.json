Landazuri, however, filed the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition at issue on this appeal in the Northern District of Texas. In it, he challenged his sentence and conditions of confinement, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>he should receive a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on the 2007 Sentencing-Guidelines amendments for crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). In this <em>pro se </em>appeal, Landazuri raises only his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) contention. Accordingly, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>waives any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of relief on his other claims. <em>E.g., Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Regarding the \u00a7 3582(c) issue, the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it was not the sentencing court. The dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000) (holding \u00a7 2241 petition challenging manner in which prisoner\u2019s sentence was initially determined must either be dismissed or construed as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which must be filed in court in which prisoner was sentenced). Because Landazuri did not file this challenge to his sentence in the court in which he was sentenced, the district court ruled correctly that it lacked jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 212; <em>United States v. Meza, </em>620 F.3d 505, 507 (5th Cir.2010). Furthermore, the district court in which Landazuri was sentenced has previously denied his petition for sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
