After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we conclude that no procedural error occurred, \u201cthe second step is to review the sentence\u2019s \u2018substantive reasonableness\u2019 under the totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">As for procedural error, Hernandez contends that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His argument lacks merit. In imposing its sentence, the district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of all [the] parties [and] the advisory guidelines and the statutory factors.\u201d The district court\u2019s acknowledgment that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201calone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). No procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Hernandez also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his 41-month sentence, which was at the lowest end of his advisory Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months imprisonment. He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because his Guidelines range is too high, and the district court failed to take into account his cultural assimilation in this country and his age when he committed the criminal offense that resulted in his deportation. However, we see no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of a low-end guideline sentence for Hernandez. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (We may vacate a defendant\u2019s sentence as substantively unreasonable only if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
