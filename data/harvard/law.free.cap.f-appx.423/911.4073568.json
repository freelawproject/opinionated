The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Wang\u2019s asylum claim because it was untimely, and denied the remaining claims after concluding that Wang lacked credibility. Wang appealed to the BIA, and separately filed a motion to remand the case to the IJ for consideration of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In a single final order, the BIA denied Wang\u2019s claims for relief and his motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Wang now petitions this Court for review. He raises four issues, which we address in turn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">First, Wang argues that the BIA erred in holding that ineffective assistance of counsel does not excuse his untimely asylum application. With respect to whether an application is timely, \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d in this respect. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have held that this provision deprives us of jurisdiction to determine \u201cwhether an alien filed within one year or established extraordinary circumstances to excuse an untimely filing.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">Here, the BIA determined that Wang had not filed his asylum application within a year of his entry into the United States, and that he did not qualify for any of the exceptions to the timeliness requirement. Our precedent thus forecloses our consideration of this issue on appeal. <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1231. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination, and dismiss the petition with respect to Wang\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">Second, Wang argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, he contends that the BIA erred in concluding that an earlier application for adjusted status containing his name and personal information contradicted his testimony that he had not before initiated immigration proceedings. To this end, Wang asserts that someone forged the earlier application, using his name without his permission. He asserts further that the BIA placed undue emphasis on his inability to explain the application at his removal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, and, therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The BIA\u2019s credibility determinations are factual findings that we review under the substantial evidence test. <em>See id. </em>Under this test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). Moreover, the fact that an applicant provides \u201ctenable\u201d explanations concerning the implausible aspects of his claim does not compel a finding that the credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, particularly where there is a relative lack of corroborating evidence. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We affirm the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The numerous inconsistencies between Wang\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence in the record substantially support the BIA\u2019s determination. Most tellingly, Wang testified that he was not married to a woman in the United States, despite contrary evidence including a New York marriage certificate and an application for adjusted status based on such marriage. And, while Wang claims that these documents are fraudulent, his uncorroborated allegations of forgery do not compel us to find that the BIA\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233; <em>Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. As such, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Third, Wang argues that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief. At the outset, he contends that he is entitled to a presumption of past persecution under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). He then argues in the alternative that he established both past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his opposition to China\u2019s one-child policy, and that he established that it is more likely than not that the Chinese police would torture him if he were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Persecution under the INA is \u201can extreme concept.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Thus, we have held that a single detention and beating did not constitute persecution because the applicant suffered only minor injuries, in the form of bruising. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008). Regarding resistance to population control programs, Congress has prescribed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-10\">[A] person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). We in turn have held that the spouses of women who underwent forced procedures are not entitled to a presumption of persecution under this provision. <em>Yu v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (deferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation). Instead, these petitioners must establish that they suffered \u201cactual perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>cution\u201d as a result of their resistance to a procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Moreover, in order to establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an applicant must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Similarly, to establish eligibility for CAT relief, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, government officials if returned to the designated country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(2), 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Upon a thorough review of our precedent and the proceedings below, we affirm the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Wang failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Even if we accept that Wang was beaten on account of his political opinion, he continued to live in China for the next twelve years, during which time he suffered no further harm at the hands of Chinese authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This prolonged period of peaceful residence constitutes substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s conclusions that Wang was not likely to be persecuted if forced to return to China. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Wang could safely return to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Finally, Wang asserts that the BIA denied him due process by failing to render a decision on his motion to remand for ineffective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1302. We have held that the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it filters ineffective-assistance claims through the procedural requirements established in <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), which provide that an alien must: (1) support his motion with an affidavit that includes a statement setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel and the representations counsel did or did not make to the alien in this regard; (2) show that his former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed an opportunity to respond; and (3) indicate in the motion whether a complaint was filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the representation, and if not, why not. <em>See Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1223 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">The BIA treated Wang\u2019s motion to remand as part of the appeal, and denied the motion after finding that he failed to comply with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements and also that he failed to substantiate his claim. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in so concluding. Wang argues that two individuals, one a lawyer and one a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>non-lawyer \u201cimmigration consultant,\u201d ineffectively counseled him during his asylum procedures. Regarding his complaint against the lawyer, Wang has not complied with the procedures set forth in <em>Lozada, </em>and therefore the BIA\u2019s denial was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Gbaya, </em>342 F.3d at 1223. As to the non-lawyer, in light of its adverse credibility determination, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Wang\u2019s uncorroborated explanation that non-attorney forged Wang\u2019s name on certain documents. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233; <em>Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. Accordingly, we deny Wang\u2019s petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss petitioner\u2019s motion in part and deny petitioner\u2019s motion in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-10\">. Because Wang petitions <em>pro se, </em>we liberally construe his petition for review. <em>See Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">. Wang asserts that he suffered economic persecution because he was fired from his government job, but we agree with the BIA that his ability to find other sufficient work rendered him unable to make the necessary showing that he faced \"a threat to [his] life or freedom.\" <em>In re Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, In re Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). As such, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying relief on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-13\">. Wang's claim that he is wanted for questioning regarding events stemming from the protests against his neighborhood's condemnation similarly does not suffice to show persecution, because that investigation is not based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
