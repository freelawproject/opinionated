Perez-Ramirez asserts his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not justify the sentence with an individualized rationale. Perez-Ramirez also contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court gave too much weight to the Sentencing Guidelines and failed to give adequate weight to the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm Perez-Ramirez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">Perez-Ramirez has not established that his within-Guidelines sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (stating the party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a)\u201d). First, the district court committed no procedural error. The court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered Perez-Ramirez\u2019s arguments, considered the \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> factors and did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Additionally, we reject Perez-Ramirez\u2019s argument the district court\u2019s general statement that it considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors was not adequate be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>cause the court did not explain how the factors applied specifically to his case or how they justified the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining the district court need not discuss or explicitly state on the record each \u00a7 3553(a) factor and that an acknowledgment by the district judge that he or she has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient for review).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Further, the sentence is substantively reasonable. The sentence was within the Guidelines range, and we accord an expectation of reasonableness to such a sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88 (explaining that although a within-Guidelines sentence is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect a within-Guidelines sentence to be reasonable). Additionally, while the district court did give some weight to the advisory Guidelines range, the record shows it also gave adequate weight to the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining a sentence is substantively reasonable, if, under the totality of the circumstances, it achieves the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)). Perez-Ramirez has not met his burden to show an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-12\">. We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. In imposing a particular sentence, the court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and provide the defendant with needed training, medical care or other treatment, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
