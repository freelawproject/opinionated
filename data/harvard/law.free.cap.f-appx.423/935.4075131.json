Hernandez\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. DuBose, </em>598 F.3d 726, 729 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the conviction, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In order to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 1958, \u201cthe government must prove that the defendant: (1) used or caused another to use any facility of interstate or foreign commerce; (2) with the intent that a murder be committed; (3) as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay anything of pecuniary value.\u201d <em>United States v. Preacher, </em>631 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">In this case, Hernandez used his cellular telephone to instruct an undercover officer \u2014 posing as a hired hit man \u2014 to kill another individual. After that telephone conversation, Hernandez also participated in several other similar in \u2014 person conversations, but his crime was complete after that first call. <em>Id. </em>at 1204 (\u201cThe first time that Preacher used his cell phone to communicate his desire that the victim be killed for money, he violated \u00a7 1958.\u201d). Hernandez argues that he revoked his requisite intent by informing the undercover officers (posing as hit men) during their final meeting that he wanted them only to harm, but not kill, the individual. This argument, however, is squarely foreclosed by our decision in <em>Preacher, </em>decided after the briefing in this case was completed. In that case, we held that, \u201conce the defendant uses an instrument of interstate commerce with the intent that a murder-for-hire be committed, the crime is completed,\u201d and it therefore \u201ccan no longer be abandoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203-04. Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Hernandez later sought to call off the hit, that would not render the evidence insufficient to support his conviction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
