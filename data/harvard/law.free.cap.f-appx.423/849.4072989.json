At trial, Williams testified that, although he drove Weston to the banks, he did not know that Weston intended to, or in fact did, rob the banks until a dye pack exploded in the car as they were about to drive away from the second bank. On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for committing perjury at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">\u201cWe review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings necessary for an obstruction of justice enhancement based on perjury and accord great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002) (citation, ellipsis, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Section \u201c3C1.1 provides for a two level enhancement for defendants who willfully obstruct or impede, or attempt to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762-63 (citation, ellipsis, and alterations omitted); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 makes clear that the enhancement applies when the defendant commits perjury during his trial. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)). In order for a court to find that a defendant perjured himself: \u201c(1) the testimony must be under oath or affirmation; (2) the testimony must be false; (3) the testimony must be material; and (4) the testimony must be given with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a result of a mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">In this case, the district court found that Williams committed perjury by deliberately providing untruthful testimony at his trial in an attempt to avoid guilt. Contrary to Williams\u2019s argument, the district court did not make this finding merely because the jury returned a guilty verdict after he testified in his own defense. Rather, the court independently found that his testimony was not truthful, emphasizing that: Williams had a prior association with Weston, who had recently been released from prison; when Weston entered the banks, Williams parked in a manner that concealed his car and allowed for a speedy escape; Williams did not stop driving when the dye pack exploded; and Williams was not a naive person in light of his college education and service in the Marine Corps. We further point out that a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified at trial that Williams admitted knowing Weston\u2019s true purpose and acting as Weston\u2019s driver after the first incident. In sum, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Williams committed perjury, and we therefore affirm the court\u2019s two-level enhancement and Williams\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
