The jury returned a verdict in favor of St. Tammany. Picard appeals, asserting error in the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury and asserting that the verdict lacks evidentiary support. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Picard worked as a transcriptionist at St. Tammany until November 2006. As a transcriptionist, Picard\u2019s duties included transcription in addition to tasks such as assisting her co-workers and answering the phone. During her last five years at St. Tammany, Picard was subject to annual performance reviews. Each of these performance reviews rated her as competent or better. She also received a merit pay-raise after each review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Picard has been diagnosed with Char-cot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Her physician describes it as a condition that delays nerve impulse propagation. As a result, Picard requested that she be permitted to use a dictation software program, Dragon, which would allow her to limit her typing by speaking the dictation. She also requested a quiet room in which to work. She testified at trial that she had difficulty working, walking, shopping, and engaging in activities requiring fine motor skills. She also stated that her friend took her shopping and that increased concentration ameliorated her risk of tripping.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">To demonstrate her CMT\u2019s medical relevance to St. Tammany, Picard referenced her medical correspondence. In 2000, her doctor at the time, Dr. Palopoli, wrote a letter to the hospital describing Picard\u2019s CMT, as well as her carpal tunnel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Dr. Palopoli also stated that, in light of these conditions, he \u201cwould recommend from a medical standpoint\u201d that Picard receive a break every hour to stretch. St. Tammany\u2019s policies already allowed its transcriptionists to take breaks to stretch. Subsequently, in 2004, Picard took a medical leave and had surgery to improve her carpal tunnel syndrome. Her surgeon, Dr. Plauche, released her to work with no restrictions on work, bending, walking or standing, sitting, lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling, positioning, or repetitive actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">Approximately six months after the carpal tunnel surgery, and roughly five years after the Palopoli letter, another of Pi-card\u2019s doctors, Dr. Fischer, wrote a letter to St. Tammany. This letter stated that as a result of CMT, Picard\u2019s ability to perform her transcriptionist duties was \u201cimpaired.\u201d Dr. Fischer wrote that it was his \u201copinion\u201d that this constituted a \u201csignificant handicap\u201d for Picard, and that it \u201cshould be taken into account in any measures of her job performance.\u201d Some eleven months later, Dr. Plauche wrote a letter stating that Picard was \u201cinterested in obtaining the Dragon program for work.\u201d Dr. Plauche believed Dragon would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201cbeneficial\u201d for her and would allow her to devote her time to meeting her output requirements. St. Tammany did not provide Picard with the Dragon software. It did permit her to use ExSpeak, which creates a rough draft of a physician\u2019s dictation. A transcriptionist then edits that draft. After trying it, Picard told St. Tammany that she could not use ExSpeak, finding it difficult and painful. Picard resigned from St. Tammany in November 2006. At that time she thanked her supervisors and offered to \u201cwork per diem\u201d for the hospital in the future. She then began working as a clerk at another hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Picard subsequently filed suit against St. Tammany. Picard alleged that she was disabled and that St. Tammany had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found that Picard was not a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA. Picard appeals the jury instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict. Our jurisdiction over this appeal is properly vested pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Picard appeals the instruction given to the jury, contending that the jury should have been instructed that \u201ca per se violation of the ADA occurs when the employer fails to engage in the required \u2018interactive process,\u2019 once an employee requests an accommodation.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s refusal to provide a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given this \u201csubstantial latitude,\u201d refusal to give such a jury instruction \u201cconstitutes reversible error \u2018only if the instruction 1) was a substantially correct statement of law, 2) was not substantially covered in the charge as a whole, and 8) concerned an important point in the trial such that the failure to instruct the jury on the issue seriously impaired the party\u2019s ability to present a given claim.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">The ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d is \u201c \u2018an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A \u201cdisability,\u201d in turn, is: \u201c \u2018(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stressing the need for an individual to be substantially limited, we have held that \u201c[m]erely having an impairment, however, does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That said, an employer\u2019s failure to make \u201c \u2018reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability\u2019 \u201d constitutes discrimination, unless the accommodation would impose an \u201c \u2018undue hardship\u2019 \u201d on the business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When a qualifying individual with a disability makes a request for an accommodation, the ADA calls for an \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>teractive process\u201d between employer and employee: \u201c \u2018a meaningful dialogue with the employee to find the best means of accommodating that disability.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXj\">Picard requested that the district court instruct the jury that a failure to engage in the interactive process, once an accommodation is requested, constitutes a \u201cper se\u201d violation of the ADA. We have previously described a \u201cper se rule\u201d as providing \u201can immutable principle\u201d that specific conduct violates the law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is echoed by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which provides the definitions \u201c[o]f, in, or by itself; standing alone, without reference to additional facts\u201d and \u201c[a]s a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEv\">Given these definitions, Picard\u2019s proposed per se jury instruction lacks support from our prior holdings regarding the ADA and its interactive process. We have observed that the \u201cADA\u2019s regulations state that \u2018it may be necessary for the [employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation\u2019 in order to craft a reasonable accommodation.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of course, that which \u201cmay be\u201d necessary is not universally required. In fact, Picard\u2019s proposed per se rule is ill-suited to consideration of the interactive process. We have stated that \u201cthere may be some situations in which the reasonable accommodation is so obvious that a solution may be developed without either party consciously participating in an interactive process.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This is so because the \u201cinteractive process is not an end i[n] itself \u2014 it is a means to the end of forging reasonable accommodations.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe process must thus be viewed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Picard relies upon our statement regarding the interactive process in <em>E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., L.P. </em>There, we stated that if an employee satisfies her burden \u201cto specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations,\u201d as a result of \u201csuch a request\u201d \u201cthe employer is obligated by law to engage in an \u2018interactive process.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet contrary to Picard\u2019s contention, <em>Chevron </em>refers only to those individuals who specifically identify their disability and the resulting limitations. Moreover, <em>Chevron </em>indicates that not all impairments constitute disabilities under the ADA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> By contrast, Picai'd\u2019s desired instruction would not require a jury to consider whether an employee had a disability under the ADA, an impairment, or neither before imposing liability on employers that fail to enter the interactive process. Thus, Picard\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Further, insofar as Picard contends that requesting an accommodation is a protected activity, regardless of whether she was ultimately disabled, she has failed to cite to retaliatory measures taken in response to her request for an accommodation. Such a failure to provide \u201cthe reasons [s]he deserves the requested relief\u2019 constitutes abandonment of an issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Picard also contends that the jury\u2019s verdict lacks sufficient evidentiary support. The jury found that Picard was not a \u201cqualified individual with a disability under the ADA.\u201d In reviewing the evidentiary support for a jury verdict, \u201c[ujnless the evidence is of such quality and weight that reasonable and impartial jurors could not arrive at such a verdict, the findings of the jury must be upheld.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our inquiry examines the time of the adverse employment action, not the present.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">As noted above, an ADA disability is: \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For the jury to determine that Picard was disabled, proof of an impairment is insufficient \u2014 for instance, Dr. Fischer\u2019s statement that Picard\u2019s ability to perform her transcription duties was \u201cimpaired.\u201d Instead, an impairment must substantially limit a major life activity, and we have noted that the \u201cADA\u2019s implementing regulations provide a non-exhaustive list of major life activities, including \u2018caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In evaluating whether a limitation is \u201csubstantial,\u201d \u201cthe EEOC advises that courts should consider: \u2018([i]) the nature and severity of the impairment, (ii) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">On appeal, Picard contends that she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA because of her difficulties working, walking, shopping, and with her fine motor skills. Here, we need not address whether these all constitute \u201cmajor life activities,\u201d since a reasonable jury could have concluded that none of Picard\u2019s limitations were substantial. Regarding working, the jury heard evidence of Picard\u2019s positive performance reviews and her merit raises. She also offered to continue to work at the hospital in her resignation letter. With respect to walking, Picard testified that \u201cpa[ying] attention when I walked\u201d was sufficient to ameliorate her walking problems. Picard testified that she had difficulty shopping at the time of the trial, but that her friend would take her shopping at the time she was requesting an accommodation. She also testified that her lack of fine motor skills led her to drop items. Yet, Picard testified that she was able to perform her subsequent job \u2014 including pulling apart charts and filing the components accordingly \u2014 \u201c[fjairly well.\u201d Moreover, the jury heard her testimony regarding her typing proficiency. As a result, reasonable and impartial jurors could have concluded that Picard was not a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
