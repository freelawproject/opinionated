We review the procedural reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>613 F.3d 1344, 1357 (11th Cir.2010). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United, States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Procedural error may exist if the district court improperly calculated the guidelines, based a sentence on clearly erroneous facts, failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or failed to explain adequately the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">We conclude that Castillo\u2019s sentence \u2014 at the bottom of the guidelines range \u2014 procedurally is reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Castillo argued that his previous brain surgery and its continuing effects contributed to his commission of the instant offenses and made him less culpable because of his diminished capacity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court listened to Castillo\u2019s arguments and also listened to the government\u2019s arguments for a sentence above the guidelines range based on Castillo\u2019s violent criminal history. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that defendant\u2019s procedural unreasonableness argument failed when the district court \u201cstated that it had heard and considered [defendant\u2019s] arguments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Contrary to Castillo\u2019s appellate assertion, the district court explained why it rejected Castillo\u2019s arguments for a sentence below the guidelines range. The district court acknowledged Castillo\u2019s neurological problems and that such problems may, in fact, have contributed to the commission of the instant offenses. But the court explained that Castillo\u2019s medical issues did not justify his acts, especially given that Castillo knew of his limited capabilities, and noted his long history of violent crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also noted that Castillo was a danger to himself and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>community because he could not control his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The court considered the section 3553(a) sentencing factors \u2014 including Castillo\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to provide just punishment and protection of the public, and needed medical care \u2014 in responding to, and rejecting, Castillo\u2019s arguments and explaining the sentence appropriate for him. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). The district court\u2019s explanation for sentencing Castillo in the guidelines range was adequate; and Castillo failed to meet his burden of showing that his sentence procedurally is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. Castillo received a 57-month sentence for being found in the United States after his deportation as an aggravated felon; and he received a 6-month, concurrent sentence for improper entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-10\">. That the advisory guidelines range correctly was calculated and that the sentence was based on unchallenged facts in the presen-tence investigation report is undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-11\">. Castillo earlier had sustained a head injury after he was attacked by three men. After the injury, he suffered seizures, for which he is on medication. Many years after the attack, Castillo underwent surgery for neurocysticercosis (a parasitic infection of the brain), where doctors removed damaged tissue and lesions from Castillo's brain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b912-17\">.This history included convictions for aggravated sexual assault and aggravated battery, possession of a weapon in prison, and battery and criminal mischief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
