Con-nally Unit, where he is currently incarcerated, had committed numerous constitutional violations. In addition to holding that the majority of Castaneda\u2019s claims were factually frivolous, the district court concluded that Castaneda\u2019s challenge to the validity of his conviction and his allegation that he was falsely disciplined were not yet cognizable because he had not met the requirements under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court further concluded that the remainder of Castaneda\u2019s constitutional complaints, some of which extended back to 2000, were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">We need not consider Castaneda\u2019s assertion that officials have engaged in a campaign of retaliation since he filed this appeal because we generally do not address arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of appellate review that claims raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.\u201d). Moreover, Castaneda does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims were barred pursuant to either <em>Heck </em>or the applicable statute of limitations. Because Castaneda has failed to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 case); <em>see also United States v. Ballard, </em>779 F.2d 287, 295 (5th Cir.1986) (direct criminal appeal) (determining that a party who \u201coffered only a bare listing of alleged errors without citing supporting authorities or references to the record\u201d abandoned those claims on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">Castaneda is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). He previously received a strike under \u00a7 1915. <em>See Castaneda v. Nunoz, et. al., </em>No. SA-09-CA-556-FB (W.D.Tex. September 17, 2009). Castaneda is cautioned that he has now accumulated two strikes, and if he accumulates a third strike, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">AFFIRMED.
