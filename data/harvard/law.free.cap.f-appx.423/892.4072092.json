The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of Freeman and the district court affirmed. This is Dixon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Dixon secured a loan from Freeman using her vehicle as collateral. The loan required that Dixon maintain property insurance on her vehicle and she opted to secure the insurance from Freeman. By signing the credit disclosure statement, Dixon acknowledged that Freeman had a financial interest in the sale of the insurance because it either retained a portion of the premium or received a commission if the policy was passed onto another insurance company. The cost of the VSI was $376.00; Freeman received a 50% commission on the premium because it remitted it to an unaffiliated insurance company. Freeman itemized the VSI premium as part of the amount financed in the credit disclosure statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Dixon was also given an insured\u2019s copy of the terms and conditions applicable to the insurance policy. The policy provided, \u201cWaiver of Subrogation: Except in the case of fraudulent actions of the Insured Creditor or Insured Debtor, the Company waives any right to subrogation against the Insured Creditor or Insured Debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">In her bankruptcy proceeding, Dixon filed a complaint against Freeman alleging violations of TILA. Freeman moved for summary judgment, which the bankruptcy court granted. Dixon appealed to the district court and it affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards used by the bankruptcy court. <em>In re Delco Oil, Inc., </em>599 F.3d 1255, 1257 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">TILA was enacted to protect consumers and assist them in making informed credit decisions. <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollir, </em>444 U.S. 555, 559, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980) (\u201c[TILA] has the broad purpose of promoting the informed use of credit by assuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms to consumers.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). TILA is implemented by \u201cRegulation Z,\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226, and \u00a7 226.4 governs finance charges. Section 226.4(d) requires,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-12\">(2) Premiums for insurance against loss of or damage to property or against liability arising out of the ownership of property, including single interest insurance if the insurer waives all right of subrogation against the consumer, may be excluded from the finance charge if the following conditions are met,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-13\">(i) The insurance coverage may be obtained from a person of the consumer\u2019s choice, and this fact is disclosed,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-14\">(ii) If the coverage is obtained from or through the creditor, the premium for the initial term of insurance shall be disclosed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(d)(2). For Freeman to have satisfied the requirements under Regulation Z, it must have 1) disclosed to Dixon that she could choose who provided her VSI insurance, 2) disclosed to Dixon the premium for the insurance, if provided by Freeman, and 3) waived all subrogation rights against Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-16\">The parties do not dispute that Freeman properly disclosed to Dixon the amount of the premium, that it had a financial interest in the insurance she purchased, and that it might retain a portion of the premium or receive a commission. But Dixon argues that Freeman violated TILA when it treated the $376 premium for the VSI as part of the amount financed, instead of as part of the finance charge. In support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>her argument, Dixon points to the language of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18(c)(iii), which reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">(c) Itemization of amount financed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(1) A written itemization of the amount financed, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">(i) The amount of any proceeds distributed directly to the consumer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">(ii) The amount credited to the consumer\u2019s account with the creditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">(iii) Any amounts paid to other persons by the creditor on the consumer\u2019s behalf. The creditor shall identify these persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">As the district court correctly observed, there is nothing in \u00a7 226.18(c) that requires a commission received by a creditor to be removed from the amount financed and added to the finance charge. Furthermore, Dixon did not pay Freeman\u2019s commission; the record shows that Dixon\u2019s entire premium was paid to the third party insurer. Therefore, we conclude that Freeman did not violate TILA or Regulation Z in its handling of the commission from Dixon\u2019s VSI insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Second, Dixon argues that Freeman failed to waive all its rights to subrogation against her as required by \u00a7 226.4(d). Dixon argues that the qualifying language used by Freeman, \u201cexcept in all cases of fraudulent actions of the Insured Creditor of Insured Debtor,\u201d fails to waive \u201call right of subrogation\u201d as required by \u00a7 226.4(d)(2). Although Dixon is correct that the language does require a waiver of all rights, the qualifying language does not violate TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">As noted by both the bankruptcy and district courts, TILA is a disclosure statute that does not affect the parties\u2019 substantive rights under state or federal law. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601, 1610(d). Under the laws of Georgia, \u201c[Waiver of subrogation] clauses are intended to [allow] the parties to exculpate each other from personal liability in the event of property loss.... Exculpatory clauses are valid and binding ... [h]owever, [they] do not relieve a party from liability or for acts of gross negligence or wilful or wanton conduct.\u201d <em>Colonial Props. Realty Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Lowder Contr. Co., </em>256 Ga.App. 106, 567 S.E.2d 389, 393 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-4-60 (\u201cA contract may be rescinded at the instance of a party defrauded.... \u201d). Thus, the effect of the subrogation waiver is not changed by the inclusion of the fraud exception because Freeman did not retain any additional rights that it otherwise would not have had under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">Because we conclude that Freeman did not violate TILA, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-13\">.
