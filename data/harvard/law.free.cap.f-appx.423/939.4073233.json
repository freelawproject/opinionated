The defendants argue that the district court erred in denying their motions to withdraw their guilty pleas. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-21\">\u201cWe review the denial of a request to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe will reverse a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to withdraw only if it is arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Najjar, </em>283 F.3d 1306, 1307 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-22\">A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea before a sentence is imposed if he shows a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). A pre-sen-tence motion to withdraw is to be liberally construed, but \u201c[i]t is well settled ... that there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea prior to imposition of a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>469, 471 (11th Cir.1988). To determine whether the defendant has met his burden, the district court considers the totality of the circumstances, including: \u201c(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The defendants\u2019 arguments focus on the second factor, whether their guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary. <em>See Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 471. We have explained that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary if it satisfies the three core concerns underlying Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, which are that: \u201c(1) the guilty plea must be free from coercion; (2) the defendant must understand the nature of the charges; and (3) the defendant must know and understand the consequences of his guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>173 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999) (quotation marks omitted). The defendants assert that they were tricked into pleading guilty by their attorneys and that they never intended to bring marijuana into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">During their plea colloquies, the defendants swore that no one had threatened, coerced, or forced them into entering a guilty plea. The defendants also swore that they intended to import marijuana into the United States. There is a strong presumption that statements made during a plea colloquy are true. <em>United States v. Medlock, </em>12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 168 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201c[W]hen a defendant makes statements under oath at a plea colloquy, he bears a heavy burden to show his statements were false.\u201d). The district court was entitled to rely on the veracity of the defendants\u2019 statements. <em>See Medlock, </em>12 F.3d at 187. For that reason, the district court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motions to withdraw their guilty pleas was not arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>See Najjar, </em>283 F.3d at 1307. No abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
