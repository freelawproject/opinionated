The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint for failure to set forth a comprehensible cause of action. Johnson fails to provide a coherent argument that adequately addresses the district court\u2019s analysis of this issue. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). As Johnson has failed to adequately brief a challenge to the district court\u2019s decision, his appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">Johnson is warned that the filing of further frivolous appeals will result in sanctions. <em>See Farguson v. MBank Houston, N.A., </em>808 F.2d 358, 359-60 (5th Cir.1986). These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
