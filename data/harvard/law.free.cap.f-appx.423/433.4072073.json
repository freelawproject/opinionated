Ford filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 arguing that the district court erred in applying the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines under the recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-23\">The district court dismissed Ford\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because she did not meet the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Ford has not shown that the district court erred in its judgment. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Alh\">. We note that in <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the definition of \"violent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act, \u00a7 924(e)(1) and the extent to which a conviction of battery necessarily constituted \"use of physical force\u201d for purposes of that definition, Critically, Ford\u2019s prior convictions were not deemed \"violent felonies\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Rather, they were deemed \"crimes of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
