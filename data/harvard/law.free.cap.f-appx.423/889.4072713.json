After his convictions for conspiracy to rob federally insured credit unions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, attempted credit union robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), possession of an unregistered short-barreled shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 586, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the new evidence came in the form of a letter from the government dated approximately one year after Brown\u2019s trial, stating that one of the government\u2019s primary witnesses against Brown had been indicted on insurance fraud charges stemming from activities that occurred both before and after the events leading to the case against Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Brown argues that, as required by Fed. R.Crim.P. 33, the new evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching because the government\u2019s case was dependent on the informant\u2019s testimony to prove the elements of the charged offenses, and the new evidence probably would have resulted in an acquittal. Brown also asserts for the first time on appeal that due process, as well as the concepts of justice and fair play, entitle him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">We review \u201cthe denial of a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cConstitutional objections not raised before the district court are reviewed only for plain error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Ujnder this standard [a defendant] must show that: (1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected his substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1289 (quotation omitted). \u201cA plain error is an error that is obvious and is clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cWithout precedent directly resolving ... [a] claim, ... [the] alleged error is not \u2018obvious\u2019 or \u2018clear\u2019 under current law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, upon a defendant\u2019s motion, the district court may \u201cvacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">As we have held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-9\">To succeed on a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence, the movant must establish that (1) the evidence was discovered after trial, (2) the failure of the defendant to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of due diligence, (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, (4) the evidence is material to issues before the court, and (5) the evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-10\"><em>Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted). \u201cFailure to meet any one of these elements will defeat a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Starrett, </em>55 F.3d 1525, 1554 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cMotions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence are highly disfavored in the Eleventh Circuit and should be granted only with great caution. Indeed, the defendant bears the burden of justifying a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1151 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). \u201cNewly discovered impeaching evidence is insufficient to warrant a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Champion, </em>813 F.2d 1154, 1171 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">After a review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion to deny Brown\u2019s motion for a new trial because the new evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>cumulative and merely impeaching, and because Brown did not show that the jury would probably have reached a different result. Further, in the absence of precedent resolving Brown\u2019s due process claim, his argument fails under plain error review. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-18\">.
