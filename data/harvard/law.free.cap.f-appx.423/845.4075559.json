On appeal, Marines-Wences argues that his sentence, imposed at the top of his guideline range, was proeedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly compared his case with a defendant the court had sentenced the day before, disregarded his cultural-assimilation argument, and gave inappropriate weight to his criminal history. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). It is generally sufficient that the record, viewed as a whole, reflects that the sentencing judge considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has taken the \u00a7 3553(a) factors properly into account. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ivey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727). \u201c[A] district court\u2019s unjustified reliance upon any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (brackets and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and brackets omitted). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). \u201c[0]r-dinarily, we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>584 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 436, 178 L.Ed.2d 338 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Marines-Wences has not shown that his 21-month sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. The district court expressly acknowledged that it had considered his arguments, as well as all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in sentencing Marines-Wences at the top of his guideline range based on his criminal history. As a result, the record does not indicate that the district court unjustifiably relied on any single factor, or on a comparison to another defendant, in sentencing Marines-Wences. Indeed, the district court noted that its purpose in mentioning the other defendant\u2019s sentencing was so that Marines-Wences could \u201ctailor [his] comments to address\u201d the court\u2019s concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In addition, Marines-Wences\u2019s extensive criminal history, including numerous traffic convictions, as well as convictions for petit theft, shoplifting, criminal mischief, resisting an officer without violence, and giving false information to a law enforcement officer, and three cocaine offenses, implicated several \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, they were relevant to Marines-Wences\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to afford adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was not erroneous. Moreover, because Marines-Wences\u2019s sentence was within his guideline range, we would ordinarily expect it to be reasonable. <em>Chavez, </em>584 F.3d at 1365. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-5\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; <em>(2) </em>the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) die need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
