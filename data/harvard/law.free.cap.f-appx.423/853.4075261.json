Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">\u201cTo establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Holmes v. Crosby, </em>418 F.3d 1256, 1258 (11th Cir.2005). Use of excessive force in making an arrest constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Davis v. Williams, </em>451 F.3d 759, 767 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">Nettles did not name Sergeant Bower (or any other police officer) in his amended complaint; thus, Bower was not a proper defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>no basis for holding the City of Pensacola liable. Nettles\u2019 amended complaint does not allege that the Fourth Amendment violation occurred pursuant to any policy or custom by the City of Pensacola, despite the magistrate judge\u2019s warning that his amended complaint had to allege as much. <em>See Lems v. City of West Palm Beach, Fla., </em>561 F.3d 1288, 1293 (11th Cir.2009) (stating a city may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only if \u201cthe injury caused was a result of municipal policy or custom\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Nettles\u2019 amended complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\">. The district court liberally construed the defendant as the City of Pensacola because the Pensacola Police Department was not a legal entity capable of being sued. <em>Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-12\">. Nettles has not raised either his Eighth Amendment claim or his claim that the Pensacola Police Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by illegally searching his vehicle without a warrant and without his consent. These claims are abandoned. <em>Harris v. United Auto. Ins. Group, Inc., </em>579 F.3d 1227, 1231 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-21\">. Dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-22\">. The magistrate judge instructed that all defendants be listed in the amended complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>and stated that the amended complaint would supercede the original complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
