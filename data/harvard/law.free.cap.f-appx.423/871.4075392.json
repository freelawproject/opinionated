He argues that his sentences, which constituted an upward variance from the prescribed Guidelines sentencing range, is procedurally unreasonable because the district court digressed from the legal standard prescribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when it stated that it was imposing a sentence that was \u201cmore than sufficient\u201d to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing, and because the court failed to explain its reasons for imposing the upward variance. He also argues that his sentences are substantively unreasonable because the court only considered the need for deterrence to the exclusion of the other \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, i.e., purposes, and sentences within the Guidelines sentencing range \u2014 two to eight months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 would have been sufficient to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence, including when it is the result of a \u00a7 3553(a) variance, under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erioneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1093 (11th Cir. 2008). A district court need not expressly discuss each and every \u00a7 3553(a) factor at the time of sentencing, but need only note that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments along with \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, the court \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Ag-bai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cSometimes the circumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call for a lengthier explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Second, we must determine whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable based on the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. <em>Gall </em>instructs that the district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d absent a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). However, \u201ca district court\u2019s unjustified reliance upon any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor [may be] a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted) (holding a sentence of five hours\u2019 imprisonment unreasonable when the district court \u201cfocused singlemindedly on the goal of restitution to the detriment of all of the other sentencing factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Moreover, the district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing of \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public from further crimes by the defendant, and provide the defendant with appropriate correctional treatment or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Additionally, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Here, the record reflects that Morales-Velazquez\u2019s sentences are procedurally reasonable because, despite the district court\u2019s purported misstatement\u2014 that the sentences were \u201cmore than sufficient\u201d \u2014 the court applied the correct legal standard under \u00a7 3553(a), and it adequately explained its reasons for varying upward from the Guidelines sentencing range based on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing purposes. The sentence was substantively reasonable because it met the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a), and the record does not indicate that the court \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d focused on the need for deterrence to the detriment of all the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
