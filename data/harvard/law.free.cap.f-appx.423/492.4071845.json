Emmett alleged that several of his constitutional rights were violated based on phone restrictions imposed upon him following his conviction in a frivolous prison disciplinary case that was brought in retaliation for his filing of grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">De novo review applies to the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of Emmett\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] court can dismiss a case prior to service on defendants for failure to state a claim, predicated on failure to exhaust, if the complaint itself makes clear that the prisoner failed to exhaust.\u201d <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 214-16, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007)). Regarding the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, Emmett asserts that his exhaustion was demonstrated by the Step 2 grievance and prison response that were attached to his complaint. Emmett moves to supplement the record with his Step 1 grievance in order to show that his Step 2 grievance was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Emmett does not brief any argument challenging the propriety of the district court\u2019s reliance on his Step 2 grievance in concluding that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and has thus abandoned any such challenge. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Emmett\u2019s Step 2 grievance contested only whether his disciplinary charge was correctly decided on the merits and whether he was given sufficient notice of his disciplinary proceedings. Entirely absent from the grievance was any mention that his disciplinary case was the product of retaliation or any complaint concerning his phone restriction or its infringement on his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Emmett contends that no administrative remedies were available to him because his complaint sought $6,200,000 in damages, an amount that exceeded the $750 cap on damages that could be awarded through the grievance procedure. He also contends that the prison grievance procedure could not remedy the violation of his right of access to the courts because the harm resulting from his inability to speak to his lawyer, due to the phone restriction, had already occurred by the time of his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">A prisoner is required to exhaust administrative remedies regardless of the relief offered through administrative procedures. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). A grievance is sufficient to exhaust administrative remedies \u201cto the extent that the grievance gives officials a fair opportunity to address the problem that will later form the basis of the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 517 (5th Cir.2004). The grievance need not allege full-fledged legal theories but must alert prison officials to the problem and provide them an opportunity to address it. <em>Id. </em>at 518. Because Emmett\u2019s Step 2 grievance showed that he did not alert prison officials to the claims in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>complaint, the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, predicated on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Booth, </em>532 U.S. at 741 &amp; n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819; <em>Carbe, </em>492 F.3d at 328; <em>Johnson, </em>385 F.3d at 517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u201cAn appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments of error are wholly without merit.\u201d <em>Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 811 (5th Cir.1988); Emmett\u2019s appeal is frivolous and is dismissed, and his motion to supplement the record on appeal is denied. <em>See id,.; </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Emmett\u2019s complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Emmett has accumulated at least one additional strike, based on the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint in <em>Emmett v. Hawthorn, </em>No. 4:10-CV-4034, 2010 WL 4394264, at *4 (S.D.Tex. Oct.29, 2010), as malicious and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Because Emmett has accumulated at least three strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g), he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Additionally, in light of Emmett\u2019s history of filing frivolous pleadings, we warn Emmett that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Emmett is further warned that, in order to avoid the imposition of sanctions, he should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
