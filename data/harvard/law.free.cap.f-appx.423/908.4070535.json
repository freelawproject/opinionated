If a person is convicted of a felony controlled substance offense or felony crime of violence that he committed over the age of 18, like Eugene was, and he has two prior felony convictions that were either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses, he is classified as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The district court determined that Eugene\u2019s two prior Florida convictions for felony battery and strong arm robbery were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and he was classified as a career offender, which increased his guidelines range from between 188 and 235 months\u2019 imprisonment to between 262 and 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Eugene was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Eugene appeals from his sentence and asks that we determine whether his prior Florida felony convictions for battery and strong arm robbery are crimes of violence under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As part of his plea agreement, Eugene waived his right to appeal his conviction and all but three issues related to his sentence. Under the agreement, Eugene could appeal any sentence imposed above the statutory maximum for the offense or as the result of an upward departure or variance from the guidelines. Eugene could also appeal the trial court\u2019s conclusion that his conviction for felony battery under Florida state law was a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines. Eugene raises that last issue on appeal, but also asks us to decide whether his Florida conviction for strong arm robbery is a crime of violence. The government argues that we should not consider the latter issue because Eugene waived his right to appeal it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We review the validity of a sentencing appeal waiver <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir. 2008). The waiver must be made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>The waiver will be valid if the government can show that the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver or that the record makes it clear that the defendant understood the significance of the waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">At Eugene\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the district court asked him if he understood that he had a right to appeal and that he would waive that right subject to certain conditions as part of the plea agreement. Eugene responded that he understood the waiver and its conditions and that he still wished to waive his right to appeal. He also said that he was waiving his right to appeal voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Because we conclude that Eugene waived his right to appeal knowingly and voluntarily, and the question whether his conviction for strong arm robbery is a crime of violence was not an exception to the waiver, we dismiss that portion of his appeal. Because Eugene preserved his right to appeal whether Florida\u2019s felony battery law is a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines, we now turn to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s earlier conviction is a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">The sentencing guidelines define a crime of violence as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-12\">any offense, under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosive, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court concluded that Eugene\u2019s Florida conviction for felony battery was a crime of violence under the guidelines. Under Florida law, a person is guilty of felony battery if he \u201c(a) actually or intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; and (b) causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">The Supreme Court recently considered whether Florida\u2019s simple battery statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03, was a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1268, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Because the definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines are virtually identical, we consider cases interpreting one as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>authority in cases interpreting the other. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that Florida\u2019s simple battery statute was not necessarily a violent felony because a person could be convicted of the offense based on any unwanted, intentional physical contact, \u201cno matter how slight.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1270 (quoting <em>State v. Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211, 218 (Fla.2007)). After reviewing the plain language of the statute, the Supreme Court defined \u201cphysical force\u201d in the context of ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cviolent force\u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271; <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir.2010). The Supreme Court reasoned that the minimal contact that could result in a simple battery conviction was not \u201cphysical force,\u201d and thus not every conviction for simple battery in Florida was a violent felony under ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Although Florida\u2019s felony battery statute contains the same \u201cactually and intentionally touching\u201d language as the simple battery statute, the felony battery statute has an additional requirement. <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041 <em>luith id. </em>\u00a7 784.03. The felony battery statute also requires that the touching \u201ccause[ ] great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041. That language means that each touching that violates the felony battery statute is not only \u201ccapable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1271, it must also actually cause great or permanent physical harm or injury to another person. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041. Thus it is impossible for one to be convicted of felony battery in Florida without having used \u201cphysical force\u201d as defined in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Because it is clear that Florida\u2019s felony battery statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041, requires the use of force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another, Eugene\u2019s prior conviction under the statute was for a crime of violence. And because that means Eugene had two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence, he was appropriately classified as a career offender under the guidelines. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
