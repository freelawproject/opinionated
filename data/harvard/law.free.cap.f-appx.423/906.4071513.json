White argues that he was entitled to a default judgment against the United States, the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Company, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company because they failed to respond timely to White\u2019s complaint or to request timely an extension of time to respond. The district court denied White\u2019s motion on the ground that the defendants had timely responded to the complaint, and the district court later dismissed White\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enter a default judgment against Metropolitan Life. Metropolitan Life never was in default. White served Metropolitan Life with the summons and complaint on May 26, 2009, and Metropolitan Life responded by timely filing a motion to strike on June 9, 2009. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(l)(A)(i). The district court later granted a stay and, after lifting the stay on February 3, 2010, granted Metropolitan Life until February 16, 2010, to respond to the complaint, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(a)(4). The district court later granted a motion to extend the time to respond until February 24, 2010, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1)(A). Metropolitan Life filed an answer to White\u2019s complaint on February 24, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enter a default judgment against the United States. White failed to \u201cestablish a claim or right to relief\u2019 against the United States. Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(d). The district court ruled that White could not \u201cmaintain his claim against the United States under the limited waiver of sovereign immunity found in [the] [Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance Act],\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8701-16, and White did not challenge that decision. Although the district court granted White leave to file an amended complaint, White refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">The dismissal of White\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
