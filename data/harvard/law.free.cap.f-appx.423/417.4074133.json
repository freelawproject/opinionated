He was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment on count one and 120 months of imprisonment on counts two, three, and four, all to be served concurrently with each other and with Shaver\u2019s sentences for two other Tarrant County convictions. He was also sentenced to pay $4,155 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Shaver now moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 motion. The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because the motion challenged the calculation of Shaver\u2019s sentence by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and thus was properly filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Northern District of Texas, where Shaver was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">By moving for IFP here, Shaver is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Shaver concedes that his motion disputed the BOP\u2019s calculation of his sentence, but he argues that his previously filed Section 2241 petition concerning this issue already was denied and that he now is attempting, pursuant to Rule 36, to conform his judgment to the district court\u2019s \u201coriginal intentions\u201d to give him presentence credit for the time that he served for his Tarrant County convictions. He also requests an evidentiary hearing on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">As Shaver concedes, his motion in fact challenged the BOP\u2019s calculation of his sentence, and thus it would properly be filed under Section 2241 in the district in which he was incarcerated. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003); <em>Pack v. Yu-suff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, he has not shown that the district court erred in denying his Rule 36 motion as a Section 2241 petition over which it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Zolicoffer v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>315 F.3d 538, 540-41 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">In light of the foregoing, Shaver\u2019s IFP motion fails to show error in the district court\u2019s certification decision and fails to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, Shaver\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Shaver\u2019s motion for an evi-dentiary hearing on appeal is likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
