The motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-27\">Bazemore challenges the dismissal of his case as barred by res judicata, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that, under the fourth prong of the res judicata test, the two cases at issue do not have the same nucleus of operative facts. See <em>Test Masters Educ. Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559, 571 (5th Cir.2005). The record indicates, however, that the instant case in fact does have the same nucleus of operative facts as Bazemore\u2019s prior complaint filed in No. 3:10-CV-720, which the district court dismissed on the merits, because both cases concern the execution of the same property seizure warrants by the same parties. <em>See id. </em>Because Bazemore has not shown that his complaint alleged facts that, if accepted as true, stated a claim for relief that was plausible on its face, his complaint cannot survive the dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Bazemore\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Bazemore is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-30\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the Fed.
