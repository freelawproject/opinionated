Jones, federal prisoner # 30209-048, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tion, challenging his convictions for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense and his aggregate 248-month sentences. The district court found that Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was successive and transferred the case to this court for a determination whether Jones was entitled to authorization to proceed. Jones currently seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of this transfer order.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">If necessary, this court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The order denying Jones\u2019s motion to reconsider the order transferring his \u00a7 2255 motion to this court is a non-appealable interlocutory order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292(a), (b); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a), 59(e); <em>Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 516-18 (5th Cir.2001). This court is without jurisdiction to consider Jones\u2019s request for a COA. Consequently, the motion for a COA is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
