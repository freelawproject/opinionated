Saucedo-Roman contends that his sentence is substantively unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>sonable because it gives too much weight to his stale drug trafficking conviction and not enough weight to his rehabilitation. In support of his argument, he cites to extra-circuit law and a proposed 2011 amendment to the Guidelines. He also argues that his sentence is unfair because immigration defendants in the Northern District of Texas receive longer terms of imprisonment and fewer below-guidelines sentences than similarly-situated defendants across the nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Saucedo-Roman concedes that, because he challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for the first time on appeal, that issue should, pursuant to our precedent, be reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, Saucedo-Roman must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he satisfies the first three elements of the plain error standard, this court has the discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Saucedo-Roman\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of his sentence does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Will-ingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 544-45 (5th Cir. 2007); <em>United States v. Rodarte-Vasquez, </em>488 F.3d 316, 322 (5th Cir.2007). As Sau-cedo-Roman has failed to demonstrate plain error in connection with his sentence, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
