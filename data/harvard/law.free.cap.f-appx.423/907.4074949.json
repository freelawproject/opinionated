United States v. Lagrone, </em>727 F.2d 1037, 1038 (11th Cir. 1984) (addressing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Felix makes several arguments about why district court erred by not granting his motion for an evidentiary hearing, but all of his arguments go to the merits of a \u00a7 2255 motion he has yet to file and why that future motion should not be time-barred. Those arguments are premature because Felix has not yet filed a \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court need not hold a hearing on speculative issues that Felix may or may not raise in a future \u00a7 2255 motion, including whether his future motion would be time-barred. Because nothing in the district court\u2019s order denying Felix\u2019s motion precludes him from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion in the future and arguing that it should not be time-barred, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his premature motion for an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\">. We do not address whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Felix\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because he expressly abandoned that issue in his reply brief to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
