On appeal, Govereh argues that: (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 does not apply to claims made under the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d); (2) the evidence at trial was insufficient for a reasonable jury to convict him of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287; (3) the government\u2019s misconduct and improper statements undermined the fairness and integrity of his trial; and (4) in imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence, the district court miscalculated the loss amount, erroneously imposed obstruction-of-justiee and role enhancements, and erroneously ordered him to pay restitution. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">First, we reject Govereh\u2019s argument that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 does not apply to claims made under the IRC. We review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The criminal False Claims Act provides that \u201c[wjhoever makes or presents ... any claim upon or against the United States, or any department or agency thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent, shall be imprisoned not more than five years and shall be subject to a fine in the amount provided in this title.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. In the civil context, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 provides a civil penalty and treble damages against any person who \u201cknowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A). Section 3729 \u201cdoes not apply to claims, records, or statements made under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The Supreme Court has determined that the term \u201cclaim\u201d in \u00a7 287 should not be given a narrow reading. <em>United States v. Neifert-White Co., </em>390 U.S. 228, 233, 88 S.Ct. 959, 19 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1968). \u201cThis remedial statute reaches ... to all fraudulent attempts to cause the government to pay out sums of money.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Here, Govereh\u2019s arguments ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 be given a broad interpretation. The plain language of \u00a7 287 encompasses fraudulent tax returns by criminalizing <em>any </em>fraudulent claim made against the United States. Similarly, Govereh\u2019s focus on the improperly verified tax returns is misplaced. The record clearly indicates that the tax returns were filed in an effort to cause the IRS to pay refunds, which satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 287. Further, Govereh has cited no authority demonstrating that Congress intended to preempt 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 either through the Internal Revenue Code or 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(d), or that \u00a7 287 should not be construed to encompass fraudulent tax returns, and has cited no cases from this Circuit supporting his proposition that tax violations cannot be prosecuted under \u00a7 287. His arguments therefore fail. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">Next, we are unpersuaded by Govereh\u2019s claim that the evidence at trial was insufficient for a reasonable jury to convict him of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. \u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1193 (11th Cir.2006). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). We also make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the government and the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>We must affirm \u201cunless, under no reasonable construction of the evidence, could the jury have found the [defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe evidence need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence or be completely inconsistent with every conclusion other than guilt because a jury may select among constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>123 F.3d 1381, 1391 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">As the record shows, the government presented extensive documentary and testimonial evidence showing that: (1) Govereh is listed as the tax preparer on the 14 tax returns which the jury found him guilty of fraudulently submitting to the government; (2) eight witnesses testified that they met Govereh at Icon Tax Service, discussed their tax returns with him, and generally understood that Govereh was going to be filing their returns; and (3) Kenndric Roberts testified that Govereh employed him to refer taxpayers to Icon, and that Govereh was the one person who was authorized to file tax returns at Icon. Moreover, when a defendant testifies, as Govereh did here, the jury is \u201cpermitted to reject\u201d that testimony and can consider such evidence as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Under these circumstances, a reasonable jury could have found Govereh guilty of submitting fraudulent tax returns to the United States. Moreover, Govereh ignores that the fraudulent returns, regardless of whether they were properly verified, were filed in an attempt to cause the government to pay out money. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Govereh guilty of violating \u00a7 287 as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We also reject Govereh\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s misconduct and improper statements undermined the fairness and integrity of his trial. We \u201creview a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). Where a defendant does not contemporaneously object to an issue before the district court\u2014 which Govereh failed to do for the government\u2019s rebuttal comments and other alleged \u201clies\u201d he now complains <em>of </em>\u2014 we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1316 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2123,176 L.Ed.2d 746 (2010). Under plain error review, the error must be plain, must affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and must \u201c \u2018seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">To constitute prosecutorial misconduct, a prosecutor\u2019s remarks must be improper and must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different. When the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Evidence of prior \u201ccrimes, wrongs, or acts,\u201d cannot be admitted for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), though such evidence can be admitted for other purposes. <em>Id. </em>In certain situations, evidence of prior bad acts is considered intrinsic to the charged crime and not governed by Rule 404(b). Evidence of acts other than the offense charged is considered intrinsic if it is \u201c(1) an uncharged offense which arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Veltmann, </em>6 F.3d 1483, 1498 (11th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Evidence will fall under one of those three categories if it tends to explain the context, motive, and set-up of the crime. <em>See United States v. Williford, </em>764 F.2d 1493, 1499 (11th Cir.1985) (citation omitted). Generally, the evidence must be \u201clinked in time and circumstances with the charged crime, or form[ ] an integral and natural part of an account of the crime, or [be] necessary to complete the story of the crime for the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Credibility determinations are for the jury, and we typically will not review such determinations. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). Where the appellant argues that the jury based its conviction on inconsistent testimony or incredible government witnesses, he must show the testimony was \u201cincredible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir. 1997). For testimony to be \u201cincredible as a matter of law,\u201d it must be unbelievable on its face, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ctestimony as to facts that the witness physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">As for the government\u2019s references to excessive tax preparation fees, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this testimony. The evidence about the fees met all three of the <em>Veltmann </em>requirements. The fees arose out of Govereh\u2019s charged offenses \u2014 the fraudulent tax returns. The fees were also inextricably intertwined with the charged offenses, because they showed the jury how Govereh was able to profit from the scheme. Moreover, the court twice instructed the jury that Govereh was not on trial for charging excessive fees, and that the jury should not draw any inferences based on Govereh\u2019s preparation fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">As for Govereh\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s rebuttal comments about his personal lifestyle were \u201cirrelevant, prejudicial, and ... specifically directed to inflame\u201d the eleven female jurors, the district court did not plainly err in denying the motion for new trial on this ground. Taken in context, the government\u2019s comments were not improper. During cross-examination, the government asked Govereh about the identities of women with whom Govereh had been photographed. During rebuttal, the government briefly commented on the lifestyle that Govereh\u2019s criminal activity afforded him. But even if improper, these comments represented a small part of the extensive case presented by the government. As discussed above, the record in this case contains sufficient evidence that Govereh submitted false claims against the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. Thus, in the face of this independent evidence of guilt, \u201cany error is harmless.\u201d <em>See Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">As for Govereh\u2019s claim that the government \u201csuborned to perjury\u201d when IRS Agent Wesley Cooper falsely testified that Govereh attempted to flee arrest on February 15, 2007, we are unpersuaded. At trial, Agent Cooper testified to the events surrounding Govereh\u2019s arrest, which the jury was free to credit. And while Govereh now cites to a memorandum that is said to contradict Agent Cooper\u2019s testimony, the record demonstrates that during cross-examination, Govereh never questioned Agent Cooper about the memorandum. As a result, Govereh cannot rely on alleged evidence outside the record to support his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>As for Govereh\u2019s claim that the government told some \u201coutright lies\u201d at trial, rendering his trial unfair and \u201ccontributing] to a miscarriage of justice,\u201d the district court did not plainly err. Even if all the statements were improper, the cumulative effects of those statements did not render Govereh\u2019s trial unfair. In fact, each statement represented a small part of a case that, as discussed above, involved extensive documentary and testimonial evidence. Therefore, in light of the substantial evidence of Govereh\u2019s guilt, the district did not err, much less plainly err, when it refused to grant Govereh a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Finally, we find no merit in Govereh\u2019s challenges to his sentence. \u201cA district court\u2019s determination regarding the amount of loss for sentencing purposes is reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). Overall, the court needs only to \u201cmake a reasonable estimate of the loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)). Moreover, the court\u2019s loss determination is entitled to deference because \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the application of an obstruction of justice enhancement based on those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bradberry, </em>466 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). We review a sentencing court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the crime for clear error. <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1253 (11th Cir.2010). We also review for clear error factual findings underlying a restitution order. <em>United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1269 (11th Cir.2008). We review sentences imposed by the district court for reasonableness using the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In this case, the district court did not clearly err in calculating a loss amount of $400,000. \u201c[I]n calculating the amount of loss, the Guidelines require a district court to take into account \u2018not merely the charged conduct, but rather all \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d in calculating a defendant\u2019s offense level.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 633 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006)). A court cannot speculate concerning the existence of a fact that permits a more severe sentence under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">As the record shows, IRS Agent Tammy Willingham testified that she had calculated across all 107 returns the IRS\u2019s exposure due to inflated Telephone Excise Tax Refund (\u201cTETR\u201d) credits. The IRS\u2019s exposure, based on the inflated TETR credits, was $469,415. Agent Willingham\u2019s testimony and calculations indicated that the uncharged returns filed by Govereh also contained inflated TETR credits. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in calculating the loss amount, and Govereh\u2019s claim that his loss amount should reflect the jury\u2019s verdict is unpersuasive, since we have held that sentencing courts should consider <em>all </em>relevant conduct when determining the attributable loss amount. <em>See Foley, </em>508 F.3d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Nor did the district court err in applying a 2-level obstruction of justice enhancement. Section 3C1.1 of the sentencing guidelines provides for a 2-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\u201d and \u201cthe obstruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>tive conduct related to ... the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The enhancement \u201cis not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.2). An enhancement is justified if a defendant commits perjury. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.4(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">At Govereh\u2019s sentencing, the district court applied the enhancement after finding that Govereh \u201csubstantially and repeatedly\u201d perjured himself. The court\u2019s findings coincide with the jury\u2019s, which found Govereh guilty despite his blanket denials of guilt. Under these circumstances, the court did not err when it applied the obstruction-of-justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">We likewise find no clear error in the district court\u2019s application of a 3-level enhancement for Govereh\u2019s role in the offense. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, a three-level enhancement may be applied if \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b). A participant is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, whether or not convicted. <em>Id. </em>comment.(n.1). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">\u201c[T]he sentencing Guidelines require a district court, at the sentencing stage, to make independent findings establishing the factual basis for its Guidelines calculations .... The district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d at 1338 (emphasis, citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Here, based on Govereh\u2019s supervision of Kenndric Roberts, and the evidence that the other participants acted as runners to bring clients to Icon, the district court did not clearly err when it applied the 3-level role enhancement to Govereh\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The district court also did not err when it ordered Govereh to pay the IRS restitution. At trial, Agent Willingham testified that the IRS paid out $138,550 on the tax returns filed by Govereh. Therefore, Govereh\u2019s argument\u2014that the IRS did not lose any money, so Govereh should not have to pay it restitution\u2014is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Finally, the sentence the district court imposed was substantively reasonable. We review a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances, including \u201cthe extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Sentences outside the Guidelines are not presumed to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>The district court must evaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when arriving at a sentence, but is permitted to attach \u201cgreat weight\u201d to one factor over others. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 128 S.Ct. 586. Among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">While Govereh argues that, if the district court had been aware of Terra Dixon\u2019s sentence, it likely would have sentenced him to a lesser term of imprisonment, Govereh has made no showing that he and Dixon were similarly situated defendants. Moreover, Govereh\u2019s argument ignores that in large part, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>court sentenced him based on his extensive history of committing fraud crimes. In fashioning Govereh\u2019s sentence, the court also emphasized the need to deter.others from committing similar crimes and the need to protect the public from Govereh, who the court characterized as a \u201cfraud machine.\u201d Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Govereh to a total of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
