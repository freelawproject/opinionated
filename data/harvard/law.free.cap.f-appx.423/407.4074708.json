He now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on a prior Texas conviction for attempted burglary of a habitation. We review this question de novo. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 651 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">The judgment from Guzman\u2019s prior state conviction shows that on August 30, 2007, he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of attempted burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft. He also admitted at rearraignment that the Government\u2019s proffered factual basis \u2014 which provided that he was convicted on August 30, 2007, of attempted burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft \u2014 was true. That language falls squarely within \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code, which we have held meets the definition of burglary of a dwelling, an enumerated crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585 (5th Cir.2008) (Armed Career Criminal Act case); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>attempt to commit an enhancing offense is counted. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
