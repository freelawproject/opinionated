All of the charges stemmed from a rock throwing barrage along Interstate 95 (1-95)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. The lower court severed Burgess\u2019s trial from that of his co-defendants, Maurice Edward Ford and Donnell Petite. Burgess elected a bench trial. After a short trial, the court reached the following verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b556-24\">The lower court sentenced Burgess on December 17, 1990. He appeals to this court, raising the twelve assignments of error that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Whether the identification evidence with respect to each of the separate incidents was insufficient to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Appellant Burgess structures his first issue around two main arguments. One, the lower court failed to distinguish between a confession and an admission. Two, the lower court did not have sufficient identification evidence to find Burgess guilty as to each count. We address his concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">On June 2, 1989, troopers White and Wooters went to Burgess\u2019s house to interview him \u201cabout a rock throwing incident that occurred on the Beltway.\u201d After speaking to Burgess for a short time, the troopers asked him to accompany them to the Maryland State Police Barracks in Forest-ville, Maryland, to continue the interview. Burgess agreed, and went to tell his parents where he was going. Once inside his house, however, Burgess clung to his mother and refused to accompany the troopers. At this time, Burgess\u2019s stepfather requested that the troopers vacate the premises and return only if they had a warrant. Troopers White and Wooters and Detective Philbin returned with a warrant around 8:00 p.m. and took Burgess to the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) Headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">At the CID Headquarters in Landover, Maryland, Detective Philbin advised Burgess of his rights. Burgess waived his rights and made a written statement. The crux of that statement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">Me, Donnell, and Man was [sic] drinking. We went to the movies in Rivertowne. After the movies we start[ed] playing around and we all were saying [\u201c]let\u2019s go to the bridge.[\u201d] Then we went and start[ed] throwing rocks on the bridge. Then Donnell got in the street and started throwing rocks at cars. After a little while we all were in the street. Then Man saw 2 people running so we left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Appellant argues that his statements to the police were \u201cadmissions and not a confession\u201d because he did not make a direct acknowledgement of guilt with respect to the harm done to any particular person or piece of property. Although he is correct to suggest that there is a distinction between an admission and a confession, he fails to show the harm that flowed from any lack of distinction and he overlooks <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 375 A.2d 1105, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 646, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977). \u201c[I]t is firmly established that the test for the receipt in evidence against an accused is the same for a confession and an admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>281 Md. at 34 n. 1, 375 A.2d 1105. We now turn to his second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Burgess suggests that the lower court did not have sufficient identification evidence before it to convict him on the 38 counts. Because the test for admissibility is the same for an admission as it is for a confession, we can look to <em>Birchead v. State, </em>317 Md. 691, 566 A.2d 488 (1989), for the evidentiary guidelines that apply when a confession is involved.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">In <em>Woods v. State, supra, </em>315 Md. [591] at 615-16, 556 A.2d 236 [ (1989) ], we observed that evidence to support an extrajudicial confession must be independent of it and relate to and tend to establish the corpus delicti, <em>i.e., </em>the facts necessary to show that a crime has been committed. But the independent evidence, we said, need not be full and complete or establish the truth of the corpus delicti beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 556 A.2d 236. It \u201cmay be small in amount and is sufficient to establish the corpus delicti \u2018if when considered in connection with the confession or admission, it satisfies the trier of facts beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense charged was committed and that the accused committed it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Bradbury v. State, </em>233 Md. 421, 424-25, 197 A.2d 126 (1964). And we recognized that the corpus delicti may be proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>by circumstantial evidence, and that the accused\u2019s identity or criminal agency is not a necessary element of the corroboration required to make the confession admissible. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><em>Id. </em>817 Md. at 706, 566 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Furthermore, we examine the principles of aiding and abetting because Burgess participated with two of his friends in the rock throwing spree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">The legal definition of the word \u2018aider\u2019 is not different from its meaning in common parlance. It means one who assists, supports or supplements the efforts of another. The word \u2018abettor\u2019 means in law one who instigates, advises or encourages the commission of a crime. Thus the word \u2018abet\u2019 may import that one is present at the commission of a crime without giving active assistance. To be an aider or abettor it is not essential that there be a prearranged concert of action, although, in the absence of such action, it is essential that one should in some way advocate or encourage the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT6\"><em>Coleman v. State, </em>209 Md. 379, 384-85, 121 A.2d 254 (1955), <em>aff'd, </em>221 Md. 30, 155 A.2d 649 (1959) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 573 A.2d 831 (1990), the Court of Appeals delineated the test for sufficiency of the evidence at the trial court level.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">The test used in determining the sufficiency of the evidence for either court or jury trial is whether the evidence shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the trier of fact could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 573 A.2d 831. Our standard of review is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), <em>quoted in State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 240, 424 A.2d 720 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>With the <em>Jackson </em>test in mind, we now determine whether there was sufficient identification evidence before the lower court on the 88 counts on which it found Burgess guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">1. <em>Burgess\u2019s admission/confession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On June 2, 1990, Burgess gave the police a signed statement regarding the rock throwing incident. That admission/confession establishes the following facts. Burgess and his two friends, Petite and Ford (Man), were \u201changing out\u201d on Saturday night, May 26, 1989. The appellant wore blue shorts, a white tee-shirt, and a gray Reebok jacket; Petite wore blue jeans, a white tee-shirt, and a waist length, red wool coat; Ford wore dark blue shorts and a white long-sleeve shirt. The youths drank some Cisco<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and watched a movie at Rivertowne. After the movie, the trio went to Livingston Road where it passes under 1-95. The three young men picked up rocks from under the bridge and hurled those rocks at passing motorists. Some of the rocks hit windshields, some hit doors and other parts of the cars, and others presumably missed their intended targets. The youths eventually entered the roadway to launch their projectiles with greater accuracy. For an unspecified time, the trio continued throwing rocks at the unsuspecting motorists who passed by. The gang only abandoned their pursuits when Petite saw two people chasing them. Burgess says he arrived home between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">2. <em>Morrison\u2019s (Mad Ball\u2019s) Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">To corroborate Burgess\u2019s statements and to provide additional information, the State called Calvin Morrison (Mad Ball) to the witness stand. Much of what Mad Ball told the court substantiated Burgess\u2019s statements. Morrison stated that he saw Burgess and Man around 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. on Saturday. Burgess wore a gray Reebok jacket and some light colored blue jean shorts. Man wore blue, baggy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>shorts and a red jacket. Mad Ball testified that when he saw them that evening, Burgess and Petite were not drunk.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, Morrison told the court that while walking by Livingston Road where it passes underneath the Beltway, on Friday night/Saturday morning, Ford \u201chad picked up a rock and was tossing it in his hand and said, [\u2018]let\u2019s introduce my Man Mad Ball to the bridge.[\u2019]\u201d In response, everyone giggled \u2014 including Burgess.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">3. <em>Witness identification</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In addition to Burgess\u2019s admission/confession and Morrison's testimony, the State produced numerous witnesses who provided the court with sufficient identification of Burgess and his colleagues. The witnesses testified that they saw three black males<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> standing on the side of the road or on the roadway. Many witnesses saw one rock thrower wearing a gray jacket or sweatshirt and another wearing a red jacket. The youths wore blue jeans or dark trousers. Two of the rock throwers were about the same height; the other remaining one was slightly taller. The trio\u2019s <em>modus operandi </em>varied. Sometimes they would launch rocks from the side of the road. At other times, they would walk shoulder to shoulder and then suddenly turn about and deliver their destructive loads. The youths, seemingly emboldened with their success, would flag cars to slow down and then bombard them. In fact, the gang even entered the roadway to hurl rocks at the unwitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>motorists. In direct support of Burgess\u2019s statement that \u201cMan saw 2 people running so we left,\u201d witnesses Jeffrey and Garner stated that they chased the young men up to the edge of a wooded area. To further support those comments, witness Palmer testified that he saw a couple of people chase the youths.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Viewing all of the evidence under the <em>Jackson </em>standard, we hold that there was sufficient identification evidence before the lower court to find Burgess guilty on the 38 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Whether .the court below committed constitutional error by denying a continuance of the trial date where defense counsel clearly indicated his lack of preparation to render defendant effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Appellant states that his trial counsel was \u201cwoefully inadequately prepared on several critical issues.\u201d He complains that his counsel was unprepared to cross-examine the medical experts regarding Ms. Morris\u2019s injuries, he did not properly check into a \u201cmissing witness,\u201d Ms. Miller, concerning the bombardment of Palmer\u2019s truck, and that he was not prepared on matters dealing with Cisco [Sisco].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Burgess did not present those arguments before the trial court. Moreover, as the State points out, his contentions relate more toward ineffective assistance of counsel than to lack of trial preparation. Three days after Burgess filed his Motion for Continuance, the court asked if there were any preliminary matters before the trial. Burgess did not raise any issues. In addition, at the beginning of the trial, the court asked both parties if they were prepared \u2014 Burgess made no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\u201cRulings on requests for continuances are within the sound discretion of the judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Beachem v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>State, </em>71 Md.App. 39, 55, 523 A.2d 1033 (1987). We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Burgess\u2019s Motion for Continuance, especially where Burgess, on two separate occasions, made no objection when the court wanted to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Whether the court below committed reversible error in admitting state of mind evidence regarding a severed co-defendant who was unavailable for cross-examination where such evidence did not constitute adoptive admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Late Friday night, Mad Ball, Burgess, Man, and Petite went to a party in Clinton, Maryland. Due to neighbors\u2019 complaints about the excessive noise generated by the party, the party was winding down as the youths arrived. Returning to Rivertowne, where the gang met hours earlier, they regrouped and started for their respective homes. Heading towards Livingston Road, on their way home, the youths had to pass under the Beltway. By now it was early Saturday morning, May 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Morrison, at trial, recounted what happened next.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">Q. And when you [Morrison, Petite, Ford, and Burgess] were walking underneath the Beltway overpass what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">A. We was [sic] walking up by the bridge. Maurice had picked up a rock and was tossing it in his hand and said, [\u201c]let\u2019s introduce my Man Mad Ball to the bridge.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASxv\">Q. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">A. Then everybody started giggling and then we just kept walking home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">Q. Was John Burgess giggling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Burgess argues that Mad Ball\u2019s statements (relating what Ford said) were immaterial and prejudicial. Furthermore, he asserts they do not constitute adoptive admissions and are therefore subject to the confrontation clause of the U.S. Constitution. The State, on the other hand, alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that it offered the statements to show their effect on Burgess \u2014 he giggled. Both parties are making those arguments for the first time: Burgess did not object when the State offered those statements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, other than the parties\u2019 assertions, we have no way of determining why the State presented the evidence. If appellant had objected, the State would have had to produce arguments to support the admission of the evidence. The issue is not preserved. Even if the appellant had objected at trial, the court properly could have overruled the objection. To avoid further litigation we note three evidentiary doctrines that would support the admission of the statements of which Burgess now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">First, in <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991), the Court of Appeals discussed the issue of adoptive admissions (in the hearsay context). The witness, Ms. Sellers, testified that she was at a motel with the defendant and three of his cohorts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the group watched television, a story came on about the Landover murders. The men began to jump and dance about the room. Bruce and Dunstrom recounted the group's beastly feats \u2014 Henry \u201cwas laughing along with them, cheering them on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 596 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Favorably citing Professor McLain, the Court reasoned that Henry tacitly adopted Bruce\u2019s and Dunstrom\u2019s statements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">A party ... may make a \u201ctacit admission,\u201d adopting, by his or her silence, another person\u2019s statement. In order for the other\u2019s statement to be considered the party\u2019s tacit admission, the following prerequisites must be satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>fied: (1) the party heard and understood the other person\u2019s statement; (2) at the time, the party had an opportunity to respond; (3) under the circumstances, a reasonable person in the party\u2019s position, who disagreed with the statement, would have voiced that disagreement. The party must have had first-hand knowledge of the matter addressed in the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">6 L. McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 801(4).3 at 312-13 (1987) (footnotes omitted). In fact, \u201cHenry even went beyond a tacit admission and by his obvious approval, adopted the statements as his own.\u201d <em>Henry, </em>324 Md. at 242, 596 A.2d 1024. Burgess\u2019s behavior, in response to Man\u2019s comment, is analogous to Henry\u2019s behavior. By giggling, Burgess indicated, to all around, that he understood what Man meant when he said, [\u201c]let\u2019s introduce my Man Mad Ball to the bridge[\u201d] \u2014 all the while, tossing a rock in his hand. Consequently, we do not agree with Burgess when he claims that his reaction was not an adoptive admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Second, the trial court could have found the statements admissible as non-hearsay.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">Many out-of-court utterances fall within such categories as greetings, pleasantries, expressions of gratitude, courtesies, questions, offers, instructions, warnings, exclamations, expressions of joy, annoyance, or other emotion, etc. Such utterances are not intended expressions of fact or opinion. They are not assertions, at least for purposes of the hearsay rule. Thus they are not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKZ\">\u201cHello.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cHow are you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201cHave a nice day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201cWould you like to have lunch?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t rain tomorrow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cI wonder what he paid for that car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cCan you join me for a drink?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cDon\u2019t do that, or else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cWatch your step.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">None of the above utterances is an intended expressions [sic] of fact or opinion. None is hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">D. Binder, Hearsay Handbook 18 (3rd ed. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Lastly, the trial court could have overruled any possible hearsay objection on the ground that the statement was not offered for the truth of the matter, but for its effect on the listener. In <em>Brown v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 187, 194, 560 A.2d 605 (1989), this court held that evidence offered to show its effect on the hearer\u2019s mind, rather than the truth of the matter asserted, was not hearsay. <em>See </em>L. McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 801.9 at 280-82. Thus, had the issue been preserved, we would hold that the lower court did not err by admitting the statements into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">Whether the court below improperly limited the defense cross examination of Calvin Morrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">At some point, Mad Ball and Burgess were friends. Nevertheless, during the trial, Mad Ball took the witness stand for the prosecution. Because Mad Ball testified against him, Burgess appears to maintain that Mad Ball was trying to \u201ccurry favor\u201d with the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Burgess asks us to hold that the lower court improperly limited his cross examination of Morrison. <em>See Deinhardt v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 391, 398, 348 A.2d 286 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>277 Md. 736 (1976).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Unfortunately, Burgess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>does not specify the particular areas to which he was restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Our review of the record reveals that the lower court allowed Burgess to inquire about Morrison\u2019s relationship with the police. The court did, however, limit Burgess when he tried to impeach Morrison by prior convictions. Smathers, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, represented to the court that the District of Columbia nol prossed a felony narcotics charge it had filed against Mad Ball. Maryland has a rule addressing proof of interest or conviction of an infamous crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">Evidence is admissible to prove the interest of a witness in any proceeding, or the fact of his conviction of an infamous crime. Evidence of conviction is not admissible if an appeal is pending, or the time for an appeal has not expired, or the conviction has been reversed, and there has been no retrial or reconviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-905(a) (1989). For purposes of this appeal, section 10-905(a) requires a conviction. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>is not a conviction. <em>See Curley v. State, </em>299 Md. 449, 474 A.2d 502 (1984). Consequently, because a nol prossed charge is <em>not </em>a conviction, Burgess could not properly impeach Morrison on the District of Columbia felony charge. Therefore, the lower court did not improperly limit appellant\u2019s crossexamination of Morrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Whether in the absence of a factual finding on the value of the property, defendant was improperly convicted in Count 62 of destruction of property of a value of greater than $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Mrs. Bryant, who was driving her car in the early morning hours of Sunday, May 27, 1989, testified that a dark-skinned \u201cguy\u201d wearing blue jeans and a red jacket (and apparently taller than his cohorts) \u201cran out in front of my car, and he put his hand back and threw tnis big <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>boulder.\u201d The \u201cbig boulder\u201d caused about $1000 damage to her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Appellant argues that the trial court did not determine whether Bryant\u2019s car was worth more than $300. Looking at the verdict sheet, we see that the lower court wrote beside count 62<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201cmore than $300.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cThe District Court or a circuit court sitting without a jury shall render a verdict upon the facts and the law. <em>Although not required, the court may state the grounds for its decision either in open court or by written memorandum.\" </em>I Md. Rule 4-328 (emphasis added). <em>See West v. State, </em>312 Md. 197, 213, 539 A.2d 231 (1988). In the instant case, the trial court had evidence before it to support the verdict. Bryant testified that a rock smashed her window and that the total damage to her vehicle was about $1000. Hence, we hold that the trial court did not err when it convicted Burgess on count 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Whether the court below committed constitutional error in permitting a variance in the proof at trial with respect to Count 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Count 90<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> alleged that Burgess destroyed (partially) Ms. Scott\u2019s car. At trial, Ms. Moody, a passenger in the vehicle, indicated that the automobile belonged to her father, Mr. Moody. Recognizing a potential defect, the State moved to amend the count to reflect Mr. Moody as the vehicle\u2019s owner, but the court denied the motion and sustained Burgess\u2019s objection. Later, the State argued that the change in the owner\u2019s name did not change the character of the offense. Subsequently, the court convicted Burgess on count 90. He contends that was an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>In the instant case, the name of the original property owner was incorrect: \u201cbeing the property of Gloria Scott____\u201d But as the trial judge noted, proof of ownership is not a material element of the crime of \u201cMalicious Destruction of Property.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 111 (1987 repl. vol.).

The record does not reflect that Burgess\u2019s admission/confession was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Trooper Michael White testified that neither he nor his partner, Trooper John Wooters, made any threats, promises, or inducements to Burgess when they first went to his house and later when they arrested him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">Q.

No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>In his admission/confession, Burgess indicated that no one induced him or promised him anything to make his statement; no one threatened, intimidated, or forced him to make the statement; and that he made his statement freely and voluntarily. In addition, his counsel admitted that Burgess made the admission: (1) \u201cNow he did make a statement as Mr. Smathers pointed out____\u201d; and (2) \u201cNow, he admits to throwing some rocks but that admission must be corroborated as to each count for which he might be found guilty for each count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">When delivering its verdict, the trial court discussed Burgess\u2019s admission/confession.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Having said that, let\u2019s start firstly with the defendant\u2019s statement in this case.

He has appeared before the Court numerous times and I have never found him to be a person who would stretch the truth to help or aid his cause and he takes no personal interest in cases. So, therefore, I find what Detective Philbin said that the defendant had knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily waived his right to have an attorney present and that he had indeed agreed to talk to him freely and voluntarily. The Court find[s] this statement was freely and voluntarily made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The court made those remarks <em>after </em>closing arguments. Burgess did <em>not </em>object to the comments. Therefore, any issue springing from those comments is not preserved. <em>Dresbach v. State, </em>228 Md. 451, 452-53, 180 A.2d 299 (1962).

This argument breaks down into two parts and one sub-part: (A) the court\u2019s consideration of facts not before it; (1) whether Burgess voluntarily made his admission/confession; and (B) the impartiality of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In <em>Turman v. United States, </em>555 A.2d 1037 (D.C.Cir.1989), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia faced an issue almost identical to the one before us. In that case, Officer Jones, a member of the Morals Division of the Metropolitan Police Department, was working undercover as a prostitute. She arrested the appellants because one of them requested her to engage in sexual acts for money. During the trial, in response to the appellants\u2019 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, the lower court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">[Counsel] ... Officer ... Jones has testified before me in this type of case several times just as she has probably testified before all our judges in this court several, several times, and <em>she\u2019s the most credible and most reliable witness in all the cases that she has ever testified in before me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">Later, in response to the defendants\u2019 renewed motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Officer ... <em>Jones has testified before me several times as a person of great credibility and, indeed, she is, </em>and the testimony in this court by [appellants] corroborates the fact that indeed she is a person of great credibility, because to a very, very large measure each of them corroborated her testimony.... So it is clear ... that they corroborate substantially the testimony of Officer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">Jones. And so indeed the court believes her____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-10\"><em>Turman, </em>555 A.2d at 1038 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The appellate court reversed the appellants\u2019 convictions because the lower court relied on facts presented to it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>previous trials, and because the lower court did not assure the parties that its \u201cprevious assessments] would play no role in judging the pending case,\u201d thereby creating an appearance of partiality \u201cwhich tainted the trial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Maryland common law offers two cases that are instructive. In <em>Trusty v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 620, 508 A.2d 1018, <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>308 Md. 658, 521 A.2d 749 (1987), we stated \u201cthe law [is] clear that a trial judge cannot apply the knowledge personally gained from one case to the quantum of evidence presented in a later case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>67 Md.App. at 626, 508 A.2d 1018. The trial court, in <em>Trusty, </em>had unwittingly taken judicial notice of \u201cthe experience and expertise of [a] police officer, the reputation of [a] neighborhood, and the component facts of a drug transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 508 A.2d 1018. The State presented <em>practically no </em>evidence to indicate that the arresting officer had any experience with narcotics investigations, yet the trial court found probable cause \u2014 in effect, taking judicial notice that the officer was experienced. Therefore, we held that the evidence before the trial court was quite insufficient to find probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In <em>Coomes v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 377, 537 A.2d 1208, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 8, 542 A.2d 845 (1988), we faced a situation similar to that in <em>Trusty. </em>\u201cOur review of the record reveal[ed] that there was <em>no </em>evidence produced from which the court could have concluded that the seizing officers, by reason of their training and experience, had probable cause to believe that the items seized were marijuana and paraphernalia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>74 Md.App. at 389, 537 A.2d 1208 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we stated that a \u201ctrial judge may not take judicial notice of the experience and expertise of a police officer and, <em>from that, </em>find probable cause for the seizure of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u201cWhen a case is tried by the court, as was the one <em>sub judice, </em>the judgment of the trial court' on the evidence will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous; and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>accord great weight to the court\u2019s determination regarding credibility.\u201d <em>Comstock v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 744, 757, 573 A.2d 117 (1990). Yet, that determination is bounded by the evidence before the court. Under the principles enunciated in <em>Trusty </em>and <em>Coomes, </em>the lower court should not have commented on Detective Philbin\u2019s reputation for veracity, absent evidentiary support. We now examine that comment to see if it warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The instant case is different from <em>Trusty </em>and <em>Coomes. </em>In those cases, the lower courts had either no evidence (Coomes) or an insufficient amount <em>(Trusty) </em>before them to determine whether the officers in question had the knowledge and training necessary to make a probable cause determination. Thus, the lower courts\u2019 judicial notice of the respective officers\u2019 expertise had no independent support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The State\u2019s burden \u201cto establish affirmatively the admissibility of the confession or admission arises upon proper objection.\u201d <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 38, 375 A.2d 1105, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 646, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977). Burgess never indicated, at trial, that he did not voluntarily make his admission/confession. On a pre-trial Motion to Suppress, the court must determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the admission/confession was voluntarily made. <em>Id. </em>Then, the trier of fact [here, the court] must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant voluntarily made the statement. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, ignoring Detective Philbin\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we note three sources of information to buttress the State\u2019s position that Burgess freely and voluntarily made his admission/confession: (1) Trooper Michael White\u2019s testimony; (2) Burgess\u2019s signature on the waiver of rights section of the form that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>he completed; and perhaps the most damaging detail against his argument (3) his counsel\u2019s concession that Burgess made the admission/confession. <em>See supra </em>text at 541-542.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The evidence regarding the voluntary nature of Burgess\u2019s admission/confession is <em>uncontradicted. </em>Therefore, even ignoring Detective Philbin\u2019s testimony, we can easily distinguish the instant case from <em>Trusty </em>and <em>Coomes </em>because there was an abundance of other evidence, whereby a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Burgess voluntarily made his admission/confession. <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 151, 406 A.2d 415 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Implicit in appellant\u2019s argument is the issue of the impartiality of the trial court. He did not raise that issue at trial either. Thus, the issue is not preserved. Our examination of the record satisfies us that the court was not partial toward the State. In fact, any potential error caused by the trial court\u2019s statements was cured by evidence other than Detective Philbin\u2019s testimony (and lack of evidence about the involuntariness of the statement), which indicates that Burgess voluntarily made his admission/confession.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u201c[S]o long as a judge remains open-minded enough to refrain from finally deciding a case until. all of the evidence has been presented, remarks made by the judge during the course of the proceedings will not be considered as indicative of disqualifying bias or prejudice.\u201d J. Shalman, S. Lubet, &amp; J. Alfini, Judicial Conduct and Ethics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u00a7 5.07 at 107 (1990). But, \u201cwhen a judge\u2019s remarks are so extreme that they show that his ... decision has been predetermined, improper bias or prejudice will be found to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108 (footnote omitted). The latter comment does not apply to the trial court. The court made its comments about Detective Philbin <em>after </em>all of the evidence and both parties\u2019 closing arguments. The court\u2019s decision was not predetermined in any way.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, the record reflects three alternative grounds to support the State\u2019s contention that Burgess voluntarily made his admission/confession. The only evidence Burgess produced that would suggest he did not voluntarily make his admission/confession is the advice his stepfather gave him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">Q. Did you give your son any advice at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">A. Yeah. I told him don\u2019t say nothing [sic] to the police until I come there with a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Burgess did not present this argument before the trial court. He does not present it now. Thus, the State\u2019s evidence was not contested when it introduced Burgess\u2019s admission/confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In <em>Boyd v. State, </em>we noted that \u201c[w]hether recusal is appropriate depends upon what the trier of fact knows when the trial begins, not when it ends. A review on appeal necessarily includes scrutiny of the entire proceeding in order that the reviewing court can determine whether bias or prejudice is shown.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Boyd, </em>79 Md.App, 53, 65, 555 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>A.2d 535 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>321 Md. 69, 581 A.2d 1 (1990). Our review of the record convinces us that the lower court was not biased or prejudiced against Burgess. <em>See </em>II Md. Rule 1231 (guidelines for recusal).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We are aware that trial judges will have many witnesses come through their courtrooms. Some of those witnesses will be frequent visitors. This raises a dilemma for the trial court: should the court have to recuse itself when dealing with a well-known witness? The answer is yes and no.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">There is nothing inherently improper about a judge deciding the credibility of a witness who has previously appeared before that judge \u2014 an event that occurs with some frequency in the Superior Court. But just as a jury may only decide a case based on the facts properly presented to it during trial, ... so too must a judge, sitting as the trier-of-fact, base his or her determinations solely on the evidence presented in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Turman, </em>555 A.2d at 1038. To prevent any possible error, the trial court may inform the parties about its prior judicial experience with the witness. But the court should make it clear to the parties involved that its previous assessment of the witness will play no role in judging that witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>credibility in the case at bar. <em>See id. </em>at 1039. In those rare and exceptional cases where the judge concludes that he or she would be swayed by his or her <em>a priori </em>assessment of the witness\u2019s credibility as to be unable to decide the case fairly, the judge should step aside. For it is a fundamental principle \u201cthat a judge shall not preside in any case unless he is disinterested and impartial.\u201d <em>Costello v.

Your Honor, the State calls Patricia Jones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Burgess maintains that the lower court erred by not investigating a <em>possible </em>violation of the court\u2019s Exclusion Order. We use the word \u201cpossible\u201d because the record does not reflect whether there were any witnesses in the courtroom. Neither the State nor Burgess noted for the record that anyone left the courtroom. Thus, we have no practical way of determining whether the court should have made an investigation. \u201cWhen ... the trial court was notified of an apparent violation by the witness of the order of sequestration, it was then incumbent upon the trial judge to make an investigation pursuant to the discretionary power vested as to the imposition of any sanction.\u201d Brown, 272 Md. at 478, 825 A.2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Therefore, because Burgess did not object and failed to point out that there were any witnesses who under the rule should not have been in the courtroom at the time, we hold that he waived any possible error on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Whether the court below erred in permitting Destiny Morris to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The State called Ms. Destiny Morris to the stand. Morris was riding in Palmer\u2019s truck when the appellant and his cohorts heaved rocks at the vehicle. At least one rock crashed through the front windshield and struck Morris on the head. At the time, Morris, along with her friends, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>returning home from Ocean City, Maryland. She was asleep, resting her head on the truck\u2019s dashboard. Morris never knew what struck her and went into a coma shortly thereafter. At trial, Morris, who had just graduated from the tenth grade, functioned at the third grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The court apparently wanted to determine whether Morris was competent to testify.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">THE COURT: And you [Mr. Joyner] have nothing to do with the remaining cases here and I put that on the record clearly, <em>but the Court\u2019s going to use this opportunity to find out about this confabulation because it could very well effect whether or not she testifies at all down the line. </em>There is no jury here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">MR.

Morris remembered nothing of the incident or her attackers on that fateful morning. In fact, she did not even recall going to the beach, let alone returning from it. The content of her testimony was neither harmful nor prejudicial to Burgess. To the extent that the manner in which she presented herself and testified might have been damaging to Burgess, the trial judge made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>it clear that sympathy would play no part in his decision.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>See State v.

Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\"><em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665 (footnote omitted). Scrutinizing Ms. Morris\u2019s testimony, we find nothing prejudicial or harmful to Burgess.

State, </em>285 Md. 66, 69, 400 A.2d 419 (1979). \u201cThe restraints on a judge\u2019s power to impose sentence are, generally, that the sentence not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, that the sentencing judge not be motivated by ill-will, prejudice or other improper considerations and, that the sentence fall within statutory limits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We concur with appellant Burgess that the lower court <em>considered </em>his race \u2014 but we do not agree that this consideration was improper. As the State points out, \u201cthe court distinguished Burgess from those described in the media as young black troublemakers.\u201d Therefore, we hold that the lower court did not improperly consider Burgess\u2019s race when that court sentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-12\">.

The United States Supreme Court delineated the standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">We conclude that in determining whether a judgment should be vacated for a violation of \u00a7 455(a) [federal recusal guideline], it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>appropriate to consider the risk of injustice to the parties in the particular case, the risk that the denial of relief will produce injustice in other cases, and the risk of undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\"><em>Liljeberg, </em>486 U.S. at 864, 108 S.Ct. at 2204.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the risk of injustice to the appellant is minuscule. In fact, he never raises the issue that the trial court should have recused itself or that the court was biased. The balance favors upholding the judgment. The appellant did not contradict the State\u2019s evidence that he voluntarily made his admission/confession. Moreover, there are three alternative sources of information, apart from Detective Philbin\u2019s testimony, to support the State\u2019s claim that Mr. Burgess voluntarily made his admission/confession. There is no risk that injustice will be done in other cases \u2014 the appellant never even suggested (or suggests now) that the court recuse itself. Lastly, there is no risk that the public\u2019s confidence will be undermined.
