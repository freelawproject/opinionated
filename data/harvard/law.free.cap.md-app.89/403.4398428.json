In short, the State alleged that Mr. and Mrs. Cicoria improperly used campaign funds for personal benefits and deposited those funds in a joint account. Those funds totalled $64,324.50. The State asserted that the Cicorias employed several schemes to steal money from Citizens for Cicoria. For example:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">1) In one plot, according to the State Prosecutor, Citizens for Cicoria reimbursed Mr. Cicoria for a $2300 loan \u2014 a loan that the committee never received. In actuality, $2300 worth of contributions were not reported as discrete contributions with specific donors. Instead, the ledger listed Mr. Cicoria as giving the committee a check (loan) for $2300.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">2) Mr. and Mrs. Cicoria, along with Mr. Cicoria\u2019s mother, purchased a unit (titled in their names) at the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Professional Park in December of 1986. Citizens for Cicoria paid $30,112.49 towards the unit\u2019s purchase price because Mr. Cicoria used the office as his headquarters. Yet, surprisingly, the Cicorias deducted the interest payments from their personal income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">3) Using a false expense scheme, checks for payment to CN printing were actually made out to Catherine Cicoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">4) Campaign contributions were deposited directly into the Cicorias\u2019 joint bank account. The statutory procedure requires the treasurer of the committee to deposit funds in the committee bank account and then disburse checks for expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In addition to those theft schemes, the State contended that the Cicorias violated State tax laws because they did not report those \u201cextra funds\u201d on their tax returns for 1986-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">On November 21, 1989, a Grand Jury of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland charged appellant with four counts of theft, one count of conspiracy to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>theft, two counts of perjury, one count of failure to complete a campaign report, and three counts of tax evasion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Bowling of the Circuit Court for Charles County was assigned to the case because Mr. Cicoria was a sitting member of the Prince George\u2019s County Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Cicoria filed a Motion to Dismiss the charges against him. The circuit court, on February 16, 1990, dismissed the four theft counts and the one conspiracy count on the ground that the State Prosecutor exceeded his statutory authority in presenting the case to the Grand Jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>court dismissed the penury counts and the failure to file a complete campaign report charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State nol prossed the remaining charges, thereby ending the first prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Subsequently, on March 19, 1990, the Grand Jury of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County returned a second indictment against Mr. and Mrs. Cicoria. The indictment included one count of felony theft, one count of conspiracy to commit felony theft, two counts of making false statements,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and three counts of tax evasion. Cicoria made a Motion to Dismiss the remaining counts of the indictment, Motion for Appropriate Relief,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a Motion to Recuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Judge Nalley of the Circuit Court for Charles County. At a hearing on September 5, 1990, the court denied all of Cicoria\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The court granted Cicoria a one week continuance because Mrs. Cicoria, his co-defendant, fled the jurisdiction and did not appear for trial on the scheduled date. The trial was mostly a \u201cpaper affair.\u201d Witnesses testified about bank accounts, committee ledgers, handwriting analysis, and so on. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, and again at the conclusion of all the evidence, Cicoria moved for Judgment of Acquittal, which motions the trial court denied. Specifically, Cicoria requested that the court strike all exhibits and testimony concerning the alleged joint bank account held by Cicoria and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">After the twelve day trial, the jury convicted Cicoria of all charges. On December 12, 1990, Judge Nalley sentenced Cicoria to concurrent sentences of ten years with all but five years suspended and five years of probation. The court also denied Cicoria\u2019s request for bond pending appeal. Cicoria appeals to this court, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">I. Does the theft statute apply to election law violations? Specifically, do Count One theft and Count Two conspiracy to commit theft properly charge offenses which would apply to candidate Cicoria?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">II. Did the State prosecutor have the statutory authority to bring the charges in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">III. Did the court err by not dismissing Counts One and Two because those counts had been previously dismissed on the merits in a prior proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">IV. Did the court erroneously admit evidence concerning a purported joint bank account when the State did not sufficiently prove that it was a joint bank account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">V. Did the State prove a willful violation of the State Income Tax Laws despite Cicoria\u2019s good faith defense':</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">VI. Did the court err by not recusing itself at the trial of this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Does the theft statute apply to election law violations? Specifically, do Count One theft and Count Two conspiracy to commit theft properly charge offenses which would apply to candidate Cicoria?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The Grand Jury indicted Cicoria for theft from Citizens for Cicoria \u2014 his election campaign committee. He argues that: (1) the State cannot convict him for stealing contributions that were for his personal use \u2014 he cannot steal from himself; (2) the Election Code does not establish a legal \u201cowner\u201d of funds as found in article 27, \u00a7 340(g); (3) the Election Code regulatory scheme precludes the State from prosecuting him under other statutes or common law for election related offenses; and (4) assuming the Election Code does create an owner of the campaign contributions, that owner is the treasurer<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Citizens for Cicoria, <em>not </em>the entity Citizens for Cicoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Cicoria appears to rely on <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 490 A.2d 1277 (1985), for the proposition that \u201c[i]t is fundamental that a court is without power to render a verdict or impose a sentence under a charging document which does not charge an offense within its jurisdiction prescribed by common law or by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, 490 A.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">To understand better Cicoria\u2019s contentions, we examine article 27, \u00a7 342(a), (b) (Maryland\u2019s theft statute).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">(a) <em>Obtaining or exerting unauthorized control. </em>\u2014 A person commits the offense of theft when he willfully or knowingly obtains control which is unauthorized or exerts control which is unauthorized over property of the owner, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">(1) Has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(2) Willfully or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in such manner as to deprive the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">(3) Uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing the use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">(b) <em>Obtaining control by deception. </em>\u2014 A person commits the offense of theft when he willfully or knowingly uses deception to obtain and does obtain control over property of the owner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">(1) Has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">(2) Willfully or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in such manner as to deprive the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">(3) Uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing such use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Cicoria does not maintain that he did not take monies from his campaign committee, rather, he argues that Citizens for Cicoria did not own the money in its account (or contributions intended to go into its account). Therefore, to simplify the discussion, we consider who \u201cowned\u201d the funds at issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Section 340(g) defines the word owner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\"><em>\u201cOwner \u201d </em>means a person, other than the offender, who has possession of or any other interest in the property involved, even though that interest or possession is unlawful, and without whose consent the offender has no authority to exert control over property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We also look to various sections of the Fair Election Practices Act for help in clarifying the issue. Md.Ann. Code art. 33, \u00a7\u00a7 1-1-32-6 (1986 repl. vol. &amp; supp. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">First, each candidate<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for a state public office must have either a treasurer<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or an authorized candidate campaign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>committee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 26-8.

Regarding statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeals notes that \u201c[r]esultant conclusions are to be reasonable, logical and consistent with common sense.\u201d <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9 (1990). Cicoria was <em>not </em>the owner of the campaign funds in the Citizens for Cicoria bank account. Almost all campaign funds had to go through the treasurer of Citizens for Cicoria first.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even Cicoria\u2019s personal monies, once he designated them for campaign purposes, had to flow through proper channels, be spent appropriately, and be accounted for. Moreover, upon the dissolution of Citizens for Cicoria, the remaining funds do not revert to Cicoria \u2014 even personal monies that he put into the campaign fund. . Second, the treasurer was not the owner of the funds, but their channeling agent. The treasurer was the <em>steward </em>for Citizens for Cicoria. The Election Code requires that he deposit campaign monies in a special account \u2014 Citizens for Cicoria\u2019s account. Furthermore, the treasurer could only spend the money in Citizens for Cicoria\u2019s bank account in a way that would \u201cpromote or assist in the promotion of the success or defeat of\u201d Cicoria\u2019s candidacy. Lastly, at trial, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>presented evidence to support its position that Citizens for Cicoria owned the monies at issue in this lawsuit. Ms. Babinec, Director of Candidacy and Campaign Finance, State Administrative Board of Election Laws, testified about the ownership of campaign funds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">Q [Mr. Nevin for the State] When a continuing committee receives contributions, whose money is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">A [Ms. Babinec] The committee\u2019s, the entity\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Q Does the money personally belong to a candidate, treasurer or chairman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">Q Can a candidate, treasurer or chairman do anything they want with the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">A No. Their activity is limited to campaign expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7\">Thus, all these factors point to Citizens for Cicoria as the entity which had \u201cpossession of or any other interest in the property involved____\u201d Md.Ann.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 340(g) (1987 repl. vol.). Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s theory that he cannot steal from himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">There is a dearth of authority on the issue of theft by a candidate from his campaign funds. <em>United States v. Pisani, </em>773 F.2d 397 (2d Cir.1985), is the only case we could find that bears even the slightest factual similarity to the case at bar. In <em>Pisani, </em>the federal government charged Pisani, a New York State Senator, with tax evasion, mail fraud, and filing false tax returns. Some of the mail fraud charges dealt with Pisani converting monies from his election campaign fund to his personal use. On appeal, Pisani argued that \u201chis use of campaign funds for personal purposes was not unlawful____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. On page 407 of the opinion, the court laid out that particular issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-14\">At the heart of this issue lies the question of whether New York law required Pisani to use moneys [sic] contributed to his campaign fund solely for campaign purposes, and prohibited him from putting them to personal use. The government contends that applicable New York law did not prohibit personal use of campaign funds, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>that Pisani\u2019s conceded use of some of them for personal purposes constituted embezzlement and conversion. Pisani contends, and we agree, that at the time of the events in question, nothing in New York law prohibited a candidate from using campaign funds for personal purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Pisani used campaign funds for personal family and personal business expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 408. His campaign disclosure statements did not accurately reflect those expenditures. <em>Id. </em>Thus, his situation is similar to Mr. Cicoria\u2019s. At the time, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[n]othing in this section [New York election laws] referred] to campaign committee funds or in any other way identifie[d] the source of the moneys [sic] from which expenditures may be made. The clear intent was to regulate what could be spent \u201cin respect of any election[,]\u201d and not to regulate or restrict a candidate\u2019s expenditures for nonelection purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 410. After argument on Pisani\u2019s appeal, the New York legislature directly addressed the issue. New \u00a7 14-130 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Contributions received by a candidate or a political committee may be expended for any lawful purpose. Such funds shall not be converted by any person to a personal use which is unrelated to a political campaign or the holding of a public office or party position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">N.Y.Election Law \u00a7 14-130 (Consol.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Maryland election laws are not as specific as New York laws on this particular point. But, Maryland law does specify that campaign contributions and expenditures are \u201cto promote or assist in the promotion of the success or defeat of any candidate____\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 33, \u00a7 1-1(a)(5), (7) (Supp.1989). Mr. Cicoria may not be permitted to willfully or knowingly obtain or exert unauthorized control over property (funds) of his campaign committee, which control has the purpose of depriving the committee of that property (the funds) and the opportunity to promote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>success of his candidacy. The indictment, quite appropriately, alleged that he did \u201csteal\u201d money \u201cfrom the campaign committee known as Citizens for Cicoria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Cicoria advances the argument that the penalty provisions of the Election Code\u2019s section on Fair Election Practices are exclusive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For example, \u00a7 26-20 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">[a]ny person who violates any of the provisions of this subtitle is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, in the discretion of the court. If a different penalty is specifically prescribed for violation of any section in this subtitle and expressly set forth therein, the specific penalty applies and the penalty set forth in this section does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Appellant is correct to point out that the Legislature has not provided for theft as an offense under the Election Code.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Cicoria, however, provides no authority to support his contentions that \u00a7 26-20 precludes the State from prosecuting him under other statutes or the common law for violations related to the elections arena. Our research of the legislative history reveals nothing that would support</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Cicoria\u2019s position.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Looking to other jurisdictions, we find one case similar to the instant case. In <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>916 F.2d 207 (5th Cir.1990), the defendants circumvented the prohibition on corporate political contributions as regulated by the federal election laws. <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431-456 (1988). The defendants argued that the government should have prosecuted them only under the federal election laws (misdemeanor offenses), and not under Title 18 for fraud, concealment, and misapplication of funds (felonious offenses). <em>Hopkins, </em>916 F.2d at 218. The court found their argument \u201cmeritless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court quoted from <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. at 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979). The United States Supreme Court stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201cwhen an act violates more than one criminal statute, the Government may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against either class of defendants.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 123-24, 99 S.Ct. at 2203-04. In addition, the court in <em>Hopkins </em>noted \u201c[tjjhe only exception arises where Congress clearly intended that one statute supplant another; the fact that one statute is more specific than the other is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>916 F.2d at 218. Furthermore, \u201cnor does the fact that one statute prescribes a felony and the other prescribes a misdemeanor affect the prosecutor\u2019s authority to choose among statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">There is no indication in the federal election laws that Congress intended them to supplant the general criminal statutes. Moreover, the defendants in this case violated not only the election laws but also committed acts that constituted independent violations of the more general criminal statutes of Title 18. Conviction under those sections requires proof of elements not required to prove a violation of the election laws. The offenses under Title 18 thus stand wholly apart and separate from any violation of the federal election laws. The defendants\u2019 contention that they were improperly prosecuted under Title 18 is without support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 218-19 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Reading the Election Code, we do not find theft listed as an offense. Furthermore, comparing the Fair Election Practices sections of the Code with the theft statutes, we find the elements of theft as a crime differ from election law violations. Thus, absent any indication from the Legislature that \u00a7 26-20 precludes prosecution under other statutes or the common law, we hold that the State properly charged Mr. Cicoria with theft and conspiracy to commit theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Therefore, based on the discussions above, we hold that counts one and two charged cognizable offenses. <em>See Williams v.

Mr. Williams took this action because, apparently, Judge Bowling dismissed the first indictment on the ground that the \u201cState Prosecutor exceeded his statutory authority....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The State Prosecutor may proceed under article 10, \u00a7 33B(b) or (c). On the facts in this case, his power comes from \u00a7 33B(c). That section deals with multi-jurisdictional criminal activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">At the request of either the Governor, Attorney General, General Assembly or a State\u2019s Attorney, the State Prosecutor may investigate criminal activity conducted or committed partly in this State and partly in another jurisdiction, or which is conducted or committed in more than one political subdivision of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The filing of false tax returns is a multi-county offense. <em>Aud v.

If an unauthorized person appears before the Grand Jury (before it issues an indictment), the court should grant a Motion to Dismiss the Indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 660.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the present case, Mr. Williams, the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>George\u2019s County, specifically requested Mr. Montanarelli, the State Prosecutor, to appear before the Grand Jury. Therefore, under the authority of <em>Goldberg </em>and article 10, \u00a7 33B(c), the State Prosecutor properly appeared before the Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Did the court err by not dismissing Counts One and Two because those counts had been previously dismissed on the merits in a prior proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">At a motions hearing on the first indictment, Judge Bowling dismissed some of the counts against Mr. Cicoria because the State Prosecutor exceeded his statutory authority.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Mr. Cicoria argues that the State should be bound by the principle of res judicata, and accordingly, should not have brought the second indictment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u201cIt is beyond question that the closely related doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel apply to criminal as well as civil causes.\u201d <em>Cook v. State, </em>281 Md. 665, 668, 381 A.2d 671, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 839, 99 S.Ct. 126, 58 L.Ed.2d 136 (1978). As Judge Nalley noted at the motions hearing on September 5, 1990, the movant carries the burden of proving that the previous decision precludes the present action. <em>See Holloway v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 703, 288 A.2d 652 (1972) (defendant did not produce sufficient evidence to support his Motion to Dismiss based on collateral estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Appellant did not furnish us with a transcript of Judge Bowling\u2019s motions hearing on the first indictment. Thus, we have no way of determining (other than the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>assertions) the grounds Judge Bowling used to dismiss certain counts of the first indictment. Nevertheless, to avoid further litigation, we address the issue. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cThere is no question but that a criminal defendant maybe indicted more than once for the same offense, ... and that any irregularity in a prior indictment may be corrected in a later indictment upon which a defendant may be tried....\u201d <em>Irvin v. State, </em>276 Md. 168, 172, 344 A.2d 418 (1975) (citation omitted). The State, however, may not indict the defendant at will. It is bound by principles of due process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">In Maryland the State may either appeal the dismissal of an indictment or seek a new indictment or both so long as the State\u2019s action is not deemed to be oppressive and thus a possible violation of due process of law. In sum, the State must act in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\"><em>Irvin v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 457, 463, 328 A.2d 329 (1974), <em>aff'd, </em>276 Md. 168, 344 A.2d 418 (1975). Nothing in the record suggests that the State\u2019s actions (in reindicting Mr. Cicoria) were oppressive or a violation of due process of law. Therefore, we hold that the State did not violate the <em>Irvin </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Did the court erroneously admit evidence concerning a purported joint bank account when the State did not sufficiently prove that it was a joint bank account?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">At trial, Judge Nalley admitted evidence concerning a bank account shared by Mr. and Mrs. Cicoria. The State proved that funds taken from Citizens for Cicoria\u2019s account (or intended for its account) were diverted and deposited into that joint bank account. Mr. Cicoria maintains that he is not listed on the account, and that the court committed reversible error by admitting evidence of the joint bank account. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201cEvidence is relevant if it tends to make a material issue in the case more probably true or untrue.\u201d <em>Jordan v.

Nevertheless, the trial court may exclude evidence if its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge has wide discretion when ruling on the relevance of the evidence. <em>Best v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 241, 259, 556 A.2d 701, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 70, 562 A.2d 718 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Ms. Mouzon, custodian of records at Sovran Bank, testified that account # 8524909 was opened in 1969. In 1977 Catherine Cicoria was the single owner of the account. But between 1977 and 1983, the bank added Mr. Cicoria\u2019s name to the account. Ms. Mouzon admitted that the bank does not have the original joint signature card with Mr. Cicoria\u2019s signature, <em>but the bank does have an \u201cautosig\u201d which is a photocopy of the signature card. Both Mr. and Mrs. Cicoria\u2019s signatures appear on the autosig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Mr. Cicoria suggests that account # 8524909 is a single account because the checks list only Mrs. Cicoria\u2019s name. Normally, both names in a joint account appear on a check, however, Ms. Mouzon pointed out that is not required. Thus, we hold that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence on the joint ownership status of account # 8524909.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Did the State prove a willful violation of the State Income Tax Laws despite Cicoria\u2019s good faith defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Appellant next alleges that a subjectively reasonable good faith belief will defeat a charge of tax evasion. <em>Cheeks v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 111 S.Ct. 604, 611, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991). His position is that Mrs. Cicoria \u201cmaintained the checkbook, paid the family bills, and had contact with the accountant who prepared the tax returns.\u201d Appellant argues that he \u201cwas clearly entitled to a Judgment of Acquittal____\u201d He is wrong. Assuming, <em>arguen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>do, </em>that he did present evidence supporting a \u201cgood faith\u201d defense, it was at best a jury question. If the jury failed to consider that defense, it was not due to judicial error, but was caused by appellant\u2019s failure to request the court to instruct the jury on the good faith defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Appellant goes on to argue that he was entitled to a jury instruction on his good faith defense claim. Assuming that he did make out a proper question for the jury, we look to Md.Rule 4-325(e) for guidance in this area.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The record indicates that Mr. Cicoria did not request a good faith defense instruction, or object to the court\u2019s instructions. Therefore, he waived any possible error. Further in the exercise of our discretion, we decline to hold that the lower court committed plain error in not, <em>sua sponte, </em>instructing the jury on his good faith claim. <em>See Tull v. State, </em>230 Md. 152, 186 A.2d 205 (1962) (failure to instruct properly on the matter of self-defense was not \u201cplain error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Did the court err by not recusing itself at the trial of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Lastly, appellant argues that Judge Nalley was \u201cbiased and prejudiced against him.\u201d To support his argument, appellant points out that Judge Nalley ordered him to provide handwriting exemplars and required him to \u201creport to a probation officer pre-trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Apparently, appellant relies on Canon 8(C)(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. \u201cA judge should not participate in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.\u201d In <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 86, 581 A.2d 1 (1990), the Court of Appeals favorably cited the test used by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., </em>861 F.2d 1307, 1318 (2d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1102, 109 S.Ct. 2458, 104 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1989), for the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">[T]he test to be applied is an objective one which assumes that a reasonable person <em>knows and understands all the relevant facts, </em>[citations omitted.] We disagree with our dissenting colleague\u2019s statement that recusal based on an appearance of impropriety ... \u2018requires us to judge the situation from the viewpoint of the reasonable person, and not from a purely legalistic perspective.\u2019 Like all legal issues, judges determine appearance of impropriety \u2014 not by considering what a straw poll of the only partly informed man-in-the-street would show \u2014 but by examining the record facts and the law, and then deciding whether a reasonable person knowing and understanding all relevant facts would recuse the judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Our standard of review is abuse of discretion. <em>Boyd, </em>321 Md. at 74, 581 A.2d 1. Appellant bears the burden of proof on this issue. <em>Carey v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 246, 248-49, 405 A.2d 293 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 967, 100 S.Ct. 1660, 64 L.Ed.2d 244 (1980). He does not meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">First, Judge Nalley required Mr. Cicoria to report to his probation officer prior to trial. While that disturbed Mr. Cicoria, he fails to point out that Judge Nalley later rescinded that order at Mr. Cicoria\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Second, the judge denied Mr. Cicoria\u2019s request to postpone a handwriting analysis. Mr. Cicoria argues that the State did not timely file its request. The State attached its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Automatic Discovery and Request for Discovery to the indictment against Mr. Cicoria. Section 3(h) of that form asked that the defendant \u201cprovide specimens of his handwriting.\u201d Original counsel for Mr. Cicoria, Arnold Weiner, Esquire, and Thomas Zagami, Esquire, entered their appearances on April 5, 1990. The State sent Mr. Weiner a copy of the indictment and the State\u2019s Automatic Discovery and Request for Discovery on or about March 16. Based on the timing of events, it appears that the State provided Mr. Weiner with its discovery requests well before the clock even began to run. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 4-263(e). In effect, the State supplied Mr. Cicoria with more time to respond to its request. Furthermore, the lower court attempted to schedule a handwriting session on two prior occasions. We hold the lower court did not abuse its discretion by not recusing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-14\">.

We get our information from a letter to Mr. Alexander Williams, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, from Mr. Stephen Montanarelli, State Prosecutor, dated March 2, 1990. In addition, at a motions hearing on September 5, 1990, Judge Nalley discussed Judge Bowling\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">THE COURT [JUDGE NALLEY]: The reason I raise it, and Mr. Touhey [Mrs. Catherine Cicoria\u2019s Counsel] might want to talk about it, but you said something slipped your mind. Page nine of Mr. Weiner\u2019s [Former Counsel for Mr. Cicoria] memo, which you are adopting, the first full paragraph, the second line of that page he says, \"The most critical of the ultimate facts in the first indictment was whether the theft-related offenses were multi-jurisdictional offenses or not. That issue was resolved against the State, and that decision become final.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">I attached an awful lot of significance to that assertion. It seems to me that you have one question: If indictment number one was or the charges in indictment number one were dismissed because the prosecutor didn\u2019t have authority to do something and his authority might have been lacking or Judge Bowling might have concluded that the prosecutor lacked authority, regardless of whether Alex Williams was involved or not, if he concluded as a matter of fact based on whatever was before him that the theft-related offenses were not multi-jurisdictional. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">On the other hand, his conclusion might have been based on whatever was presented to him. Whether or not the offenses were mu[l]ti-jurisdictional he didn\u2019t have to reach that issue if he had been persuaded that the State Prosecutor for some other reason, such as not being solicited by a State\u2019s Attorney, had no business being involved in this kind of matter, and I just wondered if either of you wanted to talk about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">Mr. Touhey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">MR. TOUHEY: Your Honor, your analysis just now to my belief strikes all the reason why the case should be dismissed because you are left in the very simple quandary of trying to be an appellate review, a second review of the decision of Judge Bowling. I mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>his order is quite clear. I mean his order says that he was dismissing one through six of the first indictment, and so we are clear as to what we are talking about, one through six, as I recall, were the theft charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">MR. NEVIN: One through five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxK\">THE COURT: What were dismissed were the theft charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">MR.

I don\u2019t know what the evidence before him suggested in that regard, but the issue is not for you to try and go back and figure out what was before him as to the first indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">THE COURT: Well, as you folks who are asking me to dismiss this set of charges based on what you say may have been before Judge Bowling, you are the moving party, isn\u2019t there a burden on you to tell me or demonstrate to me what it was that Judge Bowling was ruling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuD\">MR. TOUHEY: No, all our burden is, Your Honor, to say Judge Bowling had before him certain facts, issues and arguments, and he made a ruling that was in the nature of a final judgment that there was a defect and that the case would be dismissed as to those counts.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-14\">.
