He was sentenced to imprisonment for life on the murder conviction and twenty years imprisonment on the robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">The State served appellant with a notice of intent to seek the sentence of death and of intent to seek a sentence of imprisonment for life without possibility of parole pursuant to Maryland Annotated Code Article 27, \u00a7 412(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>lant filed numerous motions to strike the notice of intent to seek the death penalty \u2014 at the pre-trial stage, at the presentencing stage, at the sentencing hearing, and in a motion for judgment of acquittal after testimony was heard at the sentencing hearing. The ground asserted for each motion was that appellant is mentally retarded and, therefore, cannot be sentenced to death. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 412(f) (1990 Supp). Although he presented substantial evidence on the issue of his mental retardation, the trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">After appellant was convicted by the circuit court, he elected to be sentenced by a jury. The sentencing jury found that he was mentally retarded at the time he committed the crimes. The jury, however, was unable to agree upon a sentence. The circuit court then declared a mistrial and imposed a sentence for the murder conviction of imprisonment for life as required by Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 413(k)(7)(iii) (1987). Additional facts will be set forth within as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Although appellant did not receive the death penalty and did not receive a sentence of imprisonment for life without possibility of parole, he claims he was \u201csubstantially prejudiced\u201d by the prosecutor\u2019s filing, and/or the trial judge\u2019s refusal to strike, the notice of intent to seek the death penalty because he must serve more actual time in custody than an accused who received the same sentence but has \u201cnot been served with the death notice.\u201d Thus, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ordinarily a person sentenced to life imprisonment is eligible for parole after serving fifteen years less credit for good time, Md.Ann.Code art. 41, \u00a7 4-516(b)(l), a person sentenced to life imprisonment under Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 413 is not eligible for parole until he has served twenty-five years, less credit for good time. Md.Ann.Code art. 41, \u00a7 4-516(b)(2). Appellant\u2019s specific claims of error rest on this alleged prejudice. Those claims are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">1. The trial judge erred when he refused to grant appellant\u2019s pre-trial motions to strike the notice of intention to seek the penalty of death, and deprived appellant of the rights granted to him under Article 27 \u00a7 412(f)(1) of the Annotated Code of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">2. The Baltimore County prosecutor abused her discretion when she sought the death penalty against appellant under the totality of the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">3. Baltimore County\u2019s lack of discretion in applying Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute denied the appellant his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">4. The Maryland death penalty statute is facially unconstitutional and deprived appellant of his right to due process of law under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Akk\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">Appellant\u2019s initial argument is that the circuit court erred in not ruling on his motion to strike before the trial, and in not granting that motion. He argues that the trial judge misconstrued Article 27, \u00a7 412(f). That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">(1) Penalty for defendants less than 18 years old or mentally retarded defendants. \u2014 (1) If a person found guilty of murder in the first degree was, at the time the murder was committed, less than 18 years old <em>or if the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>person establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was, at the time the murder was committed, mentally retarded, </em>the person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole <em>and may not be sentenced to death, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Appellant asserts that the determination of whether a defendant was mentally retarded at the time of the crime is properly made pre-trial because the provision that a mentally retarded defendant may not be sentenced to death is contained in the same subsection of the same statute as the similar provision that defendants under the age of eighteen may not be sentenced to death. He contends that age is a threshold issue to be determined prior to trial and that many of the policy justifications for excluding the mentally retarded from death eligibility are the same as the justifications for the exclusion of juveniles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, he asserts, the General Assembly must have intended that the issue of mental retardation be decided pre-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Although \u00a7 412(f) does not expressly direct <em>when </em>the determination as to a defendant\u2019s mental retardation is to be made, it does state that a defendant must establish by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d that he is mentally retarded. This certainly suggests that it is a question of fact for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the trier of fact after consideration of all evidence. Furthermore, the statutory language points to the sentencing phase as the time when this determination is to be made in that a defendant who meets this burden \u201cshall not be <em>sentenced </em>to death\u201d; it does not state that a defendant who meets this burden may not receive the death penalty notice required by \u00a7 412(b). Moreover, Maryland Rule 4-343 speaks directly to this question and requires precisely this conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (The Minutes of the Rules Committee indicate that the Committee suggested this provision be added to the Rules because it believed it to be implied by the statute. During consideration of the proposed amendments to the rule, the Chairman of the Committee stated that \u201cthe statute [Article 27, \u00a7 412(f)] indicates this determination must be made during the sentencing proceeding, and that the proposed amendments are consistent with this interpretation.\u201d <em>See </em>Minutes of Maryland Rules Committee, Agenda Item 5, Consideration of Proposed Amendments to Rule 4-343(e), May 19, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Maryland Rule 4-343, which sets forth the sentencing procedure in capital cases, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3K\">(e) Form of Written Findings and Determinations.\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in section (f) of this Rule, the findings and determinations [with regard to capital sentencing] shall be made in writing in the following form:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">$ # Si! SfS * S*S</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Section II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Based upon the evidence, we unanimously find that the following statement, if marked \u201cproven,\u201d has been proven BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>if marked \u201cnot proven,\u201d it has not been proven BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">At the time the murder was committed, the defendant was mentally retarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">(If the above statement is marked \u201cproven,\u201d proceed to Section VI and enter \u201cLife Imprisonment.\u201d If it is marked \u201cnot proven,\u201d complete Section III.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">(f) Deletions from Form. \u2014 Section II of the form set forth in section (e) of this Rule shall not be submitted to the jury unless the issue of mental retardation is generated by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">It is clear from this rule and the form contained in it that the Court of Appeals has considered the question and decided that the issue of mental retardation is properly determined by the trier of fact at the sentencing stage of the proceedings, rather than pre-trial or even pre-sentencing. Accordingly, since here the trier of fact was not the court, but a jury, the lower court was correct in refusing to rule on the issue of mental retardation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Moreover, the court below did not err either in ultimately denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike, or in imposing sentence. No statute or rule provides authority for a court to strike a notice of intent to seek the death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>once a sentencing body has determined that a capital defendant was indeed mentally retarded at the time he committed the crime. On the contrary, Rule 4-343 again speaks directly to the appropriate next step \u2014 the sentencer must skip those portions of the form which relate to aggravating and mitigating circumstances and sentence the defendant to life imprisonment either with or without possibility of parole. Moreover, the direction in the rule, once again, is entirely consistent with statutory language. Section 412(f) provides that if found \u201cmentally retarded\u201d a person \u201cshall be sentenced to imprisonment for life or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole and may not be sentenced to death.\u201d This section only precludes imposition of the death penalty. It does not preclude either of the other two options under the capital sentencing statute, <em>i.e., </em>imprisonment for life or imprisonment for life without parole. In this case, the jury could not agree on the latter sentence and so the trial judge was required by \u00a7 413(k)(7)(iii) to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Appellant makes two arguments regarding prosecutorial discretion. First, he claims that the prosecutor abused her discretion in seeking the death penalty in appellant\u2019s case, in light of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d The \u201ccircumstances\u201d to which appellant refers are the considerable evidence of appellant\u2019s mental retardation and alcohol dependency at the time the crime was committed. The Court of Appeals in <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 468 A.2d 45 (1983), addressed the issue of prosecutorial discretion in seeking the death penalty. There, the court said, \u201cAbsent any specific evidence of indiscretion by prosecutors resulting in an irrational, inconsistent, or discriminatory application of the death penalty statute, [appellant\u2019s claim of inconsistent and discriminatory application of the statute] cannot stand.\u201d 297 Md. at 605, 468 A.2d 45. There is no evidence here that the prosecutor sought the death penalty against appellant in an irrational, inconsistent or discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tory manner. Her knowledge of the evidence of appellant\u2019s mental retardation, even if she believed that the defense had a stronger case than that of the State, does not amount to an abuse of her discretion as a prosecutor. If that were the case, abuse of prosecutorial discretion would be rampant throughout the country. The prosecutor could have reasonably believed, in light of <em>all </em>of the evidence presented on mental retardation, that the jury could find that appellant was not retarded at the time the crimes charged were committed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Appellant\u2019s second argument with regard to abuse of prosecutorial discretion is that the process engaged in by Baltimore County prosecutors to determine which cases are appropriate for a death sentence is deficient. Specifically, appellant contends that because a defendant charged with first-degree or robbery-murder in Baltimore County is more likely than in other counties to receive notice of the State\u2019s intention to seek the death penalty, it is the \u201cpolicy\u201d of Baltimore County to seek the death penalty without using any discretion. Appellant even goes so far as to draw an analogy between the policy of Baltimore County State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Attorney and the mandatory death penalty statute held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325, 96 S.Ct. 3001, 49 L.Ed.2d 974 (1976). This analogy fails. In <em>Roberts, </em>the statute at issue required that the death penalty be imposed whenever the jury found a defendant guilty of first-degree murder. Unlike the statute in <em>Roberts, </em>the Maryland death penalty statute does not require mandatory imposition of the death penalty and satisfies both federal and state requirements on its face. <em>See Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 605, 468 A.2d 45 <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846 (1984); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 720-29, 415 A.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Moreover, appellant has presented no evidence as to the policy of the Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney regarding seeking the death penalty, let alone evidence that seeking the death penalty is mandatory for all capital cases prosecuted in Baltimore County.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant relies primarily on a proportionality study which was being conducted by the Maryland Court of Appeals pursuant to Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 414(e)(4), during the trial below. This review was based on evidence submitted in <em>Collins v. State, 77 </em>Md.App. 456, 550 A.2d 743 (1988), <em>cert. granted, </em>315 Md. 228, 554 A.2d 351 (1989), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>321 Md. 103, 581 A.2d 426 (1990). Apparently, appellant was unable to obtain the results of this study, but gathered information from sources in the public defender\u2019s office. He cites the statistic that \u201c[o]f the 13 offenders sentenced to death for robbery-murder in Maryland, nine were from Baltimore County, and all four of the single-victim cases with the single aggravating circumstance of robbery were from that jurisdiction.\u201d This statistic speaks to a jury\u2019s likelihood of sentencing a capital defendant to death, and <em>not </em>as appellant argues, to a prosecutor\u2019s likelihood of seeking the death penalty. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals in <em>Calhoun </em>commented that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201c[t]o the extent that there is a difference in the practice of the various State\u2019s attorneys around the State,\u201d the proportionality review component of Article 27, \u00a7 414, is intended to assure that the death penalty is not imposed in a disproportionate manner. 297 Md. at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Appellant\u2019s third ground for reversal is \u201cthat the Baltimore County prosecutor is more likely to seek the death penalty in a robbery-murder or first degree murder case than is a prosecutor in another county in Maryland.\u201d Although he concedes that he was not sentenced to death, appellant insists that his right to equal protection of the law has been violated because, had he been prosecuted in a county in which the State chose not to seek the death penalty in his case, he would be eligible for parole sooner. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The equal protection clause of the United States Constitution prohibits only invidious discrimination and not mere classification. <em>Jacob v. Adams, </em>66 Md.App. 779, 795, 505 A.2d 930, <em>cert. denied, Barnes v. Cauthen, </em>306 Md. 513, 510 A.2d 259 (1986) (citing <em>Clements v. Fashing, </em>457 U.S. 957, 962-63,102 S.Ct. 2836, 2843, 73 L.Ed.2d 508, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>458 U.S. 1133, 103 S.Ct. 20, 73 L.Ed.2d 1404 (1982); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical, </em>348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>349 U.S. 925, 75 S.Ct. 657, 99 L.Ed. 1256 (1955)). This court considered a contention analogous to the one at bar in <em>Middleton v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 159, 506 A.2d 1191, <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 146, 517 A.2d 771 (1986). There, the equal protection claim was predicated on a lack of uniformity among various State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Offices in the invocation of the mandatory sentencing law. In rejecting this claim, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN2\">[Appellant\u2019s evidence certainly tended to show an absence, in Maryland, of a uniform policy for pursuing mandatory sentencing and, thus, by inference, perhaps the discriminatory effect of that lack of policy; however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>it did not, indeed it did not purport to, prove, either that the lack of uniformity was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, or that pursuing mandatory sentencing <em>in appellant\u2019s case </em>was based on an unjustifiable standard. In the absence of such a showing, appellant has failed to prove, as he must, that he was denied equal protection of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><em>Id, </em>67 Md.App. at 171-72, 506 A.2d 1191 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). In <em>Middleton, </em>we relied upon <em>Wayte v. U.S., </em>470 U.S. 598, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985), in which the Supreme Court held that in order to establish an equal protection violation, a defendant must show that the government\u2019s system of prosecuting only certain males who failed to register with the Selective Service was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, as well as had a discriminatory effect. <em>See also Davis v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 581, 514 A.2d 1229, <em>cert. granted, </em>308 Md. 313, 518 A.2d 1071, <em>affirmed in part reversed in part on other grounds, </em>310 Md. 611, 530 A.2d 1223 (1986) (to succeed in equal protection claim, appellant must show either that the policy is motivated by a discriminatory purpose or that the invocation of mandatory sentencing in a particular case was based on an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or some other arbitrary classification).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Appellant has failed to show any discriminatory purpose or imposition of an unjustifiable standard on the part of the Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney in its application of the death penalty statute. For this reason, we reject his equal protection argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Appellant\u2019s final two claims are based on the due process clause. First, he asserts that the Maryland death penalty statute provides no guidelines as to when a prosecuting attorney may seek the death penalty and, hence, the decision-making process is arbitrary and violates his due process rights. The Court of Appeals in <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. at 605, 468 A.2d 45, however, disposed of this issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>There, the Court held that the Maryland death penalty statute, on its face, does not promote an arbitrary decision-making process, and that absent specific evidence of prosecutorial indiscretion, there is no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that the prosecuting attorney, by seeking the death penalty, usurped the jury\u2019s role in determining the length of his sentence, thus violating his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant, at his election, received a sentencing by jury. The jury made the determination that appellant should not be sentenced to death, but after much deliberation, was unable to agree on whether to impose a life sentence or a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The judge dismissed the jury and, pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 413(k)(7)(iii), imposed the only sentence he could \u2014 a sentence of life imprisonment. Even if appellant had been sentenced as a non-capital defendant, the jury\u2019s choice of sentences would have been the same \u2014 imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. It is the date of initial parole consideration, rather than the sentence, that is affected by the prosecutor\u2019s decision whether or not to seek the death penalty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Thus, what appellant is really contending is that the Maryland legislature could not have rationally distinguished parole eligibility of defendants convicted of first-degree murder on the basis of whether or not they were sentenced in a capital proceeding. It would seem to us that there is a rational basis for this distinction. Killing another human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>being well may justify withholding parole eligibility for an additional ten years, even if mitigating circumstances, such as mental retardation, weigh against the imposition of a death sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-14\">.

Appellant maintains that the mentally retarded, like juveniles, need \u201cprotection, guidance and rehabilitation\u201d and should therefore, be kept out of the criminal justice system. One commentator advocates affording \"functional juveniles\u201d (mentally retarded individuals) the same treatment as \u201cactual juveniles\u201d (individuals under the age of eighteen) in the context of capital sentencing. This commentator asserts that both groups manifest \u201ca lack of intellectual and reasoning capacity and lack of sophistication in dealing with stress on one\u2019s own.\u201d Gruttadaurio, Editor\u2019s Note: <em>Consistency in the Application of the Death Penalty to Juveniles and the Mentally Impaired: A Suggested Legislative Approach, </em>58 U.Cin.L.Rev. 211, 233 (1989).

Appellant offered the testimony of three experts who testified that he had an IQ of 69, only one point below the intelligence quotient definition of mentally retarded. At least one of these experts, however, testified that the standard error of deviation for the IQ test administered was \"plus or minus 2.5.\u201d Moreover, the State\u2019s expert, although unable to refute the results of the IQ tests, testified that she had serious doubts as to appellant\u2019s \"impairment in adaptive behavior.\u201d Furthermore, there was abundant evidence, including appellant\u2019s own testimony, from which a fact finder might have concluded that his \"adaptive behavior\u201d was not \u201cimpaired,\" that he was able to function in society by renting his own room, feeding himself, holding a job, and washing his clothes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-5\">. Even if such a policy were, or is, in existence, appellant has not established that the State\u2019s Attorney acted improperly in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, there is no constitutional right to a jury sentencing in a capital case. <em>Hildwin v. Florida, </em>490 U.S. 638, 109 S.Ct. 2055, 104 L.Ed.2d 728 (1989); <em>Spaziano v. Florida, </em>468 U.S. 447, 104 S.Ct. 3154, 82 L.Ed.2d 340 (1984); <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 597, 530 A.2d 743 (1987). That right is created by Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 413. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. There is no constitutional right to parole. <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). In Maryland, parole is a privilege, not a right. <em>Woods v. Steiner, </em>207 F.Supp. 945, 951 (D.Md.1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b301-14\">. We note, however, that the question of whether, in fact, the legislature intended that Md.Ann.Code art. 41, \u00a7 4-516(b)(2) be applicable to persons served with the death notice but found not death eligible, involves a question of statutory construction which is not presently before us. That question would be ripe for determination if and when raised by such a defendant <em>after </em>he has been imprisoned for the term which would have been required if he had not received the death notice (e.g. 15 years, less good time).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
