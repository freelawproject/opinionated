Applying those principles, the majority classified raw test data, photographs, and witness statements as nonderivative material that is not protected. By contrast, the majority held, material reflecting <em>only </em>an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories is absolutely protected. Finally, the majority held that derivative materials\u2014amalgamations of factual information and attorney thoughts, impressions, and conclusions\u2014are qualifiedly protected; they are discoverable only upon a showing of good cause, which involves a balancing of the need for the materials and the purposes served by mediation confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">We conclude that the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of section 1119, subdivision (b), is contrary to both the statutory language and the Legislature\u2019s intent. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Real party in interest Julie Coffin, trustee of the 1979 Ehrlich Investment Trust (Coffin), is the owner of an apartment complex in Los Angeles that includes three buildings and a total of 192 units. In 1996, Coffin sued the contractors and subcontractors who built the complex\u2014including real party in interest Deco Construction Corporation (Deco)\u2014alleging that water leakage due to construction defects had produced toxic molds and other microbes on the property (the underlying action). In July 1998, the court, with the parties\u2019 consent, issued a comprehensive case management order (CMO), which provided in part; \u201cEvidence of anything said or any admission made by attorneys, parties, principals, consultants, or others in the course of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u2018mediation proceeding\u2019 . . . and any document prepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to any mediation proceeding shall be deemed privileged pursuant to Evidence Code \u00a7 1119 and shall not be admissible as evidence at trial or for any purpose prior to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In April 1997, Coffin prepared a preliminary defect list identifying structural defects and mold infestation. In April 1998, she began air testing. In late 1998, one of the buildings at the complex was closed for abatement, including demolition and replacement of drywall and ceilings, application of antimicrobial agents, and plumbing repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In April 1999, the litigation settled as a result of mediation. The settlement agreement stated in part that, \u201cthroughout this resolution of the matter, consultants provided defect reports, repair reports, and photographs for informational purpose which are protected by the Case Management Order and Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1119 and 1152, and it is hereby agreed that such materials and information contained therein shall not be published or disclosed in any way without the prior consent of plaintiff or by court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In August 1999, several hundred tenants of the apartment complex (Tenants) filed the action now before us against Deco, Coffin, Richard Ehrlich\u2014as Coffin\u2019s agent and employee\u2014and numerous other entities that participated in development or construction of the complex. Tenants alleged that defective construction had allowed water to circulate and microbes to infest the complex, causing numerous health problems. They also alleged that all defendants had conspired to conceal the defects and that they (Tenants) had not become aware of the defects until April 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In November 1999, Tenants served deposition subpoenas on attorneys and experts/consultants involved in the underlying action, demanding production of each deponent\u2019s \u201centire files\u201d relating to that action. Coffin and Ehrlich moved to quash the subpoenas and sought a protective order. Eventually, the court ordered the subpoenas withdrawn and directed Tenants to file a motion to compel, production. Tenants subsequently filed a motion to compel, requesting production of, among other things, the following: (1) discovery exchanged between the parties to the underlying litigation; (2) physical evidence of the condition of the buildings, including photographs, videotapes, test samples and reports, and any physical evidence that was removed from the buildings and saved, such as drywall, plumbing, and framing; (3) writings describing the buildings, including written notes of observations made during inspections and witness interviews; and (4) writings evidencing experts\u2019 opinions and conclusions, whether or not communicated to the defendants in the underlying action. Coffin, Ehrlich, and Deco opposed the motion, arguing in part that all of the requested documents were undiscoverable under section 1119 because they were prepared for the mediation in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The motion was heard by Judge Charles McCoy. He ruled that whether a particular document prepared in the underlying action was discoverable depended in part on whether it was prepared before or after July 2, 1998, when the CMO was signed and the mediation process began. Judge McCoy found that, as section 1119 provides, documents prepared after that date \u201cfor the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to\u201d the mediation were undiscoverable. Documents prepared before that date were discoverable if they were \u201csubject to the discovery process prior to entry of the CMO\u201d and \u201cwere not prepared for mediation purposes.\u201d Judge McCoy ordered the parties to submit the documents in question for in camera review. Defendants complied with this order by submitting the compilations they had prepared for the mediation in the underlying action. After in camera review, Judge McCoy mled that the compilations\u2014including photographs\u2014were undiscoverable under section 1119. However, he specified that his ruling applied only to \u201cthe documents taken together as a compilation for mediation purposes,\u201d and that he was not deciding whether the individual documents in the compilations, which \u201cwere not submitted . . . separately,\u201d were discoverable. Tenants did not challenge this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">After the case was reassigned to Judge Anthony Mohr, another discovery dispute arose when Tenants served interrogatories on another defendant\u2014 Alper Development, Inc. (Alper)\u2014seeking information regarding the mediation in the underlying action. Alper objected to the discovery request, based in part on section 1119. On August 16, 2001, at the hearing on Tenants\u2019 subsequent motion to compel, Judge Mohr ruled that Alper did not have to disclose information contained in the documents Judge McCoy had already held to be undiscoverable under section 1119. Judge Mohr also reaffirmed Judge McCoy\u2019s ruling that the mediation compilations were undiscoverable. However, Judge Mohr indicated that the individual photographs contained in the compilations were discoverable and would have to be produced if requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">After this ruling, Tenants served another request for production of all photographs (and negatives) and videotapes taken or received during the underlying action, \u201call recorded statements\u201d of former or current tenants obtained in that action, all \u201cresults\u201d from destructive testing during that action, and all \u201craw data\u201d collected during that action from \u201cair sampling for mold spores,\u201d \u201cbulk sampling of mold spores,\u201d and \u201cdestructive testing.\u201d When Coffin and Ehrlich objected to the request, Tenants moved to compel production, arguing that Judge Mohr had ruled only that the mediation compilations were not discoverable and had stated that the individual photographs in those compilations were discoverable if requested. In opposition to the motion, Coffin and Ehrlich asserted that, under section 1119, the requested documents were not discoverable and that Judge McCoy had so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>On March 7, 2002, Judge Mohr denied Tenants\u2019 motion. At the hearing on that date, Judge Mohr focused primarily on the requested photographs, explaining: \u201cThe plaintiffs say that they need these photos and there\u2019s no other evidence of the conditions as they were at that time and in those places, and [defendants are] saying these photographs were created for mediation purposes. They are documents under Evidence Code section 250. They\u2019re clearly protected by the mediation privilege. Judge McCoy so found. They were created pursuant to [the CMO] in the earlier case .... There\u2019s no question they\u2019re covered.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Mohr also concluded that principles governing discovery of evidence subject to a qualified work product privilege do not govern evidence \u201ccovered by the mediation privilege.\u201d Finally, Judge Mohr remarked: \u201cThis is a very difficult decision . . . because it could well be that there\u2019s no other way for the plaintiffs to get this particular material. On the other hand, the mediation privilege is an important one, and if courts start dispensing with it by using the . . . test [governing the work product privilege], . . . you may have people less willing to mediate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Tenants then sought a writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal. In a split decision, a majority of the Court of Appeal granted relief, concluding that section 1119 does \u201cnot protect pure evidence,\u201d but protects only \u201cthe substance of mediation, i.e., the negotiations, communications, admissions, and discussions designed to reach a resolution of the dispute at hand.\u201d As noted above, according to the majority, section 1119 protects mediation materials \u201cin the same manner as the work product doctrine.\u201d Applying work product principles, the majority classified the \u201craw test data, photographs, and witness statements\u201d as \u201cnon-derivative\u201d material that is \u201c not protected by section 1119\u201d and is therefore discoverable. By contrast, the majority held, \u201cmaterial solely reflecting an attorney\u2019s \u2018 \u201cimpressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories,\u201d \u2019 is entitled to absolute protection.\u201d Finally, the majority held, \u201cderivative material\u201d\u2014that is, \u201camalgamation^] of factual information and attorney thoughts, impressions, [and] conclusions,\u201d such as \u201ccharts and diagrams, audit reports, compilations of entries in documents, records and other databases, appraisals, opinions, and reports of experts employed as nontestifying consultants\u201d\u2014is qualifiedly protected; it is \u201cdiscoverable only upon a showing of good cause, which requires a determination of the need for the materials balanced against the benefit to the mediation privilege obtained by protecting those materials from disclosure.\u201d Moreover, the majority held, purely factual information included in derivative material\u2014that is, photographs and test data\u2014must, if possible, be removed and produced. The majority thus ordered issuance of a peremptory writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying Tenants\u2019 motion to compel and to apply these principles during an in camera review of the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the majority relied largely on section 1120, subdivision (a), which provides that \u201c[ejvidence otherwise admissible or subject to discovery outside of a mediation . . . shall not be or become inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of its introduction or use in a mediation . . . .\u201d The majority reasoned that adopting the trial court\u2019s contrary analysis would \u201crender section 1120 complete surplusage\u201d and would \u201cpermit the parties to use mediation as a shield to hide evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We then granted the petition for review filed by Coffin and Ehrlich. We also granted the petition for review filed by Deco, which had joined the answer Coffin and Ehrlich filed in the Court of Appeal in opposition to Tenant\u2019s writ petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">As we recently explained, \u201c[implementing alternatives to judicial dispute resolution has been a strong legislative policy since at least 1986.\u201d <em>(Foxgate Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. Bramalea California, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1, 14 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 642, 25 P.3d 1117] <em>(Foxgate).) </em>Mediation is one of the alternatives the Legislature has sought to implement. The Legislature has expressly declared: \u201cIn appropriate cases mediation provides parties with a simplified and economical procedure for obtaining prompt and equitable resolution of their disputes and a greater opportunity to participate directly in resolving these disputes. Mediation may also assist to reduce the backlog of cases burdening the judicial system. It is in the public interest for mediation to be encouraged and used where appropriate by the courts.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1775, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">One of the fundamental ways the Legislature has sought to encourage mediation is by enacting several \u201cmediation confidentiality provisions.\u201d <em>(Foxgate, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 14.) As we have explained, \u201cconfidentiality is essential to effective mediation\u201d because it \u201cpromote[s] \u2018a candid and informal exchange regarding events in the past .... This frank exchange is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>achieved only if the participants know that what is said in the mediation will not be used to their detriment through later court proceedings and other adjudicatory processes.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cTo carry out the purpose of encouraging mediation by ensuring confidentiality, [our] statutory scheme . . . unqualifiedly bars disclosure of\u2019 specified communications and writings associated with a mediation \u201cabsent an express statutory exception.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The particular confidentiality provision at issue here is section 1119, subdivision (b), which provides: \u201cNo writing, as defined in Section 250, that is prepared for the puipose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or a mediation consultation, is admissible or subject to discovery, and disclosure of the writing shall not be compelled, in any arbitration, administrative adjudication, civil action, or other noncriminal proceeding in which, pursuant to law, testimony can be compelled to be given.\u201d In turn, section 250 defines the term \u201cwriting\u201d to \u201cmean[] handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing, any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored.\u201d By statute, \u201cany writing that is inadmissible, protected from disclosure, and confidential under\u201d the mediation confidentiality provisions \u201cbefore a mediation ends, shall remain inadmissible, protected from disclosure, and confidential to the same extent after.the mediation ends.\u201d (\u00a7 1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s holding directly conflicts with the plain language of these provisions. As noted above, the Court of Appeal held that section 1119 never applies to photographs and witness statements. However, under section 1119, because both photographs and written witness statements qualify as \u201cwriting[s], as defined in [s]ection 250,\u201d if they are \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation,\u201d then they are not \u201cadmissible or subject to discovery, and [their] disclosure . . . shall not be compelled . . . .\u201d The Court of Appeal also held that \u201craw test data\u201d are never \u201cprotected by section 1119.\u201d Insofar as it was referring to actual physical samples collected at the apartment complex\u2014either from the air or from destructive testing\u2014the Court of Appeal was correct; such physical objects are not \u201cwriting[s], as defined in [sjection 250.\u201d (\u00a7 1119, subd. (b).) However, insofar as it was referring to recorded analyses of those samples\u2014for example, reports describing the existence or amount of mold spores in a sample\u2014the Court of Appeal erred; because such analyses are \u201cwritingfs], as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>defined in [s]ection 250,\u201d under section 1119, if they were \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation,\u201d then they are not \u201cadmissible or subject to discovery, and [their] disclosure . . . shall not be compelled . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Section 1120 does not, as the Court of Appeal held, support a contrary conclusion. As noted above, section 1120, subdivision (a), provides that \u201c[e]vidence otherwise admissible or subject to discovery outside of a mediation . . . shall not be or become inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of its introduction or use in a mediation . . . .\u201d Read together, sections 1119 and 1120 establish that a writing\u2014which qualifies as \u201c \u2018[ejvidence\u2019 \u201d (\u00a7 140)\u2014is not protected \u201csolely by reason of its introduction or use in a mediation\u201d (\u00a7 1120, subd. (a)), but is protected only if it was \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.\u201d (\u00a7 1119, subd. (b).) In other words, under section 1120, a party cannot secure protection for a writing\u2014including a photograph, a witness statement, or an analysis of a test sample\u2014that was not \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation\u201d (\u00a7 1119, subd. (b)) simply by using or introducing it in a mediation or even including it as part of a writing\u2014such as a brief or a declaration or a consultant\u2019s report\u2014that was \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Contrary to the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion, this construction does not render section 1120 \u201csurplusage\u201d or permit parties \u201cto use mediation as a shield to hide evidence.\u201d Rather, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent, it applies section 1120 as a \u201climit[]\u201d on \u201cthe scope of [sjection 1119\u201d that \u201cprevents] parties from using a mediation as a pretext to shield materials from disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>(Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (2004 supp.) foil. \u00a7 1120, p. 153.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On the other hand, the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction renders subdivision (b) of section 1119 essentially useless. As noted above, the Court of Appeal held that section 1119 does \u201cnot protect pure evidence,\u201d but protects only \u201cthe substance of mediation, i.e., the negotiations, communications, admissions, and discussions designed to reach a resolution of the dispute at hand.\u201d However, this protection is afforded under subdivision (a) of section 1119, which provides: \u201cNo <em>evidence </em>of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation ... is admissible or subject to discovery, and disclosure of the <em>evidence </em>shall not be compelled . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Because a \u201cwriting[]\u201d constitutes \u201c[e]vidence\u201d (\u00a7 140), any writing that discloses what the Court of Appeal characterized as \u201cthe substance of mediation\u201d\u2014\u201cnegotiations, communications, admissions, and discussions designed to reach a resolution of the dispute\u201d\u2014necessarily qualifies as \u201cevidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation,\u201d and is undiscoverable under subdivision (a) of section 1119. Thus, under the Court of Appeal\u2019s narrow statutory construction, subdivision (b) of section 1119 serves no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s holding is also inconsistent with the relevant legislative history. The Legislature passed the current mediation confidentiality provisions in 1997 at the recommendation of the California Law Revision Commission (Commission). (See Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality (Jan. 1997) 26 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1996) p. 407.) An early draft of the proposed provisions, which the Commission circulated for comment, included a section stating that although \u201ca communication, document, or any writing as defined in Section 250, that is made or prepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation\u201d is confidential and protected, it \u201cmay be admitted or disclosed if . . . [f] . . . [it] is an expert\u2019s analysis or report, it was prepared for the benefit of fewer than all the mediation participants, those participants expressly consent to its disclosure, and the communication, document, or writing does not disclose anything said or any admission made in the course of the mediation.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com., Tent. Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality (May 1996) p. 14.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The accompanying comment explained that this proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>section \u201cfacilitates admissibility and disclosure of unilaterally prepared experts\u2019 reports, but it only applies so long as those materials may be produced in a manner revealing nothing about the mediation discussion. Reports and analyses that necessarily disclose mediation communications may be admitted or disclosed only upon satisfying the general rule\u201d requiring the express consent of all persons participating in the mediation. (Cal. Law Revision Com., Tent. Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>at p. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The California State Bar\u2019s Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) submitted comments \u201cpropos [ing] to replace\u201d this provision with one stating: \u201c \u2018A written statement otherwise admissible is admissible if it is not precluded by other rules of evidence and as long as it does not include statements solely made in the mediation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com., Staff Draft of Final Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality (Dec. 1996) p. 20.) CAJ argued that, without this change, the proposed statute \u201ccould be interpreted to override\u201d another proposed statute \u201cproviding] that evidence \u2018otherwise admissible or subject to discovery outside of mediation shall not be or become inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of its introduction or use in a mediation. [CAJ] also [argued] that just because a document <em>such as a photograph </em>was created for a mediation should not make that document inadmissible.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In recommending against the CAJ\u2019s proposed change, the Commission\u2019s staff stated: \u201cCAJ\u2019s proposed revision would essentially undo . . . protection of documents prepared for the purpose of a mediation .... Loss of that protection could inhibit mediation participants from preparing such materials, which in turn could adversely affect the mediation process. Notably, of the sources commenting on the tentative recommendation, only the State Bar groups suggested reducing the existing protection of documents prepared for a mediation. Community Board Program made very clear that it would oppose such a move: \u2018We are especially concerned that all documentation relating to the preparation of a mediation, ... be deemed inadmissible as evidence unless both parties agree that it should be disclosed.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, the staff recommends against adopting the CAJ\u2019s approach. [][] CAJ\u2019s comments did, however, cause the staff to consider whether [the proposed statute] should be limited to an expert\u2019s analysis or report. Perhaps the following wording would be better: [f] . . . The communication, document, or writing [may not be admitted or disclosed unless it] is an expert\u2019s analysis or report, -it\u2014was prepared for the benefit of fewer than all the mediation participants, those participants expressly consent to its disclosure, and the communication, document, or writing does not disclose anything said or any admission made in the course of the mediation. [][] Comment. . . . [This provision] facilitates admissibility and disclosure of unilaterally prepared experts\u2019 reports materials, but it only applies so long as those materials may be produced in a manner revealing nothing about the mediation discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>...[][] This revision may alleviate some of the concerns raised by CAJ .... For example, it would allow a mediation participant to introduce <em>a photograph </em>that participant took for a mediation but later decided would be useful at trial. <em>Although in many instances it would be possible to take another photo, in some cases that could not be done, as when a building has been razed or an injury has healed. </em>Under the current version of [the proposed statute], the photo could not be introduced without the consent of all of the mediation participants, some of whom might withhold consent. The staff\u2019s proposed revision <em>would give the participant who took the photo control over whether it is used, </em>so long as it can be admitted without disclosing anything said or done or any admission made in the course of the mediation.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com., Staff Draft of Final Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 20-21, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The Commission adopted the staff\u2019s proposal. Its final recommendation proposed a section stating that \u201c[Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter\u201d on mediation confidentiality, \u201ca communication, document, or any writing as defined in Section 250, that is made or prepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or a mediation consultation, may be admitted in evidence or disclosed if . . . [f] . . . [it] was prepared by or on behalf of fewer than all the mediation participants, those participants expressly agree in writing, or orally in accordance with Section 1119, to its disclosure, and the communication, document, or writing does not disclose anything said or done or any admission made in the course of the mediation.\u201d (Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>26 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., at pp. 441-442.) The accompanying comment explained that this provision \u201cfacilitates admissibility and disclosure of unilaterally prepared materials, but it only applies so long as those materials may be produced in a manner revealing nothing about the mediation discussion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">These materials show that, in making its recommendation regarding mediation confidentiality, the Commission specifically considered the discoverability of both expert reports and photographs and drafted its proposed confidentiality provisions to preclude discovery of such reports and photographs if they were \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.\u201d (Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>26 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., at p. 438.) These materials also show that the Commission chose language expressly designed to give a mediation participant who takes a photograph for purpose of the mediation \u201ccontrol over whether it is used\u201d in subsequent litigation, even where \u201canother photo\u201d cannot be taken because, for example, \u201ca building has been razed or an injury has healed.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com., Staff Draft of Final Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>at p. 21.) The Legislature adopted the Commission\u2019s recommendation and enacted the mediation confidentiality provisions in substantially the form the Commission proposed. As noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>above, section 1119, subdivision (b), provides that \u201c[n]o writing, as defined in Section 250,\u201d\u2014which includes photographs and videotapes\u2014\u201cthat is prepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation ... is admissible or subject to discovery.\u201d Section 1122, subdivision (a)(2), provides that \u201ca writing, as defined in Section 250, that is made or prepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or a mediation consultation, is not made inadmissible, or protected from disclosure, by provisions of this chapter if ... [][].. . [it] was prepared by or on behalf of fewer than all the mediation participants, those participants expressly agree in writing, or orally in accordance with Section 1118, to its disclosure, and the communication, document, or writing does not disclose anything said or done or any admission made in the course of the mediation.\u201d The accompanying comment explains that this provision \u201cfacilitates admissibility and disclosure of unilaterally prepared materials, but it only applies so long as those materials may be produced in a manner revealing nothing about the mediation discussion.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 1122 at p. 156.) The Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that photographs and videotapes taken for purposes of mediation are not protected under section 1119 is inconsistent with this legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s narrow interpretation is also inconsistent with the legislative history in several other respects. Before section 1119\u2019s passage, former section 1152.5 governed mediation confidentiality. Subdivision (a)(2) of former section 1152.5 provided that \u201cno <em>document </em>prepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to, the mediation, or copy thereof, is admissible ... or subject to discovery.\u201d (Stats. 1996, ch. 174, \u00a7 1, italics added.) In its final recommendation to the Legislature, the Commission proposed changing the term \u201cdocument\u201d to \u201cdocument, or writing as defined in Section 250.\u201d (Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>26 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., at p. 438.) In discussing this proposal, the Commission stated: \u201c[T]he term \u2018document\u2019 is not defined in the Evidence Code. . . . [&lt;K] The Commission proposes to address this potential problem by incorporating Section 250\u2019s broad definition of \u2018writing\u2019 into the mediation confidentiality provisions.\u201d (26 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 428-429.) Again, the Legislature substantially followed the Commission\u2019s recommendation, broadly providing protection in section 1119, subdivision (b), for a \u201cwriting, as defined in Section 250.\u201d The Commission\u2019s official comment to section 1119 states that this change \u201cexpressly encompasses any type of \u2018writing\u2019 as defined in Section 250, regardless of whether the representations are on paper or on some other medium.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 1119 at p. 149.) Thus, in passing section 1119, subdivision (b), the Legislature specifically intended to extend protection to all types of writings, including photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>At the same time, the Legislature also sought to expand protection for oral communications. Whereas subdivision (a)(2) of former section 1152.5 protected documents \u201cprepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to, the mediation,\u201d subdivision (a)(1) protected only those oral communications and admissions \u201cmade ... in the course of the mediation.\u201d (Stats. 1996, ch. 174, \u00a7 1.) The Commission\u2019s recommendation explained that, under these provisions, the protection for documents was \u201cbroader\u201d than the protection for oral communications and admissions, and \u201c[t]o encourage frankness in discussions relating to mediation, the Commission propose[d] . . . eliminating] this distinction [by] protecting] \u2018evidence of anything said or of any admission made for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to,\u2019 the mediation.\u201d (Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>26 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., at p. 428.) Again, the Legislature followed suit by protecting, in subdivision (a) of section 1119, \u201cevidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.\u201d The Commission\u2019s official comment explains that this section \u201cextends [protection] to oral communications made for the purpose of or pursuant to a mediation, not just oral communications made in the course of the mediation.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 1119 at p. 149.) The Court of Appeal\u2019s narrowing of the protection under section 1119 is inconsistent with these legislative efforts to expand protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">More broadly, the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction is inconsistent with the overall purpose of the mediation confidentiality provisions. As noted above, \u201cconfidentiality is essential to effective mediation,\u201d <em>(Foxgate, supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th at p. 14) and to \u201censur[e] confidentiality, [our] statutory scheme . . . unqualifiedly bars disclosure of\u201d specified communications and writings associated with a mediation \u201cabsent an express statutory exception.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.) In making its 1997 recommendation, the Commission explained that the then existing \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d regarding mediation confidentiality \u201cha[d] ambiguities that cause[d] confusion.\u201d (Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, 26 </em>Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., at p. 414.) The changes the Commission recommended, which the Legislature adopted, were designed to \u201celiminate[]\u201d these ambiguities in order \u201c[t]o further the effective use of mediation\u201d by ensuring the \u201ccandor\u201d that \u201cis crucial to [its] success.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431.) Adopting the Court of Appeal\u2019s narrow construction of section 1119 would significantly undercut the Legislature\u2019s efforts to ensure the confidentiality necessary to effective mediation. For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that photographs, videotapes, witness statements, and \u201craw test data\u201d from physical samples collected at the complex\u2014such as reports describing the existence or amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of mold spores in a sample\u2014that were \u201cprepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, [the] mediation\u201d in the underlying action are not protected under section 1119.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Court of Appeal also erred in holding that, although section 1119\u2019s protection applies to so-called derivative material \u201cthat is prepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation\u201d (\u00a7 1119, subd. (b))\u2014such as charts, diagrams, information compilations, and expert opinions and reports\u2014such material is nevertheless discoverable \u201cupon a showing of good cause.\u201d As noted above, in reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal borrowed principles governing discovery of work product. However, discovery of work product is expressly governed by statute; Code of Civil Procedure section 2018, subdivision (b), provides that work product\u2014other than writings reflecting an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories\u2014is discoverable if \u201cthe court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing that party\u2019s claim or defense or will result in an injustice.\u201d Thus, the Legislature clearly knows how to establish a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to a protection or privilege if it so desires. The Legislature did not enact such an exception when it passed Evidence Code section 1119 and the other mediation confidentiality provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">However, the Legislature did expressly enact other exceptions to section 1119\u2019s protection. As explained above, section 1122, subdivision (a)(2), permits discovery of protected communications and writings that were \u201cprepared by or on behalf of fewer than all the mediation participants\u201d if \u201cthose participants expressly agree\u201d to disclosure and disclosure would not reveal \u201canything said or done or any admission made in the course of the mediation.\u201d As also noted above, the language of this provision was designed to give a mediation participant \u201ccontrol over whether\u201d something prepared for the mediation \u201cis used\u201d in subsequent litigation. (Cal. Law Revision Com., Staff Draft of Final Recommendation on Mediation Confidentiality, <em>supra, </em>at p. 21.) Subdivision (a)(1) of section 1122 establishes another exception; it permits discovery of protected material if \u201c[a]ll persons who conduct or otherwise participate in the mediation expressly agree ... to disclosure . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The Legislature established other exceptions for settlement agreements made or prepared \u201cin the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1123, 1124.) \u201cUnder the maxim of statutory construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>if exemptions are specified in a statute, we may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sierra Club v. State Bd.. of Forestry </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1230 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 876 P.2d 505].) Here, there is no evidence of a legislative intent supporting the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception the Court of Appeal majority read into the statute. On the contrary, as the dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal observed, that exception \u201cis inconsistent with th[e] narrowly drawn exception[s]\u201d the Legislature expressly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In <em>Foxgate, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]o carry out the purpose of encouraging mediation by ensuring confidentiality, [our] statutory scheme . . . unqualifiedly bars disclosure of\u2019 specified communications and writings associated with a mediation \u201cabsent an <em>express statutory </em>exception.\u201d <em>(Foxgate, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 15, italics added.) We also found that the \u201cjudicially crafted exception\u201d to section 1119 there at issue was \u201cnot necessary either to carry out the legislative intent or to avoid an absurd result.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 14.) We reach the same conclusion here; as Judge Mohr observed, \u201cthe mediation privilege is an important one, and if courts start dispensing with it by using the . . . test [governing the work-product privilege], . . . you may have people less willing to mediate.\u201d Thus, the Court of Appeal erred in holding that so-called derivative material \u201cthat is prepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation\u201d (\u00a7 1119, subd. (b)), is discoverable \u201cupon a showing of good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and, in light of the parties\u2019 settlement, the cause is remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the petition for writ of mandate and to discharge the peremptory writ.
