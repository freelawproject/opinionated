I slap on my face of happiness but inside I am evil!! For I can be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school. So parents watch your children cuz I\u2019m BACK!!\u201d For the reasons below, we conclude that the ambiguous nature of the poem, along with the circumstances surrounding its dissemination, fail to establish that the poem constituted a criminal threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">Fifteen-year-old George T. (minor) had been a student at Santa Teresa High School in Santa Clara County for approximately two weeks when on Friday, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>March 16, 2001, toward the end of his honors English class, he approached fellow student Mary S. and asked her, \u201cIs there a poetry class here?\u201d Minor then handed Mary three sheets of paper and told her, \u201c[r]ead these.\u201d Mary did so. The first sheet of paper contained a note stating, \u201cThese poems describe me and my feelings. Tell me if they describe you and your feelings.\u201d The two other sheets of paper contained poems. Mary read only one of the poems, which was labeled \u201cDark Poetry\u201d and entitled \u201cFaces\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">Who are these faces around me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">Where did they come from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">They would probably become the next doctors or loirs or something. All really intelligent and ahead in their game. I wish I had a choice on what I want to be like they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">All so happy and vagrant. Each origonal in their own way. They make me want to puke. For I am Dark, Destructive, &amp; Dangerous. I slap on my face of happiness but inside I am evil!! For I can be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school. So parents watch your children cuz I\u2019m BACK!! by: Julius AKA Angel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Minor had a \u201cstraight face,\u201d not \u201cshowing] any emotion, neither happy or sad or angry or upset,\u201d when he handed the poems to Mary.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Upon reading the \u201cFaces\u201d poem, Mary became frightened, handed the poems back to minor, and immediately left the campus in fear. After she informed her parents about the poem, her father called the school, but it was closed. Mary testified she did not know minor well, but they were on \u201cfriendly terms.\u201d When asked why she felt minor gave her the poem to read, she responded: \u201cI thought maybe because the first day he came into our class, I approached him because that\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d and because she continued to be nice to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">After Mary handed the poems back to minor, minor approached Erin S. and Natalie R, students minor had met during his two weeks at Santa Teresa High School. Erin had been introduced to minor a week prior and had subsequently spoken with him on only three or four occasions, whereas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Natalie considered herself minor\u2019s friend and had come to know him well during their long after-school conversations, which generally lasted between an hour to an hour and a half and included discussions of poetry. Minor handed Erin a \u201cfolded up\u201d piece of paper and asked her to read it. He also handed a similarly folded piece of paper to Natalie, who was standing with Erin. Because Erin was late for class, she only pretended to read the poem to be polite, but did not actually read it. She placed the unread poem in the pocket of her jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The next day, Saturday, Mary e-mailed her English teacher William Rasmussen to report her encounter with minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you over the weekend, but I don\u2019t think this should wait until Monday. During 6th period on Friday, 3/16, the guy in our class called julius (actually his name is Theodore?) gave me two poems to read. He explained to me that these poems \u2018described him and his feelings,\u2019 and asked if I \u2018felt the same way.\u2019 [j[] I was surprised to find that the poems were about how he is \u2018nice on the outside,\u2019 and how he\u2019s \u2018going to be the next person to bring a gun to school and kill random people.\u2019 I told him to bring the poems to room 315 to Ms. Gonzalez because [she] is in charge of poetry club. He said he would but I don\u2019t know for sure if he did.\u201d Mary remained in fear throughout the weekend because she understood the poem to be personally threatening to her, as a student. Asked why she felt the poem was a threat, Mary responded: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious he thought of himself as a dark, destructive, and dangerous person. And if he was willing to admit that about himself and then also state that he could be the next person to bring guns and kill students, then I\u2019d say that he was threatening.\u201d She understood the term \u201cdark poetry\u201d to mean \u201cangry threats; any thoughts that aren\u2019t positive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Rasmussen called Mary on Sunday regarding her e-mail. Mary sounded very shaken during the conversation, and based on this and on what she stated about the contents of the poem, Rasmussen contacted the school principal and the police. He read \u201cFaces\u201d for the first time during the jurisdictional hearing and, upon reading it, felt personally threatened by it because, according to Rasmussen, \u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s going to come randomly shoot.\u201d His understanding of \u201cdark poetry\u201d was that it entailed \u201cthe concept of death and causing and inflicting a major bodily pain and suffering .... There is something foreboding about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">On Sunday, March 18, officers from the San Jose Police Department went to minor\u2019s uncle\u2019s house, where minor and his father were residing. An officer asked minor, who opened the door when the officers arrived, whether there were any guns in the house. Minor \u201cnodded.\u201d Minor\u2019s uncle was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>surprised that minor was aware of his guns, and handed the officers a .38-caliber handgun and a rifle. When asked about the poems disseminated at school, minor handed an officer a piece of paper he took from his pocket. The paper contained a poem entitled, \u201cFaces in My Head\u201d which recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">Look at all these faces around me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">They look so vagrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">They have their whole lives ahead of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">They have their own indivisaulity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">Those kind of people make me wanna puke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">For I am a slave to very evil masters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">I have no future that I choose for myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">I feel as if I am going to go crazy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">Probably I would be the next high school killer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">A little song keeps playing in my head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-15\">My daddy is worth a dollar not even 100 cents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-16\">As I look at these faces around me</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azu\">I wonder why r they so happy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-17\">What do they have that I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-18\">Am I the only one with the messed up mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-19\">Then I realize, I\u2019m cursed!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-20\">As with the poem entitled \u201cFaces,\u201d this poem was labeled \u201cdark poetry\u201d but it was not shown or given to anyone at school. Minor drafted \u201cFaces in My Head\u201d that morning in an attempt to capture what he had written in \u201cFaces\u201d because he wanted a copy for his poetry collection. Minor was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-21\">Police officers went to the school the following Monday to investigate the dissemination of the poem. Erin was summoned to the vice-principal\u2019s office and asked whether minor had given her any notes. She responded in the affirmative, realized that the poem was still in the pocket of her jacket, and retrieved it. The paper contained a poem entitled \u201cFaces,\u201d which was the same poem given to Mary. Upon reading the poem for the first time in the vice-principal\u2019s office, Erin became terrified and broke down in tears, finding the poem to be a personal threat to her life. She testified that she was not in the poetry club and had no interest in the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-22\">Natalie, who testified on behalf of minor, recalled that minor said, \u201c[r]ead this\u201d as he handed her and Erin the pieces of paper. The folded-up sheet of paper Natalie received contained a poem entitled, \u201cWho Am I.\u201d When a police officer went to Natalie\u2019s home to inquire about the poem minor had given her on Friday, Natalie was not completely cooperative and truthful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>telling the officer that the poem was about water and dolphins and that she believed it was a love poem. The police retrieved the poem from Natalie\u2019s trash can and although it was tom, some of it could still be deciphered: \u201c. . . I created? . . . cause it really . . . feel as if . . . stolen from ... of peace . . . Taken to a place that you hate. Your locked up and when your let out of your cage it is to perform. Not able to be yourself and always hiding &amp; thinking would people like me if I behaved differently? by Julius AKA Angel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Natalie did not feel threatened by the poem, rather it made her \u201cfeel sad\u201d because \u201c[i]t was kind of lonely.\u201d She testified that \u201cdark poetry is . . . relevant to like pure emotions, like sadness, loneliness, hate or just like pure emotions. Sometimes it tells a story, like a dark story.\u201d Based on her extended conversations with minor, Natalie found him to be \u201cmild and calm and very serene\u201d and did not consider him to be violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Minor testified the poem \u201cFaces\u201d was not intended to be a threat and, because Erin and Natalie were his friends, he did not think they would have taken his poems as such. He thought of poetry as art and stated that he was very much interested in the subject, particularly as a medium to describe \u201cemotions instead of acting them out.\u201d He wrote \u201cFaces\u201d during his honors English class on the day he showed it to Mary and Erin. Minor was having a bad day as a consequence of having forgotten to ask his parents for lunch money and having to forgo lunch that day, and because he was unable to locate something in his backpack. He had many thoughts going through his head, so he decided to write them down as a way of getting them out. The poem \u201cWho Am I,\u201d which was given to Natalie, was written the same day as \u201cFaces,\u201d but was written during the lunch period. Neither poem was intended to be a threat. Instead they were \u201cjust creativity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Minor and his friends frequently joked about the school shootings at Columbine in Colorado.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They would jokingly say, \u201cI\u2019m going to be the next Columbine kid.\u201d Minor testified that Natalie and Erin had been present when he and some of his friends had joked about Columbine, with someone stating that \u201cI\u2019ll probably be the next Columbine killer,\u201d and indicating who would be killed and who would be spared. Given this past history, minor believed Natalie and Erin would understand the poems as jokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The poems were labeled \u201cdark poetry\u201d to inform readers that they were exactly that and, minor testified, \u201cif anybody was supposed to read this poem, or let\u2019s say if my mom ever found my poem or something of that nature, I would like them to know that it was dark poetry. Dark poetry is usually just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>an expression. It\u2019s creativity. It is not like you\u2019re actually going to do something like that, basically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Asked why he wrote, \u201cFor I can be the next kid to bring guns to school and kill students,\u201d minor responded: \u201cThe San Diego killing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was about right around this time. So since I put the three Ds\u2014dark, destructive, and dangerous\u2014and since I said\u2014T am evil,\u2019 and since I was talking about people around me\u2014faces\u2014how I said, like, how they would make me want to\u2014did I say that?\u2014well, even if I didn\u2019t\u2014yeah, I did say that. Okay. So, um, I said from all these things, it sounds like, for I can be the next Columbine kid, basically. So why not add that in? And so, \u2018Parents, watch your children, because I\u2019m back,\u2019 um, I just wanted to\u2014kind of like a dangerous ending, like a\u2014um, just like ending a poem that would kind of get you, like,\u2014like, whoa, that\u2019s really something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Minor stated that he did not know Mary and did not give her any poems. However, he was unable to explain how Mary was able to recount the contents of the \u201cFaces\u201d poem.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">On cross-examination, minor conceded that he had had difficulties in his two previous schools, including being disciplined for urinating on a wall at his first school and had been asked to leave his second school for plagiarizing from the Internet. He explained that the urination incident was caused by a doctor-verified bladder problem. He denied having any ill will toward the school district, but conceded when pressed by the prosecutor that he felt the schools \u201chad it in for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">An amended petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 was filed against minor, alleging minor made three criminal threats in violation of Penal Code section 422.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victims of the alleged threats were Mary (count 1), Erin (count 3), and Rasmussen (count 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Following a contested jurisdictional hearing, the juvenile court found true the allegations with respect to Mary and Erin, but dismissed the allegation with respect to Rasmussen. At the dispositional hearing, the court adjudicated minor a ward of the court and ordered a 100-day commitment in juvenile hall. Minor appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that he made criminal threats. Over a dissent, the Court of Appeal affirmed the juvenile court in all respects with the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of remanding the matter for the sole purpose of having that court declare the offenses to be either felonies or misdemeanors. We granted review and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In <em>People v. Toledo </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 221 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 315, 26 R3d 1051] <em>(Toledo), </em>we made clear that not all threats are criminal and enumerated the elements necessary to prove the offense of making criminal threats under section 422. The prosecution must prove \u201c(1) that the defendant \u2018willfully threaten[ed] to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,\u2019 (2) that the defendant made the threat \u2018with the specific intent that the statement ... is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,\u2019 (3) that the threat\u2014which may be \u2018made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device\u2019\u2014was \u2018on its face and under the circumstances in which it [was] made, ... so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,\u2019 (4) that the threat actually caused the person threatened \u2018to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety,\u2019 and (5) that the threatened person\u2019s fear was \u2018reasonable]\u2019 under the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Toledo, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 227-228, citing <em>People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 337-340, &amp; fn. 13 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374],)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Minor challenges the juvenile court\u2019s findings that he made criminal threats in violation of section 422 and contends that his First Amendment rights were infringed by the court\u2019s conclusion that his poem was a criminal threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">We address first the threshold issue of what standard of review applies in this case. Claims challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to uphold a judgment are generally reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. Under that standard, \u201c \u2018an appellate court reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find [the elements of the crime] beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolden </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 515, 553 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 802, 58 P.3d 931], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Kipp </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1100, 1128 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 27, 33 P.3d 450]; see <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 317-320 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781].) \u2018\u201c\u201cIf the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 919, 933 [251 Cal.Rptr. 467, 760 P.2d 996], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Hillery </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 692, 702 [44 Cal.Rptr. 30, 401 P.2d 382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Minor and his supporting amici curiae<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contend that because First Amendment interests are implicated by the determination that minor\u2019s poem constituted a threat, this court should employ the independent review standard, which entails an examination of the \u201c \u2018 \u201cstatements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see . . . whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment . . . protect.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connaughton </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 657, 688-689 [105 L.Ed.2d 562, 109 S.Ct. 2678] <em>(Harte-Hanks), </em>quoting <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 285 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 84 S.Ct. 710]; see also <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 485 [80 L.Ed.2d 502, 104 S.Ct. 1949] <em>(Bose).) </em>Disagreeing, the Attorney General contends this court should not depart from the substantial evidence standard because the high court decisions cited by minor are inapposite, and this court has already determined that section 422 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In <em>Bose, </em>the Supreme Court explained \u201cthat in cases raising First Amendment issues [it has] <em>repeatedly </em>held that an appellate court has an obligation to \u2018make an independent examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 499, italics added, quoting <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at pp. 284-286.) <em>Bose </em>held that a federal appellate court should conduct an independent review of a trier of fact\u2019s determination that a defendant acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d in the context of a defamation suit, rather than rely on the clearly-erroneous standard typically applied to findings of fact. <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 514.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Independent review, which \u201cassigns to judges a constitutional responsibility that cannot be delegated to the trier of fact, whether the factfinding function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>be performed in the particular case by a jury or by a trial judge\u201d <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 501 [104 S.Ct. 1949]), \u201cis a rule of federal constitutional law\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 510). It is necessary \u201cbecause the reaches of the First Amendment are ultimately defined by facts it is held to embrace\u201d and an appellate court must decide \u201cwhether a given course of conduct falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.\u201d <em>(Hurley </em>v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc. </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 557, 567 [132 L.Ed.2d 487, 115 S.Ct. 2338], citing <em>Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S at p. 503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We conclude that a reviewing court should make an independent examination of the record in a section 422 case when a defendant raises a plausible First Amendment defense to ensure that a speaker\u2019s free speech rights have not been infringed by a trier of fact\u2019s determination that the communication at issue constitutes a criminal threat. <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. 485.) Contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s contention, neither <em>Bose </em>nor <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>nor any other high court decision, limits independent review to specific First Amendment contexts. Rather, both <em>Bose </em>and <em>Harte-Hanks </em>emphasize that the high court has engaged in independent review in various First Amendment contexts, including \u201cfighting words\u201d <em>(Street v.

More recently, the high court applied the independent review standard in deciding whether a parade constituted protected speech <em>(Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., supra, </em>515 U.S. 557) and whether a group \u201cengagefd] in \u2018expressive association\u2019 \u201d <em>(Boy Scouts of America v. Dale </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 640, 648 [147 L.Ed.2d 554, 120 S.Ct. 2446]). The high court did so without reference to the unique nature of the specific First Amendment question involved. What is evident is that the high court has employed the independent review standard in varied First Amendment contexts as an added safeguard against infringement of First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The Attorney General contends independent review is unnecessary because true threats comprise a category of speech that is unprotected by the First Amendment <em>(Virginia </em>v. <em>Black </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 343 [155 L.Ed.2d 535, 123 S.Ct. 1536]; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 705 [22 L.Ed.2d 664, 89 S.Ct. 1399]), and argues that a fact finder\u2019s determination that section 422 has been violated necessarily includes a finding that the speech at issue is an unprotected true threat. This misses the point\u2014independent review is utilized by a reviewing court precisely to make certain that what the government characterizes as speech falling within an unprotected class actually does so. <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. at 505 [independent review is employed \u201cboth to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Moreover, as the <em>Bose </em>court explained in the obscenity context, \u201calthough under <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>[(1973) 413 U.S. 15 [37 L.Ed.2d 419, 93 S.Ct. 2607]], the question of what appeals to \u2018prurient interest\u2019 and what is \u2018patently offensive\u2019 under the community standard obscenity test are <em>\u2018essentially questions of fact,\u2019 </em>[citation], we expressly recognized the \u2018ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary,\u2019 [citation]. We have therefore rejected the contention that a jury finding of obscenity <em>vel non </em>is insulated from review so long as the jury was properly instructed and there is some evidence to support its findings, holding that substantive constitutional limitations govern.\u201d <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 506-507, italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">While it is certainly true, as the Attorney General contends, that a threat falling within section 422 lies outside the bounds of First Amendment protection, it is untrue that that fact militates against conducting an independent review. As we explained in <em>Toledo, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 221, the current version of section 422 was enacted by the Legislature after this court held the prior version unconstitutionally vague under the California Constitution in <em>People v. Mirmirani </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 375 [178 Cal.Rptr. 792, 636 P.2d 1130]. <em>(Toledo, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 228.) The current version of section 422 was drafted with the mandates of the First Amendment in mind, incorporating language from a federal appellate court true-threat decision, \u201cto describe and limit the type of threat covered by the statute.\u201d <em>(Toledo, </em>at p. 229, citing <em>United States v. Kelner </em>(2d Cir. 1976) 534 F.2d 1020, 1027.) While <em>Toledo </em>has explained the nature of our review by enumerating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>necessary elements for a criminal threats prosecution, independent review permits an appellate court to ensure that the <em>Toledo </em>test is satisfied and that the suppression of speech is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In sum, the high court has applied independent review in a wide array of First Amendment contexts, and no compelling reasons exist why independent review should not also apply in the unique circumstances presented in this case. Independent review is particularly important in the threats context because it is a type of speech that is subject to categorical exclusion from First Amendment protection, similar to obscenity, fighting words, and incitement of imminent lawless action. \u201cWhat is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.\u201d <em>(Watts </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 707.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Independent review is not the equivalent of de novo review \u201cin which a reviewing court makes an original appraisal of all the evidence to decide whether or not it believes\u201d the outcome should have been different. <em>(Bose, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 514, fn. 31.) Because the trier of fact is in a superior position to observe the demeanor of witnesses, credibility determinations are not subject to independent review, nor are findings of fact that are not relevant to the First Amendment issue. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 499-500; <em>Harte-Hanks, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 688.) As noted above, under the substantial evidence standard, the question is whether any rational trier of fact could find the legal elements satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas under independent review, an appellate court exercises its independent judgment to determine whether the facts satisfy the rule of law.  Accordingly, we will defer to the juvenile court\u2019s credibility determinations, but will \u201c \u2018 \u201cmake an independent examination of the whole record\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hurley </em>v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., supra, </em>515 U.S. at pp. 567-568), including a review of the constitutionally relevant facts \u201c \u2018de novo, independently of any previous determinations by the [juvenile court]\u2019 \u201d <em>(DVD Copy Control Assn. v. Burner, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 889-890, quoting <em>McCoy v. Hearst Corp. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 835, 842 [231 Cal.Rptr. 518, 727 P.2d 711]; <em>Hurley, supra, </em>515 U.S. at pp. 567-568) to determine whether minor\u2019s poem was a criminal threat entitled to no First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">As discussed above, this court in <em>Toledo </em>enumerated five elements the prosecution must prove in order to meet its burden of proving that a criminal threat was uttered. Minor challenges the findings with respect to two of the five elements, contending that the poem \u201cwas [not] \u2018on its face and under the circumstances in which it [was disseminated] so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to [Mary and Erin] a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat\u2019 \u201d (quoting \u00a7 422) and that the facts fail to establish he harbored the specific intent to threaten Mary and Erin (see <em>ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>With respect to the requirement that a threat be \u201cso unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,\u201d we explained in <em>People v. Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 297, that the word \u201cso\u201d in section 422 meant that \u201c \u2018unequivocality, unconditionality, immediacy and specificity are not absolutely mandated, but must be sufficiently present in the threat and surrounding circumstances . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 340, quoting <em>People v. Stanfield </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1157 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 328].) \u201cThe four qualities are simply the factors to be considered in determining whether a threat, considered together with its surrounding circumstances, conveys those impressions to the victim.\u201d <em>(People v. Stanfield, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1157-1158.) A communication that is ambiguous on its face may nonetheless be found to be a criminal threat if the surrounding circumstances clarify the communication\u2019s meaning. <em>(People v. Butler </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 745, 753-754 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 269].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">With the above considerations in mind, we examine the poem at issue\u2014 \u201cFaces.\u201d What is readily apparent is that much of the poem plainly does not constitute a threat. \u201cFaces\u201d begins by describing the protagonist\u2019s feelings about the \u201cfaces\u201d that surround him: \u201cWhere did they come from? They would probably become the next doctors or loirs or something. All really intelligent and ahead in their game. I wish I had a choice on what I want to be like they do. All so happy and vagrant. Each origonal in their own way. They make me want to puke.\u201d These lines convey the protagonist\u2019s feelings about the students around him and describe his envy over how happy and intelligent they appear to be, with opportunities he does not have. There is no doubt this portion of the poem fails to convey a criminal threat as no violent conduct whatsoever is expressed or intimated. Neither do the next two lines of the poem convey a threat: \u201cFor I am Dark, Destructive, &amp; Dangerous. I slap on my face of happiness but inside I am evil!!\u201d These lines amount to an introspective description of the protagonist, disclosing that he is \u201cdestructive,\u201d \u201cdangerous,\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201d But again, such divulgence threatens no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Only the final two lines of the poem could arguably be constmed to be a criminal threat: \u201cFor I can be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school. So parents watch your children cuz I\u2019m BACK!!\u201d Mary believed this was a threat, but her testimony reveals that her conclusion rested upon a considerable amount of interpretation: \u201cI feel that when he said, T can be the next person,\u2019 that he meant that he will be, because also he says that he\u2019s dark, destructive, and dangerous person. And I\u2019d describe a dangerous person as someone who has something in mind of killing someone or multiple people.\u201d The juvenile court\u2019s finding that minor threatened to kill Mary and Erin likewise turned primarily on its interpretation of the words, \u201cFor I <em>can </em>be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school\u201d (italics added) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>mean not only that minor could do so, but that he would do so. In other words, the court construed the word \u201ccan\u201d to mean \u201cwill.\u201d But that is not what the poem recites. However the poem was interpreted by Mary and Erin, and the court, the fact remains that \u201ccan\u201d does not mean \u201cwill.\u201d While the protagonist in \u201cFaces\u201d declares that he has the potential or capacity to kill students given his dark and hidden feelings, he does not actually threaten to do so. While perhaps discomforting and unsettling, in this unique context this disclosure simply does not constitute an actual threat to kill or inflict harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As is evident, the poem \u201cFaces\u201d is ambiguous and plainly equivocal. It does not describe or threaten future conduct because it does not state that the protagonist plans to kill students, or even that any potential victims would include Mary or Erin. Such ambiguity aside, it appears that Mary actually misread the text of the poem. In her e-mail to Rasmussen, she stated that the poem read, \u201che\u2019s <em>\u2018going </em>to be the next person to bring a gun to school and kill random people.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) She did not tell Rasmussen that this was her interpretation of the poem, but asserted that those were the words used by minor. Given the student killings in Columbine and Santee, this may have been an understandable mistake, but it does not alter the requirement that the words actually used must constitute a threat in light of the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The Court of Appeal rejected minor\u2019s contention that the protagonist in the poem was a fictional character rather than minor because he gave the poem to Mary with a note stating that the poem described \u201cme and my feelings.\u201d There is no inconsistency, however, in viewing the protagonist as a fictional character, while also concluding that the poem reflects minor\u2019s personal feelings. And when read by another person, the poem may similarly describe that reader\u2019s feelings, as minor implied when he asked Mary if the poem also \u201cdescribed [her] and [her] feelings.\u201d More important, the note is consistent with the contention that the poem did nothing more than describe certain dark feelings. The note asked whether Mary had the same feelings; it did not state or imply something to the effect of, \u201cthis is what I plan to do, are you with me.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>In re Ryan D. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 854, 864 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 193] <em>(Ryan D.) </em>[violent painting did not unequivocally convey a threat since it was unaccompanied by statements such as \u201cthis will be you,\u201d or \u201cI do have a gun, you know\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Of course, exactly what the poem means is open to varying interpretations because a poem may mean different things to different readers. As a medium of expression, a poem is inherently ambiguous. In general, \u201c[Reasonable persons understand musical lyrics and poetic conventions as the figurative expressions which they are,\u201d which means they \u201care not intended to be and should not be read literally on their face, nor judged by a standard of prose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>oratory.\u201d <em>(McCollum </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc. </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 989, 1002 [249 Cal.Rptr. 187].) Ambiguity in poetry is sometimes intended: \u201c \u2018Ambiguity\u2019 itself can mean an indecision as to what you mean, an intention to mean several things, a probability that one or the other or both of two things has been meant, and the fact that a statement has several meanings.\u201d (Empson, Seven Types of Ambiguity (2d ed. 1996) pp. 5-6.) As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>Ryan D., supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th 854, a case involving a painting graphically depicting a student shooting a police officer in the back of the head, \u201ca painting\u2014even a graphically violent painting\u2014is necessarily ambiguous because it may use symbolism, exaggeration, and make-believe.\u201d <em>(Ryan D., supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 859.) This observation is equally applicable to poetry since it is said that \u201c[p]ainting is silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks.\u201d (Plutarch, De Gloria Atheniensium, III, 346, attributed to Simonides (circa 556-68 B.C.) in Bartlett, Familiar Quotations (15th ed. 1980) p. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In short, viewed in isolation the poem is not \u201cso unequivocal\u201d as to have conveyed to Mary and Erin a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect that minor would bring guns to school and kill them. Ambiguity, however, is not necessarily sufficient to immunize the poem from being deemed a criminal threat because the surrounding circumstances may clarify facial ambiguity. (See <em>Toledo, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 227-228; <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at pp. 753-754.) As section 422 makes clear, a threat must \u201con its face and <em>under the circumstances </em>in which it is made, [be] so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey ... a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>italics added.) When the words are vague, context takes on added significance, but care must be taken not to diminish the requirements that the communicator have the specific intent to convey a threat and that the threat be of such a nature as to convey a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of the threat\u2019s execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Unlike some cases that have turned on an examination of the surrounding circumstances given a communication\u2019s vagueness, incriminating circumstances in this case are noticeably lacking: there was no history of animosity or conflict between the students <em>(People v. Gaut </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1431-1432 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 924] [defendant had a history of threatening and assaulting victim]; <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1341-1342 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 728] [both victim and defendant were gang members and threat made following victim\u2019s testimony against defendant\u2019s brother]), no threatening gestures or mannerisms accompanied the poem <em>(People v. Lepolo </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 85, 88-89 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 735] [defendant raised a 36-inch machete and waved it at victim while making threat]; cf. <em>In re Ricky T. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1138 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 165] [threat unaccompanied by \u201cphysical show of force\u201d]), and no conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>suggested to Mary and Erin that there was an immediate prospect of execution of a threat to till <em>(People v. Butler, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at pp. 749-750 [defendant and his cohorts surrounded victim and grabbed her arm]). Thus the circumstances surrounding the poem\u2019s dissemination fail to show that, as a threat, it was sufficiently unequivocal to convey to Mary and Erin an immediate prospect that minor would bring guns to school and shoot students.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The themes and feelings expressed in \u201cFaces\u201d are not unusual in literature: \u201cLiterature illuminates who \u2018we\u2019 are: the repertory of selves we harbor within, the countless feelings we experience but never express or perhaps even acknowledge, the innumerable other lives we could but do not live, all those \u2018inside\u2019 lives that are not shown, not included in our resumes.\u201d (Weinstein, A Scream Goes Through the House: What Literature Teaches Us About Life (2003) p. xxiii.) \u201cFaces\u201d was in the style of a relatively new genre of literature called \u201cdark poetry\u201d that amici curiae J.M. Coetzee et al. explain is an extension of the poetry of Sylvia Plath, John Berryman, Robert Lowell, and other confessional poets who depict \u201cextraordinarily mean, ugly, violent, or harrowing experiences.\u201d (See Deutsch, Poetry Handbook (4th ed. 1973) pp. 36-37, quoting John Berryman\u2019s \u201cDream Songs\u201d [\u201cI\u2019m scared a only one thing, which is me\u201d].) Consistent with that genre, \u201cFaces\u201d invokes images of darkness, violence, discontentment, envy, and alienation. The protagonist describes his duplicitous nature\u2014malevolent on the inside, felicitous on the outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold the poem entitled \u201cFaces\u201d and the circumstances surrounding its dissemination fail to establish that it was a criminal threat because the text of the poem, understood in light of the surrounding circumstances, was not \u201cso unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to [the two students] a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat.\u201d (\u00a7 422.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Our conclusion that the poem was not an unequivocal threat disposes of the matter and we need not, and do not, discuss minor\u2019s contention that he did not harbor the specific intent to threaten the students, as required by section 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">This case implicates two apparently competing interests: a school administration\u2019s interest in ensuring the safety of its students and faculty versus students\u2019 right to engage in creative expression. Following Columbine, Santee, and other notorious school shootings, there is a heightened sensitivity on school campuses to latent signs that a student may undertake to bring guns to school and embark on a shooting rampage. Such signs may include violence-laden student writings. For example, the two student killers at Columbine had written poems for their English classes containing \u201cextremely violent imagery.\u201d (Brunner, <em>The Right to Write? Free Expression Rights of Pennsylvania\u2019s Creative Students After Columbine </em>(2003) 107 Dick. L.Rev. 891, 893, 897.) Ensuring a safe school environment and protecting freedom of expression, however, are not necessarily antagonistic goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Minor\u2019s reference to school shootings and his dissemination of his poem in close proximity to the Santee school shooting no doubt reasonably heightened the school\u2019s concern that minor might emulate the actions of previous school shooters. Certainly, school personnel were amply justified in taking action following Mary\u2019s e-mail and telephone conversation with her English teacher, but that is not the issue before us. We decide here only that minor\u2019s poem did not constitute a criminal threat.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">III.

We believe the elements of section 422, in particular the requirements that the communicator have the specific intent <em>to </em>threaten <em>and </em>that the threat be \u201cso unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,\u201d coupled with independent review, adequately protects freedom of expression, as they have done in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> Amicus curiae Youth Law Center urges that allowing and even encouraging students to express their feelings teaches students to write out their feelings rather than acting them out and permits early intervention. Early intervention may involve talking to the student, either by school personnel such as a school psychologist or other professional, talking to the student\u2019s parents, and in the most egregious of situations, such as where there appears to be an imminent threat, resort to law enforcement. (Citing U.S. Dept. of Education Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools (1998).) Amici curiae Legal Services for Children, Juvenile Law Center, National Center for Youth Law, and Legal Advocates for Children and Youth similarly urge that minor should not be sanctioned for engaging in what mental health professionals recommend\u2014expressing feelings by, inter alia, writing poetry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>BAXTER, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">I concur in the result. To convict one of the <em>felony offense </em>of making a <em>criminal </em>threat, the prosecution must prove several technical and stringent elements. One of these is that the threat must have been, \u201con its face and under the circumstances in which it [was] made,... so <em>unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific </em>as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an <em>immediate prospect of execution </em>of the threat.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 422, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Applying the independent review standard proper for cases implicating First Amendment interests, I agree the evidence does not establish this specific element. The writing, in the form of a poem, that defendant handed to Mary S. and Erin S. said that the protagonist, \u201cJulius AKA Angel,\u201d \u201ccan be the next kid to bring guns to kill students at school.\u201d (Italics added.) It did not say, in so many words, that defendant <em>presently intended </em>to do so. And the surrounding circumstances did not lend unconditional meaning to this conditional language.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">That said, there is no question that defendant\u2019s ill-chosen words were menacing by any common understanding, both on their face and in context. The terror they elicited in Mary S., and the concern they evoked in the school authorities, were real and entirely reasonable. It is safe to say that fears arising from a raft of high school shooting rampages, including those in Colorado and Santee, California, are prevalent among American high school students, teachers, and administrators. Certainly this was so on March 16, 2001, only <em>eleven days </em>after the Santee incident had occurred. That is the day defendant selected to press his violent writing on two vulnerable and impressionable young schoolmates who hardly knew him.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Defendant admitted at trial that he intentionally combined the subject matter and the timing for maximum shock value. Indeed, he acknowledged, his words would be interpreted as threats by \u201ckids who didn\u2019t know [he] [was] just kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Under these circumstances, as the majority observe, school and law enforcement officials had every reason to worry that defendant, deeply troubled, was contemplating his own campus killing spree. The important interest that underlies the criminal-threat law\u2014protection against the trauma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of verbal terrorism\u2014was also at stake. Accordingly, the authorities were fully justified, and should be commended, insofar as they made a prompt, full, and vigorous response to the incident. They would have been remiss had they not done so. Nothing in our very narrow holding today should be construed as suggesting otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
