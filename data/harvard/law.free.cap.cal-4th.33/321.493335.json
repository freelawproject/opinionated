Does this evidence satisfy the force or fear element of simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>kidnapping? (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207, subd. (a) (hereafter section 207(a)).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude it does, and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">On August 15, 2000, 18-year-old Alesandria M. was riding home on her bicycle. She was an employee at the Zany Brainy store at Mira Mesa Market Center. Earlier that day, Alesandria had purchased a gift at Zany Brainy for her brother\u2019s birthday. Just prior to starting home, Alesandria returned to Zany Brainy and made a second purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">After Alesandria had been riding for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, defendant Gaylon Michael Majors, wearing sunglasses and standing in the street next to a white van, flashed a badge and asked her to stop. He told her he was a security guard at the Mira Mesa mall and had received a call saying someone on a bicycle was suspected of a theft at the Zany Brainy store. Alesandria got off her bike and showed defendant the items in her backpack, her payment receipts, and. her identification. Defendant told Alesandria she would have to return with him to the store and speak to the security guard to resolve the issue. He tried to put her bike in the van, but it did not fit, so he \u201csaid to go ahead and lock my bike up at the school right across the street.\u201d While Alesandria did so, defendant took her backpack and put it in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">When she returned to the van, Alesandria asked to see defendant\u2019s badge again. While defendant was not in uniform, Alesandria testified that \u201cI felt scared that maybe if he was undercover or something like that I would get in more trouble. So I took his badge again. I was not really sure what to look for.\u201d The badge said \u201csecurity guard\u201d on it. On the other side of the badge was an orange laminated card. Alesandria did not ride off because she \u201cwas really scared that if ... he was who he said he was, that I would be in jail, that I would have to explain to my parents why I was there, even though I knew inside that I was innocent of stealing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Alesandria testified she was afraid she would be arrested if she did not get into the van. She believed defendant had the authority to arrest her because he displayed a badge and identified himself as a security officer. Alesandria had never dealt with the police before, and was afraid not to get in the van. She testified, \u201cI believed what he said about being a security guard and that we would have to go back to the . . . mall, to clear things up. And I actually worked at Zaney Brainey <em>[sic\\, </em>so I was confident about getting the manager to clear everything up for me.\u201d \u201cHe told me I would have to go with him.\u201d \u201cI requested to see his badge because I didn\u2019t believe him. But at the same time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>I didn\u2019t want to not believe him if he was telling the truth. I didn\u2019t want to make a situation worse than it had already been.\u201d Defendant did not do anything to cause her to be afraid for her safety before she got into the van. He did not display any weapons, threaten, or touch Alesandria until they parked at the mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Once Alesandria and defendant were in the van, defendant appeared to make a call on his cell phone. \u201cHe made it sound like maybe he was talking to a partner or somebody, saying that the suspect was apprehended.\u201d Alesandria asked if she could call her parents. Defendant told her \u201cthat we could once we got there.\u201d Once they arrived at the mall, defendant said \u201cthey were going to have to check with the manager to see if they could look at their cameras.\u201d This caused Alesandria apprehension, apparently because she knew from her employment there were no cameras at Zany Brainy.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Defendant ultimately drove to an isolated area of the mall. Alesandria started to get out of the van, but defendant grabbed her by the hair and slammed her head into the passenger side window. He then pulled back her hair so she was facing him, told her to go to the back of the van, and said he would not hurt her. Alesandria grabbed for defendant\u2019s throat, but defendant grabbed her head again, and tried to force her head between her legs. He ultimately threw her into a bench seat in the back of the van, and told her if she cooperated he would not hurt her. He then straddled her, pinning her arms to her chest, and struck her twice on the side of her head saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be mean to you, so just do what I say.\u201d Alesandria was screaming and crying, and kicking defendant. Defendant asked Alesandria if she wanted to die, and she said yes. Defendant said, \u201cOkay, you are going to die.\u201d Alesandria continued to kick defendant, and he eventually released her, saying, \u201cGet out bitch.\u201d Alesandria reported the matter to a security guard and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Defendant\u2019s fingerprint was found on one of Alesandria\u2019s Zany Brainy purchase receipts. Defendant was also positively identified at trial by a woman who lived at the location where defendant initially stopped Alesandria. On the day of his arrest, defendant was seen driving a white van. When arrested, he was in possession of a canvas briefcase containing an orange laminated card, sunglasses, binoculars, a digital camera, and a dildo.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The jury was instructed that both kidnapping for rape and simple kidnapping required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Alesandria \u201cwas unlawfully moved by the use of physical force or by any other means of instilling fear,\u201d and that her movement was \u201cwithout her consent.\u201d \u201cConsent\u201d was defined as \u201cact[ing] freely and voluntarily and not under the influence of threat, force, or duress. . . . Consent requires a free will and positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>cooperation in act or attitude.\u201d With respect to the crimes against Alesandria,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant was convicted of kidnapping for rape (\u00a7 209, subd. (b)(1)), simple kidnapping (\u00a7 207(a)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>assault with the intent to commit rape (\u00a7 220), and false imprisonment by violence and menace (\u00a7\u00a7 236, 237, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">A divided Court of Appeal reversed defendant\u2019s convictions for kidnapping and kidnapping for rape for insufficiency of the evidence regarding the element of force or fear. The majority stated, \u201cThis case appears to be a classic case of asportation by fraud, not by force or fear.\u201d In all other respects as to the crimes against Alesandria, the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review to consider whether evidence that a victim entered a defendant\u2019s vehicle under threat of arrest is sufficient to satisfy the force or fear element of section 207(a) kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Section 207(a) provides, \u201cEvery person who forcibly, or by any other means of instilling fear, steals or takes, or holds, detains, or arrests any person in this state, and carries the person into another . . . county, or into another part of the same county, is guilty of kidnapping.\u201d The language \u201cany other means of instilling fear\u201d was added in 1990. (Stats. 1990, ch. 55, \u00a7 1, p. 393.) Section 207(a) expressly \u201cdo[esj not apply to ... : [(J[] ... [][].. . any person acting under Section 834[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] or 837.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u00a7 207, subd. (f)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">As can be seen by this language, in order to constitute section 207(a) kidnapping, the victim\u2019s movement must be accomplished by force or any other means of instilling fear. We have observed that even prior to the 1990 amendment adding the language \u201cany other means of instilling fear,\u201d our cases held \u201cthat a taking is forcible if accomplished through fear.\u201d <em>(People v. Hill </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 853, 856 &amp; fn. 2 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 254, 3 P.3d 898] <em>(Hill).) </em>As these earlier cases explain, the force used against the victim \u201cneed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>not be physical. The movement is forcible where it is accomplished through the giving of orders which the victim feels compelled to obey because he or she fears harm or injury from the accused and such apprehension is not unreasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>(People v. Stephenson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 652, 660 [111 Cal.Rptr. 556, 517 P.2d 820] (Stephenson); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Camden </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 808, 814 [129 Cal.Rptr. 438, 548 P.2d 1110] [section 207(a) \u201cencompasses any movement of a victim which is substantial in character [citation], and accomplished by means of force or threat of force\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 183, 189 [137 P.2d 21] [the gravamen of the offense of kidnapping is \u201csome form of compulsion\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dagampat </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 492, 495 [334 P.2d 581] (Dagampat) [\u201cThe requisite force or compulsion need not consist of the use of actual physical force or of express threats\u201d].) We have also observed that the concepts of consent and force or fear \u201care clearly intertwined.\u201d <em>(In re Michele D. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 609 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 59 P.3d 164] <em>(Michele D.) </em>[addressing force]; <em>Hill, </em>at p. 855 [kidnapping generally must be \u201cagainst the will of the victim, i.e., without the victim\u2019s consent\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">These alternative bases for committing kidnapping, i.e., \u201cforcibly, or by any other means of instilling fear,\u201d while stated in the disjunctive, are not mutually exclusive. As noted, prior to the 1990 addition of the language \u201cany other means of instilling fear,\u201d we had held that threats of force satisfy the force element of section 207(a). Given the similarity between a \u201cthreat of force\u201d and \u201cany other means of instilling fear,\u201d there are inevitably now circumstances that constitute both force and fear within the meaning of this statute. As the Attorney General notes, \u201cthe mechanism by which a threat of force produces the movement of the victim necessary for a kidnapping is fear, specifically, the fear that the threat of force will be carried out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In contrast to the use of force or fear to compel asportation, \u201casportation by fraud alone does not constitute general kidnapping in California.\u201d <em>(People v. Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 517, fn. 13 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 64, 63 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468] [\u201cdefendant tricked [victim] into believing she was simply being taken on a quick trip to her sister\u2019s house and back\u201d], overruled on other grounds in <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 239 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834, fn. 3 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99].) This long-standing rule is premised on the language of section 207, which for general kidnapping, at issue here, requires asportation by force or fear, but for other forms of kidnapping proscribes movement procured only by \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201centice[ment],\u201d or \u201cfalse promises.\u201d (\u00a7 207, subds. (a)-(d); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 588, 602-603 [114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058], overruled on other grounds in <em>Martinez, </em>at p. 237; <em>People v. Rhoden </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 519, 526-527 [99 Cal.Rptr. 751, 492 P.2d 1143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Thus, in <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 652, we reversed two kidnapping convictions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 659-660, 662.) In one, the victim entered the vehicle voluntarily because he thought it was a taxi. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 656.) In the other, the victim accepted a ride from a stranger. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 657.) We concluded the victims \u201cwere enticed to get voluntarily into defendant\u2019s car by deceit or fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 659.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">By contrast, in <em>People v. La Salle </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 139, 143, 146 [162 Cal.Rptr. 816] (disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Kimble </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 480, 496, fn. 12, 498 [244 Cal.Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803]), the victim entered the car not voluntarily, but because the defendant had her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter in the car, and could have driven away with her. While \u201cshe was afraid to get into the car, she was more afraid not to get in, because of what could happen to her daughter .... [S]he felt she had no choice but to cooperate. The jury was entitled to conclude that this was not a case of inducement by fraud or deceit, but one wherein the victim <em>was forced </em>to consent to defendant\u2019s demands.\u201d <em>(La Salle, </em>at p. 146; <em>Dagampat, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.2d at p. 495 [\u201ccourt could reasonably have found that [victim] did not willingly enter the car, but did so because of a fear of bodily harm induced by [one defendant\u2019s] order to get into the convertible, defendants\u2019 \u2018dirty looks,\u2019 the sudden approach of [another member of defendants\u2019 group] from the drugstore, and his recollection of the fight in which\u201d the other defendant stabbed a different victim].)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Of course, it goes without saying that asportation may be accomplished by means that are both fraudulent and involve force or fear. For example, a defendant who claims to have a gun but who in fact does not could not successfully argue he induced the movement of the victims who credited his statement solely by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The question in this case is whether movement accomplished by the implicit but false threat of arrest satisfies the elements of force or fear in section 207(a), or whether such movement is simply asportation by fraud. While not addressing the precise factual scenario presented here, kidnapping cases involving fraudulent arrest date back over a century.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pick </em>(1891) 89 Cal. 144, 147, 152-153 [26 P. 759], we distinguished <em>Ex Parte Stemes </em>(1889) 82 Cal. 245 [23 P. 38], in which a deputy sheriff lawfully executed an arrest warrant, and upheld the kidnapping conviction of the defendant constable. In <em>Pick, </em>the defendant arrested the victim, but then took her to a house of \u201cill-fame.\u201d <em>(Pick, </em>at p. 147.) We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>observed that the language of former section 207<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cnecessarily implies that the arrest and conveying to another county must be without the consent of the person injured, and without any lawful authority therefor . . . <em>(Pick, </em>at p. 150.) In response to the defendant\u2019s contention that his action was not kidnapping because \u201che was acting under a warrant,\u201d we stated, \u201cit is not unreasonable to believe that [defendant], when he made the arrest, intended to do with his prisoner just what the evidence shows that he did do, and that he had no other purpose. In other words, that her arrest was simply a means to the end he had in view; that he never intended to take her before a magistrate, but did intend to place her [at the house of ill-fame]. Such an act was unlawful, and as the warrant under which [defendant] claims that he acted never authorized such a proceeding, it affords no justification for the act now under consideration.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 151-152.) Because it was not at issue, we did not describe in <em>Pick </em>what force was used to effectuate the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Broyles </em>(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 428, 429 [311 P.2d 88], the defendants spotted a car parked in an isolated area. It was occupied by a man and a woman. Defendant Broyles turned a flashlight into the car \u201cand told the occupants that he was a special deputy sheriff patrolling the back roads, that what they were doing was wrong, and that he would have to take them in.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>He asked to see the man\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Broyles then sent codefendant Gully back to their car to see if the couple \u201chad a record and if the car was stolen.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Gully came back saying there was no record and the car was not stolen. Broyles told the man he would have to take the woman \u201cdown to the station.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The woman entered the defendants\u2019 car \u201cbelieving that these were police officers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Gully later made a statement that during the drive \u201che could hear crying in the back seat and could hear \u2018somebody getting hit.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 430.) The Court of Appeal rejected Gully\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence and upheld his kidnapping conviction, stating, \u201cThere was ample evidence that the victim . . . was induced to enter the car driven by [Gully] by the representations made by these parties that they were police officers; that she believed these representations, and acted through fear; that they forced her into their car by giving orders which she felt compelled to obey; and that some force was used while she was being transported over a space of several miles. The evidence is sufficient to show the crime of kidnaping.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 430-431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>People v. Harris </em>(1944) 67 Cal.App.2d 307, 308-309 [154 P.2d 442], the defendant stated to two 15-year-old boys, William and Henry, that he had been sent by the Dallas County Sheriff to get a particular boy. When William asked the defendant if he had any identification demonstrating he was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>officer, the defendant said, \u201c ' \u201cNever mind,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and that they \u201c \u2018must go and get in the car.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 309.) When William started to walk away from the car, the defendant said, \u201c \u2018 \u201cIf you don\u2019t want a damned broken leg you had better come back here, boy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Defendant ultimately said he had to take Henry \u201c \u2018 \u201cdown\u201d.. .. \u201cIf you are not the one, ... I will bring you home or see you get back home.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 309-310.) Henry testified, \u201c T thought that he was a plain clothes police officer, and I was kind of afraid. . . . Then I got in the car.\u2019 \u201d Henry was subsequently sexually assaulted, and the defendant convicted of kidnapping and oral copulation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 307, 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The Court of Appeal in <em>Harris </em>observed that while the defendant \u201cmakes no argument and cites no authority in support of the claim that his conviction of the crime of kidnaping is unsupported by the evidence, we feel that such claim is effectually refuted by the recent case of <em>People v. Brazil </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 596 [128 P.2d 204], There, a gun was exhibited and the complaining witness was told to get into the automobile because the defendant was going to take her to the police station. While no gun was displayed in the instant case, the orders of the defendant were carried out under fear induced by oral threats. Henry testified, when asked whether he got into the car willingly: \u2018Well, he threatened my friend and I thought that he was a plain clothes police, and so I got in the car to keep from having any trouble, because I didn\u2019t want to get in any trouble with no police.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Harris, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.2d at p. 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">As can be seen, none of these cases directly hold that an implicit threat of arrest satisfies the force element of the kidnapping statute. In <em>Pick, </em>the force used to effectuate the arrest was not described. However, nothing in that case suggests that in order to constitute kidnapping, the arrest had to involve anything other than an assertion the victim was required to accompany the officer. In <em>Broyles, </em>it is unclear whether the Court of Appeal concluded the totality of the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate kidnapping, or whether it had alternative bases for its holding, i.e., that the evidence demonstrated kidnapping both when the victim entered the car because of orders from apparent police officers she felt compelled to obey, and when force was later applied during the asportation. In <em>Brazil, </em>a gun was used in effectuating the \u201carrest.\u201d And in <em>Harris, </em>prior to the victim\u2019s entry into the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant threatened to break the leg of the victim\u2019s companion if he ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Nevertheless, defendant fails to cite a single case in which asportation accomplished by the threat of arrest was found to be movement motivated solely by fraud. Indeed, implicit in the language of section 207, subdivision (f)(2), which creates an exception to the kidnapping statute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>lawful arrest by a peace officer or a private person, is the Legislature\u2019s understanding that <em>unlawful </em>arrest may, under certain circumstances, be a form of kidnapping. As we have observed in a somewhat different context, \u201c[p]olice officers occupy a unique position of trust in our society. . . . They are given the authority to detain and to arrest .... Those who challenge an officer\u2019s actions do so at their peril . . . .\u201d <em>(Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 206 [285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341]; <em>Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Assoc, of New Jersey </em>v. <em>Township of Washington </em>(3d Cir. 1988) 850 F.2d 133, 141 [police officers exercise \u201cthe most awesome and dangerous power that a democratic state possesses with respect to its residents\u2014the power to use lawful force to arrest and detain them\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As observed above, the concepts of consent and force or fear with regard to kidnapping are inextricably intertwined. (See <em>Michele D., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 609.) Thus, in those cases in which the movement was found to be by fraud alone, and not force or fear, the circumstances suggest the victim exercised free will in accompanying the perpetrator. By contrast, the threat of arrest carries with it the threat that one\u2019s compliance, if not otherwise forthcoming, will be physically forced. Thus, the use of force is implicit when arrest is threatened. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, \u201cbeing arrested\u201d is not an \u201cesoteric\u201d fear that stretches the meaning of the statute. This is true regardless of whether the defendant used deception regarding the fact of the threatened arrest. The compulsion, which is the gravamen of the kidnapping crime, remains present.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We therefore conclude an implicit threat of arrest satisfies the force or fear element of section 207(a) kidnapping if the defendant\u2019s conduct or statements cause the victim to believe that unless the victim accompanies the defendant the victim will be forced to do so, and the victim\u2019s belief is objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">We further conclude there was substantial evidence here of force or fear, i.e., that Alesandria entered defendant\u2019s van under such implicit threat of arrest. In making this determination, we do not resolve evidentiary conflicts, but \u201c \u2018view the evidence in a light most favorable to\u2019 \u201d the People, \u201c \u2018and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Felix </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 905, 909-910 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">First, there was substantial evidence Alesandria subjectively feared arrest. Alesandria testified she was afraid she would be arrested if she did not get into the van. She believed defendant had the authority to arrest her because he displayed a badge and identified himself as a security officer. Alesandria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>had never dealt with the police before, and was afraid to not get into the van. \u201cI requested to see his badge because I didn\u2019t believe him. But at the same time I didn\u2019t want to not believe him if he was telling the truth. I didn\u2019t want to make a situation worse than it had already been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Moreover, Alesandria\u2019s belief that she would be arrested if she did not accompany defendant back to the mall was objectively reasonable. Defendant approached the victim, who had been riding her bike, and stopped her by holding up a badge. He identified himself as a security guard, and indicated he stopped her for a law enforcement purpose. Specifically, he told the victim he had received a call about a suspected theft from a store Alesandria had just visited twice, and that the suspected thief was someone on a bicycle. Defendant told Alesandria she \u201cwould have to go with him.\u201d He then exerted control over the victim\u2019s belongings, at first trying to put her bike into his van. When he saw that the bike would not fit, he told her to lock it up, thus depriving her of transportation. He then took her backpack and put it in the van. Once the victim was in the van, defendant continued the ruse in a manner that reinforced the notion that he had law enforcement authority and that the victim might be in criminal trouble: He made a phone call to tell his partner or some other interested person that \u201cthe suspect was apprehended\u201d and refused the victim\u2019s request to call her parents, telling her she had to wait until they returned to the mall to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">As the Attorney General notes, when defendant \u201cimplicitly threatened Alesandria with arrest if she did not get in the van and return with him to the mall to face the theft allegations, he necessarily threatened her with the possibility of force if she did not comply.\u201d This kind of compulsion is qualitatively different than if defendant had offered to give Alesandria a ride, or sought her assistance in locating a lost puppy, or any other circumstance suggesting voluntariness on the part of the victim. While defendant contends this is no more than a classic case of asportation by fraud, we disagree. As the Attorney General observes, defendant\u2019s \u201cmisidentification of himself and his implicit threats of false arrest were simply the vehicle for his conveyance of threats of force and fear that compelled Alesandria to get in his van.\u201d Thus, the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate a threat of force, and alternatively, that such a threat instilled fear in Alesandria that such force would actually be applied. Under either the force or the fear prong of the kidnapping statute, therefore, we conclude the evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Defendant asserts that Alesandria was not \u201cafraid of some implicit threat of forcible arrest,\u201d but rather \u201cgot into the van to prove her innocence,\u201d and was \u201csimply afraid of the possibility of going to jail.\u201d It is not obvious how these concepts of fear of \u201cimplicit threat of forcible arrest\u201d and fear of \u201cthe possibility of going to jail\u201d substantially differ. In any event, contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>defendant\u2019s assertions, we read the record as containing sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that Alesandria\u2019s movement was compelled by an implicit threat of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Defendant also asserts that the Attorney General has waived the argument that the asportation was accomplished by the threat of force because the prosecutor did not make this argument below. Rather, he contends the \u201cprosecution\u2019s case-in-chief was built entirely on arguing the show of authority vitiated consent and instilled fear in Alesandria M. that compelled her to move.\u201d As noted earlier, there is little meaningful distinction and considerable overlap between the concepts of threat of force and instilled fear. Moreover, whether characterized as any other means of instilling fear or threat of force by the prosecution below, the prosecutor argued at length that the only reason Alesandria got into the van was because of defendant\u2019s show of authority and her fear she would be arrested, and hence her movement was not voluntary. Such argument focused the jury\u2019s attention on the evidence demonstrating both a threat of force and a threat that instilled fear in Alesandria. The jury was instructed that the victim\u2019s movement must be compelled by either force or fear, and was free to rely on either prong in reaching its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The Attorney General also asserts that the Legislature\u2019s 1990 addition of the language \u201cany other means of instilling fear\u201d \u201cincrease^] the scope of liability for kidnapping to those who use fear <em>of any type </em>in order to compel the movement of their victims.\u201d He asserts this would include, for example, threatening to report a coworker to a supervisor for sexual harassment unless the coworker accompanies the defendant. He further asserts, \u201c[a] kidnapper could threaten the property, reputation, or livelihood of the victim in order to compel the victim to comply with the kidnapper\u2019s demands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Here, it is apparent that defendant\u2019s actions creating a threat of force would have constituted kidnapping even prior to the 1990 amendment to section 207(a), and that such a threat would also \u201cinstill[] fear\u201d of the potential use of such force in the victim under the current wording of the statute. Because we conclude there was sufficient evidence Alesandria\u2019s movement was accomplished by threatened force and fear of that threatened force, we need not decide in this case what other forms of fear would also satisfy the amended statute. We note, however, in response to the Attorney General\u2019s suggested broad definition, that section 207(a) refers to \u201cany other means of instilling fear,\u201d not to \u201cany fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Moreover, our review of the legislative history of the 1990 amendment does not conclusively demonstrate that <em>any </em>fear would now satisfy section 207(a). For example, that history notes, \u201cAlthough most kidnappings may be accomplished by the use of force, there are instances where the kidnapper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>may accomplish the same by instilling fear in the victim. For example, the kidnapper may threaten to kill a family member. Thus, by expanding the definition of the crime to include such situations, the bill would close a potential loophole in the law.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Pub. Safety, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1564 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) as amended Jan. 16, 1990, p. 3.) This example of violence towards one close to the victim, rather than the victim herself, is categorically different from fear the perpetrator will not attend a high school prom with the victim, or other fears substantially removed from the use of force. Indeed, when we observed in <em>Hill, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 853, that our cases prior to the 1990 amendment had held \u201cthat a taking is forcible if accomplished through fear,\u201d we were referring to fear of \u201charm or injury from the accused.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 856, fn. 2, citing <em>People v. Alcala </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 622 [205 Cal.Rptr. 775, 685 P.2d 1126], superseded by statute on other grounds; <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at pp. 659-660.) Thus, while we need not delineate in this case the precise parameters of the language \u201cany other means of instilling fear,\u201d it is unlikely that by adding this language the Legislature intended to expand the crime of kidnapping to include movement compelled by fear of any and all negative consequences to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case remanded to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">George, C.
