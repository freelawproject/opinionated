Proper advisement and waivers of these rights in the record establish a defendant\u2019s voluntary and intelligent admission of the prior conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1178-1179 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315] (Howard); <em>North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970) 400 U.S. 25, 31 [27 L.Ed.2d 162, 91 S.Ct. 160].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">When, immediately after a jury verdict of guilty, a defendant admits a prior conviction after being advised of and waiving only the right to trial, can that admission be voluntary and intelligent even though the defendant was not told of, and thus did not expressly waive, the concomitant rights to remain silent and to confront adverse witnesses? The answer is \u201cyes,\u201d if the totality of circumstances surrounding the admission supports such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">On April 13, 1999, defendant Clyde Mosby was arrested for selling a $20 piece of rock cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was charged with one count of selling cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352, subd. (a)), and it was alleged he had a prior felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370, subds. (a) &amp; (c)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>At trial, the prosecution offered three witnesses; Detective Chaplin, who bought the cocaine, described its purchase; Detective Reyes, who was present at the arrest, identified the rock of cocaine as the one he had seized; and chemist Edwin Smith testified that the rock contained cocaine base. Defendant\u2019s attorney cross-examined each detective. Defendant did not testify, although his codefendant did.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">After the trial court learned that the jury had arrived at its verdict, the trial court asked defendant whether he wanted a jury trial on the bifurcated prior conviction allegation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThe Court: The question is, should this jury return a guilty verdict as to Mr. Mosby, the hearing on whether it is true he did suffer such a prior conviction. Mr. Dawson [hereafter defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I\u2019ve spoken with Mr. Mosby, and at this time he\u2019s willing to, first of all, waive jury on that issue. He will leave that in the hands of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cBut secondly, at [tjhis time, I am in agreement that he will admit the enhancement, which essentially, absent unusual circumstances, makes him probation ineligible and allow the court to do what it will at sentencing if that becomes a necessary issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, your understanding is he\u2019s willing to waive the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Waive the jury and actually admit the prior offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cThe Court: We can deal with that afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cMr. Mosby, it\u2019s alleged in the information that you were convicted of a felony violation, a drug offense, back on or about May 5th of \u201993, that\u2019s alleged in the information, so that if that\u2019s true, you were convicted on this charge, this present charge, it would make you ineligible for probation, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThe Court: You are entitled to have this jury, if they should find you guilty, you\u2019re entitled to have this jury determine the truth of the allegation that you suffered this prior felony conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to have the jury hear that and make a decision on whether that\u2019s true or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cDo you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cThe Court: Do you waive and give up your right to have this jury make a determination as to whether you suffered such a prior conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201cThe Court: And you join in that, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">The jury then returned and delivered its verdict finding defendant guilty of selling cocaine. After discharging the jury, the court returned to the prior conviction allegation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201cThe Court: [Defense counsel], since Mr. Mosby wants the court to hear that matter, or prepared to admit the prior\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: He\u2019s prepared to admit the prior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Mosby, can you understand that you are entitled\u2014you already waived having the jury determine the truth of this prior felony conviction of yours that\u2019s alleged. You are . . . entitled to have the court hear the matter, as well, to make a determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">\u201cDo you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-18\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-19\">\u201cThe Court: Do you waive and give up your right to have the court make that determination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-20\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The court then read the allegation that on May 5, 1993, defendant was convicted of drug possession in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11350; defendant admitted that he had been so convicted. Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of three years eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court\u2019s incomplete rights advisements rendered his admission of the prior conviction invalid. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It said: \u201cIt would frankly be absurd for this court to find that the defendant\u2019s admission of his prior conviction\u2014a prior plea of guilty\u2014was not voluntary and intelligent when he knew he did not have to admit but could have had a jury or court trial, had just participated in a jury trial where he had confronted witnesses and remained silent, and had experience in pleading guilty in the past, namely, the very conviction that he was now admitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Defendant petitioned for review in this court, arguing that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision created a conflict with other Court of Appeal opinions. We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">A. <em>Our Decision in In re Yurko, supra, 10 Cal.3d 857</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238, 243 and footnote 5 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709], the United States Supreme Court explained that a defendant seeking to <em>plead guilty </em>is denied due process under the federal Constitution unless the plea is voluntary and knowing. \u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination .... [Citation.] Second, is the right to trial by jury. [Citation.] Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 243.) In <em>Boykin, </em>the defendant pled guilty to five counts at a proceeding in which \u201cthe judge asked no questions of petitioner concerning his plea, and petitioner did not address the court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 239.) Given that truly \u201csilent record,\u201d the high court refused to presume a knowing and voluntary waiver of these constitutional rights. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 242, 243.) In the wake of <em>Boykin, </em>we held in <em>In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449] that \u201ceach of the three rights mentioned\u2014self-incrimination, confrontation, and jury trial\u2014 must be specifically and expressly enumerated for the benefit of and waived by the accused <em>prior </em>to acceptance of his <em>guilty plea.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 132, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Some five years later, in <em>In re Yurko, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 857, we adopted as a judicial rule of criminal procedure the requirement that the three <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>admonitions must also be given \u201cbefore a court accepts an accused\u2019s admission that he has suffered <em>prior felony convictions.\" (Id. </em>at p. 863, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Of note here is a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court that the federal Constitution\u2019s right to a jury trial does not extend to the factual determination of whether a defendant has suffered a prior conviction. <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466, 490 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348].) Nor does our state Constitution afford such a right. <em>(People v. Epps </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 19, 23 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 18 P.3d 2]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sengpadychith </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 316, 326 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 27 P.3d 739].)  That right is purely statutory in origin. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1025 [same jury that tried criminal charge must try prior conviction allegation], 1158; <em>People v. Epps, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 23.) When trial is required by statute, we shall assume for the purpose of this discussion that a defendant\u2019s due process trial rights, at least under our state Constitution, encompass the rights to remain silent and to confront witnesses. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) Here, defendant was advised only of his right to trial, which he waived before admitting the prior conviction. Thus, we must decide whether, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant\u2019s admission was voluntary and intelligent despite the trial court\u2019s failure to advise defendant of the rights to remain silent and to confront witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">B. <em>Standard of Review for Yurko Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">For nearly two decades after our decision in <em>In re Yurko, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 857, lack of express advisement, and waiver, of all three <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>rights was viewed as error requiring automatic reversal. (See <em>People v. Wright </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 487, 493-495 [233 Cal.Rptr. 69, 729 P.2d 260]; <em>In re Ibarra </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 277, 283, fn. 1 [193 Cal.Rptr. 538, 666 P.2d 980]; <em>In re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 315, 320-321 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684].) Then, in our 1992 decision in <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1132, we revisited the issue and came to a different conclusion. The pertinent inquiry, we said, was whether \u201cthe record affirmatively shows that [the admission] is voluntary and intelligent under the <em>totality of the circumstances'\u201d </em>(i<em>d. </em>at p. 1175 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315], italics added), applying \u201cthe test used to determine the validity of guilty pleas under the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Howard </em>explained; \u201c[T]he weight of authority today makes it abundantly clear that \u2018the California interpretation of <em>Boykin </em>announced in <em>Tahl </em>is not required by the federal Constitution . . . .\u2019 <em>(United States v. Pricepaul </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 540 F.2d 417, 424-425; [citation].)\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at pp. 1177-1178.) We also said that the United States Supreme Court \u201chas never read <em>Boykin </em>as requiring explicit admonitions on each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>three constitutional rights,\u201d but instead looks to the test set out in <em>North Carolina v. Alford, supra, </em>400 U.S. at page 32, which asks \u201c \u2018whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Howard, supra, </em>at p. 1177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">By adopting in <em>Howard </em>the federal constitutional test of whether under the totality of circumstances the defendant\u2019s admission is intelligent and voluntary, we rejected the rule that \u201cthe absence of express admonitions and waivers requires reversal regardless of prejudice.\u201d <em>(Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1178.) In replacing the old rule, the focus was shifted from whether the defendant received express rights advisements, and expressly waived them, to whether the defendant\u2019s admission was intelligent and voluntary because it was given with an understanding of the rights waived. After our <em>Howard </em>decision, an appellate court must go beyond the courtroom colloquy to assess a claim of <em>Yurko </em>error. (See <em>People v. Allen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 424, 438 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 981 P.2d 525].) Now, if the transcript does not reveal complete advisements and waivers, the reviewing court must examine the record of \u201cthe entire proceeding\u201d to assess whether the defendant\u2019s admission of the prior conviction was intelligent and voluntary in light of the totality of circumstances. <em>(Ibid.) </em>That approach\u2014reviewing the whole record, instead of just the record of the plea colloquy\u2014was recently endorsed by the United States Supreme Court in a case where a federal court failed, before accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, to advise the defendant of his right to counsel as required by rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Vonn </em>(2002) 535 U.S. 55, 76 [152 L.Ed.2d 90, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1055]; Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., rule 11(b)(1), 18 U.S.C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">A. <em>Application of Howard\u2019s Totality of the Circumstances Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">After our 1992 decision in <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1132, our Courts of Appeal have applied its \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d harmless error test to a variety of cases ranging from no advisements or waivers to incomplete advisements and waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">1. <em>Silent-record cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Truly silent-record cases are those that show no express advisement or waiver of the <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>rights before a defendant\u2019s admission of a prior conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stills </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1766, 1769-1771 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 486] [without any rights advisements or waivers the defendant was asked if he admitted priors]; see also <em>People v. Campbell </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 305, 309-310 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 315] [after conviction by jury on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the substantive offense, the defendant, who received no admonishments and gave no waivers, admitted each of four alleged priors]; <em>People v. Moore </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 411 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 286] [after conviction by jury on the substantive offense, the defendant, who received no admonishments and gave no waivers, admitted a prior conviction of assault with a deadly weapon and a prior prison term].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Although the record was not entirely silent in <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 169 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 650], it was so nearly silent as to be indistinguishable from the three cases just cited. A jury convicted the defendant of three crimes, but before the jury was excused the trial court took the defendant\u2019s admission to having two prior convictions and having served a prior prison term. The court did so without admonishing the defendant of his right to a trial on the priors at which he could confront witnesses and need not testify. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 177.) The court made a fleeting reference to \u201c \u2018whether or not you want a jury trial,\u2019 \u201d and without waiting for a response, the court then immediately asked the defendant, \u201c \u2018[W]ere you convicted?\u2019 \u201d The defendant admitted the priors. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under the totality of circumstances, the Court of Appeal in <em>Johnson </em>had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the defendant \u201cwas in fact aware of his right to a jury trial, his right to confront witnesses, and his right to remain silent, all of which he had just exercised in trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 178.) Nonetheless, absent <em>any </em>advisement of those rights, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was \u201cimpossible to determine\u201d whether the defendant \u201cnot only was aware of these rights, but was also prepared to waive them as a condition to admitting his prior offenses\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>thus rendering the defendant\u2019s admission of the priors neither intelligent nor voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In all of the cases just discussed a jury trial on a substantive offense preceded the defendants\u2019 admissions of prior convictions. These defendants were not told on the record of their right to trial to determine the truth of a prior conviction allegation. Nor did they expressly waive their right to trial. In such cases, in which the defendant was not advised of the right to have a trial on an alleged prior conviction, we cannot infer that in admitting the prior the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived that right as well as the associated rights to silence and confrontation of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">2. <em>Incomplete Boykin-Tahl advisements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In <em>People v. Carroll </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 892 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 868], the defendant was advised of his right to a jury trial on four prior conviction allegations. Trial on those priors was ordered bifurcated but eventually not held because a mistrial was declared after the jury could not reach a verdict on one of the charged crimes. At the defendant\u2019s second trial, there was no discussion of the priors until after the jury returned a guilty verdict. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>sentencing, defense counsel said his client was willing to admit two priors. The trial court asked the defendant if he wanted to waive his \u201c \u2018right to a trial\u2019 \u201d and admit \u201c \u2018those allegations are true?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 896.) The defendant replied, \u201c \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 897.) The Court of Appeal reversed, describing the record as \u201cdevoid of any meaningful effort to ensure the defendant was making an informed decision.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It acknowledged, but did not apply, the totality of the circumstances test of <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1132, which it said permitted finding error harmless \u201cwhere technical defects have occurred\u201d in the giving of <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>admonitions. <em>(Carroll, </em>at p. 897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Incomplete advisement of <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>rights also occurred in another Court of Appeal decision, <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1660 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 103]. At the conclusion of a jury trial on a drag offense, the defendant was advised of, and waived, the right to have a jury or court trial on a prior prison term allegation, but he was not told of, and did not waive, the rights to silence and to confront witnesses. On the record, the prosecutor told the defendant that at a trial on the prior conviction the People had the right to present evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1664, fn. 3.) On appeal, a majority of the court concluded that the defendant had not been \u201cadmonished as to his rights to confrontation and against self-incrimination explicitly, or in terms amounting to a reasonable substitute for an explicit admonition,\u201d thus requiring reversal and remand for retrial of the alleged prior. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1665.) The dissenting justice was of the view that having been told of the prosecution\u2019s right to present evidence the defendant was adequately advised of both the right to remain silent and to confront the witnesses against him. Having just participated in a jury trial, the dissenter concluded, the defendant \u201cunderstood\u201d \u201cwhat a trial meant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1666 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Woods (Fred), J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In <em>People v. Torres </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1083 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 77], also written by the author of <em>People v. Howard, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th 1660, the Court of Appeal reversed and remanded for retrial the findings that the defendant had suffered prior convictions and a prior prison term. In <em>Torres, </em>a jury had just convicted the defendant of several crimes when he was advised of his right to a jury trial on the alleged priors. The defendant admitted the priors and did so without admonishment, or waivers, of his rights to remain silent and to confront witnesses. The Court of Appeal concluded that without express advisements and waivers in the record, \u201cit is not possible here to find defendant\u2019s admissions\u201d were voluntary and intelligent. <em>(People v. Torres, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 1082.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1242 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 256], the same division of the Court of Appeal that had decided <em>People v. Torres, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 1073, reversed and remanded for retrial prior conviction allegations admitted by the defendant after advisement only of his right to a jury trial on those allegations. The Court of Appeal stated that \u201cnothing in the record suggests defendant\u2019s prior exposure to the criminal justice system afforded him notice of his right to confrontation and privilege against self-incrimination\u201d nor was he given any \u201cadvice from which [he] could infer\u201d that his right to confrontation, which he had experienced \u201cin the trial-in-chief\u2019 also applied to the trial of his priors. <em>(People v. Garcia, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">B. <em>This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">As mentioned earlier, in this case, immediately after the jury found defendant guilty of selling cocaine, defendant was told he had a right to a jury trial on the prior conviction allegation. After waiving that right, defendant admitted the truth of the allegation. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error by not telling him of his rights to remain silent and to confront witnesses. The Court of Appeal disagreed, stating; \u201cIt would exalt a formula (Boykin-Tahl) over the very standard that the formula is supposed to serve (that the plea is intelligent and voluntary) to suggest that a defendant, who has just finished a contested jury trial, is nonetheless unaware that he is surrendering the protections of such a trial\u201d when after being advised of the right to a trial on an alleged prior conviction the defendant waives trial and admits the prior. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In this case, the alleged prior conviction was a plea of guilty to possessing cocaine. Defendant argues that when he admitted the prior conviction\u2014 immediately after a jury found him guilty of selling cocaine\u2014he would not necessarily have understood that trial of the alleged prior would afford him the same rights that he had at the trial of the drug charge. We note that unlike a trial on a criminal charge, trial on a prior conviction is \u201csimple and straightforward,\u201d often involving only a presentation by the prosecution \u201cof a certified copy of the prior conviction along with the defendant\u2019s photograph [or] fingerprints\u201d and no defense evidence at all. <em>(People v. Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826, 838 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121].) Here, defendant, who was represented by counsel, had <em>just </em>undergone a jury trial at which he did not testify, although his codefendant did. Thus, he not only would have known of, but had just exercised, his right to remain silent at trial, forcing the prosecution to prove he had sold cocaine. And, because he had, through counsel, confronted witnesses at that immediately concluded trial, he would have understood that at a trial he had the right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>A review of the entire record also sheds light on defendant\u2019s understanding. For instance, \u201ca defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system\u201d is, as the United States Supreme Court has concluded, \u201crelevant to the question [of] whether he knowingly waived constitutional rights.\u201d <em>(Parke v. Raley </em>(1992) 506 U.S. 20, 37 [121 L.Ed.2d 391, 113 S.Ct. 517].) That is so because previous experience in the criminal justice system is relevant to a recidivist\u2019s \u201c \u2018knowledge and sophistication regarding his [legal] rights.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Parke, </em>at pp. 36-37; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dawson </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 193 F.3d 1107, 1110-1111 [the defendant, who had received full advisements in state court action two months before he entered a guilty plea on incomplete advisements in federal court, knowingly waived rights of confrontation and silence despite lack of advisement on either].) Here defendant\u2019s prior conviction was based on a plea of guilty, at which he would have received <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>advisements. As the Court of Appeal here concluded: \u201c[H]e knew he did not have to admit [the prior conviction] but could have had a jury or court trial, had just participated in a jury trial where he had confronted witnesses and remained silent, and had experience in pleading guilty in the past, namely, the very conviction that he was now admitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Under the totality of the circumstances, the Court of Appeal did not err in concluding that defendant voluntarily and intelligently admitted his prior conviction despite being advised of and having waived only his right to jury trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">George, C. J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-12\"> The allegation that defendant had been previously convicted of felony possession of a controlled substance, if found to be true, would render defendant ineligible for probation (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">When a defendant is alleged to have been previously convicted or to have previously served a term in state prison, trial on such an allegation becomes necessary only if the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>convicted of the charged offense. Thus, defendants who elect a jury trial routinely ask to bifurcate trial so that the case on the charged crime will be tried first. If the jury returns a guilty verdict on the charged crime, then the truth of the alleged prior will be tried, either to the jury before it is discharged or to the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> To the extent that language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at page 1248, suggests that the sophistication of the crime itself, apart from a defendant\u2019s actual knowledge or capacity to understand the constitutional rights in question, is relevant to a defendant\u2019s intelligent waiver of rights, it is disapproved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> We disapprove the following cases to the extent they are inconsistent with our holding: <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Buren </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 875 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 510]; <em>People v. Carroll, supra, 47 </em>Cal.App.4th 892; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 1242; <em>People v. Torres, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 1073; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 1660.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Ideally, a defendant admits a prior conviction only after receiving, and expressly waiving, standard advisements of the rights to a trial, to remain silent, and to confront adverse witnesses. <em>(Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 1178-1179 [\u201cexplicit admonitions and waivers still serve the purpose that originally led us to require them,\u201d and \u201care the only realistic means of assuring that the judge leaves a record adequate for review\u201d].) Although it may not be reversible error, failing to give full advisements and obtain express waivers carries a high cost. \u201cAs a consequence of the . . . failure to obtain valid admissions of readily provable serious priors, appeals are filed, briefs are prepared, appellate research and record review are conducted, argument is heard, appellate opinions are written, matters are remanded to trial courts, defendants are transported from prisons to county jails to courtrooms, attorneys are appointed to represent defendants, and prior allegations are belatedly relitigated.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1249 (cone. opn. of Woods (Fred), J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
