J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">This case concerns three brand-name labels (Napa Ridge, Napa Creek Winery, and Rutherford Vintners) appearing on wine bottled and marketed by petitioners Bronco Wine Company and Barrel Ten Quarter Circle, Inc. (hereafter Bronco). These wines are made not from grapes grown in Napa County, or in the Rutherford viticultural (wine grape growing) region of Napa County,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but instead from grapes grown in areas far from Napa, such as Stanislaus County and the environs of the City of Lodi\u2014areas where the cost of grapes, and often their perceived quality as well, is considerably lower. The challenged bottle labels have been approved by the federal agency charged by Congress with enforcing federal labeling law but violate a four-year-old California wine labeling statute, which requires that, when the word \u201cNapa\u201d (or any federally recognized viticultural region within Napa County) appears on a brand label, at least 75 percent of the grapes used to make that wine must be from Napa County. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25241 (hereafter section 25241).) We granted review to consider the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that federal law preempts the state law. We conclude that the state labeling statute is not preempted by federal law and hence that the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Bronco asserts that it specializes in \u201cpremium wines at affordable prices.\u201d Some of Bronco\u2019s wine is bottled at its facilities in Ceres (near Modesto, in Stanislaus County) and in Sonoma County; other Bronco wines are bottled by petitioner Barrel Ten Quarter Circle, Inc., at a recently completed facility in the City of Napa, in Napa County. The latter plant is capable of producing approximately 18 million 12-bottle cases per year\u2014output that would be more than double the current annual production of Napa-grown wines.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Bronco sells wines under approximately 30 labels or brand names. A representative label for the three challenged brand names (Napa Ridge, Napa Creek Winery, and Rutherford Vintners) is set forth in the appendix.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As can be seen, with regard to the representative Napa Ridge label, the label lists (in smaller lettering and below the brand name) the \u201cdesignation\u201d of the wine (the varietal name White Merlot), followed underneath by the \u201cappellation of origin\u201d\u2014the geographic source of the grapes (Lodi). The representative Napa Creek Winery label lists (in smaller lettering and below the brand name) the appellation of origin (Lodi), followed underneath by the varietal name (Chardonnay). The representative Rutherford Vintners label lists (in smaller lettering and below the brand name) the appellation of origin (Stanislaus County), followed underneath by the varietal name (Merlot). The \u201cback label\u201d of each states that the wine was \u201cvinted and bottled\u201d by the named winery in \u201cNapa, CA\u201d or in \u201cNapa, California.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, many of the Napa Ridge wines include the word \u201cNapa\u201d on bottleneck collars, and some include that word on branded corks.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Bronco acquired these three brand names, and the right to use these labels, from predecessor owners of wineries located in Napa County. The Napa Ridge brand, which Bronco acquired in January 2000 from Beringer Wine Estates for more than $40 million, had been in use since the early 1980s. The Napa Creek Winery brand, introduced in 1981, was acquired by Bronco in 1993. The Rutherford Vintners brand originated in the early 1970s, and was acquired by Bronco in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The prior owner of the Napa Ridge brand had used that name and label for wines made from grapes grown in California\u2019s Central Coast, North Coast, and Lodi appellation areas, as well as from Napa County. All of the wines previously marketed by the prior owner under the Napa Creek Winery brand and most wines previously marketed by the prior owner under the Rutherford Vintners brand had been made from Napa County grapes. Under Bronco\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ownership, all three of these brands have been used almost exclusively to sell wines made from grapes grown outside Napa County.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The bill that became section 25241 was introduced in the California Legislature in February 2000 (Assem. Bill No. 683 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.)). After receiving substantial public comment and holding hearings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Legislature found: \u201c(a)(1) . . . [F]or more than a century, Napa Valley and Napa County have been widely recognized for producing grapes and wine of the highest quality. Both consumers and the wine industry understand the name Napa County and the viticultural area appellations of origin contained within Napa County (collectively \u2018Napa appellations\u2019) as denoting that the wine was created with the distinctive grapes grown in Napa County. Q] (2) The Legislature finds, however, that certain producers are using Napa appellations on labels, on packaging materials, and in advertising for wines that are not made from grapes grown in Napa County, and that consumers are confused and deceived by these practices. [][] (3) The Legislature further finds that legislation is necessary to eliminate these misleading practices. It is the intent of the Legislature to assure consumers that the wines produced or sold in the state with brand names, packaging materials, or advertising referring to Napa appellations in fact qualify for the Napa County appellation of origin.\u201d (\u00a7 25241, subd. (a), added by Stats. 2000, ch. 831, \u00a7 l.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The resulting legislation, section 25241, provides in relevant part that no wine produced or marketed in California shall use a brand name or have a label bearing the word \u201cNapa\u201d (or any federally recognized viticultural area within Napa County) unless at least 75 percent of the grapes from which the wine was made were grown in Napa County. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>The legislative history discloses that section 25241 was designed to close what some legislators termed a \u201cloophole\u201d created by an exception in a federal wine labeling regulation. As discussed more fully below, federal law, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, or FAA Act (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.), enacted by Congress in 1935, bars misleading statements on wine labels <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 205(e)) and requires federal approval of each label via a certificate of label approval (hereafter sometimes COLA) before that label may be used in interstate or foreign commerce. A 1986 federal regulation, also described more fully below, designed to implement 27 United States Code section 205(e), generally prohibits the use of a label bearing a brand name that implies the wine was made from grapes grown in the area suggested by the brand, unless at least 75 percent of the grapes used to make the wine were in fact grown in that area (27 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.39(i)(l)). But a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d appended to the federal regulation exempts from the federal regulation\u2019s prohibition an otherwise misleading geographic brand name if the brand name was in use prior to July 7, 1986, <em>and </em>the front label also discloses the true geographic source of the grapes used to make the wine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>contained in the bottle. <em>(Id,., </em>\u00a7 4.39(i)(2)(ii).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, the state statute prohibits, with respect to Napa County, what the federal regulation\u2019s grandfather clause does not prohibit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">In late December 2000, shortly before section 25241 was to become effective, Bronco filed an original petition for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> seeking to prohibit respondents (the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and its then Interim Director, Manuel R. Espinoza, currently Jerry R. Jolly, Director) (hereafter the Department) from enforcing section 25241 with respect to Bronco\u2019s wines, on the ground that the. state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>statute to the extent it applies to wine destined for interstate or foreign commerce is preempted by the grandfather clause contained in the federal law. Bronco also claimed that the California statute violates the First Amendment, the commerce clause, and the takings clause of the United States Constitution. Intervener Napa Valley Vintners Association (NVVA) joined with the Department in defending the validity of the state enactment. The Court of Appeal issued an alternative writ and granted a stay of enforcement of section 25241. As noted above, that court ultimately concluded that section 25241 is preempted by federal law, and to date that statute has not been enforced. We granted review to address the preemption issue only.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">The basic rules of preemption are not in dispute: Under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2), Congress has the power to preempt state law concerning matters that lie within the authority of Congress. <em>(Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 363, 372 [147 L.Ed.2d 352, 120 S.Ct. 2288] <em>(Crosby).) </em>In determining whether federal law preempts state law, a court\u2019s task is to discern congressional intent. <em>(English </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 72, 78-79 [110 L.Ed.2d 65, 110 S.Ct. 2270].) Congress\u2019s express intent in this regard will be found when Congress explicitly states that it is preempting state authority. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 519, 525 [51 L.Ed.2d 604, 97 S.Ct. 1305] <em>(Jones).) </em>Congress\u2019s implied intent to preempt is found (i) when it is clear that Congress intended, by comprehensive legislation, to occupy the entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the states to supplement federal law <em>(Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 218, 230 [91 L.Ed. 1447, 67 S.Ct. 1146] <em>(Rice)); </em>(ii) when compliance with both federal and state regulations is an impossibility <em>(Florida Avocado Growers v. Paul </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 132, 142-143 [10 L.Ed.2d 248, 83 S.Ct. 1210] <em>(Florida Avocado)); </em>or (iii) when state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 52, 67 [85 L.Ed. 581, 61 S.Ct. 399] <em>(Hines); </em>see also <em>Crosby, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 373; <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 25, 31 [134 L.Ed.2d 237, 116 S.Ct. 1103] <em>(Barnett Bank); Lawrence County </em>v. <em>Lead-Deadwood School Dist. </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 256, 260 [83 L.Ed.2d 635, 105 S.Ct. 695] <em>(Lawrence County); Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 691, 699 [81 L.Ed.2d 580, 104 S.Ct. 2694]; see also <em>Dowhal </em>v. <em>SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 910, 923-924 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 88 P.3d 1] <em>(Dowhal).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">In the present case, it is clear that Congress has not expressly preempted state authority with respect to the regulation of wine generally, or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>respect to wine labels in particular, and Bronco does not contend otherwise. Neither does Bronco contend that this is a case in which Congress has occupied the field and thus impliedly preempted the state statute here at issue. Nor does Bronco contend that implied preemption is shown because compliance with both federal and state regulations is impossible; as Bronco concedes, it can comply with the stricter state law and simultaneously comply with federal law. Instead, Bronco asserts that we should find implied preemption in this case because section 25241 stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 910, 929, 935 [state law warnings concerning nicotine frustrate the purposes of the federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act and corresponding federal regulations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">As we shall explain, we disagree that section 25241 is impliedly preempted by federal law. In reaching this conclusion we first address Bronco\u2019s assertion that a presumption against preemption does not apply in this matter. (See <em>post, </em>pt. II.B.l.) After extensively reviewing the history of state regulation of beverage and wine labels prior to Congress\u2019s adoption of the FAA Act in 1935\u2014a history that reveals substantial state involvement and very little federal regulation\u2014we conclude that a presumption against preemption does indeed apply in this case. Next, we address the intent of Congress in enacting the FAA Act in 1935. (See <em>post, </em>pt. II.C.l.) The legislative history of that enactment reveals congressional intent, among other things, (i) to prevent the deception or misleading of consumers related to the labeling of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and (ii) to supplement\u2014but not supplant\u2014existing state regulation of the industry. We next consider the intent of the responsible federal regulatory agency vis-\u00e1-vis state regulation of wine brand labeling, as reflected in regulations and comments set out in the Federal Register. (See <em>post, </em>pt. H.C.2.) As we explain, the record reveals that the federal regulatory agency has long operated on the understanding that states may and would continue to impose their own stricter wine labeling regulations. Finally, we address the substantive issue of implied preemption of the particular state legislation at issue and conclude that the California statute in question does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. (See <em>post, </em>pt. HD.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">The party who claims that a state statute is preempted by federal law bears the burden of demonstrating preemption. (See, e.g., <em>McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 422 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>1189], and cases cited.)  An important corollary of this rule, often noted and applied by the United States Supreme Court, is that <em>\u201c[wjhen Congress legislates in a field traditionally occupied by the States, \u2018we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' \" (California v. ARC America Corp. </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 93, 101 [104 L.Ed.2d 86, 109 S.Ct. 1661], italics added <em>(ARC America Corp.), </em>quoting <em>Rice, supra, </em>331 U.S. 218, 230; see also, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Locke </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 89, 107-108 [146 L.Ed.2d 69, 120 S.Ct. 1135] <em>(Locke); Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 470, 485 [135 L.Ed.2d 700, 116 S.Ct. 2240] <em>(Medtronic) </em>[presumption applies both to the existence of preemption and the scope of preemption]; <em>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 151, 157 [55 L.Ed.2d 179, 98 S.Ct. 988] <em>(Ray); Jones, supra, </em>430 U.S. 519, 525; <em>Florida Avocado, supra, </em>373 U.S. 132, 146; <em>Allen-Bradley Local v.

Jones </em>(1912) 225 U.S. 501, 533 [56 L.Ed. 1182, 32 S.Ct. 715] <em>(Savage); Reid v. Colorado </em>(1902) 187 U.S. 137, 148 [47 L.Ed. 108, 23 S.Ct. 92].) As explained in <em>Jones, supra, </em>430 U.S. 519, 525, this venerable presumption \u201cprovides assurance that \u2018the federal-state balance,\u2019 . . . will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress or unnecessarily by the courts.\u201d (Citation omitted; see <em>Olszewski v. Scripps Health </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 815 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 69 P.3d 927] <em>(Olszewski).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The Department and the NVVA assert that the state regulation at issue in this case directly implicates the traditional police powers of the states to protect consumers from deception in the marketing of food and beverages and to safeguard the integrity\u2014and worldwide market\u2014of a vital California industry. (See, e.g., <em>Florida Avocado, supra, </em>373 U.S. 132, 146 [state police powers properly are employed both to protect consumers\u2019 health and to \u201cprevent the deception of consumers\u201d]; <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 137, 143 [25 L.Ed.2d 174, 90 S.Ct. 844] [recognizing a state\u2019s interest in protecting its reputation as a reliable source of authentic, high-quality goods in all markets where its goods compete].) Indeed, we observed as much concerning the California wine industry more than 100 years ago. <em>(Ex parte Kohler </em>(1887) 74 Cal. 38, 42-43 [15 P. 436] [state wine labeling statute, designed to protect the health of consumers and the integrity of the wine industry, was a proper exercise of the police power].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Bronco and amici curiae on its behalf, Abundance Vineyards et alia.,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> assert, however, that no presumption against preemption applies in this case because there is no evidence that states traditionally have exercised their police powers to regulate the labeling of wine.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, Bronco argues that prior to the August 1935 enactment of the FAA Act, 27 United States Code section 201 et seq., federal regulation of wine labeling was \u201cwell-established,\u201d whereas the activity of the states in that enterprise was \u201climited.\u201d Bronco maintains that \u201calthough the states have played a limited role in regulating wine labeling over the past century, the federal government\u2019s presence in that field . . . would negate the application of any presumption against preemption in this case.\u201d Amici curiae assert, similarly and more emphatically, that prior to enactment of the FAA Act in August 1935 \u201cstate and local authorities had exercised control over the <em>distribution </em>and <em>sale </em>of liquor\u201d but that \u201cit was the federal government that first comprehensively regulated the packaging and labeling\u201d of wine.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The Department and the NVVA, on the other hand, point to early California statutes addressing wine labeling, isolated statements in treatises and legal articles, and statements in congressional reports and debates suggesting an intent by Congress in 1935 that the FAA Act, including 27 United States Code section 205(e) and the regulations that would be expected to flow therefrom, would supplement state regulation of wine labeling but not preempt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Prior to oral argument we solicited supplemental briefing from the parties, asking them to address the effect, if any, of numerous additional state statutes and regulations disclosed in the course of our review of this case. Having considered those materials and the parties\u2019 supplemental briefs, we conclude below that the historic record amply supports the conclusion that a presumption against preemption applies in this case because the protection of consumers from potentially misleading brand names and labels of food and beverages in general, and wine in particular, is a subject that traditionally has been regulated by the states.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">1. <em>Regulation of wine labels prior to adoption of the FAA Act in August 1935</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Prior to the 20th century, federal legislation relating to wine and alcohol focused essentially upon revenue collection\u2014specifically, enforcement of federal tax laws. (See Byse, <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Before Repeal </em>(1940) 7 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 543, 552, fns. 57 &amp; 58 <em>(Alcoholic Beverage Control Before Repeal).) </em>By contrast, as disclosed below, widespread legislation enacted by states in the mid to late 19th century, and continuing through adoption of the FAA Act in August 1935, focused upon the substantive public problems of \u201cadulteration\u201d and \u201cmisbranding\u201d (or \u201cmislabeling\u201d) of wines and alcohol. This historic record supports the view that prior to adoption of the federal act in 1935, states vigorously exercised their police powers to regulate wine labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">a. <em>The emergence of state \u201cpure food\u201d and labeling statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">During the latter half of the 19th century, awareness gradually increased throughout the nation concerning a combination of related problems in the supply of food and beverages. Some food and beverage products were mere imitations or dilutions of what they purported to be; other products, subject to spoilage, were \u201cadulterated\u201d by a \u201csoaring employment of chemical preservatives.\u201d (Young, Pure Food (1989) p. 126.) Many of these preservatives\u2014such</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>as salicylic acid, employed as a preservative in wine <em>(id., </em>at p. 105)\u2014were used in excessive quantities dangerous to health. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 110, 112, 126.) As a result, it was found that more than \u201c73 per cent of the milk in Buffalo [New York] was watered, 69 of 171 samples of ground coffee collected in New York were adulterated, 71 percent of the olive oils examined in New York and Massachusetts were mixed with cotton seed oil which had been shipped from the United States and returned as \u2018olive oil\u2019 [, and] [f]orty-six percent of candy samples collected in Boston contained mineral pigments, chiefly lead chromate.\u201d (Hart, <em>A History of the Adulteration of Food Before 1906 </em>(1952) 7 Food Drug Cosm. LJ. 5, 21); see also McCumber, <em>The Alarming Adulteration of Food and Drugs </em>(Jan. 5, 1905) The Independent, 28, 29-31 [listing common adulterations of various products].) Wines too were subject to abuses. Some were \u201cmade from cheap substances and then doctored up.\u201d (Regier, <em>The Struggle for Federal Food and Drugs Legislation </em>(1933) 1 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 3, 8.) Others were mislabeled as to place of origin. (Carosso, The California Wine Industry: A Study of the Formative Years (1951) p. 25 (California Wine Industry); see also Fanshawe, Liquor Legislation in the United States and Canada (1892) p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">In response to the general threat to the food and beverage supply, many if not most states exercised their traditional police powers to regulate generally the marketing of impure or deceptively labeled foods and beverages.

An Ohio statute, enacted in 1884, made it illegal to manufacture or sell any food (defined to include drink) \u201cif by any means it is made to appear better or of greater value than it really is,\u201d or if it contained any impure substance not \u201cdistinctly labeled\u201d as such. (1884 Ohio Laws, \u00a7 3, p. 67; 1890 Ohio Laws, \u00a7 3, p. 248.) Substantially similar labeling statutes were enacted in Indiana, Massachusetts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Washington. (1899 Ind.

Laws, ch. 338), subsequently amended in 1903 and 1905, prohibited \u201cadulterated or misbranded food.\u201d The statute defined as \u201cmisbranded\u201d\u2014and illegal\u2014any food or beverage \u201cpackage ... or label\u201d that bore \u201cany statement regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein, which statement [is] false or misleading in any particular, or if the same is <em>falsely branded as to the state or territory in which it is manufactured or produced </em>(1903 N.Y.

But in the face of rampant deception in the labeling of wines\u2014 including the bottling of California wines under false foreign labels, and the bottling of inferior foreign wines under California labels (Cal.

(See Standards of Purity for Food Products (June 26, 1906) Circular No. 19, reprinted in Westervelt, American Pure Food and Drug Laws (1912) pp. 61, 78-79 (American Pure Food and Drug Laws); F.I.D.

As explained below, under federal law the cited food standards (including the wine standards) were merely advisory, and not legally binding, and with respect to the cited Food Inspection Decisions, the first was nonbinding and the second, even if binding, did not demonstrate federal control over the labeling of wines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The cited food standards had been created at the behest of Congress, which in 1902 and 1903 directed the Secretary of Agriculture to undertake numerous projects, including one \u201cto establish standards for purity of food products and determine what are regarded as adulterations therein, <em>for the guidance of the officials of the various States </em>and of the courts of justice . . . .\u201d (Pub.L. No. 57-1008 (Mar. 3, 1903) 32 Stat. 1147, 1158, italics added; see also Pub.L. No. 57-139 (June 3, 1902) 32 Stat. 286, 296.) The resulting detailed food standards addressed more than 200 categories of food items, including salted meats, oatmeal, lemon and vanilla extracts, olive oil, coffee, and\u2014in part n.F.a.3 of the secretary\u2019s food standards\u2014what Bronco characterizes as \u201cdetailed and comprehensive\u201d standards for wine, dry wine, fortified dry wine, sweet wine, fortified sweet wine, sparkling wine, modified wine (a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>low-alcohol product made by the addition of sugar), and raisin wine (a product made from pomace\u2014dried, evaporated, or previously crushed grapes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Contrary to Bronco\u2019s suggestions and representations, the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s food standards (and hence the wine standards contained therein) were not enforceable under the 1906 federal Pure Food and Drugs Act (which, as noted, required that enforcing regulations be adopted by <em>all three </em>named secretaries), or indeed under <em>federal </em>law at all. (See <em>United States v. St. Louis Coffee &amp; Spice Mills </em>(E.D.Mo. 1909) 189 F. 191 [finding the food standards relating to vanilla extract unenforceable under the 1906 Act].) In view of the 1906 Act\u2019s \u201cthree secretaries\u201d requirements for regulations and the resulting case law, the food standards proclaimed by the Secretary of Agriculture acting alone have been described by authoritative commentators as merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and as being \u201cfor the guidance of officials and the trade but <em>not having the force and effect of [federal] law.\u201d </em>(Salthe, <em>State Food, Drug and Cosmetic Legislation and its Administration </em>(1939) 6 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 165, 167, italics added; see also Lee, <em>Legislative and Interpretative Regulations </em>(1940) 29 Geo. L.J. 1, 4-17 <em>(Interpretative Regulations) </em>[noting that despite many congressional attempts in the course of three decades to make the food standards enforceable, manufacturers \u201c \u2018could take \u2019em or leave \u2019em\u2019 without legal consequences\u201d under <em>federal </em>law]; <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Before Repeal, supra, 1 </em>Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 544, 553; cf. <em>Administration of the Federal Food and Drugs Act, supra, </em>1 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 16, 32, fn. 71.) Indeed, even the treatise upon which Bronco relies concurred on this point, characterizing those same food standards as \u201cnot controlling\u201d under federal law. (American Pure Food and Drug Laws, <em>supra, </em>at p. 60.) In view of this history, we must reject Bronco\u2019s suggestion that the cited food standards, and the wine standards contained therein, constituted enforceable federal regulations under the 1906 Act or were otherwise enforceable as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">We reach similar conclusions with respect to the two Food Inspection Decisions cited by Bronco, issued in 1909 and 1910, respectively. The first Food Inspection Decision, approved by the Secretary of Agriculture acting alone, stated that Missouri and Ohio wines, which typically were produced by adding substantial amounts of sugar, \u201cwould properly be called a \u2018sugar wine\u2019 \u201d\u2014and that when made by the mixture of pomace, sugar, water, colorings and preservatives, such products should be called \u201c \u2018imitation wine.\u2019 \u201d (F.I.D. No. 109, reprinted in American Pure Food and Drug Laws, <em>supra, </em>at p. 212.) The second cited Food Inspection Decision, issued under the signatures of the three department secretaries, essentially retreated from and modified the first and stated that in light of (and apparently in deference to) the fairly lax Ohio wine statute (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 24), which had long permitted the use of sugar in wine production, such \u201csugared\u201d wines properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>could be called \u201c \u2018Ohio Wine,\u2019 or \u2018Missouri Wine,\u2019 respectively, without further qualification.\u201d (F.I.D. No. 120, reprinted in American Pure Food and Drug Laws, <em>supra, </em>at p. 213.) Moreover, the decision stated, Ohio and Missouri imitation wines could be labeled as \u201c \u2018Ohio Pomace Wine,\u2019 or \u2018Missouri Pomace Wine.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">These decisions reveal that the federal agency, far from exercising federal authority to control state practices by requiring adherence to the \u201cdetailed and comprehensive\u201d wine provisions of the food standards cited by Bronco, instead completely ignored those federal standards and, in the second decision, actually <em>deferred </em>to the applicable state wine statute, which in turn codified long-standing and lenient regional winemaking practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In any event, contrary to Bronco\u2019s suggestion that these Food Inspection Decisions evinced federal control, the first cited decision, No. 109 (approved by the Secretary of Agriculture acting alone), did not constitute a regulation under the 1906 Act and was merely advisory.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Because the second cited Food Inspection Decision, No. 120, was signed by all three secretaries it arguably qualified as an enforceable federal regulation under the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act. (See American Pure Food and Drug Laws, <em>supra, </em>at p. 17.) As noted above, however, in substance this assumed regulation merely acquiesced in and adopted fairly lax state (Ohio) law. It does not, therefore, support Bronco\u2019s implicit argument that federal regulatory authorities during this period exercised power to control wine labels in a manner different from that of the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">For these reasons we reject Bronco\u2019s suggestion that the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s food standards, including the detailed and comprehensive wine standards, constituted enforceable federal law, that Food Inspection Decision No. 109 constituted an enforceable federal wine labeling regulation, or that Food Inspection Decisi\u00f3n No. 120 evinced anything more than federal acquiescence in state law. Based upon the material cited to us, we conclude that whatever federal regulation of wine labeling existed between the first decade of the 20th century and the advent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>of Prohibition was achieved only indirectly, on a case-by-case basis, through prosecutions under the general misbranding provisions of the 1906 federal Pure Food and Drugs Act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>That </em>relatively limited federal activity, however, neither erased nor eclipsed the previous quarter-century of state regulation described above. <em>(Ante, </em>pt. II.B.1.a. &amp; b.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Moreover, at the same time federal activity in this area was commencing, state activity was continuing and at least keeping pace. By 1906, nearly all of the states had exercised their traditional police powers to enact pure food and beverage laws, almost all of which covered drinks, including wine.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Even more importantly, as explained below, within a few years of 1906 the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s food standards (including the detailed and comprehensive wine standards)\u2014although remaining merely advisory and unenforceable under <em>federal </em>law\u2014specifically were adopted as part of the general food laws of most states (including California). The perhaps ironic result was that the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s wine standards were to become enforceable substantive law in most states under <em>state </em>law, even while they remained unenforceable as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">d. <em>Relevant state law in the early 20th century: Adoption of California\u2019s place\u2014name wine statute; California\u2019s Pure Foods Act and adoption of the food standards, including the wine standards; and corresponding labeling regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Nothing in the 1906 federal Pure Food and Drugs Act implied that the existing and continuing state regulation of the misbranding of food and beverages was preempted by that federal legislation. Indeed, the act \u201cdisclose[d] very clearly that it [was] not intended to trench upon the powers of the states in any respect.\u201d <em>(Cleveland Macaroni Co. v.

The statute provided for \u201cpure\u201d California wines to be labeled with the \u201cprefix \u2018Cal\u2019 or \u2018Cala\u2019... as for example, \u2018Calclaret,\u2019 \u2018Calburgundy,\u2019 \u2018Calariesling,\u2019 etc., . . .\u201d (Stats. 1907, ch. 104, \u00a7 1, pp. 127-128.) The statute further prohibited the use of any such label on wines other than pure California wines. It barred \u201clabeling any vessel, bottle, ... or package containing any liquid other than pure wine of California manufacture, ... or any paper or brand in similitude or resemblance thereof, or any paper or brand of such form and appearance as to be calculated to mislead or deceive any unwary person or cause him to suppose the contents thereof to be pure wine of California manufacture, origin or production . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Following passage of the 1906 federal Pure Food and Drugs Act, states left in place or expanded (or in other instances enacted for the first time) then-own statutes to address the problems of adulteration, misbranding, and mislabeling of food and beverages. (See generally American Pure Food and Drug Laws, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 260-1450; <em>Proposed Food and Drugs Act, supra, </em>1 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 74, 75 &amp; fn. 4.) California, for its part, adopted such a general scheme in March 1907, addressing the problem of \u201cadulterated, mislabeled or misbranded food, or liquor.\u201d (Stats. 1907, ch. 181, \u00a7 1, p. 208; 1907 Pure Foods Act or 1907 State Act.) That statute\u2014like those of many other states\u2014specifically adopted under <em>state </em>law the food standards (including the wine standards) that had been formulated by the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture, but which, as described above, were unenforceable under <em>federal </em>law. (Stats. 1907, ch. 181, \u00a7 3, p. 209.) Further going beyond anything set forth in the federal law, the state statute also made it illegal to, among other things, <em>\u2018falsely </em>brand[]\u201d any food or liquor concerning the \u201ccounty; . . . <em>city, town, </em>[or] <em>state ... in which it is manufactured, or </em>produced\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 5, p. 210, italics added),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and provided that \u201c[flood and liquor shall be deemed <em>mislabeled or misbranded </em>within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>meaning of this act .

During this same period\u2014and indeed, until repeal of the 1906 federal Pure Food and Drugs Act in 1938\u2014the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s food standards remained unenforceable under federal law despite periodic attempts to provide otherwise.

Dept. of Pub. Health, Bur. of Food and Drug Inspection, Regs, adopted Dec. 31, 1934, amended April 13, 1935, as printed Jan. 18, 1936 (1934 Regulations).) A preamble set forth in broad terms the purpose and scope of the regulations. The stated goal was to protect both \u201cthe consuming public\u201d and \u201cthe wine industry as a whole.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. I.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To this end, the regulations adopted specific chemical definitions for dry red wines, dry white wines, and sweet wines <em>(id., </em>at pp. 1-2), similar in substance to the standards incorporated into the state\u2019s 1907 Pure Foods Act, and which, as explained <em>ante, </em>part II.B.l.d, had by then been in place in California (and numerous other states) for nearly 30 years. The 1934 Regulations also established strict and detailed labeling requirements for sparkling and artificially carbonated wines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>(Regs., at p. 2)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and for still wines <em>(id., </em>at pp. 2-3). In the latter respect, the regulations addressed the decades-old problem of California wines being labeled with foreign place names such as \u201cBurgundy.\u201d The state regulations allowed the unqualified use of that name and similar French place names \u201conly [for] products from France,\u201d and provided that a wine would be \u201cregarded as <em>misbranded!'\u2019 </em>(and hence in violation of the state\u2019s 1907 Act and ensuing regulations described <em>ante, </em>pt. II.B.l.d.) if the label read \u201cBurgundy\u201d (or any other foreign place name) and the wine was not produced there, unless the label also \u201cdisplayed with prominence equal to that\u201d of the foreign place name, \u201cthe name of the state or country where the wine is produced.\u201d (1934 Regs., at p. 2, italics added.)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Bronco insists that these various state regulations, viewed as a whole, \u201cdid not represent any innovation by California\u201d and that \u201csimilar, albeit more detailed and comprehensive . . . standards already had been adopted nearly thirty years before by federal regulators.\u201d As explained <em>ante, </em>part II.B.l.c, however, the historic record does not support Bronco\u2019s claim. The standards to which Bronco refers never were enforceable under federal law, but in fact, by 1907, they had become part of the substantive (and enforceable) law of California\u2014and within a short time, of most other states as well. In other words, the touted innovation (enforceable wine labeling standards) was accomplished by California and other states, and not by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">f. <em>Initial (and short-lived) federal wine labeling regulations issued by the Federal Alcohol Control Administration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">As Bronco emphasizes, a few months after adoption of the 1934 California wine labeling regulations, federal wine labeling regulations (which, as explained below, proved to be short-lived and never became effective) were for the first time adopted in late March 1935 by the recently created Federal Alcohol Control Administration (FAC Administration), which had been established by executive order under the National Industrial Recovery Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 703). (See Harrison &amp; Lane, After Repeal (1936) p. 24 (After Repeal).) The FAC Administration\u2019s regulations, like the numerous similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>state food and beverage regulations that preceded them, were directed against, among other things, \u201cmisbranding\u201d\u2014the false or misleading labeling of alcoholic beverages. (See FAC Admin., Misbranding Regs., Series 7, Regs. Relating to the Labeling of Wine (Mar. 25, 1935) \u00a7 3(b)(3) (Misbranding Regulations) [a wine bottle is misbranded if its label \u201ctends to create a misleading impression of the wine\u201d]; see generally O\u2019Neill, <em>Federal Activity in Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1940) 7 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 570, 572; After Repeal, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 27-29.) Nowhere in these nascent federal regulations was there any suggestion that they preempted stricter state regulations. In any event, within two months of their adoption and prior to their effective date (see Misbranding Regs., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1(a)(3)), the federal regulations became unenforceable in late May 1935 after the United States Supreme Court invalidated as unconstitutional similar \u201cfair competition\u201d codes adopted under the National Industrial Recovery Act. <em>(Schechter Corp. v. United States </em>(1935) 295 U.S. 495, 541-542 [79 L.Ed. 1570, 55 S.Ct. 837].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">g. <em>Continuing regulation by other states</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Despite the initial failure of federal regulation of wine labels, regulation by the states continued in and through 1935. In addition to California\u2019s then long-established general food and beverage regulations, and its then recent specific wine regulations, described <em>ante, </em>part H.B.l.d-e, the Ohio and Oregon wine labeling statutes, described above <em>(ante, </em>fus. 24 &amp; 26), still were in effect<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and most other states had food and beverage statutes, the majority of which regulated mislabeling or misbranding of beverages, including wine. As already explained, many of those statutes adopted specific and comprehensive wine standards that were enforceable only under state, and not federal, law\u2014and as of 1935, many had been revised specifically to bar misrepresentations on labels concerning the place of manufacture or production.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>2. <em>Propriety of imposing a presumption against preemption in this case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">In light of the history set forth above, we disagree with Bronco\u2019s assertion, advanced in its original brief in this court, that federal regulation of wine labeling prior to Congress\u2019s adoption of the FAA Act in August 1935 was \u201cwell established,\u201d and that \u201c[b]y contrast, the states\u2019 regulation of wine labeling . . . ranged from limited to none.\u201d Nor do we agree with the accusation of amici curiae Abundance Vineyards et al. that the Department and the NVVA have \u201csuggested, <em>misleadingly, </em>that the States, and not the Federal government, historically played the dominant role in the regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry before enactment of the FAA Act.\u201d (Italics added.) Based upon our review of the relevant history, we conclude that from the mid to late 19th century until shortly after the repeal of Prohibition, the states\u2019 exercise of their traditional police power to regulate the labeling of food\u2014including wine and other alcoholic beverages\u2014was both extensive and dominant. This historic evidence demonstrates that when, as described below, Congress finally entered the specific field of wine label regulation in August 1935 by enacting the FAA Act, under which the federal regulation here at issue was promulgated, Congress was legislating in a field \u201ctraditionally regulated by the States.\u201d <em>(ARC America Corp., supra, </em>490 U.S. 93, 101, and cases cited.)<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Accordingly, a strong presumption against preemption applies, and a court should not find that the traditional police powers of the states to regulate wine labels (in order to prevent the deception of consumers) are superseded unless it is clear and manifest that Congress intended to preempt state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>We turn now to consider whether, as Bronco claims, there was, at the time of the enactment of the FAA Act or thereafter, a clear and manifest intent on the part of Congress to preempt wine labeling regulation by the states such as is found in section 25241. We find no such intent. We thereafter consider whether, as Bronco claims, section 25241 is <em>impliedly </em>preempted by federal law because it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>(Hines, supra, </em>312-U.S. 52, 67.) As we explain, we find no such implied preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">1. <em>Whether Congress, when it enacted the FAA Act in 1935, intended to preempt state wine labeling regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">As explained below, contrary to Bronco\u2019s assertions the history of the 1935 FAA Act discloses no intent on the part of Congress to supplant or preempt state efforts to regulate wine labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">In late August 1935, Congress replaced the defunct FAC Administration with the Federal Alcohol Administration Act. (Pub.L. No. 74-401 (Aug. 29, 1935) 49 Stat. 977, presently 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.) The essential aspects of the FAA Act exist today in substantially unamended form and remain the basis for federal regulation of wine labeling. (See Benson, <em>Regulation of American Wine Labeling: In Vino Veritas? </em>(1978) 11 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 115, 154 et seq. <em>(Regulation of American Wine Labeling).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Substantively, the FAA Act in large measure emulated the main aspects of the invalidated FAC Administration. (After Repeal, <em>supra, </em>at p. 32; <em>Regulation of American Wine Labeling, supra, </em>11 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 115, 165.) The FAA Act makes it illegal for any person to produce, sell, or ship wine in interstate or foreign commerce unless that person is licensed to do so by the Secretary of the Treasury.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(a) &amp; (b).) Title 27 United States Code section 205(e)\u2014the primary federal statutory provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>for present purposes\u2014directs the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate such regulations \u201cwith respect to packaging, marking, branding, and <em>labeling </em>... (1) <em>as will prohibit deception of the consumer with respect to [ialcoholic </em>beverage] <em>products . . . ; </em>[and] (2) <em>as will provide the consumer with adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) To enforce these requirements, this section of the FAA Act also requires that any person who sells or ships wine in interstate or foreign commerce first obtain from the Secretary of the Treasury (or his or her designee) a certificate of label approval, or COLA, for each wine, and directs that no wine may be shipped or sold in interstate commerce unless it bears a label that has been reviewed and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury through issuance of a COLA. Finally, the section further provides that no wine label may be removed or altered \u201cexcept as authorized by Federal law\u201d or except pursuant to federal regulations \u201cauthorizing relabeling for purposes of compliance with the requirements of this subsection or of State law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Testifying in support of the legislation that became the FAA Act, Joseph H. Choate, former Chairman of the FAC Administration, explained that the goal was to continue the work of the recently invalidated FAC Administration. Adverting to the regulations mentioned above that recently had been adopted by the FAC Administration <em>(ante, </em>pt. H.B.l.f.), Mr. Choate explained that the purpose of those regulations\u2014and of the new FAA Act\u2014was to \u201cto provide such regulations, not laid down in statute, so as to be inflexible, but laid down under the guidance of Congress, under general principles, by a body which could change them as changes were found necessary, [f] <em>These regulations were intended to insure that the purchaser should get what he thought he was getting, that the representations both on labels and in advertising should be honest and straightforward and truthful. . . . [The </em>consumer] <em>should be told what was in the bottle, and all the important factors which were of interest to him about what was in the bottle.\u201d </em>(Hearings before House Com. on Ways and Means on H.R. No. 8539, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 10 (1935), testimony of Joseph H. Choate, italics added.) Similarly, Representative Thomas Cullen of New York, the author of the bill that became the FAA Act (see 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11713 et seq.), promoting his legislation on the floor of the House, asserted that the proposed bill was necessary in order to \u201cdo something to prevent the unfair trade activities of those in the industry who chisel and take advantage of the ignorance of the consumer by dishonest labeling . . . .\u201d (Remarks of Rep. Cullen on H.R. No. 8539, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11714; see generally <em>Regulation of American Wine Labeling, supra, </em>11 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 115, 165-167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">As with the 1906 federal Pure Food and Drugs Act, and by contrast to other legislation passed only days prior to adoption of the FAA Act in August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>1935,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> nothing in the body of the FAA Act reveals congressional intent to supersede concurrent (or more stringent) regulation of wine labeling by the states under their traditional police powers. As already explained, at the time Congress adopted the FAA Act in August 1935, the states, led by California (see <em>ante, </em>pt. ILB.l.d. &amp; e.), were continuing to exercise their traditional police powers in this area. (See <em>ante, </em>pt. II.B.l.g., describing the then extant statutes of various states.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Consistently with this history and contemporaneous practice, the bill\u2019s author, Representative Cullen, while promoting the bill embodying the FAA Act on the floor of the House, emphasized the cooperative, as opposed to preemptive, nature of the federal legislation. He asserted: \u201c[W]e must do something to <em>supplement </em>legislation by the States to carry out their own policies. The liquor industry is too big and the constitutional and practical limitations on the States are so considerable that <em>they alone cannot do the whole job.\u201d </em>(Remarks of Rep. Cullen on H.R. No. 8539, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11714, italics added; accord, H.R. Rep. No. 1542, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2-3 (1935).)<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Representative Cullen also assured the House that by enactment of the bill, \u201c[n]o power is taken away from the States to provide such safeguards as they deem best for their own protection.\u201d (79 Cong. Rec., <em>supra, </em>11174.)<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Based upon this legislative history, and in light of the backdrop against which Congress acted\u2014the prior decades of state legislation regulating the labeling or \u201cmisbranding\u201d of wine as a general food and beverage product, or of wine specifically\u2014we conclude that Bronco has failed to establish that Congress, at the time it enacted the FAA Act, acted with the \u201cclear or manifest\u201d purpose of preempting state statutes regulating wine labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">2. <em>Post-1935 congressional and regulatory agency intent to preempt state wine label regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Bronco further suggests that <em>subsequent </em>to the enactment of 27 United States Code section 205(e) in August 1935 and the adoption, by agencies within the Department of the Treasury, of implementing regulations, both Congress and the federal regulators manifested intent that the federal wine labeling regulations would preempt more stringent state wine labeling regulations. Applying again, as we must, a presumption against preemption in this context, we inquire whether Congress or the regulatory arm established within the Department of the Treasury evinced \u00e1 clear and manifest intent to preempt state wine labeling regulations such as California\u2019s section 25241. In so doing, we keep in mind the entire history of state regulation of wine labeling and the history and language of the FAA Act described above. As explained below, after reviewing (i) the early federal regulations and early state regulations that imposed standards higher than the federal regulations, (ii) subsequent federal regulations and pronouncements recognizing the applicability of state labeling law, and state wine regulations enacted in the mid-1970s (especially certain Oregon regulations, one of which is substantively similar to the challenged section 25241), and (iii) a 1988 amendment to the FAA Act, concerning health warnings on alcoholic beverages, we continue to find no evidence of any clear or manifest intent on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Congress or the responsible federal agency to preempt state wine labeling regulation such as section 25241. Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that the federal agency has long contemplated or at least acquiesced in concurrent and stricter state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">a. <em>Federal and California regulations issued after passage of the FAA Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">As noted above, prior to adoption of the FAA Act, California had in place, by December 1934, specific and detailed wine regulations restricting, among other things, the use of place names on wine labels. (See <em>ante, </em>pt. ILB.l.e.) In bulletins and reports issued in the years immediately thereafter, the California Department of Public Health touted its enforcement of those state regulations, which it described as requiring the \u201chonest labeling of wines.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">In late December 1935, four months after adoption of the FAA Act, and one year after California\u2019s adoption of its own post-Prohibition-repeal wine labeling regulations, valid federal wine labeling regulations were approved, and those regulations became effective on March 1, 1936. (U.S. Dept. Treas., Fed. Alcohol Admin., Regs. No. 4 Relating to Labeling and Advertising of Wine (Dec. 30, 1935) arts. I-VII, 1 Fed.Reg. 83 (Apr. 1, 1936) (hereafter Regulations No. 4); see, generally, <em>Controls Over Labeling, supra, </em>7 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 645, 652, fir. 25 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">The federal labeling regulations, as amended in 1938 (see 3 Fed.Reg. 2093 (Aug. 26, 1938)) and thereafter, presently are designated 27 Code of Federal Regulations, sections 4.20 through 4.39. One key provision\u2014Code of Federal Regulations section 4.25(b)(l)(i) and (iii)\u2014states that a wine is \u201centitled\u201d to be described with an appellation of origin if \u201c[a]t least 75 percent of the wine is derived from fruit. . . grown in the appellation area indicated\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cit conforms to the laws and regulations of the named appellation area governing the <em>composition, method of manufacture, </em>and <em>designation </em>of wines made in such place.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Soon after the adoption of this federal provision in 1938, a California statute was enacted, and two regulations were adopted, all three of which imposed <em>more stringent </em>California wine labeling requirements. First, in 1939, the Legislature amended the state ABC Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23000 et seq.) to prohibit the use on wine labels of the phrase \u201cCalifornia Central Coast counties dry wine,\u201d unless the wine was in fact made <em>entirely </em>from grapes grown in specified Central Coast counties. (Stats. 1939, ch. 1033, \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20144, p. 2838; see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25236-25238.) Second, by 1942, a regulation had been adopted imposing a similar 100 percent grape origin requirement for any wine labeled as \u201c \u2018California\u2019 or any geographical subdivision thereof.\u201d (See Cal. Dept. of Pub. Health, Regs. Establishing Stds. of Identity, Quality, Purity and Sanitation and Governing the Labeling and Advertising of Wine in Calif. (May 23, 1942) art. I, \u00a7 2(aa)<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> (hereafter 1942 Regulations), presently found at Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 17015, subd. (a)(1).) Third, by 1942 a California regulation barred the sale of wines labeled with so-called coined (or semi-generic) brand names if the \u201cbrand designation resembles an established wine type name such as . . . Madeira, . . . Port, . . . Claret, [or] Burgundy, etc. . . .\u201d (See 1942 Regs., art. II, \u00a7 8.) Under this and subsequent versions of the same regulation, a label such as \u201cBurgundy brand\u201d was long barred in California.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>The first two California labeling rules described above plainly imposed (and still impose) a more stringent standard than the 75 percent requirement set forth in the federal appellation of origin regulation. (Regs. No. 4, \u00a7 25, as revd., 3 Fed.Reg. 2093, 2096 (Aug. 26, 1938), presently found at 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.25(b)(l)(i).) The third provision described above prohibited name types that the federal regulations have permitted since 1941 upon a proper showing. (See 27 C.F.R \u00a7 4.33(b), as revd., 6 Fed.Reg. 2874 (June 13, 1941) [disallowing such a geographic name <em>unless </em>a federal officer finds the name, either qualified by word \u201cbrand\u201d or otherwise, \u201cconveys no erroneous impressions as to the . . . origin ... of the product\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Although the parties dispute whether the first two state rules cited above are sanctioned by title 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.25(b)(1)(iii)\u2014the federal provision that expressly authorizes state regulation concerning the \u201ccomposition\u201d (the grape ingredients) or \u201cdesignation\u201d of wine (the class or type of wine, as distinct from its source or origin)\u2014the third California regulation, the coined brand-name provision, cannot be so distinguished. That state regulation plainly controlled, more strictly than the federal rules, not the mere composition or designation of wines, but the brand-name labeling of wines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">In any event, there is no indication that any question previously has arisen concerning the authority or enforceability of the California statute<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> or of either regulation. Indeed, since mid-1939, the California Legislature has authorized state wine regulations that are stricter than federal wine regulations,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and for nearly the past 35 years, the Legislature expressly has authorized state wine regulations to <em>\u201cdiffer from or be inconsistent </em>with\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>federal wine regulations (Health &amp; Saf.

This history suggests, instead, the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">b. <em>Modification of federal regulations in the 1970s and 1980s, and adoption by Oregon of its more stringent wine labeling regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Beginning in the mid-1970s, the BATF, which in 1972 had been delegated the task of creating and enforcing federal regulations (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 43), began to consider proposals to further define and regulate appellations of origin. In connection with that inquiry, the BATF also began to consider how better to regulate the use in brand names of terms of \u201cgeographic or viticultural significance.\u201d (42 Fed.Reg. 30517, 30518 (June 15, 1977).)<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In 1978 the BATF adopted, but then postponed enforcement of, new brand-name rules,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and it also adopted new regulations concerning appellations of origin\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>including a new subcategory within appellations of origin known as \u201cviticultural areas.\u201d (43 Fed.Reg. 37672, 37674, 37678 (Aug. 23, 1978).)<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The 1978 federal appellations of origin regulation expressly recognized the enforceability of state laws in relation to placing a \u201cviticultural area\u201d designation on a wine label, making the right to so label a wine contingent on compliance with, among other things, <em>\u201cthe laws and regulations of all of the States contained in the viticultural </em>area.\u201d (27 C.F.R. former \u00a7 4.25a(e)(3)(iv) (1978-1981); <em>id., </em>former \u00a7 4.25a(e)(3)(v) (1981-1986), italics added.)<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Prior to and during this same period of federal regulatory action and consideration of geographic brand-name regulations (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 56), in 1977 the State of Oregon departed from the federal labeling regulations in substantial ways, imposing more stringent state rules concerning matters such as percentage content of Oregon appellation wines,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> use of \u201csemi-generic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>place names,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> percentage content of varietal wines,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> use of the term \u201cestate bottled,\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and the use of geographic brand names.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In each of these respects, Oregon reserved the right to <em>disapprove </em>wine labels that had been granted a valid federal certificate of label approval.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">For present purposes, the most relevant of these various departures from federal wine labeling regulations concerns Oregon\u2019s geographic brand-name rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Effective March 1, 1977, Oregon Administrative Rule 845-10-292(6)(e) provided that appellation names\u2014including the names of Oregon counties, and the names of Oregon wine-producing regions Willamette Valley, Umpqua Valley, and Rogue <em>Valley\u2014\u201cshall not be used in a brand name, in the name of a winery or in any other manner on a label unless 100 percent of the grapes used to produce the wine were grown within the boundaries of that appellation of origin.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The regulation included a grandfather clause permitting \u201cuse by a winery of a brand name which has been in use <em>by that winery </em>on its approved labels prior to <em>January 1, 1977.\u201d </em>(Or. Admin. R. 845-10-292(6)(e) (1977), italics added.)<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Like the other Oregon labeling rules that specifically exceed the federal regulations, this Oregon geographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>brand regulation remains in force today, more than a quarter-century after its adoption. (See Or. Admin. R. 845-010-0920(4)(f) (2004)).<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">We find these Oregon regulations relevant to our current inquiry in three interrelated respects.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> First, the state regulations\u2014especially the strict geographic brand-name rule, and the estate-bottled rule\u2014demonstrate that Oregon has long imposed labeling rules that are both (i) more stringent than the federal rules <em>and </em>(ii) go far beyond 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.25(b)(l)(iii)\u2019s authorization for states to regulate the \u201ccomposition, method of manufacture, [or] designation of wines . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Second, it is clear that the BATF has long been aware of these stricter Oregon rules and apparently views them as enforceable. The Oregon regulations had been in place for approximately 16 months at the time the BATF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>adopted its 1978 regulation concerning the use of \u201cviticultural area\u201d appellations on wine labels. That 1978 BATF regulation, as noted above, <em>expressly acknowledged and required compliance with \u201cthe laws and regulations of all the States contained in the viticultural area.\u201d </em>(27 C.F.R. former \u00a7 4.25a(e)(3)(iv) (1978-1981); <em>id., </em>former \u00a7 4.25a(e)(3)(v) (1981-1986), italics added.) By so providing, the BATF, as of 1978, acknowledged the propriety and enforceability of the more stringent labeling rules promulgated by the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Indeed, any doubt in this regard is dispelled by the BATF\u2019s action and comments seven years later (in late January 1986) when, in the course of repealing as a <em>federal </em>requirement 27 Code of Federal Regulations former section 4.25a(e)(3)(v)\u2019s rule concerning compliance with state regulations relating to viticultural areas, the BATF expressly and repeatedly acknowledged both the existence and the <em>enforceability </em>of Oregon\u2019s \u201cmore stringent\u201d wine labeling regulations.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The BATF explained that although it had decided, with regard to viticultural areas, to eliminate compliance with state laws <em>as a federal requirement, </em>the underlying substantive state law requirements relating to viticultural areas would remain, to be enforced solely by the respective states. The BATF observed: <em>\u201cState laws and regulations of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number><em>state in which the wine was fermented or finished will, of course, continue to apply to the producing winery. These state laws and regulations are enforced by the state involved.\u2019'\u2019 </em>(51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics added.)<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Third and finally, the Oregon geographic brand-name regulation, in particular, sheds light upon the BATF\u2019s apparent understanding of the grandfather clause at issue in this case. Almost 10 years after Oregon adopted its restrictive geographic brand-name labeling regulation, the BATF, after considering various options over the preceding decade (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 56, and <em>post, </em>fn. 70), amended 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.39(i)(l) in the manner at issue in this case, to prohibit the use of labels with brand names implying that a wine was made with grapes grown in the area suggested by the brand name, unless at least 75 percent of the grapes used to make the wine were in fact from that area. But, as noted above, the new federal regulation also contained a grandfather clause that lies at the center of the controversy in this case, under which such otherwise misleading labels are not prohibited, so long as the label was in use prior to July 1986 <em>and </em>the label discloses the true appellation of origin of at least 75 percent of the grapes actually used to make the wine inside the bottle. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 4.39(i)(2)(ii).)<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In view of the BATF\u2019s explicit acknowledgement, only four months prior to its adoption of the provision at issue in the present case, that the Oregon labeling regulations are proper and enforceable (see 51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986)), it is reasonable to assume that the BATF, when it adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>the grandfather clause, was aware of Oregon\u2019s \u201cmore stringent\u201d geographic brand-name labeling rule. And yet the BATF said nothing in its new provision or in its discussion of that new rule to suggest that the new rule preempted Oregon\u2019s long-standing, closely related, and more stringent brand-name labeling rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Accordingly, contrary to Bronco\u2019s theory that the BATF itself viewed or views its wine labeling regulations as preempting more stringent state regulations, we conclude that the history of the federal and Oregon wine labeling regulations in the mid-1970s through the present reveals no evidence of any such intent. Instead, that history strongly indicates that the BATF has long contemplated that the states will enforce their own stricter labeling requirements, and that the agency did not and does not view its labeling regulations as preempting more stringent state regulations such as section 25241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">c. <em>Amendment of the FAA Act in 1988, and corresponding regulations, requiring health warning labels and expressly preempting state regulation of such labels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">In 1988, Congress amended the FAA Act to require that all wine labels (and <em>the </em>labels of <em>other </em>alcoholic beverages) contain a warning on the back label, as follows: \u201cGOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.\u201d (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a).) Congress gave the BATF authority to issue appropriate regulations to enforce Congress\u2019s will (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(b) &amp; (d)), and, stressing the perceived need in this particular area for Congress to \u201cexercise the full reach of the Federal Government\u2019s constitutional powers in order to establish a comprehensive Federal program\u201d (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 213), further provided expressly for federal preemption of such health warnings on alcoholic beverage labels: \u201cNo statement relating to alcoholic beverages and health, other than the statement required by section 215 of this title, shall be required under State law to be placed on any container of an alcoholic beverage . . . .\u201d (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 216.) The BATF responded by adopting implementing regulations (see 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.20 et seq.) as well as a provision expressly reaffirming the preemptive effect of that regulation. (27 C.R.F. \u00a7 16.32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201c \u2018an express definition of the pre-emptive reach of a statute . . . supports a reasonable inference . . . that Congress did not intend to pre-empt other matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly </em>(2001) 533 U.S. 525, 541 [150 L.Ed.2d 532, 121 S.Ct. 2404], quoting <em>Freightliner Corp. </em>v. <em>Myrick </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 280, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>288 [131 L.Ed.2d 385, 115 S.Ct. 1483]; accord, <em>Bass River Associates v. Mayor, Tp. Com\u2019r </em>(3d Cir. 1984) 743 F.2d 159, 162 [\u201cIt is of some interest and no small significance that a provision in the same title does provide for federal preemption of state and local laws or regulations . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">This inference and these observations are especially apt here, in light of the history described above, which strongly suggests (i) no intent on the part of Congress, in 1935 or thereafter, to preempt any <em>other </em>category of state wine label laws, and (ii) the BATF\u2019s acknowledgement of, and apparent acquiescence in, the more stringent wine labeling laws of the states, and specifically those of Oregon. Indeed if Congress, as Bronco asserts, by enactment of the FAA Act in 1935, already had generally preempted state regulation of wine labels, there would have been no need for any express preemption clause or preemption regulation with respect to the 1988 health warnings for wine labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Once again, this history reveals no evidence of any clear or manifest intent on the part of Congress or the BATF to preempt state wine labeling regulation such as section 25241. Instead, the history supports an opposite inference that neither Congress nor the BATF intended to preempt state wine labeling laws such as section 25241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Having concluded that Bronco has failed to carry its burden of establishing clear or manifest intent on the part of Congress, or congressional intent as interpreted by the BATF, to preempt the traditional exercise of state police power such as the wine labeling regulation found in section 25241, we proceed under the presumption that no such preemption was intended. We bear this presumption in mind when we consider below Bronco\u2019s assertion that section 25241, by imposing a labeling requirement that is more exacting than the federal requirement, is impliedly preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">1. <em>Does section 25241, by prohibiting, with respect to Napa County, what the federal grandfather clause does not prohibit, stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">In support of its assertion that section 25241 frustrates the full purposes and objectives of federal law, Bronco cites various cases in which courts have made such (or similar) findings in other contexts. (Geier, <em>supra, </em>529 U.S. 861, 881 [state tort action based upon failure to equip automobile with airbags would frustrate federal highway safety standards permitting car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>makers to employ passive restraint devices other than airbags]; <em>Barnett Bank, supra, </em>517 U.S. 25, 31 [state statute barring national bank from selling insurance would obstruct federal statute that permitted, but did not require, national banks to sell insurance]; <em>Lawrence County, supra, </em>469 U.S. 256, 260-268 [state law requiring certain method of distribution of federal funds held to obstruct federal statute that was designed to provide local governments freedom to spend those federal funds \u201cas they saw fit\u201d]; <em>McDermott v. Wisconsin </em>(1913) 228 U.S. 115, 129 [57 L.Ed. 754, 33 S.Ct. 431] [state statute that required removal of certain labels on syrup was preempted by federal statute under which such labels had been approved]; <em>Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 910, 929, 935 [state law warnings concerning nicotine frustrated the purposes of the federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The Department and the NVVA, by contrast, distinguish each of these cases and rely instead primarily upon <em>Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine </em>(2002) 537 U.S. 51, 68-70 [154 L.Ed.2d 466, 123 S.Ct. 518], in which the high court declined to find preemption of a state tort action seeking to impose standards for boat propeller guards, even in the face of a decision by federal authorities not to impose any general or universal propeller guard requirements. (See also, e.g., <em>California Coastal Comm\u2019n v. Granite Rock Co. </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 572, 582-584 [94 L.Ed.2d 577, 107 S.Ct. 1419] <em>(Granite Rock Co.) </em>[federal approval of mining project was not frustrated by California\u2019s stricter environmental requirements; indeed, the federal regulations assumed the applicability of the state regulations]; <em>Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Labs. </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 707, 720-721 [85 L.Ed.2d 714, 105 S.Ct. 2371] <em>(Hillsborough County) </em>[stricter local regulations concerning plasma donors posed no serious obstacle to related federal regulations]; cf. <em>Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 117, 132 [57 L.Ed.2d 91, 98 S.Ct. 2207] <em>(Exxon) </em>[no preemption of state discriminatory pricing regulations barring conduct that triggered a limited defense under federal law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Bronco asserts that section 25241 frustrates the purposes of Congress, or at least of the BATF\u2019s regulation establishing a grandfather clause (27 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.39(i)(2)(ii)), in \u201cfour interrelated ways.\u201d Bronco argues: (i) Section 25241 prohibits precisely what the regulation establishing the grandfather clause \u201cexpressly and unambiguously authorizes\u201d; (ii) the regulation establishing the grandfather clause \u201cembodies a specific determination by federal regulators that the use of established geographical brand names for wines from a variety of appellation areas would not be misleading if the labels also featured the true appellation of origin\u201d; (iii) the regulation establishing the grandfather clause \u201creflects a careful balancing of federal policy objectives\u201d and a determination by the BATE that the regulations should not render a \u201cwhole class\u201d of established brand names \u201ctotally unusable\u201d (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 70); and (iv) the BATE, in adopting its rule and regulation establishing a grandfather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>clause, expressly rejected as \u201ctoo restrictive\u201d a general rule that would have confined the use of established geographic brand names to wines made from the region referred to in the brand name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">In reply, the Department and the NVVA assert that section 25241 is in aid of, and consistent with, Congress\u2019s general and overriding purpose in adopting 27 United States Code section 205(e) in 1935\u2014namely, the prevention of consumer deception relating to wine labeling. The Department and the NVVA claim that Bronco has failed to identify any congressional purpose with which section 25241 interferes. In this respect, the NVVA argues, \u201c[t]he assertion that the grandfather clause represents a \u2018deliberate federal policy determination\u2019 or \u2018regulatory balance\u2019 assumes that Congress or [the] BATF identified some affirmative reason that the government of the United States wanted Bronco to be able to sell wine made from non-Napa grapes under labels saying \u2018Napa.\u2019 \u201d The Department asserts there is no support for the proposition that federal regulators have concluded that in all cases, the presence of a true appellation of origin dispels the effects of misrepresentations reflected in a brand name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Both the Department and the NVVA acknowledge that in 1984 the BATF, in discussing various options for addressing the problems posed by geographic brand names, asserted that it did not believe it appropriate to issue regulations that \u201cmay be too restrictive\u201d or render \u201ctotally unusable\u201d a \u201cwhole class\u201d of brand-name labels. (49 Fed. Red. 19330, 19331 (May 7, 1984) see <em>ante, </em>fn. 70.) But, the Department and the NVAA argue, those statements suggest at most that the BATF did not believe it prudent to impose a <em>national, </em>or total, ban on the use of existing brand-name labels that suggested an origin of wine different from the actual origin of the grapes used in making the wine. The Department and the NVVA argue that the circumstance that the BATF did not see fit \u201ctotally\u201d to eliminate a \u201cwhole class\u201d of existing labels on a national basis without regard to the policies of a particular state does not provide evidence establishing that section 25241 frustrates any significant federal purpose. In this respect, the NVVA asserts that when, as here, the objectives of the state legislature are identical to the overriding purpose of section 205(e) of the FAA Act (protecting consumers from misleading wine labels), \u201cin the absence of preemptive intent, the fact that [the] BATF may have balanced federal policies and arrived at a particular result does not prevent California from considering its own local policies and needs and passing its own [more stringent] laws.\u201d Finally, the Department and the NVVA observe that the BATF apparently never contemplated, much less rejected, any area-specific exemption from the federal grandfather clause, such as is found in section 25241\u2019s special Napa County labeling mle. The NVVA concludes, \u201cThere is no evidence that [the] BATF considered the limited consumer protection provided by the grandfather clause to be sufficient to protect consumers in all cases, or intended to prevent states from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>preventing the kind of abuses which Bronco and other opportunistic winemakers could perpetuate under the grandfather clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">In view of Bronco\u2019s repeated suggestions that we should be influenced in our assessment by the circumstance that the federal regulations at issue are part of a comprehensive scheme, in resolving these conflicting views concerning whether section 25241 stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress we bear in mind the high court\u2019s admonition in <em>Hillsborough County, supra, </em>471 U.S. 707, 717: \u201cWe are even more reluctant to infer pre-emption from the comprehensiveness of regulations than from the comprehensiveness of statutes. As a result of their specialized functions, agencies normally deal with problems in far more detail than does Congress. To infer pre-emption whenever an agency deals with a problem comprehensively is virtually tantamount to saying that whenever a federal agency decides to step into a field, its regulations will be exclusive. Such a rule, of course, would be inconsistent with the federal-state balance embodied in our Supremacy Clause jurisprudence. See <em>Jones[, supra], </em>430 U.S. [519] at 525. [][] Moreover, <em>because agencies normally address problems in a detailed manner and can speak through a variety of means, including regulations, preambles, interpretive statements, and responses to comments, we can expect that they will make their intentions clear if they intend for their regulations to be exclu</em>sive.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">In addition, we are guided by the high court\u2019s observation in <em>Crosby, supra, </em>530 U.S. 363, 373, that what constitutes a \u201csufficient obstacle [for a finding of implied preemption] <em>is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended </em>effects.\u201d (Italics added.) The high court also has explained that our inquiry in this regard \u201crequires us to consider the relationship between state and federal laws <em>as they are interpreted and applied, not merely as they are </em>written.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>430 U.S. 519, 526, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">We question Bronco\u2019s characterization of the state statute as prohibiting \u201cprecisely what [the regulation establishing the grandfather clause] <em>autho</em>rizes.\u201d (Italics added.) As the NVVA asserted at oral argument and as we observed in <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 183 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527], \u201c[t]here is a difference between (1) not making an activity unlawful, and (2) making that activity lawful.\u201d In our view it is more accurate to characterize the state statute as prohibiting\u2014with respect to Napa County\u2014 what the federal regulation\u2019s grandfather clause <em>does not prohibit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">In any event, Bronco\u2019s repeated emphasis upon an alleged federal \u201cauthorization\u201d presents a myopic and oversimplified analysis. The crucial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>question is, instead, whether the state rule would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Turning to <em>that </em>question, we agree with the Department and the NVVA that section 25241 is consistent with Congress\u2019s overall purpose in enacting 27 United States Code section 205(e)\u2014that is, to \u201cinsure that the purchaser should get what he thought he was getting, [and] that the representations both on labels and in advertising should be honest and straightforward and truthful.\u201d (Hearings before House Com. on Ways and Means on H.R. No. 8539, Fed. Alcohol Control Act, (1935), testimony of Joseph H. Choate, former Chairman of FAC Admin., 74th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 10; H.R. Rep. No. 1542, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3 (1935) [highlighting deceptive labeling practices]; 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11714 [same].) The state statute also is consistent with the recognition that the FAA Act was necessary in order to \u201cdo something to supplement legislation by the States to carry out their own policies\u201d because the states \u201calone cannot do the whole job.\u201d (Remarks of Rep. Cullen on H.R. No. 8539, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 79 Cong. Rec. (1935) 11714.) For the reasons set forth above by the Department and the NVVA, we find that section 25241 does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">In reaching this determination, we also are persuaded by the apparent congressional and regulatory acquiescence in California\u2019s long-standing regulations applicable to the labeling of wines produced in California. This acquiescence militates against concluding that California\u2019s section 25241, enacted in 2000, constitutes a \u201csufficient obstacle\u201d supporting a finding of implied preemption based upon a theory of frustration of federal purpose. Indeed, any doubt that we may have had in this regard is dispelled by the related history of Oregon\u2019s corresponding geographic brand-name labeling regulation, which, as explained above, since 1977 has imposed a rule far stricter than the federal rule that existed in the mid-1970s and, like the California statute now under review, also established a regulation far more stringent than that set forth, effective in 1986, under the federal grandfather clause.

In this setting, the BATF\u2019s failure to question the enforcement of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>more stringent state regulations\u2014while instead acknowledging generally the propriety of such regulations\u2014suggests that the BATF, the expert body charged with the enforcement of 27 United States Code section 205(e), does not view these state regulations as being preempted by federal law, and also does not view them as posing an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. (See, e.g., <em>Hillsborough County, supra, 471 </em>U.S. 707, 721 [because \u201cthe agency has not suggested that the county ordinances interfere with federal goals, we are reluctant in the absence of strong evidence to find a threat to the federal goal of ensuring sufficient plasma\u201d]; accord, <em>Granite Rock Co., supra, </em>480 U.S. 572, 582-583 [\u201cIf, as Granite Rock claims, it is the federal intent that Granite Rock conduct its mining unhindered by state environmental regulation, one would expect to find the expression of this intent in these Forest Service regulations\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">We find nothing in the history of the underlying federal statute or the federal regulations suggesting that, although the BATF may have determined that as a <em>general matter </em>its grandfather clause was appropriate so as to avoid destroying an \u201centire class\u201d of brand-name labels, states would or should be precluded from adopting more stringent brand-name labeling requirements as necessary to address local concerns.

In support, Bronco relies upon numerous cases holding, on the facts presented, that a state may not, by its own regulations, impair rights granted under a federal license or permit.

But as both the Department and the NVVA observe, it is quite doubtful that a federal COLA issued pursuant to 27 United States Code section 205(e) and the corresponding wine label certificate regulations (27 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.50 et seq.) are equivalent to the licenses or permits at issue in the cases upon which Bronco relies, and Bronco does not provide any convincing authority suggesting that a COLA constitutes a license or permit as understood in those cases. Indeed, it is apparent from the FAA Act itself, and from the corresponding regulations, that both Congress and the BATF well understand the distinction between a license or permit, on one hand, and a COLA, on the other. Congress requires wine importers, producers, and wholesalers to secure a \u201cbasic permit\u201d (27 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(a)-(c); see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 204 [setting forth permit procedures]), and the BATF has adopted extensive corresponding regulations concerning such permits (27 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.20-1.59). By contrast, nowhere in the separate COLA procedures set forth in 27 United States Code section 205(e), or the extensive COLA regulations (27 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.5CM-.52, 13.1-13.92), does Congress or the BATF even <em>imply </em>that a COLA constitutes a license or permit. Quite the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">As explained above, it is evident that the BATF envisions that states will enforce their own labeling laws to the extent they impose more stringent requirements, and that BATF generally views its role as being confined to ensuring compliance with the bare terms of <em>federal </em>labeling law. (See, e.g., 51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774, discussed ante, at pt. II.C.2.b.) As the NVVA observes, the BATF itself has confirmed this view of its enforcement authority and of any resulting COLA that it issues by noting, on its COLA application form, that the BATF uses the form only for its own federal enforcement duties but that it may share the information supplied to <em>state regulators </em>\u201cto aid in the performance of their duties.\u201d (Dept. of Treas., Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bur., Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval, TTB F 5100.31 (4/2004), p. 3 &lt;http://www.ttb.gov/forms/5000.htm # alcohol&gt; [as of Aug. 5, 2004].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Nor, contrary to the assertions of Bronco and suggestions by the Court of Appeal below, can a COLA properly be viewed as conferring a \u201cright\u201d on the holder to market wines in interstate or foreign commerce so long as the bare BATF labeling regulations are satisfied. The BATF itself has observed that a \u201ccertificate of label approval was never intended to convey any type of proprietary interest to the certificate holder\u201d and that a certificate \u201c \u2018is issued for [B]ATF use only . . . .\u2019 The certificate of label approval is a statutorily mandated tool used to help the [B]ATF in its enforcement of the labeling requirements of the FAA Act.\u201d (64 Fed.Reg. 2122, 2123 (Jan. 13, 1999).) As the New Jersey Supreme Court observed in a related context, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>COLA \u201cgoes no further than evidencing compliance with [federal regulatory] standards imposed only for the purposes mentioned in the valid exercise of federal authority.\u201d <em>(Boiler Beverages, Inc. v. Davis </em>(1962) 38 NJ. 138 [183 A.2d 64, 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Bronco has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating federal preemption of a long-established and legitimate exercise of state police power with respect to the subject regulated by section 25241. As we have seen, there is no express preemption in the present context, and Bronco\u2019s assertions of implied preemption are contradicted by the long history we have described of concurrent state and federal regulation of wine labels including, historically, the representations appearing on labels suggesting the place of origin of the grapes used to make wine. Nor has Bronco succeeded in providing any persuasive indication that this long-standing concurrent regulatory scheme no longer is compatible with Congress\u2019s overall purposes which have been to support the states\u2019 efforts to protect consumers from misleading labeling, not to permit the type of labeling at issue here. Finally, Bronco has not established that, by purchasing a brand name that had been used prior to 1986, it acquired a federally recognized right or license exempting it from stricter state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">California is recognized as a preeminent producer of wine, and the geographic source of its wines reflecting the attributes of distinctive locales, particularly the Napa Valley\u2014forms a very significant basis upon which consumers worldwide evaluate expected quality when making a purchase. We do not find it surprising that Congress, in its effort to provide minimum standards for wine labels, would not foreclose a state with particular expertise and interest from providing stricter protection for consumers in order to ensure the integrity of its wine industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand the case to that court to enable it to address Bronco\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Chin J., Brown, J., Moreno, J., and Swager, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied October 13, 2004, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

The United States Supreme Court has not so held, however, and indeed has assumed otherwise. <em>(Crosby, supra, </em>530 U.S. 363, 373-374 &amp; fn. 8.) <em>Geier, </em>by contrast, did not even address the presumption-against-preemption doctrine, and in <em>Engine Manufacturers </em>the court simply found it unnecessary, because of its conclusion that the federal legislation <em>expressly </em>preempted the relevant state law, to address the presumption against preemption or even the legislative history of the federal statute. We discern no persuasive reason why the traditional presumption against preemption should be categorically inapplicable in the present circumstances, and until the high court directs otherwise, we reject Bronco\u2019s view on this point. (See, e.g., <em>Philip Morris Inc. </em>v. <em>Harshbarger </em>(1st Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 58, 85-86 [applying a \u201cstrong presumption against preemption\u201d concerning state health and safety regulations and finding those regulations not to frustrate congressional purposes].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\"> At oral argument, as in the Department\u2019s briefs, the NVVA maintained that the \u201crelevant area\u201d for purposes of determining whether the presumption against preemption is applicable should be viewed as consumer protection related to the labeling of foods and beverages in general or, more specifically, as consumer protection related to the labeling of wines. Bronco, although generally challenging the appropriateness of applying any presumption against preemption in this case (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 12), does not contest the definition of the relevant area for such an inquiry as proposed by the Department and the NVVA. For purposes of this opinion, and consistently with the high court\u2019s approach in such matters (see, e.g., <em>ARC America Corp., supra, </em>490 U.S. 93, 101 [in addressing whether federal antitrust law preempts state law, defining the relevant area as \u201cstate common-law and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices\u201d]), we view the relevant area as being consumer protection related to food and beverage labeling, with special emphasis upon wine labeling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b998-6\"> Some state laws of this era regulated the production and labeling of specific items of food such as flour, butter, oleomargarine, and vinegar.

(43 Fed.Reg. 37672, 37674, 37678 (Aug. 23, 1978).) The brand-name rules that were adopted in 1978 (but never became effective) would have provided: \u201cA brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the bottling winery is located within the geographical area used in the brand name, and the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the area named\u201d (meaning at least 75 percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>grapes used to make the wine must be from that area).

As Bronco observes, in an introductory sentence the regulation <em>also </em>states: \u201cThe Commission adopts, by reference, 27 CFR [parts] 4 [the federal wine labeling regulations] and 24[] [wineries and wine-making regulations] (1986). These regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco [] and Firearms of the United States Department of Treasury apply to all wine sold in Oregon by a Commission licensee.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Bronco reads this language as adopting generally the federal regulations concerning, for example, the use of the term \u201cestate bottled\u201d and geographic brand names for all Oregon wines sold in that state\u2014and hence as implicitly repealing or at least superseding those Oregon rules insofar as in-state sales of Oregon wines are concerned. Bronco\u2019s interpretation of the Oregon rules is belied by Oregon Administrative Rule 845-010-0910(2) (2004), which plainly states that Oregon Administrative Rules \u201c845-010-0905 <em>through </em>845-010-0940 [i.e., including Oregon\u2019s estate-bottled and geographic brand-name provisions] apply to all grape wines <em>produced or bottled in Oregon . . </em>\u2014that is, regardless where such wines are sold\u2014and that <em>\u201c[t]hese rules prevail in any conflict between . . . other rules in Chapter 845, Division 010.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b1024-6\"> As the BATF explained, prior to adoption of its 1978 appellation rules, appellations of origin relating to American wines generally were characterized as regions or places delimited by political boundaries, such as states or counties. As observed <em>ante, </em>at footnote 57, the 1978 appellation rules expanded the concept of appellations of origin by additionally including under that term \u201cviticultural areas\u201d\u2014that is, grape-growing regions\u2014defined by geographic features, and not political lines. Because some of these viticultural areas straddled states, a problem eventually arose concerning the federal requirement, then set out in 27 Code of Federal Regulations former section 4.25a(e)(3)(v) (1981-1986), that in order to employ a viticultural area designation, a winery must \u201cconform[] to the laws and regulations of all the States contained in the viticultural area.\u201d Specifically, the BATF noted (51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986)), if a wine were to use the viticultural area designation \u201cColumbia Valley\u201d (a federally recognized viticultural area straddling Oregon and Washington), the winery producing the wine would be required to comply with Oregon\u2019s state regulations, even if the grapes were grown in the Washington part of the Columbia Valley and the wine was made and finished only in Washington. Moreover, the BATF observed, \u201cregulations of Oregon and Washington differ greatly regarding the production <em>and labeling </em>of wine. <em>Oregon regulations are more stringent than Federal regulations.\u201d </em>(51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics added.) The BATF observed that because former section \u201c4.25a(e)(3)(v) required compliance with laws and regulations of all states within a multistate viticultural area, regardless of where the wine is fermented or finished, wine made from grapes originating and fermented in Washington, and finished and bottled within Washington was, nevertheless, subjected to Oregon law and regulations if the wine claimed a multistate viticultural area appellation such as Columbia Valley.\u201d (51 Fed.Reg. 3773, 3774 (Jan. 30, 1986).) And yet, the BATF determined, \u201c[a] <em>Federal requirement </em>for compliance with State laws and regulations is both unnecessary and difficult for the Federal Government to enforce <em>due to the multitude of state and local laws and regulations.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) Accordingly, the BATF concluded, it did not \u201cbelieve that Federal regulation should impose the State laws or regulations of one state upon transactions occurring in other states.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b1025-7\"> Underscoring this point, the BATF observed in the summary of its decision that although \u201cthe requirement to comply with State laws and regulations is removed as a Federal requirement,\u201d still, \u201c[t]he State laws and regulations remain in effect and <em>will continue to be enforced by the agencies of the states involved in winemaking.\u201d </em>(51 Fed.Reg. 3773 (Jan. 30, 1986), italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\"> See 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.39(i), quoted in full <em>ante, </em>at footnote 7. As Bronco observes, in a notice of proposed rulemaking issued in 1984\u2014two years prior to the BATF\u2019s adoption of the present brand-name provision and its grandfather clause\u2014the BATF stated that it did not wish to adopt a regulation that \u201cmay be too restrictive.\u201d (49 Fed.Reg. 19330, 19331 (May 7, 1984).) After outlining four possible regulatory responses to the brand-name problem, the BATF stated, in reference to a possible rule strictly regulating the use of terms of viticultural significance in brand names, its \u201cbelie[f that] the wine industry should be allowed flexibility in selecting brand names under which to market their products <em>without having a whole class of brand names become totally unusable.\u201d (Id., </em>at pp. 19331-19332, italics added.) As explained <em>post, </em>part U.D'.l, Bronco suggests that this language supports a conclusion that two years later, when the BATF adopted 27 Code of Federal Regulations section 4.39(i)(2)(ii) and concluded that the new rule \u201cwill provide the industry with sufficient flexibility in designing their labels, while at the same time providing consumers with protection from any misleading impressions that might arise from the use of geographic brand names\u201d (51 Fed.Reg. 20480, 20482 (June 5, 1986)), the BATF, in so acting, engaged in a \u201ccareful balancing of federal policy objectives\u201d and intended to <em>allow </em>the kind of brand-name labeling here at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b1031-7\"> We note that the BATF has not been reluctant to commit its thoughts to public view through publication of proposed rules and related comments in the Federal Register.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b1032-5\"> For similar reasons, we find unpersuasive the related arguments of amici curiae on behalf of Bronco that section 25241 stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, because the statute assertedly (i) \u201cimpairs the long-standing national policy favoring uniform and consistent federal wine labeling regulations,\u201d (ii) \u201cimpairs the consistent federal policy permitting continued use of established brands,\u201d and (in) \u201cwill frustrate the United States\u2019 ability to protect established brands and trademarks in ongoing trade negotiations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division One, assigned by the Chief Justice persuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
