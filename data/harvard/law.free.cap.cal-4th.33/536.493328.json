J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALt\">Defendant Donald Griffin appeals from a judgment of the Fresno County Superior Court imposing a sentence of death (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190 et seq.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">At the guilt phase of his initial trial, a jury found defendant guilty of the murder of Janice Kelly Wilson (Kelly), his 12-year-old stepdaughter, finding that he committed the murder under the special circumstances of felony-murder rape, felony-murder sodomy, and felony-murder lewd conduct, and also that he personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon, a knife. The jury also found defendant guilty of rape, sodomy, and lewd or lascivious conduct against Kelly. At the penalty phase, the jury fixed the punishment for the murder at death. The trial court rendered judgment, sentencing defendant to death for the murder, and staying imposition of sentence as to the rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">In <em>People v. Griffin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1011 [251 Cal.Rptr. 643, 761 P.2d 103] <em>(Griffin I), </em>we affirmed the judgment as to defendant\u2019s guilt of these offenses and the related special circumstance and personal-use findings, but reversed the sentence of death because the trial court committed error under <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430], by giving the so-called Briggs Instruction. That instruction informed the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the Governor could commute a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole to a lesser sentence that would include the possibility of parole, but did not inform the jury that the Governor similarly could commute a sentence of death as well. We remanded defendant\u2019s case for a new trial on the issue of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On remand, upon retrial of the penalty phase, a new jury again fixed defendant\u2019s punishment at death. The trial court rendered judgment, again sentencing defendant to death for the murder and staying imposition of sentence as to the rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">In <em>Griffin </em>/, we summarized the evidence presented at the guilt phase of the initial trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cDefendant conceded that he had killed his stepdaughter, 12-year-old Kelly . . . , but denied any sexual assault. The prosecution evidence was that defendant stopped by his wife\u2019s workplace in Kerman, California, about 7 p.m. on December 13, 1979, along with Kelly. He said they were going to his parents\u2019 house nearby, and they left. A few minutes after 10 p.m. he returned, saying that he had allowed Kelly to leave his parents\u2019 house for home in the company of a little girl wearing horn-rimmed glasses, but that Kelly had never returned home. He made several expeditions in search of Kelly during the evening and repeated this story of her disappearance. He reported to the police that Kelly was missing, that she had left in the company of a little Mexican girl wearing glasses. He said to several witnesses that if anyone had hurt Kelly, he would kill them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">\u201cWhen the police received a radio report that an injured person had been found on a nearby rural road, they asked defendant to follow them to the police station. An officer coming on duty saw defendant in a cell latrine, on his tiptoes, straddling a washbasin, with his hands in front of him. The officer could not see what defendant was doing, as his back was facing the officer. When defendant turned around, he asked for paper towels, and dried his hands. The officer saw that defendant had a buck knife in a holster at his waist. Defendant went out again to search for Kelly. He returned to the police station later that night, wearing clean pants and a different jacket. An officer observed some spots of blood on his boots, and defendant said that they were oil spots and tried to wipe them off. The officer asked where defendant\u2019s knife was, and he said he had lost it during his search for Kelly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201c[Kelly\u2019s] body was discovered that night on the side of a rural road. The blouse and sweater were pulled up partially over her face, the back of her bra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>was tom, the left shoulder strap had been tom loose, and one of the cups had been cut with a knife. The left leg was bent at an awkward angle, and the underwear and pants were pulled down below the hips. The left leg of the underwear was cut through. The pants were tom and had also been cut near the zipper. There were stab wounds in the neck and abdominal incisions from the pubic bone to the breast bone, exposing the internal organs. There was a large pool of blood nearby, and a bloody partial footprint. An officer returning from the scene thought that the print matched defendant\u2019s boots. An officer went out into the police parking lot and shone a light into the track defendant had been driving all evening; there was blood on the floorboard on the driver\u2019s side and another bloody footprint which looked like the one at the scene and looked like it could have been made by defendant\u2019s boots. Later analysis of the blood in the truck showed that it was [Kelly\u2019s] unique blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cAfter defendant\u2019s arrest, he said, T think I need a psychiatrist.\u2019 Then on his way from the crime lab to booking, he said to an officer, \u2018Do you think I\u2019ll get 10 years for this?\u2019 When an officer took defendant out of his cell after the arrest, defendant said, \u2018Go ahead man, it\u2019s all right, why don\u2019t you just go ahead and kill me. It\u2019s all right, just go ahead and kill me.\u2019 To the officer transporting him from Kerman to Fresno, defendant said, \u2018Give me your shotgun so I can blow my head off. I\u2019m a fool.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cDr. [Thomas] Nelson performed the autopsy and testified that the cause of death was strangulation and severing of the carotid artery. The abdominal incision occurred after death. It was his opinion that there had also been a rape and an act of sodomy. The hymen was partly tom and there was a little bleeding near the tear. There was also a small braise near the opening of the vagina and a braise of an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half near the tear in the hymen. This testimony was impeached with prior inconsistent statements; in his autopsy report Dr. Nelson had not mentioned any bleeding near the tear in the hymen, and had described the bruise near the tear as much smaller. He explained that the shape of the braise had become clearer after the tissue had been fixed in formaldehyde.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cDr. Nelson also testified that the anus was quite dilated, and he thought it had been stretched so far that it could not close. This testimony was impeached with his prior inconsistent statements; in his autopsy report he said the anus was somewhat \u2018prominent.\u2019 He explained at trial that this was a nicer word than dilated. At the preliminary hearing he said that the anus was somewhat dilated. He explained that he was not very precise in his speech. The doctor also testified that he took a fluid sample from the anus which showed no sperm, but which in his opinion showed the presence of prostatic acid phosphatase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cAcid phosphatase is an enzyme which occurs in the body in both sexes, but it occurs at higher levels in the male prostate gland and is contained in seminal emissions. Dr. Nelson removed 0.1 milliliters of fluid from the anus. His technician, [Joyce] Gordon, diluted this with 0.2 milliliters of saline solution, and divided the sample in half. The first test on one-half of the sample showed 14.5 sigma units of acid phosphatase. The test on the other half, involving a chemical reaction with tartrate buffer, showed that of the total, 8.1 sigma units of the acid phosphatase was prostatic acid phosphatase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201cThe defense experts testified that in the absence of sperm or physical injury to the anus, they would not use any level of acid phosphatase to express an opinion that there had been an act of sodomy. They also disputed the accuracy and reliability of the tartrate buffer test to identify acid phosphatase as prostatic acid phosphatase; one expert went so far as to say that the tartrate buffer test was worthless and that prostatic acid phosphatase could not be distinguished from any other acid phosphatase except electrophoretically. There was also a great deal of controversy among the experts on the conversion factor between sigma units and international units, and about dilution factors. One defense expert, using his conversion factor and dilution factor, found an amount of acid phosphatase which was below the minimum amount which the scientific literature said showed the presence of prostatic acid phosphatase. However, another of the defense experts agreed with the prosecution\u2019s dilution factors and used an even higher conversion factor, coming to a total well above the minimum which the literature said indicated the presence of prostatic acid phosphatase. He maintained, however, that high levels of the substance should not be used to support an opinion that there had been an act of sodomy in the absence of sperm or physical injury to the anus. The defense experts also testified that sperm breaks down faster than acid phosphatase, so with the levels of acid phosphatase found here, they would certainly expect to find sperm if there had been any seminal emission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cThe defense pathologist, Dr. [Paul] Herrmann, said that there was insufficient evidence to show either rape or sodomy, that the injuries which Dr. Nelson had described in his autopsy report were not indicative of rape, that dilation of the anus could be simply muscle relaxation after death and before rigor mortis, and that in a child of this age, he would expect much more injury if there had been a rape or act of sodomy. He thought that the injuries to the vagina could have been caused by a tampon (though the mother testified in rebuttal that the child had not started menstruating yet) or by a finger. He also thought that Dr. Nelson had erred in considering changes in tissue after fixation in formaldehyde, as the formaldehyde distorts the appearance of the tissue.\u201d <em>(Griffin I, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 1017-1020.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In <em>Griffin I, </em>we summarized the evidence presented at the penalty phase of the initial trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cDefendant was 30 years old at the time of the offense and had no prior convictions. There was no evidence of any prior misconduct; in fact, the prosecution presented no evidence at the penalty phase of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cIn mitigation, . . . defendant called his parents and other family members who described defendant\u2019s family background. Defendant had little schooling and had been placed in classes for slow learners. He left school at age 15 or 16 and started working as a laborer and security guard. He was considered cooperative and hardworking. Defendant was a loving stepfather to [Kelly] for seven years. However, at the time of the offense defendant\u2019s relationship with his wife had seriously deteriorated, in part due to financial difficulties. Defendant had been laid off a day or two before the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe evidence presented at the penalty phase of trial showed that there was no indication of any violence in defendant\u2019s nature, and no sign before the offense of the coming explosion. His friends and family were shocked, believing him incapable of such an act. There was also testimony that after the offense, defendant was extremely remorseful, asking that his own life be taken.\u201d <em>(Griffin I, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 1031-1032.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">At the penalty phase retrial, the People, in their case in aggravation, presented evidence similar to that introduced at the guilt phase of the initial trial. This evidence related circumstances of the crimes against Kelly, including expert testimony tending to establish the commission of rape and sodomy and specifically the crucial issue of penetration, as well as evidence of defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and possibly drugs, although not to the point of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The People presented additional evidence, not introduced at the initial trial, relating to the crimes against Kelly, including evidence disclosing the following three matters. First, the owner of a slaughterhouse testified that some years prior to the crimes in question, defendant was employed at that establishment, and that sheep were slaughtered in a manner similar to the way Kelly\u2019s body was mutilated. Second, a police officer testified that some months preceding the commission of the crimes, defendant struck up a conversation with the officer, and the two men discussed how crimes\u2014 including rape\u2014were investigated. Third, two of Kelly\u2019s friends and classmates testified that on the day the crimes were committed, Kelly acted unusual at school, and told one of them that defendant had been fondling her for some time and that she intended to confront him if he continued to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The People also presented evidence of other violent criminal activity committed by defendant, which also had not been introduced at the initial trial. This evidence revealed the following. First, a few years prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>commission of the crimes against Kelly, John Hogan, who was the father-in-law of defendant\u2019s sister and the property manager of a house that defendant had rented and was in the process of vacating, approached defendant in front of the house, cursing him and telling him he still owed rent and would have to pay for damage he had caused to the premises. When defendant paid no attention, Hogan touched his shoulder. In response, defendant sprang up, pulled out a knife with a folding blade, flicked the blade open, and took a step toward Hogan. Defendant\u2019s sister stepped between the men, with her face to defendant and her back to Hogan. As Hogan continued to curse defendant, saying, \u201c[W]ell, come on, come on,\u201d defendant repeatedly told his sister, \u201c[G]et him away or I\u2019ll cut his throat\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d After she told defendant to put his knife away and leave, he did so. Second, perhaps a year or two preceding the commission of the present crimes, defendant had engaged in lewd conduct on two separate occasions with four- or five-year-old Lisa B., his wife\u2019s niece by marriage. Once, defendant touched Lisa with his fingers in the area of her vagina; on the other occasion, he penetrated her vagina with his fingers and then flicked open a knife with a folding blade. Each time, he threatened harm to others if Lisa revealed what he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In his case in mitigation, defendant presented evidence similar to what he had presented at the guilt phase of the initial trial relating to the rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct offenses that preceded his murder of Kelly, including expert evidence offered to raise a lingering doubt as to the element of penetration required for the commission of rape and sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Defendant also presented evidence bearing on his background and character. Some of this testimony, given by lay witnesses, was much like the evidence he presented at the penalty phase of his initial trial, describing his minimal schooling and placement in classes for slow learners, his departure from school in his early to middle teens in order to perform manual and essentially unskilled labor, his reputation as cooperative and hardworking, his loving care for Kelly, his seriously deteriorating relationship with his wife, and his financial difficulties during the period leading up to the commission of the crimes against Kelly, the loss of his job a day or two before the crimes were committed, and the remorse he subsequently expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Additional testimony related to defendant\u2019s background and character was given by expert witnesses, and was substantial and far different from his evidence at the penalty phase of his initial trial. This evidence was to the following effect: Defendant suffered physical abuse as a child and youth under his father\u2019s harsh discipline. In addition, defendant repeatedly suffered severe and violent sexual abuse within an extended and pervasively aberrant family, which comprised the Sextons and the McDonalds as well as the Griffins, especially at the hands of his uncles Lonnie and Charles Sexton and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>even from his own father. This abuse had various adverse consequences, including the translation of his experiences as a victim into an inclination to victimize others. Defendant was borderline mentally retarded and suffered from severe neuropsychological defects, profound learning disabilities, and a speech impediment. Defendant committed the crimes against Kelly during a \u201cpsychotic experience.\u201d According to defendant, after getting into his truck with Kelly, \u201che had an extremely weird experience in which he felt that he was being threatened by what looked like some sort of a monster that was trying to get at him\u201d; \u201cat that point he drew his knife and tried to defend himself against this weird monster that was taking over and then passed out\u201d; and \u201csometime thereafter he came to and saw the body and got out of there.\u201d Lastly, according to expert testimony presented, defendant had performed well in prison and could be expected to continue to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In rebuttal, the People presented evidence to show that defendant was not borderline mentally retarded and did not commit the crimes against Kelly during a psychotic experience. An expert witness testified that defendant was not psychotic when he committed the crimes and was not mentally retarded, and that the qualifying term \u201cborderline\u201d was psychiatrically \u201cinappropriate.\u201d This expert witness further testified that when observed by several individuals shortly before and shortly after the commission of the crimes, defendant was behaving normally, whereas a \u201cperson who\u2019s suffering [from] a psychosis has a significant\u201d and \u201cusually quite obvious\u201d \u201cimpairment\u201d of appreciable duration. This witness added: \u201c[T]hat theory that there was a monster is just ridiculous. There\u2019s no psychiatric disorder . . . that comes on in a half hour and goes in a half hour. There\u2019s also the inconsistency if he thought he were protecting himself from a monster with his knife, why would he have had sex with the monster, raped the monster, sodomized the monster before killing the monster.\u201d The expert witness concluded that defendant acted in a rational manner, intending to commit the crimes without being detected and to avoid suspicion thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Finally, in surrebuttal, defendant presented evidence concerning the poor grades he received in school, the resulting angry reaction from his father including spankings and insults, and defendant\u2019s inability to complete job applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">As noted above, at the conclusion of the penalty phase retrial the jury again fixed the punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">II. Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Defendant raises several claims in an attempt to establish error requiring reversal of the judgment. As will appear, we conclude that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>A. <em>Denial of Wheeler Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">After 12 jurors and two of four alternate jurors were selected and sworn for the penalty phase retrial, and in the midst of the selection of the two remaining alternate jurors, defendant moved, in his counsel\u2019s words, \u201cfor a mistrial . . . , under what is known as a <em>Wheeler </em>Motion,\u201d which the trial court understood as a motion based on <em>People v. Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] to dismiss all of the jurors and alternate jurors and to quash the remaining venire. In <em>Wheeler, </em>we held that a prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to strike prospective jurors on the basis of membership in a cognizable group, including African-Americans, violates the right of a defendant under article I, section 16 of the California Constitution to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. <em>(People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-277, &amp; 280, fn. 26.) Defendant, who is European-American, asserted that the prosecutor struck, in his counsel\u2019s words, \u201cevery prospective black juror that has been called. And I have counted five\u201d\u2014the last being Prospective Alternate Juror G. R.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, determining that it was \u201cnot timely\u201d and additionally that there was no \u201cprima faci[e] showing as to .. . the people that were excused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At this' point, the following colloquy ensued between the trial court and defendant\u2019s counsel. Counsel stated, \u201cYour Honor, could I put on the record the last alternate who was excused was black. Mr. [G. R.].\u201d The court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Was he? [][] He appeared to be of minority [szc]. I can\u2019t say that he was black. I don\u2019t know. Was he? In your opinion?\u201d Counsel replied, \u201cWell, perhaps I should have inquired, but, yes, he certainly appeared to be black to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Selection of the alternate jurors then proceeded. After the two remaining alternate jurors were selected and sworn, the prosecutor volunteered a comment apparently disputing the number of African-Americans whom he had peremptorily challenged, and articulating a reason explaining his peremptory challenge of Prospective Alternate Juror G. R.: \u201cAnd with respect to\u2014assuming that [defense counsel] was correct in his opinion that Mr. [G. R.] was black, there were comments made by Mr. [G. R.] in his juror questionnaire about the responsibility of persons who are using drugs or otherwise intoxicated which are closely related to the issues or some of the issues, which I believe will be raised in this case. And [I] would have excused anyone with those attitudes.\u201d The trial court did not respond to the prosecutor\u2019s comment, but instead \u201cpoint[ed] out for the record\u201d\u2014without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>contradiction or objection by defense counsel\u2014\u201cthat Mr. [G. R.] was asleep during most of the voir dire. He was in the back row and I asked the bailiff to wake him up.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Defendant now contends that the trial court erred by denying his <em>Wheeler </em>motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Under <em>Wheeler, </em>there is a presumption that a prosecutor who employs a peremptory challenge against a prospective juror who is a member of a cognizable group does so for a purpose other than to discriminate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 278.) If a defendant believes that the prosecutor is using a peremptory challenge for a discriminatory purpose, the defendant \u201cmust raise the point in timely fashion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280.)  At the threshold, the defendant must establish a \u201cprima facie case of [purposeful] discrimination.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cFirst, . . . [the defendant] should make as complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cSecond, [the defendant] must establish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThird, from all the circumstances of the case [the defendant] must show a strong likelihood\u201d (ibid.)\u2014or, stated in other terms, must raise a \u201creasonable inference\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 281; accord, <em>People v. Johnson </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1302, 1306, 1312-1318 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 71 P.3d 270], cert, granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>sub nom. Johnson v. California </em>(2003) 540 U.S. 1045 [157 L.Ed.2d 692, 124 S.Ct. 817], cert, dismissed (2004) 541 U.S. 428 [158 L.Ed.2d 696, 124 S.Ct. 1833])\u2014\u201cthat such persons are being challenged because of their group association rather than because of any specific bias\u201d <em>(People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 280). In order to demonstrate such a \u201cstrong likelihood,\u201d or raise such a \u201creasonable inference,\u201d the defendant \u201cmust show that it is more likely than not the [prosecutor\u2019s] peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias\u201d or purposeful discrimination. <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1306; <em>id. </em>at p. 1318.)  If the defendant succeeds in establishing a prima facie case of such discrimination, the prosecutor must articulate neutral reasons explaining the peremptory challenges in question. <em>(People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal. 3d at pp. 281-282.) Ultimately, the defendant must prove purposeful discrimination. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 278-282 [placing the \u201cburden of proof\u2019 on the defendant].) If the defendant succeeds in proving such discrimination, the trial court must dismiss any jurors thus far selected and sworn, and quash any remaining venire. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion. We need not consider whether it erred in determining that the motion was untimely because, in any event, the trial court did not err in determining that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">When a trial court denies a <em>Wheeler </em>motion with a finding that the defendant failed to establish a prima face case of purposeful discrimination, we review the record on appeal to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the ruling. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Farnam </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 135 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988]; <em>People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 993-994 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 116-117 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record includes voir dire (see, e.g., <em>People v. Farnam, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 135; <em>People v. Jenkins, supra, 22 </em>Cal.4th at p. 993; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 116) as well as any juror questionnaires (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyette (2002) 29 </em>Cal.4th 381, 419-123 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391]). We sustain the ruling when the record discloses grounds upon which the prosecutor properly might have exercised the peremptory challenges against the prospective jurors in question. (E.g., <em>People v. Farnam, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 135; <em>People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>During voir dire, Prospective Alternate Juror G. R. stated that he never had served as a juror, had lived in Fresno approximately 14 years, worked as a track man for the San Joaquin Valley Railroad making repairs, was unmarried, and spent his leisure time playing basketball, and also implied that he could choose either death or life imprisonment with possibility of parole as the penalty for defendant, depending on the evidence to be presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In his juror questionnaire, this prospective juror disclosed further information, including the following: G. R. was 19 years of age, was a recent high school graduate, and was the father of a 10-month-old daughter. Expressing a desire to become a highway patrol officer, G. R. stated that relatives and friends had been arrested for, charged with, or incarcerated for, the sale of drugs, and also stated that he had witnessed various crimes, including theft, the sale of drugs, and a shooting. As for his general attitudes regarding the use of drugs and alcohol, G. R. expressed beliefs that included the following: \u201c[T]hey should stop selling alcohol because all it does it cause [szc] problems\u201d; alcohol use affects individuals by \u201cmak[ing] them do crazy things\u201d and by causing them to \u201cforget what happen [sic] the day before\u201d; similarly, drug use affects individuals by \u201cmak[ing] them do crazy things and hurt people\u201d and by \u201ccausing]\u201d them \u201cto do other crimes just to get some more\u201d; drug users are more likely than others to be guilty of crimes with which they are charged, \u201c[bjecause they dont [sic] remember if they did it or not\u201d; and \u201cI don\u2019t like [drug use] because I have family members on it,\u201d adding that a drug user is a \u201cperson looking for an excuse.\u201d G. R. also made various other comments, expressing a belief that violent crime had increased recently because \u201c[t]here are more crazy people because of drug users and gangs,\u201d and that the penalty of death is imposed \u201c[Randomly,\u201d whereas the penalty of life imprisonment without possibility of parole is \u201cno good if they will never get out why live.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Having reviewed the record on appeal, we find substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to establish a prima face case of purposeful discrimination. The record discloses grounds upon which the prosecutor properly might have made his peremptory challenge against G. R. First, he apparently had substantial acquaintance with persons engaged in criminal activity. Second, he held a negative view of the nature of the penalty of life imprisonment without possibility of parole as \u201cno good,\u201d and a similarly negative view of the administration of the penalty of death as random. Third, his comments on various points suggested that he may have been lacking in attention, in conformity with the trial court\u2019s observation\u2014 uncontradicted and unobjected to by defense counsel\u2014that G. R. was \u201casleep during most of the voir dire.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The foregoing constitutes substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to make a prima face case of purposeful discrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred by denying his <em>Wheeler </em>motion insofar as the motion also implicated <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712]. In <em>Batson, </em>which followed <em>Wheeler </em>by some eight years, the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to strike a prospective juror on the basis of membership in a cognizable group, including African-Americans, violates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>(Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at pp. 84-89.) <em>Batson </em>requires of defendant substantially the same prima face case of purposeful discrimination as is required by <em>Wheeler. </em>(See <em>People v. Yeoman </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 115-118 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 186, 72 P.3d 1166]; see also <em>People v. Johnson, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 1302, 1313-1314.) Because defendant failed to satisfy <em>Wheeler, </em>he likewise failed to satisfy <em>Batson. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Yeoman, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 115-118.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>B. <em>Excusal of Prospective Jurors for Cause Related to Capital Punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Defendant contends the trial court erred under the impartial-jury guaranties of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 16 of the California Constitution by excusing four prospective jurors at the penalty phase retrial because of their views on capital punishment. As we shall explain, we conclude that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770], the United States Supreme Court held that a prospective juror cannot be excused for cause based on his or her views on capital punishment without violating a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment, unless, as is pertinent here, the prospective juror made it \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that he or she would <em>\u201cautomatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 522, fn. 21.) In <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412 [83 L.Ed.2d 841, 105 S.Ct. 844], however, the court revisited <em>Witherspoon </em>and declared that the proper standard was \u201cwhether the [prospective] juror\u2019s views would \u2018prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424.)  In <em>People v. Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 767 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250], we adopted the <em>Witt </em>standard as the test for determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury under article I, section 16 of the state Constitution was violated by an excusal for cause based on a prospective juror\u2019s views on capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">On the People\u2019s challenge, the trial court excused Prospective Jurors E. B., M. C., J. D., and C. F. for cause based on their views concerning capital punishment. The trial court found that each held views that would substantially impair the performance of her duties as a juror in accordance with the instructions and her oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Substantial evidence is the standard of review applicable to a finding on the potential effect of a prospective juror\u2019s views related to capital punishment. (E.g., <em>People v. Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 817-818 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305]; <em>People v. Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1262 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251].) The standard is the same for the threshold finding regarding the nature of such views; \u201cSuch a finding, we have stated, is generally \u2018binding\u2019 \u2018if the prospective juror\u2019s responses are equivocal ... or conflicting ....\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>962 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214]; see <em>People v.

Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 1025 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099].) As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cain </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 60 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 481, 892 P.2d 1224]: \u201c[W]e pay due deference to the trial court, which was in a position to actually observe and listen to the prospective jurors. Voir dire sometimes fails to elicit an unmistakably clear answer from the juror, and there will be times when \u2018the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law. . . . [T]his is why deference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Wainwright v. Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412, 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings that each of the prospective jurors in question held views concerning capital punishment that substantially impaired her ability to perform her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Prospective Juror E. B. stated, alternately, that she could, and could not, vote to impose the death penalty. Although she stated that earlier in her life she strongly had supported the death penalty, she admitted that she presently entertained mixed feelings and was at a crossroads in her thinking, further revealing that she believed that it was wrong to impose the death penalty and that life imprisonment without possibility of parole was sufficient punishment. She added that she had been much affected by the recent deaths of her father and her mother, which occurred on the same day; that she had been unsettled by the execution of Robert Alton Harris, placing herself in his place in the gas chamber in her thoughts; and, lastly, that she had been unable even to have a gravely ill dog put down just three weeks earlier. The trial court reasonably could find substantial impairment in her reactions to each of these very different events.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Prospective Juror M. C. indicated that she would not want to take responsibility for voting for the death penalty and, upon further questioning, stated and reiterated that she did not know whether she <em>ever </em>could vote to impose the death penalty, regardless of the state of the evidence in a case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In similar fashion, Prospective Juror J. D., although stating that she supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the death penalty generally, also stated she did not know whether she actually could vote to impose the death penalty\u2014even in a case in which she had concluded that the defendant deserved the death penalty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With respect to each of these prospective jurors, the trial court, having had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of each and to assess the degree of reluctance and apprehension expressed by each prospective juror in responding to questioning, reasonably could find that each prospective juror\u2019s views on the death penalty would substantially impair her ability to perform the duties of a juror in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Lastly, Prospective Juror C. F. was the warden of a state prison at which women condemned to death are incarcerated pending execution. C. F. stated that in light of her professional responsibilities as warden and the potential adverse effect on conditions in her institution that might result if it became known she had voted to impose the death penalty, she would have difficulty imposing that punishment and did not know whether her employment would affect her choice of penalty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court, having heard C. F.\u2019s responses and observed her demeanor, reasonably could find that her position and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>responsibilities as warden would substantially impair her ability to perform the duties of a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Defendant, maintaining substantial evidence does not exist to support the trial court\u2019s excusal of any of the prospective jurors in question, focuses on equivocal and conflicting responses by each of the four women in her juror questionnaire and on voir dire. As already explained, however, the trial court had the opportunity to observe the demeanor and to assess the degree of uncertainty and reluctance of each prospective juror and resolved any equivocal and conflicting responses in a manner that caused the court to conclude that each of these jurors\u2019 views or employment would substantially impair the juror\u2019s ability to make a penalty determination in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions. On this record, we have no reason or basis for second-guessing that finding. Contrary to defendant\u2019s suggestion, the fact that at some point each of these prospective jurors may have stated or implied that she would perform her duties as a juror did not prevent the trial court from finding, on the entire record, that each nevertheless held views or had employment responsibilities that substantially impaired her ability to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Defendant also argues that the trial court failed to apply the appropriate standard in excusing the prospective jurors in question. The record does not support this assertion. With regard to one of the prospective jurors, the trial court expressly invoked the requisite standard. As for the others, the court did so by implication. Defendant\u2019s point seems to be that the trial court must have failed to apply the appropriate standard because substantial evidence does not exist to support its excusal of any of these prospective jurors. But as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>we have explained, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s action in excusing each of the jurors in question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">C. <em>Failure to Reopen Jury Selection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Moments after the 12 regular jurors were selected and sworn at the penalty phase retrial, and prior to the selection of any of the four alternate jurors, one of the 12 jurors, E. L., who the record reflects was \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201cin tears,\u201d asked to be discharged because her son had been arrested, adding, \u201cI have too many things on my mind. I can\u2019t even think.\u201d The trial court, outside the presence of the other jurors and prospective alternate jurors, questioned E. L. concerning her situation. E. L., who remained distraught, responded that her son had been arrested for seven armed robberies four days earlier, apparently after the conclusion of the last court session. When the trial court asked why she had failed to bring the fact to its attention earlier that day, E. L. replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I could say anything about it. I just can\u2019t do this.\u201d The trial court addressed the prosecutor and defense counsel: \u201cI suspect that what we should do is to\u2014if you stipulate that she can be excused, we\u2019ll seat the alternates and then select an alternate to replace her at this point in time. The jury has been sworn in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">After asking Juror E. L. to leave the courtroom, the trial court engaged in colloquy with the prosecutor and defense counsel. The prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s been sworn and in a hypertechnical sense, jeopardy is attached and/or at least there\u2019s an argument to be made for that.\u201d The trial court asked the prosecutor, \u201cWell, would you stipulate she could be excused and we could then seat her [replacement] and there would be no challenges to the other eleven but only as to this one seat?\u201d The prosecutor responded with his view that \u201cdefendant personally [should] be part\u201d of any such stipulation. Defense counsel interjected that defendant could not do so. The trial court replied, \u201cWell, all [the prosecutor] is suggesting is that . . . whatever procedure we use . . . your client personally agree as to what procedure we\u2019re going to go through.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s a stipulation that [E. L.] . . . be excused, we re-seat a new juror to take this juror\u2019s place before we start selecting the alternates. That your client stipulate to it... . That\u2019s all [the prosecutor] is suggesting.\u201d Defense counsel asked for an opportunity to research the question, and the trial court ordered a recess for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Following the recess, defendant moved for a mistrial. Defense counsel stated: \u201cJeopardy has attached, the jury was sworn. The defense is also at a significant disadvantage. We have used sixteen peremptory challenges. We have had twenty-six to use. If . . . juror [Ms. E. L.] . . . had said that five seconds before, we would still have those ten peremptories to use plus the ones on the alternates, and we feel that this is a significant disadvantage to the defense . . . .\u201d The trial court inquired: \u201cWell, aside from the mistrial, would you stipulate to excusing this juror at this time and reopening and proceeding to select a person to sit in [her place] . . . ?\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cYour Honor, not giving up any issues on the mistrial issue, which I think is preserved at this point, is file court saying would we agree to\u2014would we feel we are not in so much of a disadvantage\u2014\u201d The trial court interrupted: \u201cNo, I\u2019m asking if you want to stipulate to this procedure, the procedure you suggested. Now if you stipulate to it then you are giving up your advantage and your objection.\u201d Defense counsel replied: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Invited by the trial court to comment on the procedure to be followed, the prosecutor expressed his position that the trial court should select and swear the intended four alternate jurors, and then should turn to considering whether to discharge Juror E. L. and, if she were discharged, replacing her with one of the alternate jurors. In response, defense counsel stated: \u201cYour Honor, for the record, the defense would like to indicate that I believe this decision has already been made by the court. That they are going to excuse that juror . . . .\u201d The trial court cited its authority in section 233 (mistakenly transcribed or referenced as section 234) of the Code of Civil Procedure to put an alternate juror in the place of a juror who has been discharged. Defense counsel responded: \u201cThe difference I see we have before us, your Honor, is we don\u2019t have any alternates.\u201d The trial court replied: \u201cI understand that and we\u2019re in the process of obtaining the alternates. And the court is therefore going to proceed to select the alternates and then we\u2019ll seat the alternates, seat one of the alternates to replace juror [E. L.] . . . . We\u2019ll select four alternates. Each . . . side will have one peremptory per alternate, that means four peremptories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The prosecutor requested clarification: \u201cIf I understood your comments correctly a few moments ago when you were speaking with the defense here on the record, that you were making available or offering to them the procedure whereby we reopen jury selection so that they could proceed with whatever the peremptories were that were remaining if they opted to avail themselves to that procedure that was available to them?\u201d The trial court responded: \u201cWell, it was except they declined it and still insisted on the mistrial.\u201d The prosecutor stated: \u201cRight. I understand. That\u2019s what I thought had occurred there.\u201d Defense counsel made no statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The trial court continued: \u201cAnd then the procedure after we seat the alternates, first alternate will replace juror [E. L.] . . . if we get to that point and juror [E. L.] . . . is excused. Then if . . . another juror wishes to be excused during the course of the trial, alternate number 2 will replace and then alternate number 3, and then alternate number <em>4. </em>Any objection to that procedure?\u201d Defense counsel and the prosecutor each answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Thereupon, in open court the four alternate jurors were selected and sworn. Immediately thereafter, the trial court conducted a hearing in chambers as to whether to discharge Juror E. L. The trial court questioned E. L. as previously, concerning her son\u2019s recent arrest, and E. L. continued to indicate she was too distraught to serve as a juror. The trial court then asked the prosecutor and defense counsel whether they would stipulate to E. L.\u2019s discharge. Defense counsel answered: \u201cYour Honor, the Defense can\u2019t do that at this time.\u201d The trial court responded: \u201cAll right, . . . then we\u2019ll keep [Ms. E. L.] on as a juror. Is that what you want?\u201d Defense counsel replied: \u201cNo. I think it\u2019s the Court\u2019s decision.\u201d Upon further questioning by the trial court and the prosecutor, E. L. responded, \u201cI can\u2019t do this right now. I am very emotional\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could [do it]\u201d even weeks later. The trial court discharged E. L. as unable to perform her duty, noting later its \u201copinion that she could not pay attention to the evidence based on her emotional state,\u201d and replaced her with an alternate juror. The trial court then admonished the jury and the remaining three alternate jurors, and excused them for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Defendant again moved for a mistrial. Defense counsel stated: \u201cWe had asked for a mistrial earlier, but that was before [Ms. E. L.] had been excused. [][] We would ask for a mistrial now, because we did not stipulate or agree to have [Ms. E. L.] be excused and the jury was sworn and then the alternates were picked right after the jury was sworn. [f] This is on the record already. [][] [Ms. E. L.] indicated a problem with serving as a juror and we are still of the same mind, we feel that a mistrial should be granted and should be granted at this time in this case.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Subsequently, after the jury returned its penalty determination and just prior to the hearing on defendant\u2019s automatic application to modify the verdict of death, defendant moved for a new trial, in pertinent part effectively renewing his mistrial motions. The trial court denied the new trial motion, stating as to the mistrial motions that the court \u201cstands by its ruling[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">On appeal, defendant does not contend the trial court erred by discharging Juror E. L. Instead, defendant claims that the trial court erred by failing to reopen jury selection completely, in order to allow him to exercise his remaining peremptory challenges against jurors already sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The legal principles applicable to the claim before us are set out in our decisions in <em>In re Mendes </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 847 [153 Cal.Rptr. 831, 592 P.2d 318], <em>People </em>v. <em>Armendariz </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 573 [209 Cal.Rptr. 664, 693 P.2d 243], and <em>People v. Caro </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1035 [251 Cal.Rptr. 757, 761 P.2d 680].</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In <em>Mendes, </em>we held that jeopardy does not attach for purposes of the double jeopardy clause of either the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 15 of the California Constitution until empanelment of the jury is complete, which entails selecting and swearing in not only the 12 regular jurors but also any alternate jurors. <em>(In re Mendes, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 852-854.) We further held that discharge of a regular juror before empanelment of the jury has been completed\u2014with the selection and swearing-in of the alternate jurors\u2014does not amount to discharge of the jury for double jeopardy purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 852-856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In <em>Mendes, </em>we also concluded that when the trial court discharges a regular juror prior to the selection and swearing in of any alternate jurors, the court possesses authority to reopen jury selection completely to allow each of the parties to exercise any peremptory challenges remaining against any of the remaining regular jurors already sworn. <em>(In re Mendes, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 855.) In reaching this conclusion, we observed that inasmuch as the \u201ccomposition of the 12-member panel [would] . . . change,\u201d there could be a \u201cvalid reason\u201d for the trial court to allow the parties to exercise their remaining peremptory challenges against remaining regular jurors already sworn in order to \u201csatisfy themselves to the best of their ability with the final composition of the jury.\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Next, in <em>Armendariz, </em>we considered a claim by the defendant that, following the trial court\u2019s discharge of two regular jurors prior to the selection and swearing in of the alternate jurors, the trial court erred by denying the defendant\u2019s motion to completely reopen jury selection to allow him to exercise his remaining peremptory challenges against the remaining regular jurors already sworn. Applying the abuse-of-discretion standard <em>(People </em>v. <em>Armendariz, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 581), we found that the trial court in that case was unaware of its authority to reopen jury selection, and that had it been aware of that authority, it could not reasonably have denied the defendant\u2019s motion <em>(id. </em>at pp. 581-583). On that ground, we reversed the judgment rendered against the defendant and remanded the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Thereafter, in <em>Caro, </em>we considered a claim by the defendant that the trial court erred by failing to reopen jury selection completely to allow him to exercise his remaining peremptory challenges against the remaining regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>jurors already sworn, following discharge of a regular juror prior to the selection and swearing of the alternate jurors. In light of the procedural posture of that case, however, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, concluding that a trial court does not have a duty to reopen jury selection sua sponte, that is, on its own initiative in the absence of a request by the defendant <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caro, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 1046). We therefore held that a defendant \u201cmay not be heard to complain\u201d of any such omission on appeal unless he or she requested such action by the trial court <em>(id. </em>at p. 1047). Because the defendant in <em>Caro </em>had not asked the trial court to reopen jury selection, we concluded he could not complain on appeal of the trial court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Applying the principles set forth above in <em>Mendes, Armendariz, </em>and <em>Caro, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court in this case erred by failing to reopen jury selection completely in order to allow him to exercise his remaining peremptory challenges against the remaining regular jurors already sworn, following the discharge of Juror E. L. and prior to the selection and swearing in of the alternate jurors. As in <em>Caro, </em>defendant did not seek any such action from the trial court. What defendant in fact did seek, twice, was a mistrial\u2014under what defendant now concedes was the erroneous belief that jeopardy had attached. In support of a mistrial, defense counsel cited the assertedly \u201csignificant disadvantage to the defense\u201d flowing from the circumstance that had the 12 regular jurors not been selected and sworn, the defense would have had 10 remaining peremptory challenges for use against any prospective jurors called to voir dire for Juror E. L.\u2019s seat as a regular juror, in addition to the four peremptory challenges available for use against any prospective jurors summoned to voir dire as potential alternate jurors. When the trial court inquired of defense counsel whether they were willing to stipulate to the procedure that the trial court believed they had suggested\u2014 that is, to reopen jury selection\u2014defense counsel responded in the negative. Any uncertainty in this regard was dispelled later when, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s request for clarification, the trial court <em>stated\u2014without contradiction by defense </em>counsel\u2014that defense counsel had \u201cdeclined\u201d what the prosecutor described as the \u201cprocedure whereby we reopen jury selection so that they could proceed with whatever the peremptories were that were remaining.\u201d Thus, not only did defendant not seek to reopen jury selection, he in fact actively opposed such action, and his two motions for mistrial were not the equivalent of a request that the trial court do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In support of his claim, defendant argues that the trial court was unaware of its authority to reopen jury selection completely in order to allow each of the parties to exercise remaining peremptory challenges against remaining regular jurors already sworn. The argument, however, does not establish that the trial court erred in failing to take such a course. Although the trial court provided an opportunity for counsel to research this issue, defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>did not even cite <em>Mendes, Armendariz, </em>or <em>Caro. </em>More importantly, under <em>Caro, </em>which had been decided some years earlier, the trial court did not have a sua sponte duty to reopen jury selection. Defendant did not request such action, and the trial court was not under any obligation to act on its own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Defendant alternatively argues that the trial court improperly required him to withdraw his first motion for mistrial as a condition of the court\u2019s exercising its authority to reopen jury selection completely so as to allow each of the parties to exercise its remaining peremptory challenges against the remaining regular jurors already sworn. Defendant relies upon the trial court\u2019s inquiry: \u201cWell, <em>aside from the mistrial, </em>would you stipulate to excusing . . . juror [E. L.] at this time and reopening and proceeding to select a person to sit in [her place] . . . ?\u201d (Italics added.) Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, we do not discern in the italicized phrase the imposition of any condition on defendant, improper or otherwise, but only an attempt to clarify whether defendant would accept the procedure proposed as an acceptable resolution short of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Defendant finally argues that the trial court should not have continued the hearing on whether to discharge Juror E. L. until after the four alternate jurors were selected and sworn, having done so assertedly to avoid any discharge of the jury that might have been required by Code of Civil Procedure section 233.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the trial court\u2019s action in continuing the hearing has no bearing on the resolution of the matter before us, inasmuch as under <em>Caro </em>the trial court did not have a sua sponte duty to reopen jury selection.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>D. <em>Denial of Motion for Order Recusing the District Attorney\u2019s Office for Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Prior to the penalty phase retrial, defendant moved under section 1424 for an order recusing the district attorney\u2019s office based on an asserted conflict of interest arising out of that office\u2019s employment of Noemi Yolanda Summi. The People opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion. Summi testified at the hearing as follows: She currently was employed in the district attorney\u2019s office as an investigator with the civil section of the juvenile division in what she described as an extra-help, temporary position, having begun work there about seven months earlier. Her office was situated in a building located miles from the building in which the prosecutor\u2019s office was situated. Previously, she was self-employed as a private investigator; about three years earlier, she had been hired to work as an investigator for defense counsel representing defendant\u2019s brother Elzie Griffin when Elzie was charged with murder (with one or more special circumstance allegations) unrelated to the charges against defendant. She worked in that capacity for a year or so, during which time she also collaborated with an investigator who worked for defense counsel representing defendant. Along with six or seven other persons, she once attended a team meeting relating to defendant\u2019s case, but never engaged in any discussions about defendant\u2019s case with any person other than counsel representing defendant and the agents of those counsel. Since the beginning of her employment in the district attorney\u2019s office, she never had been approached by anyone in that office with any questions about defendant\u2019s case and she never had occasion to do any work whatsoever for that office with respect to defendant\u2019s case. Indeed, she believed that no one in the district attorney\u2019s office knew about her indirect involvement in defendant\u2019s case or her direct involvement in defendant\u2019s brother Elzie\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Following Summi\u2019s testimony, defense counsel presented argument, conceding that \u201cit is apparent that there is no actual conflict in that . . . Miss Summi has not talked to . . . [the prosecutor] or anyone on his team or to anyone about the case,\u201d but adding that \u201c[j]ust because Miss Summi has not spoken to anyone so there is no actual conflict, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t an apparent conflict or appearance of impropriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to recuse the district attorney\u2019s office, stating: \u201cI agree there is no actual conflict and any apparent conflict is simply that. It\u2019s clear from Miss Summi\u2019s testimony she has not spoken to anyone in the District Attorney\u2019s office concerning her former services on . . . [defendant\u2019s] case. In fact, her thinking is no one in the District Attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>office is even aware of the fact that she worked on that case.\u201d The trial court then admonished Summi, \u201cspecifically ordering [her] to not discuss this case at all with anyone from the District Attorney\u2019s office or anyone at all that is involved in this case, directly or indirectly involved in the prosecution of [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Greer) </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 255 [137 Cal.Rptr. 476, 561 P.2d 1164], we held that a trial court has general statutory authority to order recusal of a member of a district attorney\u2019s office, and inferentially the office itself, for a conflict of interest. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 261-265 ; see generally <em>People v. Eubanks </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 580, 590-594 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 927 P.2d 310].) In <em>Greer, </em>we further held that the applicable standard for the trial court\u2019s exercise of such authority is whether there exists a conflict of interest that \u201cmight prejudice [the conflicted person or entity] against the accused and thereby affect, or appear to affect, [its] ability to impartially perform [its] discretionary functions.\u201d <em>(Greer, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 269; see generally <em>People v. Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 590-591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">After our decision in <em>Greer, </em>the Legislature added section 1424 to the Penal Code. That statute sets forth the procedure for a defendant to seek an order from the trial court recusing a member of the district attorney\u2019s office, or the office as a whole, for a conflict of interest. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Millwee </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 96, 123, fn. 7 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 954 P.2d 990]; <em>People v. Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 591.) The statute also makes a substantive change (see <em>People v. Millwee, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 123, fn. 7; <em>People v. Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 591), replacing the standard set forth in <em>Greer </em>with a standard that, in its present form, provides that a trial court may not order recusal \u201cunless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial\u201d (\u00a7 1424, subd. (a)(1)). (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 591; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conner </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 141, 147 [193 Cal.Rptr. 148, 666 P.2d 5].) A conflict of interest exists \u201cwhenever the circumstances of a case evidence a reasonable possibility that the [conflicted person or entity] may not exercise its discretionary fiinction in an evenhanded manner.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Conner, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 148; accord, <em>People v. Snow </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 43, 86 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 65 P.3d 749]; <em>Hambarian v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 826, 833 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 725, 44 P.3d 102]; <em>People v. Millwee, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 123; <em>People v. Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 592.) Whether characterized as \u201cactual\u201d or merely \u201capparent,\u201d a conflict requires recusal only if it is \u201cso grave as to render it unlikely that [the] defendant will receive fair treatment during all portions of the criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>(People v. Conner, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 148; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Snow, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 86; <em>Hambarian v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 833; <em>People v. Millwee, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 123; <em>People v. Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 592.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>On appeal, a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for an order recusing a member of the district attorney\u2019s office, or the office as a whole, for a conflict of interest is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and its findings as to any underlying facts are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eubanks, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion. In light of the facts set out in Summi\u2019s testimony, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion was supported by substantial evidence and did not amount to an abuse of discretion. The court reasonably determined, in effect, that there was no conflict of interest that would have rendered it unlikely that defendant would receive a fair trial. There was no showing as to what confidential information Summi might have obtained about defendant\u2019s case while working as an investigator on defendant\u2019s brother Elzie\u2019s case, other than what related to their \u201ccommon upbringing.\u201d The evidence further established that Summi had not disclosed any such confidential information to anyone in the district attorney\u2019s office, and in light of the trial court\u2019s order there was no reasonable basis to believe she would do so in the future. Furthermore, although defendant argues that the trial court applied an erroneous standard in denying his motion, the record does not support that assertion. Both defendant and the People cited the proper standard to the trial court, and it is reasonable to conclude that the trial court applied that standard, even if it did not quote it exactly. In stating \u201cthere is no actual conflict and any apparent conflict is simply that,\u201d the trial court merely was responding to defense counsel, who had been first to use that language. Moreover, in context, the trial court\u2019s words imply its view that \u201cany apparent conflict\u201d arising out of the district attorney\u2019s employment of Summi would not render it unlikely that defendant would receive a fair trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">E. <em>Granting of Motion to Permit the Presence of the Victim\u2019s Mother and Sister</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Prior to opening statements at the penalty phase retrial, defendant made a motion, apparently under section 777 of the Evidence Code, to exclude from the courtroom any witness not then testifying, in order to prevent such witness from hearing the testimony of others. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The People then made a motion of their own to permit the presence of Marvene Nordin, Kelly\u2019s mother, and Tamara Wilson, Kelly\u2019s sister, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to former section 1102.6. Former section 1102.6 provided in pertinent part that a \u201cvictim shall be entitled to be present and seated at the trial,\u201d unless the trial court \u201cfinds that the presence of the victim would pose a substantial risk of influencing or affecting the content of any testimony.\u201d (Former \u00a7 1102.6, subd. (a), as enacted by Stats. 1986, ch. 1273, \u00a7 2, p. 4448 and repealed by Stats. 1995, ch. 332, \u00a7 2, p. 1824; hereafter former section 1102.6.) Former section 1102.6 also defined \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201c(1) the alleged victim of the offense and one member of the victim\u2019s immediate family and (2) in the event that victim is unable to attend the trial, up to two members of the victim\u2019s immediate family who are actual or potential witnesses.\u201d (Former \u00a7 1102.6, subd. (e).) Nordin and Wilson were \u201cvictims\u201d within the meaning of former section 1102.6, because Kelly was unable to attend and they were members of her family who were expected to be called as witnesses. Defendant opposed the motion; defense counsel, invoking experience with other trials, stated: \u201cI would object strongly to having witnesses in the courtroom, reacting and letting the jury see their reactions.\u201d Noting that no witnesses then were present, the trial court took the motion under submission and stated it would make a ruling at a later time. Pending such a ruling, the trial court excluded from the courtroom any witness not then testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In their case in aggravation, the People called Nordin, Kelly\u2019s mother, as their first witness. Nordin testified concerning such matters as her first marriage, the birth of her children, including Kelly, and her marriage to defendant and their life together, including observations that he appeared not to use drugs, but did consume alcohol\u2014at least on one occasion to the point of intoxication. Nordin also testified about events that occurred on the night the crimes were committed against Kelly, including further observations that defendant was uncharacteristically upset, with tears in his eyes, and although smelling of alcohol did not act as though he was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Later the same day, the People called Wilson, Kelly\u2019s sister, as a witness. Wilson also testified about events on the night in question, including observations that defendant was uncharacteristically upset and, although smelling of alcohol, did not act as though he were intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The next day, the trial court returned to the People\u2019s motion to permit the presence of Nordin and Wilson as victims under former section 1102.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In arguing in favor of the motion, the prosecutor relied upon the language of former section 1102.6, which provides that a \u201cvictim shall be entitled to be present and seated at the trial\u201d (former \u00a7 1102.6, subd. (a)). Although conceding that Nordin and Wilson might testify again in rebuttal, the prosecutor also noted that the two women already had testified, in conformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>with the spirit of a separate requirement of former section 1102.6, namely that on the granting of a motion of this sort, the \u201cvictim shall testify first\u201d \u201cif the defendant . . . object[s] to the order of the victim\u2019s testimony\u201d (former \u00a7 1102.6, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In opposition, defense counsel relied upon the language of former section 1102.6 that withdrew a victim\u2019s entitlement to be present in the event the trial court \u201cfinds that the presence of the victim would pose a substantial risk of influencing or affecting the content of any testimony.\u201d (Former \u00a7 1102.6, subd. (a).) Defense counsel likened the question to one of undue prejudice under section 352 of the Evidence Code: \u201c[Ijt\u2019s like a 352 issue would be brought to the case by having these people sit in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">One of defense counsel\u2019s concerns related to the possibility of further testimony by Nordin or Wilson: \u201cIn a case like this, it would be our contention that to have two of the key witnesses present in court for all the testimony and probably being called in rebuttal later after having listened to everything in court, it\u2019s very, very prejudicial to our client and would overweigh any other considerations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Another of defense counsel\u2019s concerns related to any reaction by Nordin or Wilson to evidence such as crime scene and autopsy photographs\u2014an issue that the trial court had raised. For his part, the prosecutor had given his assurance that he would caution at least Nordin about the nature of the evidence. Defense counsel nevertheless was unsatisfied: \u201cAnd I was personally present in another trial where the audience was admonished not to react and they did again and again after being admonished .... And the jury\u2019s attention was constantly brought to the audience and the reactions from the different evidence that came in which was very gruesome. And once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s too late is the problem. And it doesn\u2019t\u2014in my opinion, if . . . [the prosecutor] talks to them, if the court admonishes them, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Thereupon, the trial court granted the motion to permit the presence of Nordin and Wilson, but directed the prosecutor to \u201ccaution\u201d them against \u201cany emotional outbreak\u201d and to instruct the two witnesses that \u201c[t]hey will be given one opportunity only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">After the People completed their case in aggravation, defendant began his case in mitigation. Among defendant\u2019s witnesses was Nell Riley, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist with a specialty in neuropsychology, who testified that defendant was borderline mentally retarded and suffered from a speech impediment. Dr. Riley also testified that defendant was not malingering when he performed poorly during the testing to which she subjected him. Another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of defendant\u2019s witnesses, Harry Kormos, M.D., a psychiatrist, also testified that defendant was borderline mentally retarded. Dr. Kormos testified additionally that defendant was laboring under substantial stress at the time of the murder. In support, Dr. Kormos related various statements defendant had made to him indicating that Nordin put pressure on defendant to move up from lower paying employment that he enjoyed to higher paying employment for which he was unsuited; that she and her children ridiculed him as stupid; and that she had threatened separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Another of defendant\u2019s witnesses, James Chiminillo, taught defendant reading and mathematics while he was incarcerated on death row. Chiminillo testified that defendant started out at a first-grade, eighth-month, level in reading and at a third-grade, fourth-month, level in mathematics, and that although he worked hard, he did not make substantial progress. On cross-examination, Chiminillo was presented with an inmate/parolee appeal form, signed with defendant\u2019s name, that purportedly bore defendant\u2019s handwriting and that suggested by its contents that defendant functioned at a higher level than defendant revealed to Dr. Riley and therefore may have been malingering when he performed poorly during the tests she administered to him. Chiminillo, however, testified that he could not identify the handwriting as defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">After defendant completed his case in mitigation, the People presented rebuttal. Among other witnesses, the People called Nordin. Nordin denied defendant\u2019s statement that she put pressure on him to move up to higher paying employment; she denied his statement that she or any of her children ridiculed him; and she denied his statement that she had threatened separation. Nordin also testified that defendant did not appear to be mentally retarded and could speak without impediment. In addition, Nordin identified handwriting on the inmate/parolee appeal form as defendant\u2019s. The People also called Wilson. Like Nordin, Wilson denied that she or any of the other members of Nordin\u2019s family ridiculed defendant, testified that he did not appear to be mentally retarded, and identified handwriting on the inmate/parolee appeal form as defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Defendant now contends that the trial court erred by granting the People\u2019s motion to permit the presence of Nordin and Wilson as victims under former section 1102.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The question of the appropriate standard of review for a trial court\u2019s mling on a motion to permit the presence of a victim under former section 1102.6 has not been addressed in any reported decision. In resolving this question, we look to the standard of review for a mling on a motion to exclude witnesses, as to which a mling on a motion to permit the presence of a victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>operates as an exception. A ruling on a motion to exclude witnesses is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lariscy </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 30, 32 [92 P.2d 638]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooks </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 224, 330 [190 Cal.Rptr. 211].) We believe that the same standard should apply to a ruling on a motion to permit the presence of a victim. In making any determination as to who may attend or not attend a trial or any portion of a trial, a trial court exercises its authority over the course and conduct of the proceedings. (See \u00a7 1044.) The exercise of that authority in the making of such determinations generally is subject to review for abuse of discretion. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Halbert </em>(1926) 78 Cal.App. 598, 613 [248 P. 969].) We see no reason to exempt from that rule a trial court\u2019s determination allowing the presence of a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s granting of the People\u2019s motion to permit the presence of Nordin and Wilson as victims under former section 1102.6. In light of the circumstances, the trial court reasonably determined that the presence of Nordin and Wilson would not pose a \u201csubstantial risk of influencing or affecting the content of any testimony.\u201d (Former \u00a7 1102.6, subd. (a).) Nothing before the trial court at the time it made its ruling suggested that Nordin\u2019s or Wilson\u2019s presence posed a substantial risk that either woman would craft or shape her own testimony, or cause any other witness to do so, as a result of her presence. In arguing against the motion on this point, defense counsel asserted only that such a risk existed, but an assertion of this sort is insufficient to support a claim that the trial court abused its discretion (see <em>People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1232 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259]). Further, although we review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the basis of the record of the proceedings before it at the time the ruling was made, we note that subsequent events do not suggest that either Nordin or Wilson tailored her testimony on rebuttal to conform with what she had learned from being present at trial, but instead show that each woman simply testified to matters she was likely to know without regard to what was disclosed at trial. In addition, subsequent events do not support any inference that either Nordin nor Wilson, by her presence, caused any other witness to give testimony different from what the witness otherwise would have given, inasmuch as even defense counsel characterized each woman as \u201cvery composed\u201d and \u201cvery restrained.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>F. <em>Admission of the Victim\u2019s Precrime Out-of-court Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In their case in aggravation at the penalty phase retrial, the People presented evidence, not offered at the initial trial, that on the day on which the crimes were committed, Kelly did not act as she usually did at school, and told another girl that defendant had been fondling her for some time and that she intended to confront him if he continued to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The events leading to the admission of Kelly\u2019s statement were as follows. Michelle Acosta, who had been a friend and classmate of Kelly, was the girl to whom Kelly had made this statement. Not long after the murder, Acosta had spoken about Kelly\u2019s statement with someone whom she could not remember but did not mention the statement again for about 12 years until shortly prior to the penalty phase retrial when, after a chance meeting with an estranged sister of defendant\u2019s, she related it to a detective. It was only about three weeks prior to opening statements, shortly after trial commenced with jury selection, that the prosecutor learned of the existence of Acosta and of Kelly\u2019s statement to her. Within a day or two, the prosecutor notified defense counsel. A week or so later, defense counsel was provided an opportunity to interview Acosta.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In the course of the People\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor began to make reference to Kelly\u2019s statement, but was cut off by an objection by defense counsel. Outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel argued that Kelly\u2019s statement was inadmissible because it was hearsay and did not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule, and also because it amounted to aggravating evidence of other violent criminal activity and had not been included in the pretrial notice required by section 190.3 for all such evidence except the circumstances of the murder. In response, the prosecutor argued that Kelly\u2019s statement was admissible because it fell within the exception to the hearsay rule for a statement of state of mind and also because it was not offered to prove other violent criminal activity, but rather constituted aggravating evidence of the circumstances of the murder. The trial court sustained the defense objection, but without prejudice to a later request by the People for a ruling as to the admissibility of Kelly\u2019s statement. The trial court then admonished the jury to \u201cdisregard the last sentence, the last subject of the . . . [prosecutor].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Later that day, outside the presence of the jury, the People sought a ruling from the trial court that Kelly\u2019s statement was admissible. At an evidentiary hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, the People called Acosta to testify. Acosta related Kelly\u2019s statement, making plain that she had asked Kelly\u2014for 10 or 15 minutes or perhaps even longer\u2014what was bothering her, before Kelly spoke of defendant\u2019s past fondling. Acosta added that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>had made various suggestions to Kelly leading up to Kelly\u2019s expression of her intent to confront defendant. The prosecutor argued that Kelly\u2019s statement was admissible because it fell within the exception to the hearsay rule for a statement of state of mind and also within the exception for a spontaneous statement. In addition, the prosecutor argued that Kelly\u2019s statement was not offered to prove other violent criminal activity by defendant, but rather constituted aggravating evidence of the circumstances of the murder. In opposition, defense counsel argued that Kelly\u2019s statement could not be deemed spontaneous because it was elicited by questioning and was not made shortly after the past fondling by defendant to which it referred. Defense counsel also argued that Kelly\u2019s statement, even if it reflected her state of mind, was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The trial court ruled, again without prejudice to a later request by the People, that Kelly\u2019s statement was inadmissible. The trial court determined that Kelly\u2019s statement did not fall within the spontaneous-statement exception to the hearsay rule because it was elicited by questioning and also because it could not be said to have been made shortly \u00bfter defendant\u2019s past fondling. The trial court further determined that Kelly\u2019s statement did not fall within the state-of-mind exception, essentially because it was preceded by the suggestions made by Acosta.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In their case in aggravation, the People proceeded to call Alma Torres. Torres testified before the jury that Kelly was her best friend and a classmate, and that at school on the day on which the crimes were committed, Kelly \u201cjust was different. She didn\u2019t want to eat lunch, she didn\u2019t want to play, she didn\u2019t want to do nothing. She wasn\u2019t mad at me, she was just upset. She didn\u2019t want to tell me what was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">After Torres\u2019s testimony, outside the presence of the jury, the People again sought a ruling from the trial court that Kelly\u2019s statement was admissible. The prosecutor and defense counsel made arguments that were substantially similar to those they previously had made regarding the admissibility of Kelly\u2019s statements. At this time, stating that it had been \u201cbothered by,\u201d and had \u201cre-thought,\u201d its \u201cprior ruling,\u201d the trial court reversed itself and ruled that Kelly\u2019s statement was admissible, determining that it fell within the spontaneous-statement and state-of-mind exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In light of the trial court\u2019s ruling, the People called Acosta as a witness. On direct examination, Acosta testified as follows: Acosta was a friend and classmate of Kelly. On the day on which the crimes against Kelly were committed, Acosta discovered Kelly in a comer of a school bathroom, attempting to avoid contact and crying so hard that she was shaking and unable to catch her breath. Acosta went over to Kelly and asked what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>bothering her, but Kelly did not answer immediately. After Acosta continued her inquiry for about 15 or 20 minutes, Kelly, still crying, finally responded that for some time defendant \u201cwas touching her places where she knew that it was wrong to be touched,\u201d and that \u201cwhen she goes home from school and if. . . [defendant] was going to touch her places . . . that she knew .. . wasn\u2019t right, ... she was going to tell him to quit,\u201d and that \u201cif he wasn\u2019t, ... she was going to . . . tell him that she was going to tell her mother.\u201d After this conversation, Acosta and Kelly returned to class, but thereafter when Acosta saw Kelly during the remainder of the school day, Acosta observed that Kelly did not act as she usually did, but was quiet and withdrawn. Defendant did not subject Acosta to cross-examination. In their respective summations to the jury, the prosecutor mentioned Kelly\u2019s statement only briefly, and defense counsel did not mention it at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of Kelly\u2019s statement was error. The applicable standard of review is abuse of discretion, the test that governs the admissibility of evidence generally. \u201cUnderlying that determination [of admissibility] are questions of (1) relevance, (2) hearsay rule/state-of-mind exception, and (3) undue prejudice.\u201d <em>(People v. Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 264 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The trial court reasonably determined that Kelly\u2019s statement was not subject to the requirement of pretrial notice in section 190.3 for the admissibility of aggravating evidence other than the circumstances of the murder. At the outset, we observe that notwithstanding its several clauses, Kelly\u2019s utterances constitute a single and entire statement. The references to defendant\u2019s past fondling of Kelly and Kelly\u2019s intent to confront defendant are inextricably linked to each other for their context and meaning. Kelly\u2019s statement constituted aggravating evidence of the circumstances of the murder, suggesting that later that same day Kelly confronted defendant and that in response defendant murdered her wilfully and with premeditation and deliberation in order to avoid apprehension for his continuing acts of molestation, and not simply in a senseless explosion of violence. If defendant believed the jury might use Kelly\u2019s statement to find he had engaged in violent criminal activity <em>other than </em>the murder and the accompanying rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct, he could have moved for an instruction limiting the use of the statement (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 355), but he was not entitled to have the statement excluded pursuant to section 190.3. Furthermore, even if the People had offered Kelly\u2019s statement to prove violent criminal activity <em>other than </em>the murder and the accompanying rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct without complying with the pretrial notice requirement of section 190.3, it would be difficult to conclude that defendant suffered prejudice from the asserted lack of prior notice inasmuch as the prosecutor had notified defense counsel about Kelly\u2019s statement more than two weeks prior to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to it in his opening statement, and defense counsel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>request a continuance to respond (see, e.g., <em>People v. Williams (1997) 16 </em>Cal.4th 153, 241 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710]).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The trial court also reasonably determined that Kelly\u2019s statement was relevant to the circumstances of the murder, that is, it had a tendency to prove what transpired (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 210), because it suggested that Kelly confronted defendant and that in response defendant murdered her wilfully and with premeditation and deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Likewise, the trial court reasonably determined that Kelly\u2019s statement was not unduly prejudicial. Although Kelly\u2019s statement of course was damaging to defendant\u2019s position by suggesting that he murdered her wilfully and with premeditation and deliberation, such damage does not amount to undue prejudice <em>for purposes of exclusion of evidence. </em>(See <em>People v. Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 638 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189].) Relevant as it was to the circumstances of the murder, Kelly\u2019s statement carried a probative value that was not substantially outweighed by any threat to the fairness of the trial or the reliability of the outcome. (See <em>People v. Alvarez, </em>supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 204, fn. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Finally, whether or not Kelly\u2019s statement fell within the spontaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule, the trial court reasonably determined that the statement fell within the state-of-mind exception, specifically to prove Kelly\u2019s future conduct in confronting defendant prior to the murder in accordance with the intent expressed in her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">For purposes of the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule, a statement of state of mind is one that (1) reflects the declarant\u2019s mental state, and (2) is offered, among other purposes, to prove the declarant\u2019s conduct (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1250, subd. (a)(2)), including the declarant\u2019s future conduct in accordance with his or her expressed intent (e.g., <em>People v. Majors </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 385, 404 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 684, 956 P.2d 1137]; <em>People v. Alcalde </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 177, 185-188 [148 P.2d 627]), unless the statement was made under circumstances indicating lack of trustworthiness (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1252; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1250, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Here, Kelly\u2019s statement reflected her mental state, that is, her intent to confront defendant, even though the occurrence of such a confrontation itself depended on defendant\u2019s continued fondling (see <em>People v. Conrad </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 308, 325 [107 Cal.Rptr. 421]). Moreover, Kelly\u2019s statement was offered to prove her future conduct in accordance with the intent expressed in her statement, namely that she in fact confronted defendant prior to the murder. Lastly, Kelly\u2019s statement was not made under circumstances indicating a lack of trustworthiness, there being no hint of any \u201cmotive to misrepresent or to manufacture evidence\u201d or any similar circumstance (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 28B pt. 4 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foil. \u00a7 1252, p. 303). Although evidence like Kelly\u2019s statement has been held to be \u201cnot admissible if it refers <em>solely </em>to alleged past conduct on the part of the accused\u201d <em>(People v. Hamilton </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 881, 893-894 [13 Cal.Rptr. 649, 362 P.2d 473], italics added, overruled on another point by <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 431, 442 [82 Cal.Rptr. 494, 462 P.2d 22]; accord, <em>People v. Lew </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 774, 780 [69 Cal.Rptr. 102, 441 P.2d 942]), Kelly\u2019s statement did not refer solely to defendant\u2019s past fondling, but also referred to her own intent to confront him.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Even if we assume for the sake of discussion that Kelly\u2019s statement, although admissible to prove her confrontation of defendant, was inadmissible to prove defendant\u2019s past fondling, it would not have been rendered inadmissible on that basis. \u201cWhen evidence is admissible ... for one purpose and is inadmissible ... for another purpose,\u201d a trial court is not required to exclude the evidence, but rather \u201cupon request\u201d is required to give a limiting instruction \u201crestricting] the evidence to its proper scope.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 355.) Here, defendant did not request a limiting instruction of any sort.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although we have implied that even in the absence of such a request, a trial court nevertheless may be required to exclude such evidence when a limiting instruction would be ineffective (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 86, 104-105 [246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37]), in this case we cannot conclude that a limiting instruction would have been ineffective, particularly because in their respective summations to the jury the prosecutor mentioned Kelly\u2019s statement only briefly and defense counsel did not mention it at all.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>G. <em>Admission of Photograph of the Victim\u2019s Body at the Crime Scene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">At the guilt phase of the initial trial, outside the presence of the jury, the People sought to introduce into evidence People\u2019s exhibit No. 3, a photograph of Kelly\u2019s body at the crime scene taken from a distance, depicting Kelly in a pool of blood with articles of her clothing displaced and her body exposed, and People\u2019s exhibit No. 4, a similar photograph of Kelly\u2019s body at the crime scene taken close up, depicting Kelly with her throat slashed and with her body slashed from the chest through the belly and the pubic area toward the buttocks, opening the body cavity. Defendant objected that exhibits Nos. 3 and 4 both were inadmissible as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to both exhibits and excluded them, but without prejudice to reconsidering their admissibility. Subsequently, outside the presence of the jury, the People again sought to introduce the two photographs, and defendant again objected on the same grounds. On defense counsel\u2019s representation that he would concede before the jury that defendant acted with malice aforethought and intent to kill, the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to exhibit No. 4 and excluded it, but overruled defendant\u2019s objection to exhibit No. 3 and admitted it, determining in effect that it was relevant to the circumstances of the murder and not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On appeal in <em>Griffin I, </em>we rejected defendant\u2019s contention that exhibit No. 3 was unduly prejudicial and should have been excluded. In our prior opinion, we observed that exhibit No. 3, \u201calthough . . . unpleasant and explicit, [was] clinical and was taken from quite some distance,\u201d whereas exhibit No. 4, which the trial court excluded, was \u201cobviously more graphic and shocking.\u201d <em>(Griffin I, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 1028.)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In the midst of the People\u2019s case in aggravation at the penalty phase retrial, outside the presence of the jury, defendant objected in anticipation of the People\u2019s seeking to introduce exhibits Nos. 3 and 4, which bore the same designations they had at the guilt phase of the initial trial, on the grounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>irrelevance and (especially) undue prejudice. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection and stated it would admit both exhibits, in effect determining they were relevant to the circumstances of the murder and not unduly prejudicial. In addition, the trial court denied a request by defendant to admit only one of the two photographs, apparently exhibit No. 3. Subsequently, in the presence of the jury, the trial court admitted exhibits Nos. 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Defendant now contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of exhibit No. 4 was error. We disagree. The trial court reasonably determined that this exhibit was relevant and not unduly prejudicial, and therefore did not abuse its discretion. As for defendant\u2019s claim of irrelevance\u2014which the People argue was not preserved, an assertion controverted by the record on appeal\u2014exhibit No. 4 had a strong tendency to prove the circumstances of the murder, especially its brutality. As for defendant\u2019s claim of undue prejudice, exhibit No. 4 (as we implied in <em>Griffin I) </em>indeed is graphic and shocking, but so were defendant\u2019s crimes. Other evidence could, and did, depict Kelly\u2019s body at the crime scene, but none as clearly or as powerfully as this exhibit. The trial court reasonably determined that the probative value of the exhibit was not substantially outweighed by any threat it posed to the fairness of the trial or the reliability of the outcome. Defendant raises various complaints about exhibit No. 4\u2014for example, that it is large and shows Kelly\u2019s bowels distended by gas formed after death\u2014but he fails to demonstrate undue prejudice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">H. <em>Admission of Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Employment at a Slaughterhouse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Prior to the penalty phase retrial, the People notified defendant that they intended to introduce evidence, not offered at the initial trial, of defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company, a slaughterhouse, to establish the circumstances of the murder and specifically to prove that defendant slaughtered Kelly like an animal would be slaughtered.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Prior to opening statements, defense counsel, taking the position that evidence of defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company would be inadmissible as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, asked the trial court to instruct the prosecutor not to refer to such evidence in his opening statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>in advance of a ruling on its admissibility, and the trial court so instructed the prosecutor. In the course of his opening statement, the prosecutor did not mention defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company, but did make a comment\u2014about which defense counsel later complained\u2014that the \u201cevidence will. . . show you that. . . [Kelly] was . . . [slaughtered] much like an animal is slaughtered . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Subsequently, outside the presence of the jury, the People sought a ruling from the trial court that evidence of defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company was relevant to the circumstances of the murder and therefore admissible. Defendant opposed such a ruling on the ground that this evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">At an evidentiary hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, the People called David Kennedy, the owner of the Palace Meat Company, to give testimony relating to the business and defendant\u2019s employment there. The trial court deferred ruling on the admissibility of the evidence until it heard the testimony of Dr. Nelson, the pathologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">As pertinent here, Dr. Nelson testified to the effect that the person who murdered Kelly rendered her unconscious by strangulation, stabbed her neck with a very sharp knife and then slashed her throat severing the carotid artery and causing exsanguination, and finally after death slashed the body in four strokes from the chest through the belly and the pubic area toward the buttocks, opening the body cavity. After hearing the testimony of Dr. Nelson, the trial court ruled evidence of defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company admissible, determining expressly that it was not unduly prejudicial and impliedly that it was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In accordance with the trial court\u2019s ruling, the People, in their case in aggravation, called Kennedy as a witness. In pertinent part, Kennedy testified he was the owner of the Palace Meat Company. In the mid-1970\u2019s, Palace slaughtered sheep on an open kill-floor by rendering each animal unconscious with an electrical stun, stabbing its neck with a knife and then slashing its throat in order to sever the jugular vein and cause exsanguination, and finally after death slashing the body from the area of the hips where the legs join through the belly and the brisket toward the neck, opening the body cavity. In the mid-1970\u2019s, Palace employed defendant as a general helper, doing cleanup and similar chores. Although defendant did not himself slaughter sheep, he had the opportunity to observe the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence of his employment at the Palace Meat Company was error. We reject his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">First, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the evidence of defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>relevant in this case. The condition in which Kelly\u2019s body was found showed that defendant slaughtered her much like an animal would be slaughtered. The evidence in question had some tendency to prove that defendant treated Kelly more like an animal than a human being, and hence that he was more blameworthy on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Second, the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in determining that the evidence of defendant\u2019s employment at the Palace Meat Company was not unduly prejudicial. The evidence was brief, clear, and neutral, and as such its probative value properly could be found not to be substantially outweighed by any threat it posed to the fairness of the trial or the reliability of the outcome. Relying on <em>People v. Ortiz </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 926 [157 Cal.Rptr. 448], defendant asserts that the evidence was inflammatory. <em>Ortiz, </em>however, is clearly distinguishable. In the first place, <em>Ortiz </em>involved the admissibility of evidence at a noncapital trial, and evidence that is unduly prejudicial when offered at a noncapital trial or at the guilt phase of a capital trial is not necessarily unduly prejudicial in relation to the issue to be decided by the jury at the penalty phase of a capital trial. Second, <em>Ortiz </em>held only that the admission of evidence that a defendant engaged in ritual animal sacrifice to attack his credibility as a witness was unduly prejudicial, but the case does not suggest to us that the evidence in the present case was unduly prejudicial in establishing the circumstances of the murder. Defendant also asserts that the evidence risked confusing and misleading the jury, because it did not establish that defendant actually witnessed the slaughtering of sheep or that his killing of Kelly was conducted in a manner identical to that employed in the killing of sheep. But the circumstance that the evidence only suggested, and did not conclusively prove, that defendant slaughtered Kelly much like an animal is slaughtered goes not to its admissibility, but solely to its weight. Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the evidence was neither cumulative nor remote in time or logic.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">I. <em>Admission of Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Knowledge of Police Investigatory Procedures for Rape Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Outside the presence of the jury at the penalty phase retrial, defendant sought a ruling from the trial court that evidence of his knowledge of police investigatory procedures for rape offenses, not offered at the initial trial, was inadmissible as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. The People had indicated their intent to present such evidence before introducing evidence suggesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>that defendant washed his genital area in a cell latrine following his commission of the crimes against Kelly. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court ruled the evidence in question was admissible as relevant and not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In their case in aggravation, the People called Edward Singh as a witness. In pertinent part, he testified as follows: Singh had been a police officer in Kerman for about 20 years. Some months prior to the murder, he and defendant worked at Cal Western Patrol, a security agency. On one \u2022occasion, defendant told him of a desire to become a police officer, and he and defendant then discussed how crimes, including rape, are investigated, and spoke of the gathering of evidence of pubic hair, semen, blood, and saliva from the victim\u2019s body by means of swabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of his knowledge of police investigatory procedures for rape offenses was error. We disagree. The trial court reasonably determined that the evidence in question was relevant and not unduly prejudicial, inasmuch as it was brief, clear, and neutral, and that this evidence suggested defendant washed his genital area in the cell latrine in order to destroy evidence and avoid apprehension. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the evidence did not \u201cintimat[e] that . . . [he] was planning . . . [his] crimes all along, months before they took place,\u201d but only that he sought, after committing the crimes, to escape responsibility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">J. <em>Admission of Evidence of Other Violent Criminal Activity by Defendant Involving Lewd Acts Committed Against Lisa B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Prior to the penalty phase retrial, the People gave notice to defendant of their intent to present evidence, not introduced at the initial trial, of other violent criminal activity by him involving lewd acts committed against Lisa B. In reliance on the plurality opinion in <em>People v. Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72, footnote 25 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423], which was decided under the similar 1977 death penalty law, defendant requested that the trial court conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether there was substantial evidence to prove such other violent criminal activity\u2014a condition for the admissibility of any evidence of that sort. Substantial evidence of other violent criminal activity is evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact to find the existence of such activity beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People v. Rodrigues, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 1167-1168; <em>People v. Clair </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 672-678 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705]; see also <em>People v. Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 778 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782].) Before an individual juror may consider evidence of other violent criminal activity in aggravation, he or she must find the existence of such activity beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 809-811 [276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330].) There is no requirement, however, that the jury as a whole unanimously find the existence of other violent criminal activity beyond a reasonable doubt before an individual juror may consider such evidence in aggravation. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The trial court agreed to conduct a prehminary inquiry under <em>Phillips. </em>At the ensuing evidentiary hearing, Lisa was the sole witness. On direct examination, she testified in substance as follows: Lisa was a niece by marriage to Marvene Nordin, defendant\u2019s wife. Perhaps a year or two preceding the crimes committed against Kelly, when Lisa was four or five years of age, defendant engaged in lewd acts with her on two separate occasions. One time, he touched her around her vagina with his fingers, and the other time he penetrated her vagina with his fingers and then flicked open a knife with a folding blade; on each occasion, he threatened harm to others if she were to reveal what he had done. On cross-examination, Lisa admitted that defendant had an identical twin named Ronald Griffin, but stated she had been able to distinguish between defendant and Ronald whenever other persons called either man by his given name and also because defendant lived with Nordin and Ronald did not. She also admitted that at one time her mother had dated defendant and at another time Ronald. She further admitted that at some point she had reported that Ronald had sexually molested her, and that at another time she had made a similar report about an otherwise unidentified person. Finally, she conceded she could not date either of the two incidents or even state which occurred earlier and which later.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In arguing against the admissibility of the evidence of other violent criminal activity by defendant involving lewd acts committed against Lisa, defense counsel asserted at the outset that substantial evidence did not exist to prove the existence of such activity. Defense counsel alternately asserted that this evidence was unduly prejudicial because of its purported unreliability and its similarity to the charges of rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct alleged to have been committed by defendant against Kelly. Defense counsel also asserted that because of the purported lack of specificity in the details of the crimes, the evidence would violate what <em>People v. Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643] refers to as a defendant\u2019s \u201cright to present a defense\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 317, italics omitted), arising from the accusation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, evidently, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The trial court ruled that the evidence of other violent criminal activity by defendant involving lewd acts committed against Lisa was admissible, stating that \u201cthere is substantial evidence for this matter to be heard by the jury,\u201d and that the People have the \u201cobligation to prove these acts beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In light of the trial court\u2019s ruling, the People, in their case in aggravation, called Lisa as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On direct examination, Lisa stated that she was 18 years of age. Marvene Nordin, who was Kelly\u2019s mother, was Lisa\u2019s aunt by marriage; Lisa knew Kelly and defendant, who then was Nordin\u2019s husband and Kelly\u2019s stepfather. When Lisa was four or five years of age\u2014a year or two prior to the crimes committed against Kelly\u2014she often visited defendant and Nordin\u2019s home, where Nordin sometimes would babysit for her. On two occasions during that period, defendant engaged in sexual conduct with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On one of these two occasions\u2014Lisa could not remember which occurred earlier and which later\u2014she was visiting defendant and Nordin\u2019s home. Defendant drove her in his truck to a store, pulled behind the establishment, and parked. Defendant told Lisa to take her pants off, and when she declined to do so he pulled them off himself. Defendant began to touch Lisa with his fingers in the area around her vagina, causing pain, and she began to cry; she asked him to stop, trying to push him away with her feet, but he did not. All of a sudden, defendant stopped, and Lisa apparently pulled up her pants; he then turned on the ignition, told her to lie on the floorboard, and she complied. Before arriving back at his home, defendant warned Lisa that if she told anyone about the incident, he would hurt Kelly, and Lisa became frightened. Lisa did not tell Nordin about the incident because she was afraid that defendant would hurt Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">On the other occasion, Lisa again was visiting defendant and Nordin\u2019s home, sleeping in their bedroom in a nightshirt. When Lisa awoke, she left the room and found defendant sitting in a chair. After defendant told Lisa to sit by him, she drew near, and he put her on his lap. Defendant then fondled Lisa about her chest and legs, laid her down on the floor and laid himself nearby, and continued to fondle her, then proceeding to place his hand under her nightshirt toward the area around her vagina and finally penetrating her vagina with his fingers and causing pain. After some time, as defendant continued in this fashion, Lisa heard an automobile pull up in a driveway outside, and defendant stopped. Lisa heard a door of the vehicle shut. Defendant returned to the chair and flicked open a knife with a folding blade. Just then, the doorknob started to turn, and defendant warned Lisa that if she told the person entering the house about the incident, he would hurt her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>mother and her father. The door opened, and Nordin came in. Lisa did not tell Nordin about the incident, because she was afraid of defendant. At some point after defendant murdered Kelly, Lisa disclosed both incidents to a person whom she did not identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On cross-examination, Lisa admitted that defendant had a twin named Ronald Griffin, but denied that she remembered defendant and Ronald to be identical twins. Lisa stated that she could distinguish between defendant and Ronald whenever other persons called either man by his given name; she also stated she could distinguish between the two because defendant lived with Nordin and Ronald did not, and also because she believed Ronald to be larger than defendant. Lisa also admitted that at one time her mother had dated defendant and at another time had dated Ronald. Lisa further admitted that at some point she had reported that Ronald had sexually molested her, and that at another she had made a similar report about an otherwise unidentified person. There apparently was no independent corroboration of the two incidents that Lisa described as occurring in defendant\u2019s truck and at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Defendant now contends that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of other violent criminal activity by him involving lewd acts committed against Lisa. For the reasons that follow, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">As stated, a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence generally is reviewed for abuse of discretion. This standard applies in the specific context of evidence of other violent criminal activity. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 449 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442]; <em>People v. Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The trial court reasonably determined that substantial evidence existed to prove other violent criminal activity by defendant involving lewd acts committed against Lisa. A rational trier of fact could have credited Lisa\u2019s testimony, which generally was detailed, internally consistent, and not in conflict with any other evidence presented, and was sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant touched Lisa around her vagina with his fingers in the incident in his truck and penetrated her vagina with his fingers in the incident at his home. Both episodes involved violence by means of defendant\u2019s accompanying \u201cexpress . . . threat[s] to use . . . violence\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b))\u2014against Kelly in the former incident and against Lisa\u2019s mother and father in the latter incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The trial court also reasonably determined that the evidence of other violent criminal activity by defendant involving lewd acts committed against Lisa was not unduly prejudicial. Although a trial court may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>categorically exclude evidence of other violent criminal activity on the ground of undue prejudice, inasmuch as evidence of this sort is \u201cexpressly made admissible\u201d <em>(People v. Karis, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 641; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Box </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1200-1201 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 69, 5 P.3d 130]), it may exclude \u201cparticular items of [such] evidence\u201d on that ground <em>(People v. Karis, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 641, fn. 21), insofar as any item might \u201cunfairly persuade[]\u201d the trier of fact to find that the defendant engaged in the other violent criminal activity in question <em>(People v. Box, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 1201). The record precludes any characterization of Lisa\u2019s testimony as unfairly persuasive, in that it generally was detailed, internally consistent, and not in conflict with any other evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Lastly, the trial court reasonably determined that the evidence of other violent criminal activity by defendant involving lewd acts committed against Lisa would not violate defendant\u2019s right to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s accusation clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. In <em>Jones, </em>we concluded that a lack of specificity in the details of crimes like those committed by defendant against Lisa does not \u201cinevitably preclude a defense.\u201d <em>(People v. Jones, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 319.) The issue usually turns on the relative credibility of the defendant and the child, both generally and in the situation of the so-called resident child molester <em>(ibid.) </em>who either lives with, or has continuous access to, the child <em>(id. </em>at p. 299). \u201c[T]he defendant has the option of taking the witness stand and directly denying any wrongdoing. If credible, his testimony should prevail over the unspecific assertions of [the child]. In some cases, the very nonspecificity of the child\u2019s testimony, especially if uncorroborated, may offer defense counsel fertile field for challenging the child\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 320.) Here, although Lisa\u2019s testimony was lacking in specificity as to the date of the incidents in defendant\u2019s truck and at his home, it otherwise was quite specific, with Lisa describing precisely what defendant did to her. In any event, on cross-examination defense counsel challenged Lisa\u2019s credibility by suggesting misidentification or perhaps confabulation. Although defendant did not take the witness stand to deny Lisa\u2019s testimony, his choice to proceed in that fashion does not reflect any violation of his right to present a defense, but rather a decision to present a defense in a certain way, by relying upon defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Lisa.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>K. <em>Refusal of Request to Instruct on the Penetration Element of Rape and Sodomy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In its charge to the jury at the penalty phase retrial, the trial court instructed, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he defendant in this case has been found guilty of murder of the first degree. The allegation that the murder was committed under the special circumstances that the murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of rape, while the defendant was engaged in the commission of sodomy, and while the defendant was engaged in the commission of a lewd act with a child, has been specially found to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The trial court also instructed that \u201c[i]f you the Jury, individually <em>or </em>collectively, entertains any lingering doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt as to the conviction and/or special circumstance findings, you may weigh and consider such doubt in deciding what sentence is appropriate.\u201d The trial court, however, refused a request by defendant to instruct on the elements of murder, rape, and sodomy, or in the alternative to instruct at least on the penetration element of rape and sodomy, determining in substance that to do so might confuse the jury by inviting it to relitigate the related special circumstance findings and underlying convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal of his request to instruct on the penetration element of rape and sodomy was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We conclude that there is no need to determine whether the trial court erred in declining to give the requested instruction on penetration, because assuming, without deciding, that the trial court did err in failing to give such an instruction on request, we conclude that the error was not prejudicial in this case under any standard of prejudice. We reach this conclusion because (1) defendant was permitted to present evidence in mitigation to support his contention that there was a lingering doubt whether he had effected penetration and thereby committed rape and sodomy, (2) both counsel in their penalty phase closing arguments clearly discussed the evidence relating to penetration and the lingering doubt issue, and (3) there was no suggestion, either by the court or counsel, that penetration was not an element or an essential feature of the crimes of rape and sodomy. Under these circumstances, the absence of an instruction informing the jury, for purposes of the lingering doubt issue, that penetration is an element of the offenses of rape and robbery was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>L. <em>Failure to Instruct Against Double-counting of Assertedly Overlapping Special Circumstances and Underlying Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At the penalty phase retrial, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]n determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant, you shall consider all of the evidence . . . [and] shall consider, take into account and be guided by . . . [specified penalty] factors\u201d including \u201c[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding\u201d\u2014 namely, the murder of Kelly and the accompanying rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct\u2014and \u201cthe existence of any special circumstances found to be true\u201d\u2014that is, felony-murder rape, felony-murder sodomy, and felony-murder lewd conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In his opening brief, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to modify the above-quoted instruction in order to prevent the jury from double-counting the assertedly overlapping special circumstances\u2014felony-murder lewd conduct vis-\u00e1-vis felony-murder rape and felony-murder sodomy\u2014and the assertedly overlapping underlying crimes\u2014lewd conduct vis-\u00e1-vis rape and sodomy. Defendant asserts that this error improperly inflated evidence in aggravation over that in mitigation. In their brief, the People argue that defendant did not preserve any such claim for review on appeal, because he failed to request any modification to avoid the consequences of which he now complains and because the instruction actually given was correct and applicable. In his reply brief defendant has withdrawn his contention, in light of the People\u2019s argument. Accordingly, we need not address or resolve this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">M. <em>Refusal of Request to Instruct on Mercy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">At the penalty phase retrial, as stated above, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]n determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant, you shall consider all of the evidence . . . [and] shall consider, take into account and be guided by . . . [specified penalty] factors\u201d including, as pertinent here, \u201c[a]ny sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d The trial court also instructed the jury that \u201c[y]ou are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider.\u201d The court, however, denied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>request by defendant to give a number of instructions stating or suggesting that the jury could exercise mercy based on the evidence, in part because some of these requested instructions were duplicative of those quoted above. In their respective closing arguments, defense counsel explicitly urged the jury to exercise mercy and the prosecutor implicitly urged the jury not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to instruct the jury that it could exercise mercy based on the evidence was error. We have rejected substantially similar claims in the past (see, e.g., <em>People v. Smith </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 638 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 68 P.3d 302]; <em>People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 403 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 393 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 28 P.3d 34]), and we reject the present claim as well. A trial court, of course, may refuse an instruction that is duplicative. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 560 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 905 P.2d 420]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 697 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 805, fn. 12.) The question of the appropriate standard of review applicable to a determination of duplicativeness need not be resolved (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Berryman </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1048, 1079 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 867, 864 P.2d 40]), because even when scrutinized independently, the trial court\u2019s decision was sound. The instructions requested were clearly duplicative of the instructions given, which informed the jury that it had to \u201cconsider all of the evidence\u201d and could \u201cconsider, take into account and be guided by\u201d any factor, including \u201c[a]ny sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death,\u201d and that the jury was \u201cfree to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People v. Smith, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 638; <em>People v. Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 403; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 393 .)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Defendant argues that without the instructions he requested, a reasonable likelihood exists (see <em>People v. Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 663) that the jury was misled into believing it was precluded from considering and giving effect to at least some of the evidence that he presented in mitigation, in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But having received an instruction expressly declaring that it had to \u201cconsider all of the evidence\u201d and could \u201cconsider, take into account and be guided by\u201d any factor including \u201c[a]ny . . . aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>death,\u201d the jury adequately was advised that it could consider and give effect to <em>all </em>of the evidence presented by defendant in mitigation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">N. <em>Instruction on the Determination of Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">With regard to the determination of penalty, the trial court instructed the jury at the penalty phase retrial, apparently at the request of defendant as well as the People, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201cIt is now your duty to determine which of the two penalties, death or confinement in the state prison for life without possibility of parole, shall be imposed on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cAfter having heard all of the evidence, and after having heard and considered the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\u201cAn aggravating factor is any fact, condition or event attending the commission of a crime which increases its guilt or enormity, or adds to its injurious consequences which is above and beyond the elements of the crime itself. A mitigating circumstance is any fact, condition or event which as such, does not constitute a justification or excuse for the crime in question, but may be considered as an extenuating circumstance in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">\u201cThe weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignment of weights to any of them. You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider. In weighing the various circumstances you determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the aggravating circumstances with the totality of the mitigating circumstances. To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating circumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it [sz'c] warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s giving of the foregoing instruction was constitutionally deficient in various respects\u2014each of which, he acknowledges, we have rejected in prior decisions in passing upon substantially similar instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The standard of review for the legal correctness of an instruction is independent, inasmuch as the \u201cquestion is one of law, involving as it does the determination of the applicable legal principles.\u201d <em>(People v. Berryman, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1089.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">First, defendant challenges this sentence of the instruction; \u201cTo return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating circumstances are <em>so substantial </em>in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it [iic] <em>warrants </em>death instead of life without parole.\u201d (Italics added.) Defendant argues, in substance, that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause prohibit vagueness in guiding the jury and require reliability for any decision made, that the words \u201cso substantial\u201d rendered the instruction vague, and that the word \u201cwarrants\u201d made the ensuing verdict of death unreliable. In <em>People </em>v. <em>McPeters </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1148, 1194 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 832 P.2d 146], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Breaux </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 281, 315-316 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 821 P.2d 585], we rejected a similar attack on the asserted operation of the words \u201cso substantial\u201d and \u201cwarrants,\u201d respectively, and we again do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Second, defendant challenges the failure of the instruction to state that the People bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that death is the appropriate penalty. Defendant argues that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause imposes such a burden. In <em>People v. Berryman, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at page 1101, however, we held to the contrary, and we adhere to that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Third, defendant similarly challenges the failure of the instruction to state that in order to return a verdict of death, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances and that death is the appropriate penalty. Defendant argues that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause imposes such a requirement on the jury. But in <em>People v. Hawthorne </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 79 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 133, 841 P.2d 118], we concluded that the United States Constitution, including implicitly the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, does not impose any requirement of this sort, and we so conclude again.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Fourth, defendant challenges the failure of the instruction to state that in order to return a verdict of death, the jury must be unanimous in finding any aggravating circumstance underlying the verdict and must provide a written statement of reasons. Defendant argues, by implication, that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause and/or the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause demand such a finding and statement of reasons from the jury. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>[10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643], however, we impliedly held to the contrary, and now do so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Fifth, defendant challenges the sentence of the instruction defining a mitigating circumstance as \u201cany fact, condition or event which as such, does not constitute a justification or excuse for the crime in question, but may be considered as an extenuating circumstance in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty.\u201d Defendant argues that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, as construed in <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586, 604 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 98 S.Ct. 2954], generally require that the jury \u201cnot be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death,\u201d but that the definition of a mitigating circumstance incorporated in the instruction precluded the jury from giving such consideration. Although we agree with defendant concerning what is required by the two federal constitutional provisions in question, we otherwise disagree. A mitigating circumstance must not be reviewed in isolation, but rather in the context of the charge as a whole. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Reliford </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1007, 1013 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 254, 62 P.3d 601].)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">After such review, we conclude that no reasonable likelihood exists that the jury misunderstood or misapplied the definition of a mitigating circumstance as argued by defendant. The instruction made clear that \u201c[i]n determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant,\u201d the jury had to \u201cconsider all of the evidence\u201d and could \u201cconsider, take into account and be guided by\u201d any factor, including \u201c[a]ny sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d Defendant\u2019s citation of studies purportedly showing or suggesting the generally imperfect understanding of the concept of \u201cmitigation\u201d fails to establish any reasonable likelihood that the definition of a mitigating circumstance in this case misled the jury as to the scope of its responsibility in choosing between the two possible punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Defendant asserts that, in light of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428] and <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], we must reconsider any adverse conclusion that we otherwise might be inclined to reach on any aspect of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause requires the state to submit to a jury, and prove beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>doubt to the jury\u2019s unanimous satisfaction, every fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases the punishment for a crime beyond the maximum otherwise prescribed under state law. In <em>Ring, </em>the court held that <em>Apprendi </em>operates in the capital context.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, as we recently made plain in <em>People </em>v. <em>Prieto </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 262-263 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 66 P.3d 1123], <em>Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>are inapplicable to the determination of penalty in a capital case under California law. Under the law of this state, all of the facts that increase the punishment for murder of the first degree\u2014beyond the otherwise prescribed maximum of life imprisonment with possibility of parole to <em>either </em>life imprisonment without possibility of parole <em>or </em>death\u2014 already have been submitted to a jury (and proved beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury\u2019s unanimous satisfaction) in connection with at least one special circumstance, prior to the commencement of the penalty phase. (See \u00a7 190.2.) Therefore, at the penalty phase itself no further facts need to be proved in order to increase the punishment to either death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole, because both now are prescribed as potential penalties. It is true that at the penalty phase, the choice between death and life imprisonment without possibility of parole depends on a determination as to which of the two penalties is appropriate, which in turn depends on a determination whether the evidence in aggravation substantially outweighs that in mitigation. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 538-545 [230 Cal.Rptr. 834, 726 P.2d 516], &amp; especially fns. 13 &amp; 19 on pp. 541-542 &amp; 545, revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom. California v. Brown </em>(1986) 479 U.S. 538 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837].) But as explained, the ultimate determination of the appropriateness of the penalty and the subordinate determination of the balance of evidence of aggravation and mitigation do not entail the finding of facts that can increase the punishment for murder of the first degree beyond the maximum otherwise prescribed. Moreover, those determinations do not amount to the finding of facts, but rather constitute a single fundamentally normative assessment (see, e.g., <em>People v. Boyde </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 212, 252-255 [250 Cal.Rptr. 83, 758 P.2d 25], affd. <em>sub nom. Boyde </em>v. <em>California </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 370 [108 L.Ed.2d 316, 110 S.Ct. 1190]) that is outside the scope of <em>Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi. </em>(Cf. <em>Cooper Industries, Inc. v.

Specifically, defendant claims that the death penalty law fails adequately to narrow the class of death-eligible murderers because the law (1) defines murder of the first degree in a vague and overbroad fashion, in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (2) impermissibly leaves the narrowing function to prosecutorial discretion, in violation of the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the due process clauses of article I, sections 7 and 15, the cruel or unusual punishment clause of article I, section 17, and the equal protection clause of article I, section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In <em>People v. Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pages 403-404, we concluded that the death penalty law in fact adequately narrows the class of death-eligible murderers. There, we rejected a claim substantially similar to defendant\u2019s. Here, defendant adds only a bare invocation, without argument, of the federal and state constitutional guaranties of equal protection. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s claim as well. Lastly, in light of the crimes of which he was convicted, which included rape, sodomy, and lewd conduct in addition to murder and the special circumstances found true (which comprised felony-murder rape, felony-murder sodomy, and felony-murder lewd conduct), defendant is squarely within the class of death-eligible murderers, no matter how narrowly that class reasonably might be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Defendant also contends that the 1978 death penalty law violates the United States Constitution, both on its face and as applied, by failing to provide for intercase proportionality review\u2014specifically violating the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process and equal protection clauses, and some unidentified clause of the Sixth Amendment. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 1029 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183], we held that the United States Constitution, including explicitly the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, does not require intercase proportionality. Presented with no reason to reconsider our holding, we adhere to it in this case and accordingly reject defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Defendant contends that the 1978 death penalty law violates the United States and California Constitutions, both on their face and as applied, in several additional particulars, each of which he acknowledges we have rejected in other decisions. Defendant also claims that instructions given in this case in conformity with the death penalty law are themselves violative of the federal and state Constitutions in various respects, each of which he likewise acknowledges we have rejected in passing upon substantially similar instructions elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">First, defendant claims that the 1978 death penalty law, and the instructions given, violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause by failing to identify which penalty factors are aggravating and which penalty factors are mitigating. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 777-779 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113], we held that the United States Constitution, including implicitly the provisions on which defendant relies, does not require any such identification of aggravating and/or mitigating penalty factors. We come to the same conclusion expressly in the present case. Defendant argues that <em>Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>require us to reconsider this point, but we conclude they do not, because as we have explained these decisions are inapplicable to the determination of penalty in a capital case under California law. Further, in <em>People v. Fudge </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1126-1127 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36], we upheld substantially similar instructions against a substantially similar attack. The United States Constitution does not require the identification of aggravating and/or mitigating penalty factors in the instructions given to the jury, or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Second, defendant claims that the 1978 death penalty law, and the instructions given, violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial clause, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process and equal protection clauses, by failing to impose on the People the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that any given aggravating circumstance exists, that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, and that death is the appropriate penalty. Rejecting a like challenge to the death penalty law in <em>People v. Marshall </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 907, 935-936 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676], where the defendant\u2019s argument differed only in its omission of any reference to the Sixth Amendment, we concluded that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not impose any burden of that sort. We now reject defendant\u2019s challenge as well, finding that its invocation of the Sixth Amendment adds nothing of substance, because defendant erroneously assumes (as noted above) that <em>Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>are applicable to the determination of penalty in a capital case under California law. In <em>Marshall, </em>we also rejected a similar challenge to substantially identical instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Third, defendant claims that the 1978 death penalty law, and the instructions given, violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial clause, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process and equal protection clauses, and the analogous provisions of, apparently, article I, sections 7, 15, 16, and 17, by failing to require that in order to return a verdict of death, the jury must be unanimous in finding any aggravating circumstance underlying the verdict. In <em>People v. Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 691-692 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351], we concluded that neither the United States Constitution nor the California Constitution, including implicitly the provisions invoked in the present case, imposes any such requirement on the jury, and we adhere to that conclusion here. Moreover, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 103, 147 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 820 P.2d 559], vacated on other grounds <em>sub nomine Bacigalupo </em>v. <em>California </em>(1992) 506 U.S. 802 [121 L.Ed.2d 5, 113 S.Ct. 32], we specifically held that the Sixth Amendment does not impose any requirement of this sort. Defendant asks us to reconsider our holding in light of <em>Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi. </em>There is, however, no reason for us to do so, because\u2014as we have <em>explained\u2014Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>are inapplicable to the determination of penalty in a capital case under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Fourth, defendant claims that the 1978 death penalty law, and the instructions given, violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, and apparently the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial clause, by defining two of the penalty factors in terms of \u201c[w]hether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of <em>extreme </em>mental or emotional disturbance\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (d), italics added) and \u201c[wjhether or not <em>at the time of the offense </em>the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was <em>impaired </em>as a result of mental disease or defect, or the affects of intoxication\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (h), italics added). Defendant\u2019s argument is to the effect that the terms \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cimpairment at the time of the offense\u201d have a limiting effect and therefore are at odds with the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, which as noted generally require that the jury \u201cnot be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death\u201d <em>(Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 604). But in <em>People v. Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pages 540-541, we construed the death penalty law to allow just such consideration. The instructions in the present case, as quoted above, were expressly in accord with these requirements. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s complaint, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood or applied the terms \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201cimpairment at the time of the offense\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>isolation so as to preclude the jury from considering all that it was permitted to consider in support of the penalty of life imprisonment without possibility of parole rather than death. To the extent defendant argues that the term \u201cextreme\u201d is impermissibly vague for purposes of the death penalty law and the instructions given, and thus violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause among other provisions, we found such an argument unpersuasive in <em>People v. Taylor </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1155, 1179 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 34 P.3d 937], and adhere to that position in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Fifth, defendant claims that the 1978 death penalty law, and the instructions given, violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, the due process clauses of article I, sections 7 and 15, and the cruel or unusual punishment clause of article I, section 17, by failing to establish a presumption that life imprisonment without possibility of parole is the appropriate penalty in any given case. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 190 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980], we concluded in effect that neither the United States nor the California Constitution requires such a presumption. We adhere to that conclusion and on that basis reject defendant\u2019s reliance on the specific federal and state constitutional provisions he cites. Contrary to defendant\u2019s implication, <em>Ring </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>have no bearing on the conclusion we reach, because, as explained above, they are inapplicable to the determination of penalty in a capital case under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Sixth, defendant claims that the 1978 death penalty law, and the instructions given, violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment clause, the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, and, apparently, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial clause, to the extent the law allows the admission, and the instructions allowed the consideration, of evidence of other violent criminal activity that did not result in a conviction. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 701 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213], we explicitly rejected a claim similar to defendant\u2019s, impliedly concluding that the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments do not prohibit the admission or consideration of such evidence. Presented with no reason to do otherwise, we adhere to that conclusion and therefore reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">P. <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Defendant contends that all of the errors assertedly committed at the penalty phase retrial, considered together, require reversal of the judgment, because they cumulatively resulted in prejudicial violations of both the United States and California Constitutions\u2014specifically, the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment and the due process and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the due process clauses of article I, sections 7 and 15, the equal protection clause of article I, section 7, and the cruel or unusual punishment clause of article I, section 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">With only one exception, we have rejected all of defendant\u2019s claims of error. With respect to the claim that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on penetration as an element of rape and sodomy in connection with defendant\u2019s lingering doubt claim, we have assumed, without deciding, that the failure was error, and have found that any error in this regard was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 589-590.) Because there is no additional error to \u201ccumulate\u201d with that determination, defendant\u2019s claim of cumulative error is clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-12\"> All further unspecified section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> As indicated in part II.C, one of the 12 sworn jurors was excused for cause after completion of the selection of the four alternate jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> Subsequently, just prior to the hearing on defendant\u2019s automatic application to modify the verdict of death, the People made a motion seeking what they styled \u201caugmentation of [the] trial record\u201d in order, in pertinent part, to allow the prosecutor to articulate reasons for his peremptory challenges against prospective jurors or alternate jurors whom he believed were African-Americans. Defense counsel opposed the motion, arguing that the \u201crecord should stand on its own.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> In the course of proceedings to prepare the record on appeal, defendant applied for permission to prepare a settled statement essentially for the purpose of identifying which of the prospective jurors or alternate jurors whom the prosecutor peremptorily challenged were African-Americans and also to identify whether a certain prospective juror whom the prosecutor challenged for cause was African-American. We denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Defendant claims that to the extent the record on appeal is inadequate to support his claim of error as a result of our denial of his application for permission to prepare a settled statement, he has been denied meaningful appellate review in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and also the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (see <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 196, fn. 8 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365]). We disagree. (1) A settled statement operates to make up for the absence of a reporter\u2019s transcript of oral proceedings (see Cal. Rules of Court, rules 7 &amp; 36(b); see generally <em>Marks v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 176, 192-197 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 674, 38 P.3d 512]), and not to supply what was omitted from those proceedings (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuilaepa </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 569, 585 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 382, 842 P.2d 1142], affd. <em>sub nom. Tuilaepa v. California </em>(1993) 512 U.S. 967 [129 L.Ed.2d 750, 114 S.Ct. 2630] [stating that the \u201csettlement . . . process does not allow parties to create proceedings . . . which they neglected to [create] earlier\u201d]). If the record on appeal is inadequate, it is defendant who is responsible, inasmuch as he failed to include in the oral proceedings at trial the information that he improperly sought to insert through a settled statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Some of our decisions, including <em>People v. Davenport </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1171, 1201 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 800, 906 P.2d 1068], and <em>People v. Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 167 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521], have implied that a finding that a defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination is subject to review for abuse of discretion. Subsequent decisions, including those cited in the text, clarify that such a finding is examined for substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> Defendant apparently claims that under <em>People </em>v. <em>DeSantis </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1198, 1233-1234 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 628, 831 P.2d 1210], the trial court erred by failing to conduct any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>inquiry into whether Prospective Alternate Juror G. R. was asleep. In <em>DeSantis, </em>we concluded that the trial court did not err when it conducted a \u201cself-directed inquiry\u201d into whether certain jurors had fallen asleep. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1234.) The trial court here conducted just such an inquiry when it noticed that G. R. was \u201casleep during most of the voir dire\u201d and then \u201casked the bailiff to wake him up.\u201d The trial court was not required to do more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\"> Our conclusion that there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to establish a prima face case of purposeful discrimination would be no different were we to review the record on appeal relating to the three\u2014not four, as claimed by defendant\u2014other prospective jurors struck by the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges, and the additional prospective juror struck by the prosecutor\u2019s challenge for cause, who defendant <em>now </em>represents <em>may have been </em>African-Americans: C. E, J. H., W. M., and V. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">J. H., W. M., and V. P. were struck by peremptory challenge. V. P. made it plain that if she were sworn as a juror, she likely would not vote to impose the death penalty in this case. W. M. did so as well, and also expressed opposition to the death penalty generally. By contrast, J. H. indicated her rather strong support for the death penalty in the abstract, but at the same time stated that if she were a juror she probably could not vote to impose that punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">C. F. was struck pursuant to a challenge for cause. As discussed hereafter <em>(post, </em>pp. 560-561), C. F. was a warden at a state prison at which women condemned to death were incarcerated pending execution of sentence. C. F. stated that she would experience a personal and professional conflict of interest if she were to serve as a juror in a capital case at the same time as she participated in the administration of the death penalty. She indicated that she desired not to serve as a juror. In light of her statement, the prosecutor challenged her for cause, and the trial court excused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">In view of the foregoing, it is clear that with respect to the excusal of these four prospective jurors, there is substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to establish a prima face case of purposeful discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b595-15\"> Defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s asserted error in denying his <em>Wheeler </em>motion resulted in a judgment of death violative of the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. But, as we have concluded, the trial court\u2019s ruling was not erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> The relevant passage of M.
