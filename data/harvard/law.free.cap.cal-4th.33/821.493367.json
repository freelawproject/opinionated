J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC1\">Defendant Jaleh Wilkinson was convicted at trial of the offenses of battery on a custodial officer, driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. The Court of Appeal reversed defendant\u2019s convictions on two unrelated grounds, concluding that (1) the statutory scheme pertaining to battery on a custodial officer violates equal protection principles because the statutes allow battery on a custodial officer <em>without </em>injury to be punished more severely than battery on a custodial officer <em>with </em>injury, and (2) the trial court erred in denying defendant a hearing, pursuant to the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>doctrine <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]; <em>Frye v. United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923) 54 App. D.C. 46 [293 F. 1013]), regarding the admissibility of polygraph evidence to support defendant\u2019s claim that her commission of the charged offenses resulted from her unknowing and involuntary ingestion of drugs. We granted review to consider the Court of Appeal\u2019s resolution of both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that (1) the statutory provisions pertaining to battery on a custodial officer do not violate the equal protection clause of the state or federal Constitution, and (2) in light of the categorical prohibition on the admission of polygraph evidence in Evidence Code section 351.1, the trial court did not err in declining to hold a <em>KellylFrye </em>hearing regarding the evidence proffered by defendant. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Defendant was charged by information with the offenses of battery on a custodial officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243.1), a felony, and with driving a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and failing to stop at the scene of an accident (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20002, subd. (a)), both misdemeanors. At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that, in the early morning hours of February 27, 1999, a motorist observed defendant driving erratically on a street in the City of Santa Monica. Defendant\u2019s vehicle crossed over the center divider, struck a parked car, and continued down the street, swerving between lanes. Defendant eventually stopped her car at a curb and placed her head on the front passenger seat. After the motorist telephoned the police, officers responded and tapped on the window of defendant\u2019s parked car, whereupon defendant looked at one of the officers and drove off. The police gave chase for three blocks before defendant stopped. Defendant, who smelled strongly of alcohol and exhibited slurred speech, indicated she had consumed some drinks but not many. She could not complete a field sobriety test and did not respond when told she was required to submit to a blood or breath test for alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Officers transported defendant to the police station. She was belligerent during booking and resisted a patsearch. At one point, defendant grabbed a custodial officer\u2019s arm with both hands, causing a visible welt. When taken to a holding cell, defendant charged at an officer and yelled, kicked, and banged at the door. After the police reminded defendant that she would have to submit to a blood or breath test, defendant covered her ears, stated \u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d and began running around inside the cell. An officer testified defendant appeared to be under the influence of alcohol but not of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Defendant testified in her own defense as follows. On the night in question, defendant, a bank vice-president, went to a bar, where she met a man who offered to buy her a drink. She accepted and eventually consumed two glasses of wine. The man invited defendant to dinner, and they agreed to meet at a Santa Monica restaurant. At the restaurant, defendant consumed three alcoholic beverages over the course of three hours while she waited for the man, but he never arrived. She left her drink several times to use the restroom and to smoke a cigarette outside. She eventually left the restaurant, driving away without feeling any signs of intoxication. The next thing she remembered was waking up in jail, with no recollection of her encounter with the officers. After her release from custody, defendant filed a police complaint alleging she had been drugged.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A toxicologist, testifying on behalf of the defense, expressed the opinion that on the night in question defendant was under the influence of alcohol and gamma hydroxy butyrate (hereafter GHB), commonly known as a \u201cdate rape\u201d drug, basing his opinion on a review of the police report and a videotape of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct in the holding cell. GHB depresses the nervous system, exaggerates the effects of alcohol, and may cause drowsiness and memory loss. Depending upon a person\u2019s personality, the drug may make a person more emotional and combative. The toxicologist also suggested that if defendant was not under the influence of GHB, she must have been visibly drunk when she left the restaurant in order for her to exhibit the effects of intoxication so long after her last drink. A City of Concord police officer, testifying for the defense as a drug recognition expert, stated that defendant\u2019s symptoms appeared much more severe than what would be expected of someone who had consumed five alcoholic drinks over the course of several hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Prior to trial, defendant sought admission of evidence establishing that she had submitted to a polygraph examination and that, in the opinion of the polygraph examiner, she had \u201cpassed\u201d the exam, responding truthfully (in the negative) to queries regarding whether she knowingly consumed more than five drinks on the night in question, knowingly ingested GHB or any other drug, or knowingly attacked an officer in a detention cell. Defendant requested a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing, making an offer of proof that the polygraph examination technique employed by the examiner had been generally accepted in the scientific community and that the examiner employed proper procedures in administering the test. The trial court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, citing Evidence Code section 351.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The jury convicted defendant as charged, and the trial court placed defendant on formal probation for three years. The Court of Appeal reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, determining by a two-to-one vote that the statutory scheme pertaining to battery on a custodial officer violates equal protection principles, and unanimously concluding that the trial court erred by failing to hold a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing regarding the admissibility of defendant\u2019s proffered polygraph evidence. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review as to both issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Defendant was convicted of violating Penal Code section 243.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which states in full: \u201cWhen a battery is committed against the person of a custodial officer as defined in Section 831 of the Penal Code, and the person committing the offense knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a custodial officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties, and the custodial officer is engaged in the performance of his or her duties, the offense shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d Section 831, subdivision (a), in turn, defines a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d as \u201ca public officer, not a peace officer, employed by a law enforcement agency of a city or county who has the authority and responsibility for maintaining custody of prisoners and performs tasks related to the operation of a local detention facility used for the detention of persons usually pending arraignment or upon court order either for their own safekeeping or for the specific purpose of serving a sentence therein.\u201d Because section 243.1 provides for a punishment of imprisonment in state prison, but does not otherwise specify the term of imprisonment, under section 18 the offense is punishable \u201cby imprisonment in any of the state prisons for 16 months, or two or three years . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">At the time section 243.1 was enacted in 1976, <em>section 243 </em>prescribed the punishment (1) for simple battery (which section 243 made punishable as a misdemeanor), (2) for battery against a person who the defendant knew or should have known was a \u201cpeace officer or fireman engaged in the performance of his duties\u201d (which section 243 made punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor, commonly known as a \u201cwobbler\u201d), and (3) for battery resulting in the infliction of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d (which section 243 also made punishable as a wobbler, prescribing a punishment of two, three, or four years\u2019 imprisonment for a felony violation).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 150.5, pp. 5104-5105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>In 1981, the Legislature divided section 243 into subdivisions, with subdivision (a) covering simple battery (punishable as a misdemeanor with a maximum jail sentence of six months), subdivision (b) covering battery on a person who the defendant knows or should know is a peace officer, firefighter, etc. (punishable as a misdemeanor with a maximum jail sentence of one year), subdivision (c) covering battery on a peace officer, firefighter, etc., that results in the infliction of injury (a wobbler with a possible state prison term of 16 months, two years, or three years), and subdivision (d) covering battery that results in serious bodily injury (a wobbler with a possible prison term of two, three, or four years). (Stats. 1981, ch. 678, \u00a7 2, pp. 2476-2477.) The following year, in 1982, the Legislature added a reference to custodial officers to subdivisions (b) and (c) of section 243, defining custodial officers by reference to section 831. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1353, \u00a7 2, pp. 5048-5050; see current \u00a7 243, subd. (f)(6).) Thus, as amended in 1982, section 243, subdivision (b), provided that battery on a person who the defendant knows or reasonably should know is a custodial officer is punishable as a misdemeanor, with a maximum imprisonment of one year in county jail, and section 243, subdivision (c), provided that when such a battery results in injury to the custodial officer, the offense is punishable as a wobbler with possible imprisonment in state prison for 16 months, two years, or three years. Although the Legislature subsequently designated former section 243, subdivision (c), as current section 243, subdivision (c)(1) (with section 243, subdivision (c)(2), now covering battery on a peace officer or security guard with injury), the scheme of section 243 with respect to battery on a custodial officer has not been substantively changed since 1982.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">On appeal, defendant contended in relevant part that the current statutory scheme pertaining to battery on a custodial officer is \u201cirrational\u201d and violates the federal and state guarantees of equal protection because one who commits the \u201clesser\u201d offense of battery on a custodial officer <em>without </em>injury can receive felony punishment under section 243.1 while a person committing the \u201cgreater\u201d offense of battery on a custodial officer <em>with </em>injury can be convicted of a wobbler offense under section 243, subdivision (c)(1) and can receive a misdemeanor sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">A majority of the Court of Appeal below agreed with defendant, reasoning: \u201cIf the battery on custodial officer statutes included only two options, a straight felony under section 243.1 or a straight misdemeanor under section 243, subdivision (b), both of which have identical elements, prosecutorial discretion to choose different punishment between offenders engaging in similar conduct would not violate equal protection . . . . ffl What is troubling about our scheme, however, is its inclusion of a third charging option, the wobbler under section 243, subdivision (c)(1), which contains the additional requirement of infliction of an injury. . . . This third option raises the specter of complete irrationality in the scheme, because the <em>more serious </em>offense of battering a custodial officer with injury could be punished <em>less seriously </em>(an alternative felony/misdemeanor) than battering a custodial officer without injury (a straight felony under section 243.1).\u201d Because the \u201cgreater\u201d offense can be punished less severely, the majority found the scheme \u201cis not even rationally related to a scheme which would give prosecutors the entire range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>of punishments\u201d and \u201cencourages arbitrary, irrational charging\u201d because prosecutors have an incentive to prove the \u201clesser\u201d offense in order to obtain the greater punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The dissent found no equal protection violation, questioning whether there is substantial evidence that the custodial officer here suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d so as to allow a wobbler charge under section 243, subdivision (c)(1). The dissent also questioned whether a battery without injury necessarily was a less serious offense than battery with injury such that greater punishment for the former offense could not be imposed without violating equal protection principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">We begin our discussion with an overview of relevant case authority. Although the precise issue before us has not previously been addressed, at least two cases have discussed the legislative history surrounding the statutory scheme pertaining to battery on a custodial officer. In <em>In re Rochelle B. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1212 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 851], the juvenile court sustained a wardship petition, finding true the allegation that the minor committed battery on a custodial officer under section 243.1. The minor challenged the finding on appeal, contending that a juvenile probation counselor was not a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d within the meaning of sections 831 and 243.1. The Court of Appeal described in detail the legislative history of section 243.1, as well as the inclusion of \u201ccustodial officers\u201d within section 243. The court observed: \u201cA report of the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice suggested the bill \u2018should be amended to delete Section 243.1 of the Penal Code which is a special section referring only to custodial officers,\u2019 apparently to avoid the resulting duplication in provisions setting out aggravated penalties for batteries against \u2018custodial officers.\u2019 [Citation.] This suggestion was evidently ignored, with the result that two separate statutes now provide somewhat different punishments for batteries against custodial officers.\u201d <em>(In re Rochelle B., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1217, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">In <em>People v. Chenze </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 521, 525 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 362] <em>(Chenze), </em>the defendant contended that he was improperly charged and convicted under section 243.1 because that provision had been \u201cimpliedly repealed\u201d when the Legislature amended section 243 to include references to custodial officers. The defendant urged that the two statutes were in \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d since \u201c[t]he older statute, section 243.1, provides that any battery against a custodial officer is a felony,\u201d whereas \u201cthe more recent statute [i.e., section 243, subdivision (c)(1)] permits felony treatment only if injury is inflicted.\u201d <em>(Chenze, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 526.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>The Court of Appeal in <em>Chenze </em>disagreed that the two statutes were in irreconcilable conflict and thus rejected the claim of implied repeal. The court cited an enrolled bill report prepared by the California Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, which explained the need for an amendment to section 243 to include references to custodial officers notwithstanding the existence of section 243.1: \u201c \u2018According to the bill\u2019s sponsors, simple battery charges against custodial officers are rarely pursued by local prosecutors because the present law only provides for felony charges with imprisonment in a state prison. Thus, these violators are rarely, if ever, punished, [f] By providing for the option of county jail and/or fine for such violations, proponents hope that simple battery charges will be prosecuted more vigorously. Felony battery charges can still be pursued for the more serious cases.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Chenze, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 527.) In light of this legislative history, the court in <em>Chenze </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of irreconcilable conflict, reasoning: \u201cIn view of the fact that the Legislature amended section 243 to include custodial officers when it was aware of section 243.1, it is apparent the Legislature intended to give prosecutors a full panoply of prosecutorial options for a battery on a custodial officer. Under section 243, the offense may be punished as a misdemeanor (\u00a7 243, subd. (b)), or a misdemeanor or felony if injury is inflicted (\u00a7 243, subd. (c)(1)). But the Legislature also apparently envisioned that there might be circumstances under which no or only slight injury was inflicted, but felony charges would nonetheless still be appropriate. Accordingly, it did not repeal section 243.1, and has very recently amended it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although the defendant in <em>Chenze </em>pointed out that under section 243.1 <em>all </em>batteries on custodial officers are punished as felonies while under section 243, subdivision (c)(1), only batteries involving injury may be so punished, the Court of Appeal observed that \u201c \u2018[i]t is axiomatic the Legislature may criminalize the same conduct in different ways . . .\u2019 \u201d and the \u201cprosecutor has discretion to proceed under either of two statutes that proscribe the same conduct, but which prescribe different penalties. <em>(United States v. Batchelder </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 114, 123-125 [60 L.Ed.2d 755, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2203-2205] <em>[(Batchelder)]\u201d (Chenze, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 528.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batchelder, supra, </em>442 U.S. 114, cited in <em>Chenze, </em>concluded that the defendant properly could be sentenced under one federal firearms statute, although an almost identical statute prescribed a lesser punishment. In <em>Batchelder, </em>the court took note of legislative history indicating that Congress \u201cintended to enact two independent gun control statutes, each fully enforceable on its own terms . . . .\u201d <em>(Batchelder, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 119.) The court in <em>Batchelder </em>then stated that \u201c[t]his Court has long recognized that when an act violates more than one criminal statute, the Government may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against any class of defendants\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 123-124). The high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>court concluded that the statutory scheme at issue fell under this rule: \u201c[Tjhere is no appreciable difference between the discretion a prosecutor exercises when deciding whether to charge under one of two statutes with different elements and the discretion he exercises when choosing one of two statutes with identical elements. In the former situation, once he determines that the proof will support conviction under either statute, his decision is indistinguishable from the one he faces in the latter context. The prosecutor may be influenced by the penalties available upon conviction, but this fact, standing alone, does not give rise to a violation of the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We recently applied <em>Batchelder </em>in <em>Manduley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 537 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 168, 41 P.3d 3] <em>(Manduley), </em>in rejecting an equal protection challenge to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (d), as amended by Proposition 21. In relevant part, section 707, subdivision (d) was amended to expand the circumstances under which the prosecution may file criminal charges directly in adult court without first filing a wardship petition in the juvenile court and having that court conduct a fitness hearing to determine whether the matter should remain in juvenile court. The minors alleged that the amended provision violated equal protection principles because \u201cminors of the same age and charged with the same crime under the circumstances enumerated in section 707 [subdivision (d)] are subject either to the juvenile court law or to the criminal justice system, based solely upon a prosecutorial decision that is unguided by any statutory standards.\u201d <em>(Manduley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 567.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In <em>Manduley </em>we rejected this claim, reasoning in part: \u201c[A]ll minors who meet the criteria enumerated in [Welfare and Institutions Code] section 707 [, subdivision] (d) equally are subject to the prosecutor\u2019s discretion whether to file charges in criminal court. Any unequal treatment of such minors who commit the same crime under similar circumstances results solely from the decisions of individual prosecutors whether to file against particular minors a petition in juvenile court or instead an accusatory pleading in criminal court. Although, as petitioners assert, a prosecutor\u2019s decision in this regard can result in important consequences to the accused minor, so does a decision by a prosecutor to initiate criminal charges against <em>any </em>individual, including an adult.\u201d <em>(Manduley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 568.) We explained in <em>Manduley </em>that \u201cpetitioners cannot establish a violation of their right to the equal protection of the laws by showing that other minors in circumstances similar to those of petitioners can be prosecuted under the juvenile court law\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 570), likening a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to file adult criminal charges (instead of a juvenile court petition) to a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to bring charges under statutes proscribing similar conduct but with differing penalties (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 569-570). Accordingly, our decision in <em>Manduley </em>concluded that the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s discretion to select those statutorily eligible cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>which to seek a criminal disposition against a minor\u2014based upon permissible factors such as the circumstances of the crime, the background of the minor, or a desire to show leniency, for example\u2014does not violate the equal protection clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The Attorney General contends the statutory scheme before us does not violate equal protection principles because all persons who commit battery on a custodial officer are subject to the same statutory scheme and are not treated differently. He asserts that any possible disparate treatment results from charging decisions of prosecutors that, under <em>Batchelder </em>and <em>Manduley, </em>do not violate equal protection principles. The Attorney General further argues that in resolving the equal protection issue, we should conduct so-called rational basis review and find that there exists a rational basis for the statutory scheme at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Defendant argues, in contrast, that so-called strict scrutiny should apply to the equal protection question at issue, because the present classification involves the \u201cfundamental interest\u201d of the \u201cright to liberty.\u201d Further, defendant contends that even assuming that rational basis review applies, the Court of Appeal majority properly concluded that the statutory scheme before the court was irrational because it allows one who commits the \u201cgreater\u201d offense (battery on a custodial officer with injury) to be punished less severely than one who commits the \u201clesser\u201d offense (battery on a custodial officer without injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">It is a fundamental principle that, \u201c[t]o succeed on [a] claim under the equal protection clause, [a defendant] first must show that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.\u201d <em>(Manduley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 568; see <em>In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549].)  \u201cIn considering whether state legislation violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... we apply different levels of scrutiny to different types of classifications. At a minimum, a statutory classification must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. [Citations.] Classifications based on race or national origin . . . and classifications affecting fundamental rights ... are given the most exacting scrutiny. Between these extremes of rational basis review and strict scrutiny lies a level of intermediate scrutiny, which generally has been applied to discriminatory classifications based on sex or illegitimacy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Clark v. Jeter </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 456, 461 [100 L.Ed.2d 465, 108 S.Ct. 1910]; see also <em>Manduley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 571 [\u201cequal protection provisions in the California Constitution \u2018have been generally thought ... to be substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>equivalent of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Defendant relies upon <em>People v. Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375] and its progeny for her claim that the strict scrutiny standard applies in the situation before us. The court in <em>Olivas </em>considered an equal protection challenge to a statute that granted a trial court discretion to commit a defendant who was convicted in an adult criminal prosecution, and was between 16 and 21 years of age, to the California Youth Authority for a term longer than he or she would have received had the defendant been sentenced as an adult. Concluding that \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d constitutes a fundamental right that triggers application of the strict scrutiny standard, <em>Olivas </em>stated: \u201cNo reason has been suggested, nor can we conceive of any, why the concern for personal liberty implicit in both the California and federal Constitutions is any less compelling in defendant\u2019s case. We believe that those charters are no less vigilant in protecting against continuing deprivations of liberty than are their due process clauses in protecting against the initial deprivation of that liberty. We conclude that personal liberty is a fundamental interest, second only to life itself, as an interest protected under both the California and United States Constitutions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 250-251; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 797, 800-801 [204 Cal.Rptr. 234] [following <em>Olivas </em>and applying strict scrutiny to an equal protection challenge to a prior-prison-term enhancement statute]; <em>People v. Gonzalez </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 274, 277 [146 Cal.Rptr. 417] [citing <em>Olivas </em>for the proposition that \u201c[classifications which deal with restraints upon personal liberty are subject to the strict scrutiny test applicable to equal protection of fundamental interests.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The language in <em>Olivas </em>could be interpreted to require application of the strict scrutiny standard whenever one challenges upon equal protection grounds a penal statute or statutes that authorize different sentences for comparable crimes, because such statutes always implicate the right to \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d of the affected individuals. Nevertheless, <em>Olivas </em>properly has not been read so broadly. As the court observed in <em>People v. Davis </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 250 [154 Cal.Rptr. 817]: \u201cIt appears . . . that the <em>Olivas </em>court did not want to increase substantially the degree of judicial supervision of the Legislature\u2019s criminal justice policies. Such a highly intrusive judicial reexamination of legislative classifications is not merited by a close reading of <em>Olivas. </em>There is language in the <em>Olivas </em>opinion that emphasizes the narrowness of the holding. For instance, the court noted that [the statute in question] was constitutionally infirm because persons committed under the statute had been \u2018prosecuted <em>as adults, </em>adjudged by the same standards which apply to <em>any competent adult, </em>and convicted <em>as adults in adult courts\u2019 ([Olivas, supra,] </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 242-243.) This language requires only that the boundaries between the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>rigorously maintained. We do not read <em>Olivas </em>as requiring the courts to subject all criminal classifications to strict scrutiny requiring the showing of a compelling state interest therefor.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.3d at p. 258.) Other courts similarly have concluded that a broad reading of <em>Olivas, </em>as advocated by defendant here, would \u201cintrude[] too heavily on the police power and the Legislature\u2019s prerogative to set criminal justice policy.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1049 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 156]; see <em>People v. Owens </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 798, 802 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 428] [\u201cCalifornia courts have never accepted the general proposition that \u2018all criminal laws, because they may result in a defendant\u2019s incarceration, are perforce subject to strict judicial scrutiny,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>People v. Silva </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1167 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 181]]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 783, 796 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 150] [\u201cDetermining gradations of culpability . . . does not implicate the strict scrutiny test for equal protection purposes.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We find the rational basis test applicable here. Defendant contends that the statutory scheme regarding battery on a custodial officer violates equal protection principles because it allows the \u201clesser\u201d offense of battery without injury to be punished more severely than the \u201cgreater\u201d offense of battery with injury. A defendant, however, \u201cdoes not have a fundamental interest in a specific term of imprisonment or in the designation a particular crime receives.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 74, 88 [223 Cal.Rptr. 465]; see <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1116 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 447] [finding the rational basis test applicable to equal protection challenge involving \u201can alleged sentencing disparity\u201d].) Defendant makes no claim that the classification here at issue involves a suspect class, nor does her claim implicate any interest akin to that at issue in <em>Olivas, </em>in which an individual faced a longer period of confinement if treated as a juvenile rather than as an adult. Application of the strict scrutiny standard in this context would be incompatible with the broad discretion the Legislature traditionally has been understood to exercise in defining crimes and specifying punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Turning to the merits of defendant\u2019s claim, we find it unpersuasive. <em>Batchelder </em>instructs us that neither the existence of two identical criminal statutes prescribing different levels of punishments, nor the exercise of a prosecutor\u2019s discretion in charging under one such statute and not the other, violates equal protection principles. <em>(Batchelder, supra, </em>442 U.S. at pp. 124-125.)  Thus, defendant may not complain that she was charged with a felony violation under section 243.1 even though section 243, subdivision (b) is an identical statute prescribing a lesser punishment. As we observed in <em>Manduley, </em>numerous factors properly may enter into a prosecutor\u2019s decision to charge under one statute and not another, such as a defendant\u2019s background and the severity of the crime, and so long as there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>no showing that a defendant \u201chas been singled out deliberately for prosecution on the basis of some invidious criterion,\u201d that is, \u201c \u2018one that is arbitrary and thus unjustified because it bears no rational relationship to legitimate law enforcement interests [,]\u2019 \u201d the defendant cannot make out an equal protection violation. (Manduley; <em>supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 568-569.) Defendant \u201cdoes not allege that [her] prosecution was motivated by improper considerations.\u201d <em>(Batchelder, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 125, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Defendant, citing section 243, subdivision (c)(1), claims that the statutory scheme is irrational, based on her assertion that under the current scheme the \u201clesser\u201d offense of battery on a custodial officer without injury may be punished more severely than the \u201cgreater\u201d offense of battery on a custodial officer with injury. Defendant\u2019s assertion is based upon the questionable premise that battery on a custodial officer without injury always is a less serious offense than battery with injury, so as to warrant inevitably a lesser punishment. The dissent below questioned whether a hypothetical defendant \u201cwho, in the course of grabbing the arm of a correctional officer, inflicts a puncture wound with her fingernail that requires medical attention\u201d would be more culpable \u201cthan a defendant who repeatedly hits and kicks the correctional officer, intending to cause serious injury but does not do so through no lack of effort.\u201d As recounted by the court in <em>Chenze, </em>the Legislature amended section 243 to include references to custodial officers while simultaneously not repealing section 243.1. The legislative history of the amendment suggests the amendment was intended to allow misdemeanor prosecutions of batteries committed on custodial officers, and the Legislature did not repeal section 243.1 to allow felony prosecutions for more serious cases, even if no injury was inflicted. (See <em>Chenze, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 527.) The Legislature\u2019s actions tend to demonstrate it contemplated that the ostensible \u201clesser\u201d offense of battery without injury sometimes may constitute a more serious offense and merit greater punishment than the \u201cgreater\u201d offense of battery accompanied by injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Another premise underlying defendant\u2019s claim of irrationality that the current statutory scheme allows battery on a custodial officer, without injury, to be punished \u201cmore severely\u201d than battery with injury appears somewhat questionable. As noted, a person who commits battery on a custodial officer, without injury, faces the same maximum imprisonment under section 243.1 as one who commits battery on a custodial officer with injury under section 243, subdivision (c)(1), namely state imprisonment for 16 months, two years, or three years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, a person who does not inflict injury may be prosecuted under section 243, subdivision (b) and receive a misdemeanor sentence, the same sentence that a person who does inflict injury may receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>under section 243, subdivision (c)(1). The only difference between sections 243.1 and 243, subdivision (b) on the one hand, and section 243, subdivision (c)(1) on the other, is that, because section 243, subdivision (c)(1) is a wobbler, a trial court has discretion at sentencing either to impose misdemeanor punishment or grant probation and later, upon the defendant\u2019s successful completion of probation, declare the offense to be a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 17, subd. (b)(1), (3).) A magistrate also has discretion at the preliminary hearing to determine that a wobbler offense is a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 17, subd. (b)(5).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The circumstance that the Legislature did not grant to the trial court the same discretion in prosecutions under section 243.1 to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor as it did for prosecutions under section 243, subdivision (c) does not render the statutory scheme unconstitutional. A rational basis for these statutes exists; the Legislature reasonably could have concluded that reduction of the section 243.1 offense is not appropriate in cases of a battery on a custodial officer that is deemed serious enough by the prosecutor to warrant felony prosecution under the latter statute.  As the Legislature properly may eliminate a trial court\u2019s discretion to dismiss an action or strike an allegation in furtherance of justice (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 518 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628]; <em>People v. Thomas </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 206, 209-214 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 174, 841 P.2d 159]), so too may it by defining an offense as a straight felony deny a trial court discretion to reduce an offense to a misdemeanor. \u201cIt is the prerogative, indeed the duty, of the Legislature to recognize degrees of culpability when drafting a Penal Code.\u201d <em>(Michael M. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 608, 613 [159 Cal.Rptr. 340, 601 P.2d 572] [rejecting an equal protection challenge against the statutory rape law].) As stated in <em>People v. Flores, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d 74: \u201cThe decision of how long a particular term of punishment should be is left properly to the Legislature. The Legislature is responsible for determining which class of crimes deserves certain punishments and which crimes should be distinguished from others. As long as the Legislature acts rationally, such determinations should not be disturbed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88 [finding the Legislature did not violate equal protection principles by not dividing the crime of attempted murder into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>degrees].) Because a rational basis exists for the statutory scheme pertaining to battery on a custodial officer, these statutes are not vulnerable to challenge under the equal protection clause. (See <em>People v. Romo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 189, 196-197 [121 Cal.Rptr. 111, 534 P.2d 1015] [rejecting equal protection challenge based upon the claim that assault could be punished more severely than the greater offense of assault with intent to commit murder].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">With regard to the second issue before us, the Attorney General contends the Court of Appeal erred by remanding for a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing, because Evidence Code section 351.1 establishes a categorical prohibition on the admission of polygraph evidence in criminal cases absent a stipulation. Subdivision (a) of section 351.1, which was enacted in 1983, provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the results of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer to take, failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination, shall not be admitted into evidence in any criminal proceeding, including pretrial and post conviction motions and hearings, or in any trial or hearing of a juvenile for a criminal offense, whether heard in juvenile or adult court, unless all parties stipulate to the admission of such results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">As noted, prior to trial defendant filed a written motion seeking an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence tending to establish that she had \u201cpassed\u201d a polygraph examination. Defendant indicated that at such hearing she would present testimony by \u201cone or more experts\u201d proving that polygraph examinations now were generally accepted in the scientific community within the meaning of the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test. As an offer of proof, defendant explained that the polygraph expert who examined her utilized the \u201ccontrol question\u201d method;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that defense experts would testify this method is accepted in the scientific community, as established by scientific studies; and that proper procedures were employed in administering the test under this method. Defendant also asserted that other jurisdictions have found polygraph evidence to be accepted in the scientific community. Defendant attached as an exhibit to her motion an issue of the journal Polygraph a publication of the American Polygraph Association (APA) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>discussing the United States Supreme Court case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer </em>(1998) 523 U.S. 303 [140 L.Ed.2d 413, 118 S.Ct. 1261] (still pending at the time this issue of the journal was published) and including the parties\u2019 briefs in <em>Scheffer </em>as well as an amicus curiae brief filed in that case by the APA. Defendant acknowledged that Evidence Code section 351.1 bars the admission of polygraph evidence in criminal proceedings unless all parties stipulate to its admission, but argued that this statutory provision improperly interfered with her federal constitutional right to present a defense. The trial court, declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing, held that under section 351.1 \u201cthe evidence is inadmissible, period, <em>Kelly </em>or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On appeal, defendant contended that, notwithstanding the apparent categorical prohibition of Evidence Code section 351.1, she was entitled to a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of her proposed polygraph evidence under the reasoning of this court\u2019s decisions in <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 49, 920 P.2d 1254] <em>(Jackson), </em>and <em>People v. Fudge </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36] <em>(Fudge) </em>(discussed <em>post). </em>The Court of Appeal agreed with defendant that she had \u201cmade a sufficient offer of proof to entitle her to a [Kelly/Frye] hearing\u201d under the reasoning of <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Fudge, </em>observing that \u201cwe do not see what more such an offer would need to meet the threshold required to convene such a hearing.\u201d The court, concluding that the denial of a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing prejudiced defendant, remanded the case to the trial court with directions to conduct such a hearing and to set aside defendant\u2019s convictions in the event the trial court \u201cconcludes the polygraph evidence is admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Prior to the enactment of Evidence Code section 351.1, the admission of polygraph evidence in California was governed by the test of <em>Frye v. United States, supra, </em>293 F. 1013. Under that test, one who seeks the admission of evidence based upon a new scientific technique must make \u201ca preliminary showing of general acceptance of the new technique in the relevant scientific community.\u201d <em>(Kelly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 30; see <em>id. </em>at p. 32 [\u201creaffirming] our allegiance\u201d to the <em>Frye </em>\u201c \u2018general acceptance\u2019 \u201d test for new scientific techniques]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Leahy </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 587, 593-604 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 663, 882 P.2d 321] [retaining the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test as the applicable California standard and declining to adopt the new federal standard set forth in <em>Daubert v.

The majority, not finding any provision in the Evidence Code expressly barring the admission of polygraph evidence, concluded the defendant was entitled to a hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence, suggesting that the polygraph evidence should be admitted so long as the evidence was relevant (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210), its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the probability of undue prejudice <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 352), and the defendant could satisfy the requirements for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>admission of expert testimony <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 801 [expert opinion testimony]; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 720 [qualification of expert witness]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 405 [determination of preliminary fact]). <em>(Witherspoon, supra, </em>at pp. 30-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\u201cIt was in reaction to <em>Witherspoon </em>that the Legislature enacted Evidence Code section 351.1.\u201d <em>(People v.

The Assembly Committee on Criminal Law and Public Safety\u2019s analysis of the bill that became section 351.1 expressly stated the bill was \u201c \u2018intended to overrule <em>[Witherspoon] </em>and to create an exception to the truth-in-evidence section of Proposition 8 that bars exclusion of any relevant evidence.\u2019 (Assembly Com. on Crim.

Legislative history materials expressed concerns that (1) the <em>Witherspoon </em>procedure would \u201c \u2018substantially increase trial time by requiring courts to litigate collateral issues regarding the reliability of the particular test and qualifications of the specific polygraph examiner in every case,\u2019 \u201d (2) polygraph testing procedures lack standardization and cannot be tested for accuracy, and (3) jurors would \u201c \u2018assign too much credence to the results of a polygraph examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kegler, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at p. 89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">As past decisions make clear, the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test constitutes a judicially created rule relating to the admissibility of certain types of evidence and, as such, a rule that is subject to legislative revision. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Leahy, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 587, 604 [taking note of legislative failure to abrogate or modify the general <em>Kelly/Frye </em>standard]; <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., supra, </em>509 U.S. 579, 585-589 <em>[Frye </em>test superseded in federal courts by the enactment of the Federal Rules of Evidence].) By enacting Evidence Code section 351.1, the Legislature abrogated the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>rule with respect to the admission of polygraph evidence in criminal cases. As noted, the Legislature enacted section 351.1 to overrule the then recently decided appellate court decision in <em>Witherspoon, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d 24, which had criticized the routine application of the <em>Frye </em>test to exclude polygraph evidence and had suggested that such evidence could be admitted if the proponent made a showing of admissibility under certain provisions of the Evidence Code.  Thus, in adopting Evidence Code section 351.1, the Legislature effectively codified the rule set forth in the <em>pre-Witherspoon </em>California cases involving polygraph evidence, namely that such evidence is categorically inadmissible in the absence of the stipulation of all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">This understanding of Evidence Code section 351.1 is consistent with numerous cases that subsequently have interpreted the statute to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>polygraph evidence categorically in criminal cases, absent the stipulation of the parties. (See <em>In re Aontae D. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 167, 173 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 176]; <em>Kegler, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at p. 84; <em>In re Kathleen W, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 72.) Defendant concedes that this is the import of section 351.1, but she argues she nonetheless was entitled to a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing under this court\u2019s precedents, in particular the decisions in <em>Jackson, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 1164, and <em>Fudge, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 1075 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36]. Insofar as section 351.l\u2019s categorical exclusion is applied to deprive her of the opportunity to demonstrate the current reliability of proffered polygraph evidence under the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>standard, defendant claims the statute infringes upon her right to present a defense at trial, in violation of the federal Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">We first address defendant\u2019s claim that she was entitled to a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing notwithstanding Evidence Code section 351.1. We begin with a review of the relevant portions of the decisions in <em>Jackson, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 1164, and <em>Fudge, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 1075, upon which defendant relies. In <em>Jackson, </em>the defendant, at the guilt phase of a capital trial, sought to present evidence that he had \u201cpassed\u201d a polygraph test and had stated truthfully in the polygraph session that he had not killed the victim. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 1212.) The defendant in <em>Jackson </em>contended he was entitled to a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing notwithstanding section 351.1, arguing that the statute\u2019s exclusion of such \u201creliable exculpatory evidence\u201d denied him his right to due process of law under the federal Constitution. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 1212.) We rejected this claim, reasoning: \u201cEven if defendant\u2019s argument were true in the abstract, he has failed to make the proper offer of proof under <em>Kelly/Frye </em>that the polygraph is now viewed in the scientific community as a reliable technique.

We have previously held that such an offer of proof is necessary to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>(People v.

Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1094-1095 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619].) Other cases similarly have rejected federal constitutional challenges to section 351.1 because of the defendant\u2019s failure to make an offer of proof regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 870-871 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Koontz </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1041, 1090 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 46 P.3d 335]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 264 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3]; <em>People v.

The constitutional challenges to section 351.1 raised in the foregoing cases generally have involved claims that the exclusion of polygraph evidence deprived a defendant of his or her right to present \u201creliable exculpatory evidence\u201d at the guilt phase of a capital trial (see <em>Jackson, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 1212-1213), \u201crelevant mitigating evidence\u201d at the penalty phase (see <em>Fudge, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 1122-1123; see also <em>People v. Koontz, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1090), or impeachment evidence (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 870-871; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ayala, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 264; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 419). Because the constitutional challenges to section 351.1\u2019s exclusion of polygraph evidence rest on the premise that the statute would abridge a defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to due process and to present a defense <em>only </em>z/the proffered evidence were shown to be reliable, we have required those who would challenge section 351.1 on these grounds to make an adequate offer of proof regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence. And because the defendants in those prior cases failed to make the requisite offer of proof regarding the reliability of the proffered polygraph evidence, we did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the occasion to decide the substantive merits of the constitutional claims regarding the exclusion of polygraph evidence under section 351.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The Court of Appeal correctly concluded in the present case that defendant had preserved her constitutional challenge to section 351.1 by making her offer of proof regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence under <em>Kelly/Frye. </em>The court, however, went further and remanded the case to the trial court to conduct a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing, directing the trial court to set aside the judgment if that court found the polygraph evidence to be \u201cadmissible\u201d under the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>standard, that is, if defendant demonstrated at the hearing that the polygraph technique employed was generally accepted in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Although our past cases have determined that an offer of proof regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence is a prerequisite for raising a constitutional challenge against Evidence Code section 351.1\u2019s categorical exclusion, we never have held that such proof is sufficient by itself to make out such a claim, that is, we never have suggested that evidence that satisfies the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test must, as a constitutional matter, be admitted in evidence notwithstanding the statutory provision barring such admission. Indeed, in our recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th 833, we cautioned: \u201cBefore a criminal defendant can establish a federal due process right to use the results of a polygraph examination, it is necessary <em>(although perhaps not sufficient) </em>to offer proof that the technique has become generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 871, italics added.) Thus, the Court of Appeal erred by remanding the case for a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing without specifically addressing the question whether section 351.1\u2019s categorical exclusion of polygraph evidence would be unconstitutional in the event defendant is able to satisfy the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test. Because defendant has preserved her federal constitutional challenge to section 351.1, we now address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The Attorney General contends that under the reasoning of <em>United States v. Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. 303, the categorical exclusion of polygraph evidence mandated by Evidence Code section 351.1 does not violate the federal Constitution. In that case, the United States Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to Military Rules of Evidence, rule 707(a), which bans polygraph evidence in military trials.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant, an airman who faced a military court-martial for alleged drug use, sought the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>evidence that he had \u201cpassed\u201d a polygraph examination, in order to bolster his testimony that he innocently had ingested the drugs. In a portion of the opinion authored by Justice Thomas and joined by seven other justices,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the high court noted that \u201cthere is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable,\u201d observing that this lack of consensus is \u201creflected in the disagreement among state and federal courts concerning both the admissibility and the reliability of polygraph evidence.\u201d <em>(United States v. Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at pp. 309-311 (lead opn. of Thomas, J.).) hi light of this circumstance, the court concluded that the per se exclusion of polygraph evidence \u201cis a rational and proportional means of advancing the legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence\u201d and that \u201c[individual jurisdictions therefore may reasonably reach differing conclusions as to whether polygraph evidence should be admitted. We cannot say, then, that presented with such widespread uncertainty, the President acted arbitrarily or disproportionately in promulgating a <em>per se </em>rule excluding all polygraph evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Justice Kennedy, in a concurring opinion joined by three other justices,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> commented that the \u201ccontinuing, good-faith disagreement among experts and courts on the subject of polygraph reliability counsels against our invalidating a <em>per se </em>exclusion of polygraph results,\u201d and \u201c[gjiven the ongoing debate about polygraphs, I agree the rule of exclusion is not so arbitrary or disproportionate that it is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at p. 318 (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) Justice Kennedy, however, expressed doubt \u201cthat the rule of <em>per se </em>exclusion is wise, and some later case might present a more compelling case for introduction of the testimony than this one does.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We recently applied <em>Scheffer </em>in <em>Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 342, in which the defendant sought the admission of evidence that he had \u201c \u2018passed\u2019 \u201d a polygraph examination, in order to bolster his claim that someone else had killed the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 413.) We concluded that in light of <em>Scheffer, </em>\u201c[excluding such evidence does not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Noting that \u201c[(Implicit in the Legislature\u2019s passage of Evidence Code section 351.1 is the conclusion that \u2018[L]ie detector tests themselves are not considered reliable enough to have probative value\u2019 [Citations.],\u201d and quoting <em>Scheffer, </em>we concluded that a \u201cper se rule excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>polygraph evidence is a \u2018rational and proportional means of advancing the legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence.\u2019 <em>(Scheffer, supra, </em>at p. 312.)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We reach the same conclusion here. <em>Scheffer </em>noted that \u201cthe scientific community remains extremely polarized about the reliability of polygraph techniques.\u201d <em>(United States v. Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at p. 309 (lead opn. of Thomas, J.).) With respect to the reliability of the \u201ccontrol question technique\u201d employed in the present case, <em>Scheffer </em>observed that studies ran the gamut from showing an 87 percent accuracy rate to a rate \u201c \u2018little better than could be obtained by the toss of a coin,\u2019 that is, 50 percent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 310.) This disagreement in the scientific community in turn has been reflected \u201cin the disagreement among state and federal courts concerning both the admissibility and the reliability of polygraph evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 310-311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Defendant cannot persuasively contend that between the time of the <em>Scheffer </em>decision and defendant\u2019s trial, a span of two and one-half years, the deep division in the scientific and legal communities regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence, as recognized by <em>Scheffer, </em>had given way to a general acceptance that would render the categorical exclusion of polygraph evidence \u201cso arbitrary or disproportionate that it is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(United States v. Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at p. 318 (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) Indeed, defense counsel conceded at oral argument that the disagreement within the scientific community regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence had not been significantly altered in that time period. Further, defendant\u2019s offer of proof in the trial court regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence consisted of a publication of the APA that outlined the studies and briefing presented in the <em>Scheffer </em>case\u2014materials which the United States Supreme Court expressly considered and cited in <em>Scheffer </em>in concluding there existed no scientific consensus on the reliability of polygraph evidence in general and the control question technique in particular. Likewise, the legal authorities cited by defendant in the trial court as indicative of a \u201cmajor reevaluation of the admissibility of polygraph evidence by the federal courts\u201d all predate the <em>Scheffer </em>decision and, in any event, did not consider the constitutionality of a categorical exclusion of polygraph evidence. (See <em>United States v. Cordoba </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 104 F.3d 225, 227-229 [holding that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s per se ban on polygraph evidence, based upon <em>Frye, </em>was overturned by <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., supra, </em>509 U.S. 579, which concluded the Federal Rules of Evidence superceded the <em>Frye </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d test in federal courts]; <em>United States v.

Crumby </em>(D.Ariz. 1995) 895 F.Supp. 1354, 1358-1365 [same].) In light of the continuing division of opinion regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence, as recognized by <em>Scheffer, </em>the California Legislature has not acted \u201carbitrarily or disproportionately in promulgating [and retaining] a <em>per se </em>rule excluding all polygraph evidence.\u201d <em>(Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at p. 312 (lead opn. of Thomas, J.); see <em>In re Aontae D., supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 177 [exclusion of polygraph evidence under Evidence Code section 351.1 does not deny due process]; <em>Kegler, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at p. 89 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Defendant contends the polygraph evidence she proffered was \u201ccritical to her defense\u201d and thus exclusion of this evidence deprived her of the constitutional right to present a defense, citing <em>Rock v. Arkansas </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 44 [97 L.Ed.2d 37, 107 S.Ct. 2704] and <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 93 S.Ct. 1038], In <em>Rock, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that a per se rule excluding all hypnotically refreshed testimony infringed upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify, where the rule prevented the defendant from testifying regarding the circumstances underlying the charged killing, including whether it was accidental. <em>(Rock v. Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. at pp. 56-62.) The court in <em>Chambers </em>held that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense was impaired by Mississippi\u2019s \u201cvoucher\u201d rule, which prevented the defendant from impeaching a defense witness whom he alleged had committed the charged killing, coupled with application of the hearsay rule to exclude testimony that the witness had confessed to three persons. <em>(Chambers v. Mississippi, supra, </em>410 U.S. at pp. 294-303; see also <em>Green v. Georgia </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 95, 96-97 [60 L.Ed.2d 738, 99 S.Ct. 2150] [due process denied by exclusion of hearsay evidence that a codefendant had confessed to committing the crime alone].)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">These decisions do not assist defendant. <em>Scheffer </em>distinguished <em>Rock </em>and <em>Chambers, </em>finding that \u201cunlike the evidentiary rules at issue in those cases, [the rule excluding polygraph evidence] does not implicate any significant interest of the accused.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at pp. 316-317 (lead opn. of Thomas, J.).) The use of polygraph evidence proposed at defendant\u2019s trial was indistinguishable from that proposed in <em>Scheffer. </em>Defendant sought the admission of polygraph evidence to bolster her testimony that she was not under the influence of alcohol prior to leaving the restaurant and driving home, and to corroborate evidence suggesting that her subsequently inebriated state (which led to her erratic driving and assault of a custodial officer) could have been caused by someone placing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>drug in the drinks she consumed at the restaurant. Similarly, the airman in <em>Scheffer </em>sought to introduce polygraph evidence to bolster his claim of \u201c \u2018innocent ingestion\u2019 \u201d of drugs. <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 306.) <em>Scheffer </em>held that the exclusion of such evidence did not abridge the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense, because the defendant was not prevented from presenting \u201cthe relevant details of the charged offense from the perspective of the accused\u201d or from \u201cintroducing any factual evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.) Defendant in the present case testified to her version of the events and presented the testimony of a toxicologist and a police officer in support of her claim of having been drugged. As in <em>Scheffer, </em>defendant \u201cwas barred merely from introducing expert opinion testimony to bolster [her] own credibility.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 414 [concluding the \u201cdefense was not significantly impaired by exclusion of the polygraph examination results\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.

Defendant declared she faced deportation to Iran as a result of her felony conviction. The Court of Appeal issued an order to show cause in the habeas corpus matter, returnable before the trial court.

This point misjudges the significance of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Batchelder, supra, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123-125, that the existence of two statutes covering the same criminal conduct but carrying different penalties does not violate either equal protection or due process principles, even though a prosecutor may be influenced by the different penalties available upon conviction in determining under which statute to charge a defendant. Defendant in the present case cannot point to any harm that she suffered by virtue of the circumstance that section 243, subdivision (c), applies only to battery on a custodial officer with injury, inasmuch as she properly could have been charged under section 243.1 (even if section 243, subdivision (c), applied to battery on a custodial officer without injury) and persons who commit battery on a custodial officer with injury may be charged and punished under section 243.1. Further, the concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s argument ignores the observation in <em>Chenze, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 521, 527, that the Legislature added the references to custodial officers in section 243 precisely to allow for prosecutions involving lesser punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s observation that the prosecutor in this case twice offered to dismiss the section 243.1 charge pursuant to a plea agreement does not call into question our conclusion that the Legislature properly can eliminate a trial court\u2019s discretion to reduce a charge in cases deemed by the prosecutor to warrant felony treatment. Such offers may reflect the prosecutor\u2019s judgment regarding the benefits of avoiding the administrative burden and expense of a trial rather than reflecting an assessment by the prosecutor regarding the seriousness of the offense. In any event, the circumstance that a prosecutor may engage in plea negotiation regarding a section 243.1 offense does not establish that no rational basis exists for the Legislature to provide an alternative that does not afford a trial court discretion to reduce a charge when such plea negotiation fails. Further, because <em>any </em>battery on a custodial officer, whether with or without injury, may be prosecuted under section 243.1, the concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s argument that no rational basis exists for eliminating the trial court\u2019s discretion to reduce the charge when a defendant is prosecuted for a straight felony under section 243.1 misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In addition, contrary to the suggestion in the concurring and dissenting opinion, the present case does not involve any issue regarding necessarily included offenses, because there is no claim that section 243.1 is a necessarily included offense of section 243, subdivision (c), so that a jury must be instructed on section 243.1 when a defendant is charged under section 243, subdivision (c). Defendant was charged and the jury was instructed only under section 243.1. If a jury were to be instructed on a lesser necessarily included offense in a case in which the defendant is charged under the wobbler provision of section 243, subdivision (c), it appears that the lesser necessarily included offense that the jury would be instructed upon would be the misdemeanor offense prescribed by section 243, subdivision (b), rather than the felony offense prescribed by section 243.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\"> \u201cThe control question technique involves basically two types of questions; control or comparison questions and relevant questions that specifically concern the investigation at hand. The control questions are designed to arouse the concern of the innocent subject and it is expected that the subject will react more strongly to them than to the relevant questions. The control questions deal with acts that are similar to the issue of the investigation. However, they are more general, cover long periods of time in the life history of the subject, and are deliberately vague. During the pretest review of the control questions, the examiner carefully introduces the control questions to the subject so that in answering these questions on the test the subject is likely to be deceptive or uncertain as to the truthfulness of his answers. In this way, the innocent subject will react more strongly to the control questions than to the relevant questions. On the other hand, guilty subjects who answer the relevant questions deceptively will be more concerned about being detected in that deception than with the control questions. Thus, it is the comparative reactivity rather than the absolute reactivity to a particular question that forms the basis for determining truth or deception.\u201d <em>(United States v.

I disagree, however, with its conclusion upholding the constitutionality of the statutory provisions concerning battery on a custodial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Two statutory provisions concerning battery on a custodial officer are at issue here: Penal Code section 243.1 makes battery on a custodial officer a felony, whether or not the battery caused injury to the custodial officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (For convenience, I sometimes refer to the offense defined by section 243.1 as battery on a custodial officer without injury, because injury is not an element of the offense.) Subdivision (c) of section 243 (hereafter section 243(c)), by comparison, makes a battery on a custodial officer that results in injury to the custodial officer an offense punishable either as a felony or as a misdemeanor. (For convenience, I sometimes refer to this offense as battery on a custodial officer with injury.) Although battery on a custodial officer <em>with </em>injury is on its face more egregious than battery on a custodial officer <em>without </em>injury, it carries a lesser minimum penalty (it may be punished as a misdemeanor) and the same maximum penalty. In this respect, the statutory scheme lacks any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>rational basis, in my view, and thereby violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">\u201c \u2018The first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more <em>similarly situated </em>groups in an unequal manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cooley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 228, 253 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 177, 57 P.3d 654], quoting <em>In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Wutzke </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 923, 943 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 447, 51 P.3d 310].) In this case, persons who commit the <em>same </em>illegal act\u2014a battery on a custodial officer causing injury\u2014are in that respect similarly situated, but they are treated differently depending on whether they are charged under section 243.1, which does not require proof of injury, or under section 243(c), which does. The Attorney General\u2019s assertion that persons who commit identical acts with the identical mental states but are charged under different statutes are not similarly situated is incorrect when the equal protection issue is the constitutionality of the distinction between the two statutes. <em>(People v. Nguyen </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 705, 714\u2014715 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 173].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">As the majority observes (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 838), under the federal and state equal protection clauses the constitutionality of the statutory scheme at issue turns on whether there is a rational basis for the distinction it draws between persons prosecuted under section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury) and section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See <em>Kasler v. Lockyer </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 472, 514 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 2 P.3d 581] (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) The equal protection clause \u201cdoes not forbid classifications,\u201d but it does forbid \u201cgovernmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\u201d <em>(Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 1, 10 [120 L.Ed.2d 1, 112 S.Ct. 2326]; see <em>Easier y. Lockyer, supra, </em>at p. 515 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The relevant statutory provisions are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Section 243.1 declares that battery \u201ccommitted against the person of a custodial officer\u201d is a felony when the person committing the battery \u201cknows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>or reasonably should know that the victim is a custodial officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Section 243, subdivision (b), makes the same conduct a misdemeanor. It prescribes' misdemeanor punishment for a battery \u201ccommitted against the person of a . . . custodial officer . . . engaged in the performance of his or her duties . . . and the person committing the offense knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a . . . custodial officer</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Section 243(c) describes more egregious conduct. It requires a battery \u201ccommitted against a custodial officer . . . engaged in the performance of his or her duties\u201d when \u201cthe person committing the offense knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a . . . custodial officer . . . <em>and an injury is inflicted on that </em>victim.\u201d (Italics added.) Violation of section 243(c) is punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor, in the discretion of the trial court. (Such crimes are colloquially referred to as \u201cwobblers.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Finally, section 243, subdivision (d), not directly relevant here, describes an even more serious crime; battery on a custodial officer resulting in <em>serious </em>bodily injury. Violation of this provision too can be punished as either a felony or a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Traditionally, California\u2019s sentencing laws have punished more harshly crimes that cause injury than similar crimes that do not. The statutory scheme at issue here, however, goes against this pattern. As the Court of Appeal majority observed, \u201c[t]he current scheme encourages arbitrary, irrational charging.\u201d In the case of a battery on a custodial officer that causes injury, there would be no incentive for the prosecutor to charge the defendant under section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury). By ignoring the injury and charging the defendant under section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury), the prosecutor is spared the burden of proving the injury and the trial court is precluded from treating the offense as a misdemeanor, an option that would be available to the court if the defendant had been charged with, and convicted of a violation of section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Other consequences of the statutory scheme are even more perplexing, as illustrated by the problems involved in instructing a jury in the trial of a defendant charged with a violation section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury). A trial court must instruct the jury on a lesser included offense when the evidence raises a question whether all of the elements of the charged crime are present, and the evidence would support a conviction of the lesser offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1055 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544].) \u201c[A] lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser offense, such that the greater cannot be committed without also committing the lesser.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 117 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073].) Because a defendant cannot commit battery on a custodial officer with injury (\u00a7 243(c)) or battery on a custodial officer causing serious bodily injury (\u00a7 243, sub. (d)) without committing all elements of battery in violation of section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury), the latter is an offense necessarily included in the crimes of battery on a custodial officer with injury or with serious bodily injury. Consequently, when a defendant is charged with a battery on a custodial officer with injury or serious bodily injury, and there is a question whether the injury occurred, the trial court must instruct on the necessarily included offense of battery in violation of section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury). If the jury then found the defendant guilty as charged of a battery on a custodial officer causing injury (\u00a7 243(c)), the court would have discretion to impose a misdemeanor sentence. But if the jury, because it entertained a reasonable doubt that the battery had caused an injury to the custodial officer, found the defendant guilty only of the necessarily included offense of battery on a custodial officer (\u00a7 243.1), the trial court would be required to sentence the defendant as a felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">I can perceive no rational basis for this rather startling statutory scheme. The majority does, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The majority first questions whether the offense defined in section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury) is actually less serious than the offense defined in section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury). It observes that if we compare two <em>different </em>batteries, it is possible that a particular battery without injury could be more heinous than another battery that did cause an injury. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 839-840.) By the same reasoning, however, a particular petty theft could, depending on the circumstances, be more serious than a particular grand theft, and a particular grand theft could be more serious than a particular robbery, and so forth. Under this reasoning, the legal classification of crimes as inherently \u201cgreater\u201d or \u201clesser\u201d becomes meaningless and a rational ordering of crimes and punishment in the penal law becomes impossible. In deciding which of two crimes is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>greater, the only meaningful comparison is between the elements of each crime, as I discussed at pages 853-855, <em>ante, </em>not the particular circumstances of their commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The majority also questions defendant\u2019s claim that the statutory scheme allows a battery on a custodial officer without injury to be punished more severely than one with injury. The majority points out that the <em>maximum </em>punishment under both section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury) and section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury) is the same\u2014three years. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 839.) But the majority cites neither authority nor reason for the proposition that when comparing statutes for the purpose of equal protection analysis a court should examine only the maximum punishment and ignore everything else. Here the <em>minimum </em>punishment specified under section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury) is 16 months in state prison (\u00a7 18) while the <em>minimum </em>punishment under section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury) is \u201ca fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2000) [or] imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year.\u201d When, as here, the defendant\u2019s crime could reasonably be treated as a misdemeanor, it is the minimum punishment that is more important.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The majority holds that section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury) does not violate the principle of equal protection of the laws because the Legislature could have rationally concluded that reduction of this offense to a misdemeanor is not appropriate whenever the prosecutor deems the offense serious enough for felony prosecution. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 840.) This reasoning misses the point. Equal protection analysis requires comparing two statutes\u2014here section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury) and section 243(c) (battery on a custodial officer with injury). The majority offers no rational basis for the distinction between them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">I perceive no rational basis for giving trial courts the power to punish as a misdemeanor a charge of battery on a custodial officer with injury, but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>deny that power as to battery on a custodial officer <em>without injury </em>under section 243.1. Could the Legislature rationally believe that some batteries without injury are so serious that the prosecutor must be given unfettered, unreviewable power to ensure that they are prosecuted as felonies, but that this is not the case for batteries causing injury? Conversely, could the Legislature rationally believe that the courts could be trusted to determine when batteries causing injury should be treated as felonies rather than misdemeanors, but could not be trusted to make the same determination as to batteries that did not cause injury? The answer is inescapable: the statutory distinction has no rational basis, thus denying defendant the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The allegations of defendant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus filed in conjunction with defendant\u2019s appeal, if true,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> belie the majority\u2019s assumption that prosecutors will charge the felony offense of battery on a custodial officer without injury under section 243.1 only when they deem the offense serious enough to warrant felony punishment. Here, after charging defendant with a felony battery under section 243.1, the prosecutor offered to dismiss the felony charge if defendant would plead guilty to a misdemeanor battery, which would be further reduced to an infraction if she successfully completed probation. Defense counsel refused the offer. The prosecutor then offered to dismiss the battery charge if defendant would plead guilty to the misdemeanor of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152). Defense counsel rejected this offer as well. The case was then prosecuted as a felony. The trial court expressed dismay that the case had not been settled, and, after the jury found defendant guilty as charged, the court placed defendant on probation instead of sending her to prison for the felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">If true, these facts show that the prosecutor did not consider defendant\u2019s conduct so egregious as to require felony punishment. A prosecutor taking that view would not have been so eager to induce defendant to plead guilty to crimes punishable only as misdemeanors. But because defendant was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>under section 243.1, a mandatory felony, the trial court was prevented from exercising the discretion the Legislature gave it to treat the more serious crime of battery on a custodial officer with injury (\u00a7 243(c)) as a misdemeanor. This kind of injustice is the predictable result of the current irrational statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">I would affirm the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\"> Statutory citations are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-11\"> If two groups are not similarly situated, then any \u201cequal protection claim cannot succeed, and does not require further analysis.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nguyen, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 714.) Thus, by applying a rational basis test, the majority here implicitly acknowledges that the two groups\u2014persons charged under section 243.1 and those charged under section 243(c)\u2014are similarly situated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\"> Although the prosecutor has no incentive to charge a defendant with battery on a custodial officer with injury (\u00a7 243(c)), there would still be an incentive to charge a defendant with battery causing <em>serious </em>bodily injury (\u00a7 243, subd. (d)) because that offense, although a wobbler, has a higher maximum penalty than of offense defined by section 243.1 (battery on a custodial officer without injury).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\"> The majority mistakenly relies on <em>United States v. Batchelder </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 114 [60 L.Ed.2d 755, 99 S.Ct. 2198], a case involving a federal statutory scheme that defined two crimes with essentially the same elements but different penalties. The United States Supreme Court concluded that the federal scheme did not deny equal protection to a defendant convicted of the crime carrying the greater penalty. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 124-125.) The court was not faced with a statutory scheme like the one at issue here, which defines two closely related crimes <em>and permits lesser punishment for the crime that differs only in requiring one additional aggravating element. </em>The high court in <em>Batchelder </em>thus had no occasion to decide whether a statutory scheme with those irrational features violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws. I note, moreover, that the Colorado Supreme Court found the reasoning in <em>Batchelder </em>unpersuasive and declined to follow it in construing the equal protection clause of its own state constitution. <em>(People v. Estrada </em>(1979) 198 Colo. 188 [601 P.2d 619, 621].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\"> The truth of these allegations may be determined at an evidentiary hearing ordered by the Court of Appeal on the habeas corpus petition defendant filed in conjunction with her appeal. At issue there is whether defense counsel failed to consult with defendant before rejecting the prosecution\u2019s offers to dismiss the felony charge if defendant would plead guilty to either of two misdemeanors, battery or driving under the influence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
