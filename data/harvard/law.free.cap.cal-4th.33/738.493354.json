J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aof\">In the present case, the trial court struck a prior-conviction allegation that was based upon defendant\u2019s negotiated plea of no contest to a charge of willful discharge of a firearm into an inhabited dwelling in violation of Penal Code section 246.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite defendant\u2019s entry of this plea to the earlier charge, his resulting admission of the factual basis for the plea, and his express acknowledgement that the plea would result in a strike for the purpose of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law, the trial court in the present case concluded that the prior-conviction allegation should be stricken pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>section 1385, primarily because the magistrate after conducting a preliminary hearing had held that there was insufficient evidence to hold defendant to answer on that charge. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, because it based its decision to strike the prior-conviction allegation on a factor that is extraneous to the Three Strikes law. As our conclusion is consistent with the determination of the Court of Appeal below, we affirm the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Defendant was charged by information in four counts. Three of the counts arose from a single incident in December 1999: murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 189), active participation in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)). The fourth count, which charged defendant with being a felon in possession of a firearm, arose out of a January 2000 incident. In that incident, officers responding to a domestic violence call were told by defendant\u2019s girlfriend that he had a gun. Defendant fled in a pickup truck and threw a handgun out of the window during the ensuing police chase. The information also alleged defendant had two prior convictions that constituted serious or violent felonies under the Three Strikes law. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d), 1170.12, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">After a jury was unable to reach a verdict, the trial court declared a mistrial. A second jury convicted defendant of the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, based upon the January 2000 incident, but deadlocked on the remaining counts. A mistrial was declared as to the latter charges. Defendant waived jury trial on the truth of the prior-conviction allegations and requested that the trial court exercise its discretion under section 1385 to strike one of his two prior-strike convictions in the event the trial court found the allegations to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Both of the two prior convictions were for willful discharge of a firearm into an occupied vehicle or building. (\u00a7 246.) The first was based upon an incident that occurred in March 1996. The second was based upon an incident that occurred in April 1996 and originally was charged as a murder. Defendant was 19 years of age at the time of each incident. After a preliminary hearing at which evidence was presented regarding both of these incidents, the magistrate held defendant to answer on the murder count but not on the count of willful discharge of a firearm, finding there was not sufficient cause to believe defendant guilty. (See \u00a7 871.) The prosecutor nevertheless charged both counts in a subsequent information. (See \u00a7 739.) Defendant pleaded not guilty and succeeded in persuading the trial court to set aside the willfuldisdiarge-of-a-firearm count. (See \u00a7 995, subd. (a)(2).) Pursuant to a plea negotiation, the information was amended to reinstate the latter count and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>add an additional count of willful discharge of a firearm with respect to the April 1996 incident that originally was charged as a murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Defendant pleaded no contest to these two counts of willful discharge of a firearm in exchange for dismissal of the murder charge. Defendant, by initialing and signing a change-of-plea form, indicated he understood and waived his constitutional rights to a speedy trial, to confront witnesses, to remain silent, and to subpoena witnesses, acknowledged that his plea was not the result of a promise or threat, and denied that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Defendant also stipulated to a factual basis for his plea, initialing the portion of the change-of-plea form indicating that he had discussed with defense counsel \u201cthe contents of the police reports\u201d and that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d he was aware of the evidence against him. Defense counsel, in open court, expressly stipulated to a factual basis for the plea. Defendant stated on the record that he understood that both offenses would constitute \u201cstrikes\u201d under the Three Strikes law in a subsequent prosecution. The trial court accepted the plea, found a factual basis for the plea, and placed defendant on formal probation for a term of five years, subject to the condition that he not possess a firearm. The court dismissed the murder count on the prosecutor\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The probation officer\u2019s report prepared for the sentencing hearing in the present case reflected that the two prior convictions for willful discharge of a firearm were defendant\u2019s only adult offenses, although defendant had committed several offenses as a juvenile, including felony violations consisting of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner (\u00a7 246.3) and driving with willful disregard for the safety of persons or property while fleeing a pursuing officer (Veh. Code \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a)), as well as misdemeanor violations consisting of resisting arrest (\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1)) and trespassing (\u00a7 602, subd. (o)). The probation report quoted the investigating officer in the present case, Detective Solis, who stated his belief that defendant was a \u201cmagnet for gun-related crimes,\u201d and defendant\u2019s supervising probation officer, who believed that defendant was \u201can extremely dangerous person who should not be supervised on the local level.\u201d The probation officer\u2019s report recommended against reinstating defendant on probation, citing defendant\u2019s \u201chistory of weapons related crimes\u201d and his poor performance on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">After finding true the prior-conviction allegations, the trial court in the present case heard argument on defendant\u2019s motion to strike the prior-conviction allegation that was based on the March 1996 incident. Defense counsel contended, in relevant part, that the trial court should take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>into consideration the circumstance that with regard to the prior-strike conviction for willful discharge of a firearm occurring in March 1996, the magistrate, after conducting a preliminary hearing, had held that there was insufficient evidence to hold defendant to answer. Defense counsel urged that, as a consequence of this action by the magistrate, defendant\u2019s two prior-strike convictions were not \u201cindicative of [defendant\u2019s] background and his record.\u201d Defense counsel also suggested in passing that there existed an insufficient factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea with respect to the March 1996 offense and that defendant entered the plea solely because of the favorable plea negotiation and his desire to be released from custody. The prosecutor responded by noting that defendant had entered his plea pursuant to a plea agreement and had been informed that he would be subject to the Three Strikes law in the event he reoffended.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">After a brief discussion regarding the sentencing consequences of dismissing one of the prior-conviction strike allegations, the trial court commented: \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the 1385 issue. [][] But for this argument... I don\u2019t see any justifications for striking any of the strikes. And given the criminal record that Mr. Wallace has dating back to the time he was a juvenile continuing into adulthood, and ... in the probation report a Detective [Solis] is quoted as saying the following about Mr. Wallace: \u2018He\u2019s a magnet for gun-related crimes.\u2019 And his criminal history, juvenile and adult, seems to so indicate.\u201d The trial court later added: \u201cSo I just want to pause a little bit more about your argument here relating to . . . one of the 246 counts because otherwise, quite frankly, I don\u2019t think I would be consistent with the proper exercise of my discretion to dismiss any of the strikes, and the consequence of that would be that ... I would have to, of course, sentence Mr. Wallace to 25 to life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">After hearing further argument from counsel, the trial court noted that the magistrate at the preliminary hearing in the prior proceeding \u201chad determined that . . . based on the evidence that she heard in the matter there was insufficient evidence to . . . even proceed with the charge against Mr. Wallace, and the Superior Court sustained the motion to dismiss and by so doing essentially confirmed as a practical matter Judge Lindenbaum\u2019s [the magistrate] appraisal of the situation.\u201d The prosecutor responded that \u201cwhether the court dismissed it or didn\u2019t dismiss it in terms of a 995 really is [moot] at this point because the fact is the information was amended, and the defendant pled no contest to it. . . . He admitted it. Now the court is going behind his plea and saying, well, we don\u2019t really think it happened . . . .\u201d Shortly thereafter, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Well, that it really didn\u2019t happen in a sense they\u2019re asking me to take into account with respect to that conviction that ... a judge found there wasn\u2019t even enough evidence to charge him with that. They\u2019re asking me to take that into account in exercising my discretion pursuant to 1385.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201c[The prosecutor:] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a proper argument in asking the court to exercise discretion under 1385.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I think the court can examine whether a conviction is a <em>conviction in form rather than in substance. </em>[][]... I don\u2019t mean to suggest by that the courts could or should look into every conviction that\u2019s based upon a plea and go beyond the plea, have a hearing with respect to all these matters. But this particular case is unique. It doesn\u2019t present that type of a situation. It\u2019s not a situation where a defendant is\u2014I don\u2019t take it to be where the defendant is arguing \u2018it didn\u2019t happen, give me a chance to prove it.\u2019 It\u2019s saying in exercising a 1385[,] take into account that a judge found there wasn\u2019t even evidence to charge it.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The prosecutor reiterated his argument: \u201cThat is not a proper inquiry for sentencing here. He stands convicted of it. He admitted that it\u2019s true. Yes, he did fire into an occupied vehicle .... \u2018Yes, I did that. There is a factual basis for that, and yes, I plead to that, and yes, I am subject to the three-strikes law, and yes, I understand the court can sentence me to 25 to life.\u2019 And now they\u2019re coming back and saying, no none of that is true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Nonetheless, the trial court announced: \u201cI\u2019m tentatively prepared to dismiss the strike allegation predicated on the conviction for 246 occurring on or about March 11th, 1996, pursuant to Penal Code section 1385 in the interest of justice, finding that for the reasons that we\u2019ve been discussing here on the record, given the finding of Judge Laurel Lindenbaum in this case in connection with the preliminary hearing, that there was insufficient evidence to even charge the defendant in these matters, that the conviction which subsequently resulted\u2014when as part of a plea negotiation Mr. Wallace pled guilty to that, that for purposes of the three-strike laws and the spirit of the three-strike laws it is really a conviction more in form than in substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The trial court continued: \u201cI\u2019ve taken into account . . . not only Judge Lindenbaum\u2019s\u2014what she decided in this case, but also the fact that prior to the instant case the 246 convictions were the only . . . adult criminal convictions sustained by the defendant; and also taking into account. . . [that] although there are arrests . . . suggestive of other criminal behavior, they did not result in convictions. . . . [f] All things considered, in the spirit of the law . . . pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>[(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429]] and other cases, this is truly a one-strike case rather than a two-strike case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Based upon defendant\u2019s conviction in the present case of being a felon in possession of a firearm, the trial court revoked defendant\u2019s probation with respect to his two earlier convictions for willful discharge of a firearm (\u00a7 246) and sentenced him consecutively to a prison term of eight years eight months for these offenses, calculated as the upper term on one willful-discharge conviction (seven years) plus one-third the midterm on the other willful-discharge conviction (one year eight months). (See \u00a7 1170.1.) With respect to the present offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm, the trial court imposed a consecutive term of 16 months, calculated as one-third the midterm (eight months) doubled under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(1)), which term reflected the circumstance that the trial court pursuant to section 1385 had dismissed one of the section 246 prior-conviction strike allegations. The prison term imposed upon revocation of defendant\u2019s probation in the two earlier cases plus the sentence in the current offense totalled 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">After the trial court\u2019s imposition of defendant\u2019s sentence, the prosecutor objected to defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cfor the record\u201d and suggested that the trial court had \u201callowed [defendant] to back out of the deal he made previously . . . .\u201d The following exchange later occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201c[The prosecutor:] [W]hat I object to is the court looks at the strength or proof put forward on the charge that the defendant admitted was true .... The defendant says, \u2018yes, it\u2019s true. I have committed a violation of section 246.\u2019 And the court looks at it and says, \u2018well, it doesn\u2019t look like you really did it, looks like it\u2019s more form than substance here; thus I am not going to hold you to it.\u2019 And that really is where the strength of the 1385 argument came into play today. And . . . had they not made that argument, I don\u2019t think the court would have found the defendant does not fall within the spirit of the three-strikes law. And I wanted to have that clear for the record. And I want the court to agree with that assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cThe Court: I have stated as much. I stated except for the unique circumstances of this case which lead me to conclude that for purposes of the spirit of the three-strike laws that conviction was more in form than in substance. Except for that, I would not have dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The trial court later clarified: \u201cI should say that I said a little bit earlier that but for this fact of what happened here, of the count having been dismissed because of a specific finding by a judge of insufficient evidence, that ... I would not have stricken any of the strikes. [][] On the other hand, I should make clear that Judge Lindenbaum\u2019s finding in here is not the only thing that I\u2019m looking at in connection with [striking] a strike. There are other things that supplement that, none of which in and of themselves would have been enough . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>On appeal, the district attorney contended that because defendant\u2019s plea of no contest admitted the factual bases for both prior offenses, the trial court, in deciding whether to strike a conviction for purposes of sentencing, could not properly consider the magistrate\u2019s refusal to hold defendant to answer on the charge of willful discharge of a firearm that was based upon the March 1996 incident. The Court of Appeal agreed, reversed the order striking the prior-conviction allegation, and remanded the case for further proceedings, reasoning: \u201cOnce Wallace entered his no contest plea, the elements of the offense and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that offense were established. [Citation.] Reliance by the trial court on the preplea rulings of the magistrate and the superior court concerning the sufficiency of the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing was error and constituted an abuse of discretion. Although there are many factors that may be considered by the trial court in the exercise of its broad discretion to strike, this was not one of them.\u201d Defendant petitioned for review, contending that the magistrate\u2019s conclusion after conducting a preliminary hearing that there was insufficient evidence to hold defendant to answer constituted a proper basis for the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 1385 to strike the ensuing prior conviction. We granted defendant\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">This court emphasized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628] that a \u201ccourt\u2019s discretion to strike prior felony conviction allegations in furtherance of justice is limited\u201d and that exercise of such discretion requires \u201cstrict compliance with section 1385[, subdivision] (a), and is subject to review for abuse.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 530.) We explained that the trial court must give \u201c ' \u201cconsideration both [to] the constitutional rights of the defendant and <em>the interests of society represented by the People </em>in determining whether there should be a dismissal <em>(Ibid.) </em>We gave as examples of abuse of discretion the striking of a prior conviction \u201csolely \u2018to accommodate judicial convenience or because of court congestion,\u2019 \u201d or \u201csimply because a defendant pleads guilty,\u201d or due to \u201c \u2018personal antipathy for the effect that the three strikes law would have on [a] defendant,\u2019 while ignoring \u2018defendant\u2019s background,\u2019 \u2018the nature of his present offenses,\u2019 and other \u2018individualized considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">We clarified in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 148 (Williams) that the decision whether to strike a prior-conviction allegation under the Three Strikes law requires the trial court to look \u201cwithin the scheme in question, as informed by generally applicable sentencing principles . . . .\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 160.) We explained that \u201cno weight whatsoever may be given to factors extrinsic to the [Three Strikes] scheme\u201d and that \u201cthe court in question must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme\u2019s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">We also have emphasized that the decision before a court under this statutory scheme relates to <em>sentencing </em>but does not affect the <em>validity </em>of the prior conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 490, 499 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 280, 976 P.2d 831].) A defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cis the overarching consideration because the underlying purpose of striking prior conviction allegations is the avoidance of unjust sentences.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The narrow inquiry we face in the present case is whether the circumstance that a prior-strike-conviction allegation is based on a charge, as to which a magistrate previously held there was insufficient evidence to hold the defendant to answer, constitutes a proper consideration for a trial court engaged in determining whether the defendant falls outside the spirit of the Three Strikes law for purposes of striking the prior-conviction allegation that is, whether this circumstance sheds light upon \u201cthe nature and circumstances of [a] defendant\u2019s . . . prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\u201d or \u201cthe particulars of [a defendant\u2019s] background, character, and prospects <em>(Williams, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 161.) Defendant contends that the magistrate\u2019s ruling was part of the \u201crecord of conviction\u201d of the prior case and constituted a factor relevant to the circumstances of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">As we shall explain, the circumstance that a magistrate declined to hold defendant to answer on a charge that subsequently was refiled, and as to which defendant subsequently pleaded no contest, has no bearing on either the nature of defendant\u2019s prior offenses or his background and character as they relate to the Three Strikes law. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion when it relied on this consideration as a primary basis for striking the prior-conviction allegation in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Statements made by the trial court suggest that it found that the magistrate\u2019s ruling established there was insufficient evidence to prove defendant\u2019s commission of the March 1996 offense to which he pleaded no contest. The trial court emphasized that, although courts generally should not \u201clook into every conviction that\u2019s based upon a plea and go beyond the plea,\u201d the situation here was \u201cunique\u201d because the magistrate\u2019s ruling reflected that defendant\u2019s prior conviction was \u201creally a conviction more in form than in substance\u201d as \u201cpart of a plea negotiation . ...\u201d In this context, the trial court apparently came to this conclusion because of its belief that the magistrate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>ruling demonstrated that defendant entered a no contest plea to a charged offense that he had not actually committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">It is apparent that the trial court granted the motion to dismiss on the basis of a misapprehension concerning the limited function performed by a magistrate. When a magistrate declines to hold a defendant to answer on the ground that the evidence at the preliminary hearing did not establish probable cause to believe the defendant committed the charged offense, the mling does not bar future prosecution. <em>(People v. Uhlemann </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 662, 667-668 [108 Cal.Rptr. 657, 511 P.2d 609].) The magistrate lacks authority to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The prosecution may file another complaint charging the same offense or may file an information charging the same offense in the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 666; see also \u00a7\u00a7 871.5, 999.) We have explained that the preliminary hearing \u201cis not a trial, and if the magistrate forms a personal opinion regarding the guilt or innocence of the accused, that opinion is of no legal significance whatever in view of the limited nature of the proceedings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Uhlemann, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 667; see also <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 228, 251 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 177, 57 P.3d 654].) \u201c[T]he doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel are inapplicable to orders dismissing criminal proceedings following preliminary hearings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Uhlemann, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 667-668.)  A deficiency of proof at a preliminary hearing frequently reflects a temporary state of affairs. The prosecution may discover and proffer additional proof by the time a second preliminary hearing is held or by the time the case proceeds to trial. The defendant\u2019s culpability may be established through the introduction of evidence at trial or, alternatively, by the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or no contest. Such a plea ordinarily includes an admission that there is a factual basis for the plea, and when the plea represents a negotiated disposition\u2014as it did in the present case\u2014the court must satisfy itself that a factual basis for the plea exists. (See \u00a7 1192.5; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 432, 438 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 678, 84 P.3d 366]; <em>People v. Hoffard </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1170, 1181 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 899 P.2d 896].)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Under the circumstances, the statement of the trial court in the present case that defendant\u2019s prior conviction was a \u201cconviction in form rather than in substance\u201d was contrary to established law. Defendant pleaded no contest to the prior charges of willful firearm-discharge. \u201cThe legal effect of such a plea, to a crime punishable as a felony, shall be the same as that of a plea of guilty for all purposes.\u201d (\u00a7 1016, subd. 3.) A guilty plea \u201cadmits every element of the crime charged\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 837, 844, fn. 6 [226 Cal.Rptr. 107, 718 P.2d 94]) and \u201cis the \u2018legal equivalent\u2019 of a \u2018verdict\u2019 [citation] and is \u2018tantamount\u2019 to a \u2018finding\u2019 [citations]\u201d <em>(People v. Statum </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 682, 688, fn. 2 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 50 P.3d 355]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>By contrast, as we already have noted, any determination by the magistrate that the evidence at the preliminary hearing did not establish probable cause to believe defendant guilty is <em>not </em>a binding determination reflecting on defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Further, defendant stipulated to the existence of a factual basis for his plea by initialing the portions of the change-of-plea form indicating that he had discussed with defense counsel \u201cthe contents of the police reports\u201d and was \u201csatisfied\u201d he was aware of the evidence against him. Defendant could not have appealed from his ensuing conviction on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence. <em>(People v. Stanworth </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 588, 604\u2014605 [114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 237 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512].) Indeed, defendant specifically acknowledged on the record during his no contest plea that he understood his offenses would constitute strikes under the Three Strikes law in any subsequent prosecution. In light of defendant\u2019s express stipulation as to the factual basis of his plea and his acknowledgment that his offenses constituted strikes, the trial court was not free to look beyond defendant\u2019s no contest plea, which was \u201c \u2018tantamount\u2019 to a \u2018finding\u2019 \u201d of culpability for the prior offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Statum, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 688, fn. 2), nor could the trial court properly give dispositive weight to the magistrate\u2019s evaluation of the evidence at some earlier period in the prior proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In addition, we believe that by relying upon the magistrate\u2019s ruling, the trial court not only misapprehended the limited function played by the magistrate at a preliminary hearing, but also failed to give due consideration to the nature of the plea negotiation process. A defendant who enters into a negotiated disposition gains benefits that, assuming the plea meets various requirements, bar him or her from asserting at a later date that there was insufficient evidence of guilt to support the plea and the ensuing conviction. (See <em>In re Troy Z. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1170, 1180-1181 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 724, 840 P.2d 266].) In <em>Brady v. United States </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 742 [25 L.Ed.2d 747, 90 S.Ct. 1463], the United States Supreme Court described the benefits to the parties of plea negotiation: \u201cFor a defendant who sees slight possibility of acquittal, the advantages of pleading guilty and limiting the probable penalty are obvious\u2014his exposure is reduced, the correctional processes can begin immediately, and the practical burdens of a trial are eliminated. For the State there are also advantages\u2014the more promptly imposed punishment after an admission of guilt may more effectively attain the objectives of punishment; and with the avoidance of trial, scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources are conserved for those cases in which there is a substantial issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or in which there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>substantial doubt that the State can sustain its burden of proof.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 752, footnote omitted; see <em>People v. Orin </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 937, 942-943 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193].) It is evident that both parties may reap benefits from a negotiated disposition; to permit a defendant to seek at a hearing under section 1385 to avoid some of the consequences of the plea, while holding the prosecution to the negotiated disposition, would not be consistent with our directive that the court also consider \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe interests of society represented by the People in determining whether there should be a dismissal.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero), supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 530, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Although the magistrate found insufficient evidence to hold defendant to answer on the charge of willful discharge of a firearm based upon the March 1996 incident (an offense for which defendant later entered his no contest plea), this circumstance alone does not suggest that defendant fell outside the spirit of the Three Strikes scheme. Defendant pleaded no contest to that charge in order to avoid a trial on the more serious offense of murder, a charge concerning which there was no question regarding the sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s evidence at the preliminary hearing. In dismissing the prior-conviction allegation based upon an assumption that the magistrate\u2019s earlier ruling established that defendant did not actually commit that prior offense, the trial court failed adequately to take into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s prior plea and the manner in which defendant came to be convicted of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Defendant urges that the magistrate\u2019s earlier ruling was part of the \u201crecord of conviction\u201d of the prior offense, and thus constituted a relevant consideration for the trial court in determining whether to dismiss the prior-strike-conviction allegation. For the reasons discussed above, however, the circumstance that the earlier ruling was part of the record did not render that ruling relevant for purposes of a motion under section 1385 to dismiss the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In support of his position that the magistrate\u2019s failure to hold defendant to answer was a relevant consideration under section 1385, defendant cites <em>Specht </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 605 [18 L.Ed.2d 326, 87 S.Ct. 1209] <em>(Specht) </em>and <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Ayers </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 342 F.3d 911 <em>(Gill). </em>In <em>Specht, </em>the defendant was convicted of \u201cindecent liberties\u201d in violation of a Colorado statute that provided for a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Despite the determinate term prescribed for the charged offense, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>sentenced to an indeterminate term under the Colorado Sex Offenders Act, which allowed such sentencing if the trial court found, in reliance upon a report prepared by a court-appointed psychiatrist, that the defendant constituted a threat of harm to the public or was a \u201c \u2018habitual offender and mentally ill.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Specht, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 607.) Observing that the hearing was not an ordinary sentencing hearing but essentially involved trial of a new charge, the United States Supreme Court found that the procedure permitting imposition of a sentence in excess of the maximum for the charged offense violated due process principles. As the high court declared, \u201cthe invocation of the Sex Offenders Act means the making of a new charge leading to criminal punishment\u201d was involved, requiring \u201c \u2018reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 610.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In <em>Gill, </em>the prosecution alleged that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) constituted a strike. Assault with a deadly weapon would qualify as a strike only if the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury. (See \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).) A court trial was held on the strike allegation, focusing specifically on the issue whether the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury. The trial court found the strike allegation to be true, concluding that the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury, based upon his statements to the probation officer as reflected in the probation report. The defendant sought an opportunity to testify at the court trial in order to explain his prior statements and to deny that he personally inflicted great bodily injury, but the trial court denied the request. The Ninth Circuit, relying upon <em>Specht, </em>concluded that the denial of the opportunity to testify at the trial of the strike allegation violated due process principles. <em>(Gill, supra, </em>342 F.3d at pp. 917-921.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The cited cases did not consider what types of evidence may be considered by the trial court in connection with a motion to strike an otherwise valid prior-conviction allegation, a question here at issue. These cases are of no assistance to defendant, even assuming they would apply to a sentencing hearing where the court is considering whether to exercise its sentencing discretion to strike a prior-conviction allegation under section 1385. Defendant in the present case did not request the opportunity to testify or present evidence, and the trial court did not hear any testimony or otherwise take any evidence. Defendant also did not claim that he lacked notice of the strike allegations. Indeed, defendant in the present case, unlike the defendant in <em>Gill, </em>at no time claimed that his prior convictions did not constitute strikes, because the willful discharge of a firearm is an enumerated serious felony. (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(33).)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s order striking one of his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under the Three Strikes law was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>supported by factors other than the circumstance that the magistrate had declined to hold defendant to answer on the underlying charge. Defendant asserts that the trial court based its decision in part on other factors, such as defendant\u2019s youth, his lack of adult prior convictions (other than his strike convictions) and lack of prison terms, and his \u201ccurrent nonviolent crime,\u201d as well as the length of the prison sentence (10 years) that the trial court was imposing. It is evident from the record, however, as the Court of Appeal determined, that the trial court gave dispositive weight to the magistrate\u2019s ruling. Before striking one of the two prior-conviction allegations, the trial court made reference to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the magistrate\u2019s ruling demonstrated that defendant\u2019s two prior-strike convictions were not \u201cindicative of [defendant\u2019s] background and his record,\u201d and observed that \u201c[b]ut for this argument ... I don\u2019t see any justifications for striking any of the strikes\u201d and that \u201cotherwise, quite frankly, I don\u2019t think I would be consistent with the proper exercise of my discretion to dismiss any of the strikes . . . .\u201d After striking one prior-conviction allegation, the trial court reiterated at the prosecutor\u2019s request that \u201cexcept for the unique circumstances of this case which lead me to conclude that for purposes of the spirit of the three-strike laws that conviction was more in form than in substance ... I would not have dismissed\u201d and \u201cbut for this fact of what happened here, of the count having been dismissed because of a specific finding by a judge of insufficient evidence ... I would not have stricken any of the strikes.\u201d In relying upon this factor, the trial court abused its discretion, as we have shown.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Defendant is free to contend on remand that <em>other </em>factors take him outside the spirit of the Three Strikes scheme and warrant striking the prior-conviction allegations pursuant to section 1385. Under <em>Williams (Williams, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 161), such factors may include, but are not limited to, those noted by defendant above, as well as the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of his past and present convictions suggesting that the offenses were mitigated either in the manner of their commission (for example, an offense was committed in a less serious or violent manner than would normally be expected of such a crime) or in the level of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>participation (for example, defendant played a subordinate role in the commission of the offense).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In sum, the circumstance that a magistrate previously declined to hold defendant to answer on a charge after conducting a preliminary hearing was not a proper consideration in determining whether defendant fell outside the spirit of the Three Strikes scheme and did not provide a proper basis for dismissing a prior-strike-conviction allegation. The magistrate\u2019s ruling did not illuminate the circumstances surrounding the commission of the prior offense, nor was it relevant in evaluating defendant\u2019s \u201cbackground, character, and prospects . . . .\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 161.) By giving dispositive weight to the magistrate\u2019s ruling, the trial court failed to take into account the limited function of the magistrate, as well as the nature of the plea negotiation process and the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s prior plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-11\"> Statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> Defendant suggests in passing that the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion under section 1385, properly may consider the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing in the prior case. The record does not suggest that the trial court considered such evidence in striking one of defendant\u2019s prior convictions in the present case, but rather considered only the fact of the magistrate\u2019s ruling declining to hold defendant to answer. Accordingly, we need not comment upon the propriety of a trial court considering the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\"> We have no occasion to determine in this case whether a trial court properly may strike a prior-conviction allegation in furtherance of justice under section 1385 based upon proof of factual innocence of the prior offense, and if so, what types of evidence the court may consider for this purpose. As the record reflects, defendant did not expressly argue that the trial court should strike a prior-conviction allegation in furtherance of justice because he was factually innocent of a prior offense, nor did he attempt to present evidence of his factual innocence of the prior offense. The trial court recognized that defendant was not making such an argument, commenting: \u201cIt\u2019s not a situation where a defendant is\u2014I don\u2019t take it to be where the defendant is arguing \u2018it didn\u2019t happen, give me a chance to prove it.\u2019 It\u2019s saying in exercising a 1385[,] take into account that a judge found there wasn\u2019t even evidence to charge it.\u201d Although defense counsel suggested in passing that defendant entered his previous no contest plea solely because of a favorable plea negotiation and his desire to be released from custody, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the unsworn statements of counsel are not evidence.\u201d <em>(In re Zeth S. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 396, 414, fn. 11 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 73 R3d 541].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b792-9\">MORENO, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"Au4\">I concur in the opinion as narrowly written. As the majority states, it does not decide the issue of whether \u201cthe trial court, in the exercise of its discretion under [Penal Code] section 1385, properly may consider the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing in the prior case. The record does not suggest that the trial court considered such evidence in striking one of defendant\u2019s prior convictions in the present case, but rather considered only the <em>fact of the magistrate\u2019s ruling </em>declining to hold defendant to answer. Accordingly, we need not comment upon the propriety of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>trial court considering the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 753, fn. 2, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">I agree that the mere facts that the magistrate declined to hold defendant to answer in one of the prior convictions to which defendant eventually pleaded guilty, and that the trial court set aside the charge pursuant to Penal Code section 995, subdivision (a)(2), do not by themselves justify the dismissal of the strike under Penal Code section 1385. But in my view nothing forbids a court from considering the insufficiency of the underlying evidence to determine whether the magistrate and the trial court were correct in their rulings, and in then dismissing a strike on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">As we stated in <em>People v. Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429]: \u201c[I]n ruling whether to strike or vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction allegation or finding under the Three Strikes law, on its own motion, \u2018in furtherance of justice\u2019 pursuant to Penal Code section 1385(a), or in reviewing such a ruling, the court in question must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme\u2019s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.\u201d The fact that there was insufficient evidence to hold defendant to answer on one of the prior felony convictions is a relevant \u201ccircumstance of [a] defendant\u2019s . . . prior serious and/or violent felony convictions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If there is indeed insufficient evidence as to one of the convictions to which a defendant pleaded guilty, that fact may well enter into the trial court\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s threat as a recidivist, and therefore whether the imposition of the permitted punishment under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law really serves the purpose of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Such an examination of the evidence of the underlying offense is not an impermissible collateral attack on a plea agreement, because the plea, and the conviction, are unaffected by the trial court\u2019s decision. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 490, 499 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 280, 976 P.2d 831].) Nor would a trial court considering such evidence be acting from considerations identified as improper in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 531 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628], i.e., \u201csolely \u2018to accommodate judicial convenience or because of court congestion.\u2019 . . . [or] if \u2018guided solely by a personal antipathy for the effect that the three strikes law would have on [a] defendant,\u2019 while ignoring \u2018defendant\u2019s background,\u2019 \u2018the nature of his present offenses,\u2019 and other \u2018individualized considerations.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>In short, the fact that there was insufficient evidence to hold a defendant to answer for an offense to which he eventually pleaded guilty has bearing on whether the defendant is in whole or in part outside the spirit of the Three Strikes law. A trial court should be able to consider this fact in determining whether to dismiss a strike under section 1385.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
