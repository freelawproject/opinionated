The FOIC determined that Stack improperly had been denied access to the arbitration hearing. The plaintiffs, the GEA, the commissioner of education and the arbitrators, appealed from the FOIC decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 l-21i (b) and 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Superior Court sustained the appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>and the Appellate Court affirmed. <em>Glastonbury Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>35 Conn. App. 111, 643 A.2d 1320 (1994). We granted certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the issue: \u201cDo binding interest arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-153a through 10-153n fall within the exemption from public disclosure [for strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining] contained in General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (b)?\u201d <em>Glastonbury Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>231 Conn. 922, 648 A.2d 162 (1994). Because we conclude that at least part of such a hearing may be closed to the public under the \u201cstrategy or negotiations\u201d provision of \u00a7 l-18a (b), we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The record reveals the following facts. After the GE A and the board had failed to reach agreement on a new union contract, compulsory binding arbitration was imposed by the commissioner of the department of education pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>December 8, 1990, an arbitration hearing was held to allow each side to present its \u201clast best offer\u201d and evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>dence and argument in favor of its position. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (2). Stack sought to attend this hearing, but was denied admission by the arbitration panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Stack and Hallas filed a eomplaint with the FOIC against the board and the arbitration panel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a contested hearing, the FOIC found that although the \u201cpurpose of the [arbitration] hearing was to allow the [board] and the [GEA] to each present a \u2018last best contract\u2019 offer and to submit evidence and argument on behalf of their positions,\u201d \u201cthe parties . . . can negotiate an agreement on their own with respect to <em>any </em>of the disputed issues, prior to the determination of the respondent panel . . . .\u201d The FOIC concluded that \u201calthough [such] hearings may and often do lead to further negotiation, the aetual arbitration hearing in this case . . . constituted a meeting within the meaning of <em>$ </em>l-18a (b), which should have been open to the public pursuant to \u00a7 1-21 . . . .\u201d The FOIC determined that the hearing must be open unless the GEA, the board and the arbitrators \u201cprovefd] . . . that collective bargaining negotiations actually occurred during the hearing in question.\u201d It found that the parties had failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The GEA, the commissioner of education and the arbitration panel appealed to the trial court, which sustained their appeal. That court held that, because compulsory arbitration proceedings are a continuation of strategy and negotiations with respect to collective bargaining, they do not constitute \u201cmeetings\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b) and thus they need not be open to the pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>lie. On appeal from the trial court, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment and the reasoning of the trial court. <em>Glastonbury Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 118-19. Viewing compulsory arbitration under the TNA as a part of the collective bargaining process, the Appellate Court held that such arbitration is excluded from the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d contained in the FOIA. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The FOIC challenges the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the relationship between compulsory binding arbitration hearings and collective bargaining automatically excludes such hearings in their entirety from the ambit of \u201cmeetings\u201d of government agencies that are presumptively open to the public under \u00a7 1-21 (a). The statutory exclusion from the open meeting requirement contained in \u00a7 l-18a (b) provides that \u201c \u2018[mjeeting\u2019 shall not include . . . strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining . ...\u201d In the view of the FOIC, the legislature intended this exclusion to encompass only those aspects of any collective bargaining process, including compulsory binding arbitrations, that directly involve strategy or negotiations. Although we agree with the FOIC in part, on the present record we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">This appeal raises two interrelated issues of statutory construction. What is the scope of the exclusion for collective bargaining contained in \u00a7 l-18a (b)?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To what extent are compulsory arbitration proceedings under the TNA properly characterized as collective bargaining and as strategy or negotiations relating thereto?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Inquiry into the scope of the statutory exclusion for collective bargaining contained in \u00a7 l-18a (b) must com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>menee with the recognition of the legislature\u2019s general commitment to open governmental proceedings. \u201cThe overarching legislative policy of the FOIA is one that favors \u2018the open conduct of government and free public access to government records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 166, 635 A.2d 783 (1993), citing <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 328, 435 A.2d 353 (1980); see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>208 Conn. 442, 450, 545 A.2d 1064 (1988) (\u201cgeneral policy of openness expressed in the FOIA legislation\u201d). The sponsors of the FOIA understood the legislation to express the people\u2019s sovereignty over \u201cthe agencies which serve them\u201d; see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328, citing 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1975 Sess., p. 3911, remarks of Representative Martin Burke; and this court consistently has interpreted that expression to require diligent protection of the public\u2019s right of access to agency proceedings. \u201cOur construction of the [FOIA] must be guided by the policy favoring disclosure and exceptions to disclosure must be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 651, 631 A.2d 252 (1993); <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992); see also <em>Kureczka </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 271, 277, 636 A.2d 777 (1994); <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 398, 604 A.2d 351 (1992); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 232, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 431, 518 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In light of these principles, the statutory definition of public meetings contained in \u00a7 l-18a (b) must be read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>to limit rather than to expand the opportunities for public agencies to hold closed hearings. Accordingly, the language providing that public meetings \u201cshall not include . . . strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining\u201d means, as the FOIC maintains, that what is excluded from the term \u201cmeeting\u201d is not <em>all </em>collective bargaining, but only \u201cstrategy or negotiations\u201d sessions that relate to collective bargaining. This interpretation accords proper respect for the manifest legislative policy expressed in the FOIA. It also comports with its legislative history, which suggests that the collective bargaining exception was understood to provide privacy for \u201cthe <em>give-and-take in negotiating sessions </em>of collective bargaining . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 18 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 3896. Had the legislature intended a broader exclusion, it could have excluded \u201ccollective bargaining\u201d without limitation, or it could have excluded \u201ccollective bargaining, including but not limited to strategy and negotiations relating thereto.\u201d See <em>Bloomfield Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Frahm, </em>35 Conn. App. 384, 389, 646 A.2d 247, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 926, 648 A.2d 161 (1994). It chose neither of these options.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 l-18a (b) finds further support in related provisions of the FOIA that provide limited exceptions to the public disclosure requirement for those portions of proceedings that relate to strategy or negotiations. In \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2), for example, the legislature authorized a public agency to adjourn a meeting into executive session for \u201cstrategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims and litigation\u201d to which the agency itself is a party. Pointedly, the legislature did not adopt a more sweeping approach, such as closing the entire meeting, to achieve its purpose of sheltering specified components of the proceedings from public scrutiny. See <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 183, 190, 470 A.2d 1209 (1984) (agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>authority under \u00a7 l-18a [e] [1] to adjourn into executive session for deliberations during proceedings about public employee\u2019s job performance does not include authority to conduct evidentiary portion of proceedings in private). Similarly, the legislature has exempted from public disclosure not all documents relating to collective bargaining, but only \u201crecords, reports and statements of strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (9). Although the legislature\u2019s narrowly tailored approach to the FOIA exclusions and exemptions may add a layer of complexity to agency administration, the legislature implicitly has decided that the associated costs are outweighed by the benefits derived from open government.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the structure of the TNA. Although TNA arbitrations arise out of an initial failure to reach agreement in ordinary collective bargaining, they were designed to provide incentives for further bargaining between the parties. The TNA establishes a sequence of increasingly formal collective bargaining procedures to ensure the existence of a teacher contract by the beginning of the town\u2019s fiscal year. A board of education and representatives of the teachers\u2019 union have a statutory duty to negotiate concerning salary and other conditions of employment. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153d (b). Those negotiations must commence no later than 210 days- prior to the budget submission date for the board. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153d (b). If a complete negotiated settlement has not been reached by 160 days prior to the submission date, the statutes mandate that the parties proceed to mediation. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (b). Finally, if mediation has not settled all remaining disputes by 135 days prior to the submission date, the statute imposes mandatory last best offer arbitration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 10-153f (c) (1). After a hearing at which each party may present all relevant evidence, the arbitral panel \u201cshall resolve separately each individual disputed issue by accepting the last best offer thereon of either of the parties. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (4). The arbitral panel also is required to include in its decision any agreements previously arrived at by the parties. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The issue raised by this three-step collective bargaining process is how to fit the process into the open meetings provisions of the FOIA. The various steps contemplated by the TNA could be construed as establishing a structural division between \u201cnegotiation,\u201d which occurs at step one, and \u201carbitration,\u201d which occurs at step three and occurs only if both negotiation and mediation have failed to result in a contract. Such a construction of the TNA would not comport, however, with the underlying realities of the TNA process.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The TNA contemplates arbitration proceedings that interface with collective bargaining between the parties and collective bargaining\u2019s attendant \u201cstrategy and negotiations.\u201d The TNA permits the arbitration proceedings to be continued, at the discretion of the arbitrators, provided that the arbitration hearing concludes within twenty-five days after its commencement. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (3). The apparent purpose of this provision is to afford the parties an opportunity to pursue further negotiations on their own even after compulsory arbitration has commenced, if the arbitration panel believes that such negotiations could prove fruitful. Even when not formally recessed for \u201cnegotiations,\u201d the arbitration hearing itself contains elements of strategy and negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Uncontradicted evidence in the record before the FOIC documents that a TNA arbitration does not oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ate as a typical quasi-judicial process, but rather as a stylized or ritualized mediated negotiation process in which the parties submit initial last best offers, interim last best offers and final last best offers. Throughout the process, the threat of the arbitration panel\u2019s decision-making power provides a strong incentive for the parties to resolve outstanding issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Testimony before the FOIC in this case indicated that the arbitrators \u201cdon\u2019t receive the parties\u2019 absolute final position until the very end of the hearing and the parties often and usually present a different position when they open the hearing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">This description comports with the general understanding of how compulsory binding interest arbitration hearings are usually conducted. One outside commentator has observed that the theory undergirding last best offer arbitration is that \u201cthe logic of the procedure would force negotiating parties to continue moving closer together in search of a position that would be most likely to receive neutral sympathy. . . . Flexible procedures of this kind, clearly designed to encourage voluntary settlements prior to, during and even after the completion of the hearing, are obviously a. hybrid of mediation and arbitration. . . . Flexible final-offer procedures . . . almost inevitably result in a proceeding which is known as mediation-arbitration, often called simply \u2018med-arb\u2019. . . . Ordinary interest arbitration is normally a somewhat judicial procedure in which the neutral [arbitrator] takes evidence and then drafts the parties\u2019 \u2018agreement\u2019 in the loneliness of his own study. In med-arb [however] the neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>[arbitrator] customarily works out solutions in the presence of and with input from the parties.\u201d C. Rehmus, \u201cInterest Arbitration,\u201d in Portrait of a Process: Collective Negotiations in Public Employment (1979) pp. 218-20. As we held recently in interpreting similar provisions of the Municipal Employees Relations Act, by requiring the arbitrators to accept revised last best offers, binding arbitration procedures facilitate further collective bargaining between the parties. <em>International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 564 </em>v. <em>Jewett City, </em>234 Conn. 123, 133-34, 661 A.2d 573 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">These operational characteristics of compulsory arbitration under the TNA persuade us that the actual presentation of last best offers by the parties sufficiently resembles \u201cnegotiations,\u201d despite the fact that they occur during a proceeding denominated as \u201carbitration,\u201d to be excluded from the \u201cmeeting\u201d requirements of the FOIA. Because the FOIC order in this case determined that Stack should have been permitted to attend the entire arbitration hearing, and ordered that similar hearings in the future likewise be open to the public in their entirety, the FOIC\u2019s unconditional order was improper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We note that the TNA permits each party, in its presentations to the arbitral board, \u201cto submit all relevant evidence, to introduce relevant documents and written material, and to argue on behalf of its\u201d last best offer. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (2). In aid of this evidentiary process, the arbitrators have the \u201cpower to administer oaths and affirmations and to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-108; see General Statutes \u00a7 10-153f (d). Thus, the arbitration hearing also provides an opportunity for the parties to create an evidentiary record on which the arbitrators can rely in making their final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>determination of any issues left unresolved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since we already have concluded that the FOIC order at issue here cannot stand, we postpone to another day questions concerning the validity of a more narrowly tailored FOIC order that requires open hearings only with respect to evidentiary presentations and permits executive sessions for discussion and argument about the contents of the parties\u2019 last best offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In this opinion Callahan and Palmer, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a provides in relevant part: \u201cdefinitions.

I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed because the freedom of information commission (FOIC) order in this case improperly required the \u201clast best offer\u201d arbitration hearings to be open to the public in their entirety. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s reservation of the issue of \u201cthe validity of a more narrowly tailored FOIC order that requires open hearings only with respect to evidentiary presentations and permits executivesessions for discussion and argument about the contents of the parties\u2019 last best offers.\u201d In my view, \u201clast best offer\u201d arbitration proceedings under the Teacher Negotiation Act do not fall with the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d as that term is used in General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (b), and the public may be excluded from such proceedings in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">First, I think that the certified question, which asks whether binding interest arbitration proceedings \u201cfall <em>within the exemption </em>from public disclosure contained in General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (b)\u201d (emphasis added) is analytically incorrect, and that the majority builds on that analytical error when it refers to the \u201cstatutory exclusion from the open meeting requirement contained in \u00a7 l-18a (b).\u201d Section l-18a is the definitional section of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Thus, it is the section that determines whether something is a meeting in the first instance, not whether something is excluded from \u201cthe open meeting requirement.\u201d The question in this case is whether the arbitration proceedings come within the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d in \u00a7 l-18a (b) and are, therefore, covered by the FOIA in the first instance, not whether they are otherwise covered proceedings that are exempted from the open meeting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">I agree that, in construing the definitions contained in \u00a7 l-18a, we do so in light of the general principle of openness embodied by the FOIA. See <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 551, 436 A.2d 266 (1980). I disagree, however, that that principle applies with the same force under \u00a7 l-18a as it does under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b). <em>See Rules Committee of the Superior Court </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 234, 472 A.2d 9 (1984); <em>Connecticut Bar Examining Committee </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>209 Conn. 204, 550 A.2d 633 (1988); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>213 Conn. 216, 566 A.2d 1362 (1989), affirming <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 267, 566 A.2d 1380 (1988); <em>Connecticut Humane Society </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 757, 591 A.2d 395 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>(1991); <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 595 A.2d 313 (1991). Thus, I agree that, in deciding whether the arbitration proceedings in this case come within the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d contained in \u00a7 1-18a (b), we must do so in light of the general purpose of openness embodied in the FOIA. As I explain below, however, that general purpose is insufficient to overcome the other, more specific evidence that the legislature, in enacting the definition that applies to this case, did not intend the arbitration proceedings at issue here to be within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The language at issue in this case is as follows: \u201c \u2018Meeting\u2019 means any hearing or other proceeding of a public agency ... to discuss or act upon a matter over which the public agency has . . . control [or] jurisdiction .... \u2018Meeting\u2019 shall not include . . . strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (b). This language, taken alone, gives very little guidance on how to decide this case. Both parts of the definition\u2014what \u201cmeeting\u201d <em>\u201cmeans\u201d </em>and what it <em>\u201cshall hot include\u201d\u2014 </em>are put in very broad terms. In this connection, I do not think that the use of the phrase \u201cstrategy or negotiations\u201d was meant to be a limitation on the meaning of \u201ccollective bargaining,\u201d but, as I explain below, was meant to be an expansive phrase\u2014in effect, to signify that the legislature meant to cover all of the aspects\u2014 both intraparty (strategy) and interparty (negotiations)\u2014of the collective bargaining process, and everything in between.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Although the specific statutory language, as applied to the facts of this case, sheds little light on how to decide this case, the legislative history is very illuminating. The legislator who presented the amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the House of Representatives stated: \u201cThe first thing the Amendment does is to take the concept of collective bargaining out of the \u2018right to know law.\u2019 In other words, [in] the definitional section of meeting of a public agency, collective bargaining is not included. The Committee felt, after discussions with many parties, that the area of collective bargaining was distinctly different from any other governmental process or a process that governments engage in. It was thought that the give-and-take in negotiating sessions of collective bargaining was much too sensitive to require that this be done in public. It also could possibly result in violations of various labor Acts as an unfair labor practice. That is, if a public agency demanded that the negotiations take place in public and the bargainers for the employees did not want this. We further felt that the area of abuses that we\u2019re trying to get at by this sweeping Freedom of Information Act were not really in the area of labor negotiations. So for those reasons, <em>we took out collective bargaining from a definition of a meeting of a public agency and so this Act doesn\u2019t deal at all with collective bargaining.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8,1975 Sess., p. 3896, remarks of Representative Martin B. Burke. This clearly indicates a legislative intent to exclude the process of collective bargaining from the coverage of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">This reading of the legislative history is also consistent with the dictionary definitions of \u201cstrategy\u201d and \u201cnegotiations\u201d that are the most appropriate to the subject of collective bargaining. Those definitions are, in my view, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Strategy is defined as \u201cthe art of <em>devising or employing plans or stratagems.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. This suggests that strategy goes beyond devising to include the implementation of the plan or stratagem devised. Thus, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>include not only the plans devised by the parties in the course of the arbitration process, but their putting those plans into practice during that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Negotiation is defined as \u201cthe action or process of negotiating,\u201d and negotiate is variously defined as: \u201cto communicate or confer with another so as to arrive at the settlement of some matter: meet with another so as to arrive through discussion at some kind of agreement or compromise about something\u201d; \u201cto arrange for or bring about through conference and discussion: work out or arrive at or settle upon by meetings or agreements or compromises\u201d; and \u201cto influence successfully in a desired way by discussions and agreements or compromises.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. These definitions go beyond the mere \u201cquid pro quo\u201d part of the negotiation process, and would include the entire presentation during the arbitration process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In addition, the fact that the statute does not explicitly mention \u201cmediation\u201d supports this broad reading. It would be difficult to conclude that the process of mediation, which is essentially a process of negotiation between the principals aided by a mediator, was not meant to be excluded by the legislature in its statutory formulation of what a \u201cmeeting\u201d does not include. This suggests, therefore, that, consistent with the legislative history, the legislature meant the phrase \u201cstrategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining\u201d to be a unitary phrase, and to be broadly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>strued to cover the entire continuum of the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The majority asserts that \u201c[h]ad the legislature intended a broader exclusion, it could have excluded \u2018collective bargaining\u2019 without limitation, or it could have excluded \u2018collective bargaining, including but not limited to strategy and negotiations relating thereto.\u2019 \u201d Although I agree that this language would also carry the meaning I ascribe to the language that the legislature <em>did </em>enact, the fact that the legislature could have phrased its intention differently is essentially irrelevant. Our task in statutory interpretation is to determine what the legislature meant by the language it did use. With judicial hindsight it is always possible to construct clearer language that would have better conveyed the legislature\u2019s intent, particularly with respect to a factual situation that the legislature might not have specifically contemplated. In short, I \u201csee no justification to thwart the legislature\u2019s purpose simply because that purpose could have been stated more clearly.\u201d <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 436, 650 A.2d 557 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">My conclusion that the last best offer arbitration proceeding does not constitute a meeting within the meaning of the FOIA is also consistent with the record in this case. The majority aptly describes the process of last best offer arbitration as a combination of mediation and arbitration that \u201c \u2018force[s] negotiating parties to continue moving closer together in search of a position that would be most likely to receive neutral sympathy.\u2019 \u201d That this \u201c \u2018[flexible [procedure is] clearly designed to encourage voluntary settlements prior to, during and even after the completion of the hearing\u2019 \u201d supports my broad reading of the statutory language. The witnesses who testified before the FOIC hearing officer described the collective bargaining process as a continuum, consisting of negotiation, mediation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>arbitration. The record is also clear that the last best offer process is itself a kind of strategizing and negotiation between the parties, by which the parties themselves continually modify their various \u201clast best offers\u201d in response to the other party\u2019s various \u201clast best offers.\u201d In addition, when the parties themselves agree\u2014either on all or part of the issues\u2014they are required to present those agreements to the arbitrators, who <em>must </em>then accept them and render their award accordingly as a \u201cstipulated award.\u201d The record also discloses that even the evidence that the parties present in the arbitration proceeding is presented in connection with their \u201clast best offers.\u201d Thus, it cannot be separated out from the process of conveying those offers. In effect, there are two audiences for that evidence: (1) the arbitrators; and (2) the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The majority\u2019s reservation of the issue of whether the \u201cevidentiary presentations\u201d may be subject to an FOIC open meeting order is unworkable in the context of this kind of arbitration. First, it assumes that part of the arbitration proceedings can fit within the statutory definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d while the remainder falls without. It is unrealistic to slice up the proceeding that way, and I see no basis for it in the language or purpose of the statutory definition of \u201cmeeting.\u201d Any attempt to separate the \u201cevidentiary presentations\u201d from the argument in support of various last best offers in such proceedings would simply require too fine a cut for the parties and arbitrators to achieve. Although such a delineation may be possible in a formal judicial hearing, such a division is inconsistent with what the record discloses regarding how this type of arbitration works. It does not appear to me that there is, or can be, a clearly defined line between argument and evidence in the \u201cmed-arb\u201d process as described by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Finally, although I agree with the judgment of the majority affirming the Appellate Court, I suggest that the majority has established a procedural hurdle not previously placed before citizens seeking information through the FOIC. The majority concludes that, since Stack asked to attend the <em>entire </em>arbitration proceeding, and the FOIC ordered the <em>entire </em>arbitration proceeding open, because at least part of the proceeding, namely, everything except the evidentiary presentation, does not have to be open, the majority need not consider whether the remainder, namely, the evidentiary presentation, must or need not be open. The premise of this conclusion, however, is simply that Stack made too broad a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Thus, had Stack asked to attend only the evidentiary portions of the proceedings, the majority would be faced squarely with deciding whether she had the right to do so. Because she asked to attend the entire proceeding, however, the majority has declined to decide whether she is entitled to attend a certain part of it. When faced with such issues in the past, we have delineated what portions of the information requested were and were not public under the FOIA and remanded for further proceedings. See <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 256, 588 A.2d 1368 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\u201cAs a practical matter, the FOIA is used repeatedly by members of the public who are unschooled in technical, legalistic language distinctions.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 167, 635 A.2d 783 (1993). Just as we determined in <em>Perkins </em>that \u201c[i]t would be unreasonable to deny a member of the public access to the FOIA simply because of arguable imperfections in the form in which a request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>public records is couched\u201d; id.; it is also unreasonable to require that a member of the public disaggregate her request into its component parts in order to receive a definitive ruling on the validity of that request. This is especially true in this case, where the division of the proceeding into component parts is the creation of the majority\u2019s analysis and was not suggested by any of the parties or the witnesses who described the arbitration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In sum, I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on the ground that the last best offer arbitration proceedings in this case were not within the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d contained in \u00a7 l-18a (b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\"> The majority points to \u00a7 1-19 (b) (9), asserting that \u201cthe legislature has exempted from public disclosure not all documents relating to collective bargaining, but only \u2018records, reports and statements of strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining.\u2019 \u201d In my view, this conclusory statement begs the question. Based on my analysis of the legislative history, \u201crecords, reports and statements of strategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining\u201d is also meant to cover the waterfront on collective bargaining, not narrow the field.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b746-5\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJq\">dissenting. The issue before this court is whether the people of the town of Glastonbury, and indeed the public at large, have a right to know what transpires before a formal arbitration proceeding that will have a direct effect upon the town\u2019s public education and the costs of operating the public schools. In my view, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that all formal proceedings before arbitrators appointed pursuant to the Teacher Negotiation Act (TNA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including the last best offers submitted into evidence by the parties during this proceeding, be open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">I begin my analysis with the principles that not only serve as the theoretical underpinnings of the FOIA, but also govern our interpretation of the act and our application of its provisions. In <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 398, 604 A.2d 351 (1992), this court unanimously held that \u201cthe general rule under the [FOIA] is disclosure . . . .\u201d The FOIA \u201cexpresses a strong legislative policy in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>of the open conduct of government and free public access to government records. ... At the time of its unanimous passage by the General Assembly, the act was noted for making sweeping changes in the existing right to know law so as to mark a new era in Connecticut with respect to opening up the doors of city and state government to the people of Connecticut. . . . As Representative Martin B. Burke, who sponsored the bill which was enacted, expressly stated on the floor of the house, the intent of the act is to make every public record and every public meeting open to the public at all times with certain specified exclusions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 550, 436 A.2d 266 (1980). In light of these underlying principles, therefore, we must narrowly construe any exceptions or exemptions to its guiding rule of openness. <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 398; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 329, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). \u201cThe burden of proving the applicability of an exception to the FOIA rests upon the party claiming it.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 232, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Justice Borden, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, and the majority profess to adhere to these beneficent purposes of the FOIA. In practice, however, these justices narrowly construe the FOIA. The concurring and dissenting opinion would keep the entire proceedings before the arbitration panel from public scrutiny. The majority, which addresses only whether the evidence of the last best offers submitted by the parties is available to the public, concludes that it is not. These interpretations of the FOIA serve only to undermine and weaken its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">All aspects of collective bargaining are not, as the concurring and dissenting opinion would hold, exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>from disclosure. Rather, as the majority notes, what the legislature intended to exclude from the requirements of the FOIA \u201cis not <em>all </em>collective bargaining, but only \u2018strategy or negotiations\u2019 sessions that relate to collective bargaining. . . . Had the legislature intended a broader exclusion, it could have excluded \u2018collective bargaining\u2019 without limitation, or it could have excluded \u2018collective bargaining, including but not limited to strategy and negotiations relating thereto.\u2019 ... It chose neither of these options.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Nevertheless, I do not agree with the conclusion that the majority proceeds to draw from its interpretation of this language. The majority holds that the public does not have the right to attend arbitration hearings in which the parties present last best offers. The majority\u2019s reasoning on this point is, at best, tenuous. It begins with a characterization of the TNA arbitration proceedings that is not supported by anything in the record or in extrinsic sources, and concludes that \u201cthe actual presentation of last best offers by the parties sufficiently resembles \u2018negotiations,\u2019 despite the fact that they occur during a proceeding denominated as \u2018arbitration,\u2019 to be excluded from the \u2018meeting\u2019 requirements of the FOIA.\u201d I strongly disagree with both the majority\u2019s premise and the conclusion that it draws therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The majority, under the guise of interpreting the \u201cunderlying realities of the TNA process,\u201d declares that arbitration conducted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd \u201cdoes not operate as a typical quasi-judicial process, but rather as a stylized or ritualized mediated negotiation process.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet this suggestion that the arbitration proceeding is akin to mediated negotiation is not supported by the statutory scheme, the record before us, or any of the professional literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The legislature has established a three-tiered system that is designed to lead to a collective bargaining agreement between teachers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and their local school board. Initially, the two sides attempt to negotiate an agreement that is mutually acceptable. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-153d (requiring representatives of both sides to negotiate). If negotiation fails, either party or the commissioner of education may institute mediation. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (b). The statute allows the two sides to select a single mutually acceptable mediator, or the commissioner may select the single mediator. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153f (b). If mediation fails to produce an agreement, the dispute proceeds to the arbitration stage. The neutral party may consist of either a single arbitrator or a panel of three arbitrators. If the parties agree to have a single arbitrator decide the issues, the commissioner must select that arbitrator at random from a designated pool. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (1); see General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (a). If the parties agree on a three person panel, each side selects one arbitrator and the commissioner selects the third at random from the designated pool. General Statutes \u00a7 10-153f (c) (1). During the arbitration hearing, \u201ceach party shall have full opportunity to submit all relevant evidence, to introduce relevant documents and written material, and to argue on behalf of its positions.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-153\u00cd (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of the arbitration proceeding as \u201cmediated negotiation\u201d is wholly inconsistent with this statutory scheme. The parties only reach the final step of arbitration after they have attempted mediation unsuccessfully. Unlike the mediation process, where the statute expressly contemplates that each side will make \u201cconfidential communication\u201d to the private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>mediator,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the statutory arbitration proceedings are set forth by statute as quasi-judicial proceedings in which the parties present evidence and argue their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Moreover, there is nothing in the record to support the majority\u2019s characterization of the arbitration process. Although it is true that each side may change the substance of its \u201clast best offer\u201d between the beginning of the hearing and its conclusion, this fact alone does not suggest that the arbitrators have any involvement other than as neutral decision makers. Indeed, there is evidence in the record to the contrary. Donald J. Deneen, one of the three arbitrators who served on the arbitration panel in this case, testified before the freedom of information commission (FOIC) that each side caucuses privately and decides what its \u201clast best offer\u201d shall be. Deneen indicated that the arbitrators are not involved in these decisions: \u201cThe offers are decided by each side. <em>They present their offers to us.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, Deneen indicated that the mediation procedures and arbitration procedures are completely distinct from one another. As he explained, \u201cwe\u2019re not involved until they have gone through the time frame of the mediation phase of the process.\u201d This version of events, and of the nature of the arbitration hearing that was conducted in this case, is fully supported by the findings and conclusion of the FOIC, which determined that neither strategy nor negotiations occurred during the arbitration proceeding in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority, contrary to well estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>lished law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> chooses to ignore these factual findings of an administrative agency and instead substitutes its own belief that the arbitration proceeding constituted \u201cmediated negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Finally, the professional literature that addresses impasse resolution procedures contradicts the approach taken by the majority. Indeed, this literature universally indicates that when mediation has failed and the dispute has proceeded to arbitration, the resulting proceeding is quasi-judicial in character. In interest arbitration, the arbitrators \u201cendeavor to give the parties a fair and impartial hearing.\u201d D. Dilts &amp; W. Walsh, Collective Bargaining and Impasse Resolution in the Public Sector (1988) p. 118. Under such a scheme, \u201cissues not resolved through negotiation, fact-finding, or mediation are required to be submitted to an arbitration board whose decision is final and binding.\u201d J. Grodin, D. Wollett &amp; R. Alleyne, Collective Bargaining in Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Employment (3d Ed. 1979) p. 273. The parties to such a procedure, like parties to a judicial proceeding, usually may request continuances, stays, inspections and site visitations. D. Dilts &amp; W. Walsh, supra, p. 118. Indeed, as indicated above, the legislature in this state has expressly provided in the TNA for parties to submit evidence and to argue on behalf of their respective positions during the arbitration stage. These sources all indicate that, unlike the interpretation of the majority, interest arbitration is more accurately characterized as a judicial process, not a mediation process. I would be very much surprised that an arbitrator, who must make the final decisions on these contested matters, would participate in negotiations between the parties. See, e.g., <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 146-47, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987) (arbitral \u201cmisconduct,\u201d which is grounds for a court to vacate an arbitration award, includes \u201cparticipation in ex parte communications with a party or a witness, without the knowledge or consent of the other party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The majority quotes a single commentator as support for its interpretation of \u201cthe general understanding of how compulsory binding interest arbitration hearings are usually conducted.\u201d It quotes that commentator for the proposition that the neutral party \u201ccustomarily works out solutions in the presence of and with input from the parties.\u201d C. Rehmus, \u201cInterest Arbitration,\u201d in Portrait of a Process: Collective Negotiations in Public Employment (1979) p. 220. That commentator, however, is not describing arbitration. Rather, that commentator is expressly referring to a completely different procedure known as mediation-arbitration. \u201cMediation-arbitration (med-arb) combines the two dispute settlement techniques of mediation and arbitration, just as the name implies. Under med-arb, the mediator becomes the arbitrator with binding author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>ity to settle any issue not resolved . . . .\u201d D. Dilts &amp; W. Walsh, supra, p. 167. This is an alternative approach to mediation and arbitration, \u201cin which the neutral [party] is expected both to mediate the dispute and, if he is not successful, to decide it.\u201d J. Grodin, D. Wollett &amp; R. Alleyne, supra, p. 274. Nevertheless, on this tenuous basis, the majority concludes that \u201cthe actual presentation of last best offers by the parties sufficiently resembles \u2018negotiations\u2019 \u201d to allow these offers to be kept from public disclosure. In Connecticut, however, the three-tiered system crafted by the legislature provides for different individuals to mediate the dispute and to arbitrate it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the med-arb procedure, and the observations of the lone commentator cited by the majority, are of absolutely no relevance in interpreting our own system of dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Most importantly, the very narrow scope of the FOIA\u2019s exemption for strategy or negotiations dovetails with the necessity of public accountability for any decisions reached with regard to teacher contracts. If a local board of education negotiates with the teachers union in hopes of reaching a settlement, the FOIA exemption provides that those negotiations need not be disclosed. That secrecy in government, however, can be tolerated because if the negotiations do, in fact, result in a settlement, the board of education will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>held directly accountable by the public for the terms of the settlement to which it agreed. On the other hand, if the new contract is imposed upon the parties by an arbitrator or arbitration panel, the board of education will not be held directly accountable for the terms of the contract; rather, the board would be insulated from public criticism because the contract was imposed by a quasi-judicial decision maker. It is for this reason that secrecy cannot be tolerated during those arbitration proceedings. The public must be able to learn what the board of education proposed and what evidence it presented to the arbitration panel. Only in this manner will members of the public be able to hold their local board accountable for any failure to represent properly their interests before the neutral arbitral panel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Neither the majority nor Justice Borden, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, attaches significance to this fundamental need for accountability. According to the majority, the public can be prevented from learning what type of contract offer the board of education has made. Indeed, the majority does not make clear whether the public would <em>ever </em>be allowed to discover this information, even after a new contract has been reached. According to the concurring and dissenting opinion, the public does not have the right to know what type of contract offer the board of education has made, or what types of evidence the board presented in support of that offer. These approaches allow government, and specifically the local board of education, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>operate in secrecy without any direct accountability to the public. The central, underlying purpose of the FOIA\u2014to allow the people to know what their government is up to<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2014is not served by the court today.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a and 1-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> I confess that I am not entirely certain what it means for a process of negotiation to be \u201cstylized or ritualized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-5\"> The three-tiered process also applies to administrators.
