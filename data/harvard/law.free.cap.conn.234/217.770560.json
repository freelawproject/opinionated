The court affirmed the board\u2019s award and the plaintiff appealed from the court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The events that prompted this litigation can be summarized in the following manner. In early 1992, the new administration of the defendant city of West Haven (city) became aware that the city\u2019s financial condition was especially precarious. Projections were that by the end of June, 1992, the city\u2019s deficit would reach $10.2 million. The administration attempted to alleviate the city\u2019s financial crisis by various methods, including borrowing money through the issuance of bond anticipation notes. In April, 1992, however, the city was informed that its bond rating had been downgraded so that its bond anticipation notes were unmarketable. In desperation, the city sought assistance from the state in the form of state guarantees of its present and future bond obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Connecticut legislature responded by enacting No. 92-5 of the 1992 Special Acts (act). The act provided the sought after guarantees of the city\u2019s obligations. It also created the board, however, to oversee the city\u2019s finances and to ensure that the city did not default on its bonds and bond anticipation notes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>were thereafter guaranteed by the state. Moreover, the board was vested by the act with broad oversight powers. Those powers include the power: to approve or disapprove budgets; to review and approve the city\u2019s financial plans; to review and approve all contracts involving expenditures of more than $50,000; and, most importantly for the purposes of this litigation, to approve or disapprove all collective bargaining agreements and to serve as the binding arbitration panel with respect to all labor contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">On June 30,1993, the existing collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the city expired. When the plaintiff and the city were unsuccessful in agreeing on a new contract, the board imposed binding arbitration. Functioning as the arbitration panel pursuant to the act, the board conducted hearings and issued an arbitration award in December, 1993. The plaintiff, dissatisfied with the arbitration award, filed its application to vacate the award. In its application to vacate, the plaintiff claimed that the act: (1) violated the home rule provision of article tenth, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) violated General Statutes \u00a7 2-14;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>(3) required the board members to act with \u201cevident partiality\u201d toward the city in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) denied the plaintiff and its members equal protection of the law, in violation of article first, \u00a7 20, of the state constitution; and (5) granted the city exclusive emoluments or privileges in violation of article first, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s various claims and denied its application to vacate the arbitration award. This appeal followed. In its appeal, the plaintiff renews the claims it made in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">A thorough examination of the record, the briefs and arguments of the parties on appeal persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues raised on appeal were correctly decided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>trial court\u2019s exhaustive memorandum of decision. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 681, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 470, 662 A.2d 160 (1995).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the court\u2019s memorandum of decision addresses and fully resolves the issues raised in the present appeal, it would serve no useful purpose to repeat the discussion contained therein. <em>Fraenza </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>232 Conn. 401, 404-405, 655 A.2d 1112 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 provides: \u201cVACATING AWARD, (a) Upon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof, shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201c(b) If an award is vacated and the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u201c(c) Any party filing an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section concerning an arbitration award issued by the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration shall notify said board and the attorney general, in writing, of such filing within five days of the date of filing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> The constitution of Connecticut, article tenth, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cThe general assembly shall by general law delegate such legislative authority as from time to time it deems appropriate to towns, cities and boroughs relative to the powers, organization, and form of government of such political subdivisions.

Indeed, in <em>Daly </em>we construed the equal protection clause of the state constitution to furnish more protection than its federal counterpart. It does not affect the result in this case but our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s decision should not be construed so as to disavow our holding in <em>Daly.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
