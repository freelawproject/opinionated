The plaintiff, Patricia A. Krafick, appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court dissolving her thirty-three year marriage to the defendant, John H. Krafick, and distributing the parties\u2019 marital assets. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court without opinion. <em>Krafick </em>v. <em>Krafick, </em>34 Conn. App. 930, 643 A.2d 314 (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted certification<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>The relevant procedural and factual background is as follows. The parties were married on December 27, 1958. During the first twenty years of their marriage, the plaintiff worked in the home, caring for the parties\u2019 seven children. She reentered the paid workforce in 1979 to work part-time in a bakery. In 1981, she obtained a full-time position with the Danbury welfare department as a case worker, where she subsequently was promoted to assistant director. The plaintiff\u2019s 1992 earnings from this position were approximately $36,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The defendant worked as a teacher, first in the Dan-bury school system and subsequently in the Bedford, New York school system. He retired on February 1, 1994, shortly after the parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved, after thirty-four years of service. In addition, the defendant worked as a full-time seasonal night dispatcher at a fuel company and held a number of other short-term summer jobs. The defendant\u2019s 1992 total earnings were approximately $79,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">After several years of growing dissatisfaction with their relationship, the parties separated in February, 1991. In August, 1991, the plaintiff instituted this marriage dissolution action seeking a decree of dissolution, alimony and the assignment of certain property from the defendant\u2019s estate, including a 50 percent interest in the defendant\u2019s pension by way of a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>The parties\u2019 financial affidavits disclosed that, in addition to the family home,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the parties owned a retail liquor business,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a summer cottage in Old Saybrook<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and several \u201cindividual assets,\u201d including personal vehicles and savings and checking accounts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties also claimed as \u201cdeferred assets\u201d their respective retirement plans. The plaintiff had two individual retirement accounts with a total value of $8374 and a pension from the city of Danbury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant had a 401k plan from his job as a dispatcher, valued at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>$30,500, an early retirement bonus in the amount of $16,200 and a pension from the New York state teachers\u2019 retirement system, which would pay him 61 percent of the average of his three highest years of salary upon retirement, but which he claimed had \u201cno present cash value.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">At trial, two documents addressing the nature and value of the defendant\u2019s teacher\u2019s pension were introduced as exhibits. The first was a letter from the teachers\u2019 retirement system benefits department that was addressed to the defendant. The letter explained that the pension fund was entirely employer funded and that contributions were not allocated to individual members in the form of an annuity savings account. Instead, benefits were calculated pursuant to a preset formula, based on the member\u2019s total years of service and the average of the member\u2019s three highest years of salary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The pension vested at twenty years of credited service.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The plaintiff also introduced an expert appraisal of the defendant\u2019s pension performed by Law Data, Inc. The appraisal stated that the defendant was fully vested in the pension and it projected, on the basis of his retiring on the eve of trial, that his annual pension income would be $36,500. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s age and life expectancy, the appraisal further stated that the present value of the pension was $420,981. The defendant did not contest this appraisal nor did he introduce an alternative calculation of the pension\u2019s present value or its projected yearly payout. Instead, he stressed that he could not liquidate the pension nor receive any payments from it until he retired. The defendant indicated at trial that he was eligible to retire and that he intended to do so in June, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On November 19,1992, the trial court rendered judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> however, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>made the following division of the parties\u2019 property and award of support. The plaintiff was awarded the family home, most of the household furniture and furnishings, her interest in the Old Saybrook property, and the retail liquor business. Additionally, the defendant was ordered to pay to the plaintiff $300 per week in alimony, secured by a QDRO against his pension.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant received $30,000 \u201cas and for a property distribution.\u201d The parties retained their \u201crespective bank accounts, securities, IRA plans and respective pension rights free and clear of any claims of the other, subject only to the [QDRO].\u201d In addition, the parties were made equally responsible for payment of any existing debt, but were individually responsible for any other liabilities shown on the affidavits. Lastly, the parties were ordered to exchange life insurance policies, each worth approximately $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to open and clarify the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 (a); see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 329, 4051 and 4061. She contended that the trial court\u2019s disposition of the marital assets was inequitable, in that, according to her calculations, it awarded the defendant 87 percent of the assets and the plaintiff only 13 percent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>tiff sought clarification of the basis of the court\u2019s property distribution, particularly whether the trial court had found the plaintiff to be at fault. She also asked the trial court to address difficulties encountered in using a QDRO to reach the pension merely as security for alimony, rather than awarding her as a QDRO a percentage interest in the pension itself. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003 (b) (1) (Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA] does not apply to governmental employee benefit plans).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">At the hearings on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the trial court confirmed that it had intended to award the plaintiff no interest in the pension other than as security for the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation. Despite the plaintiff\u2019s repeated attempts, the trial court refused to state the basis of its property distribution or to articulate the value, if any, that it had ascribed to the defendant\u2019s pension. The trial court acknowledged that the pension was an asset, but indicated that because it did not have a liquidated value, it was not amenable to reliable valuation and, therefore, was not considered alongside other assets in distributing the marital property.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The Appellate Court, in a per curiam opinion, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly failed to treat the pension as an asset, to assign it a value and to apportion it equitably. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The distribution of assets in a dissolution action is governed by \u00a7 46b-81, which provides in pertinent part that a trial court may \u201cassign to either the husband or the wife all or any part of the estate of the other. ... In fixing the nature and value of <em>the property, </em>if any, to be assigned, the court, after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party . . . shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court shall also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This approach to property division is commonly referred to as an \u201call-property\u201d equitable distribution scheme. See 3 Family Law and Practice (A. Rutkin ed., 1995) \u00a7 37.01 [2] [a] [v], p. 37-19. It does not limit, either by timing or method of acquisition or by source of funds, the property subject to a trial court\u2019s broad allocative power. A. Rutkin, E. Effron &amp; K. Hogan, 7 Connecticut Practice Series: Family Law and Practice with Forms (1991) \u00a7 27.1, pp. 398-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">There are three stages of analysis regarding the equitable distribution of each resource: first, whether the resource is property within \u00a7 46b-81 to be equitably distributed (classification); second, what is the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>ate method for determining the value of the property (valuation); and third, what is the most equitable distribution of the property between the parties (distribution). The present case concerns the proper treatment of the defendant\u2019s vested pension under all three stages of our equitable distribution scheme.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We first consider whether pension benefits should be classified as property pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81. We conclude that they should.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our \u201cfundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431-32, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The term \u201cproperty\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 46b-81 or elsewhere in the dissolution chapter. \u201c \u2018Where a statute does not define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southington </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>210 Conn. 549, 561, 556 A.2d 166 (1989); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 341, 636 A.2d 782 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) defines \u201cproperty\u201d as the term \u201ccommonly used to denote everything which is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal, tangible or <em>intangible, </em>visible or invisible, real or personal; everything that has an exchangeable value or which goes to make up wealth or estate. It extends to every species of valuable right and interest, and includes real and personal property, easements, franchises, and incorporeal hereditaments.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">\u201cPension benefits represent a form of deferred compensation for services rendered. <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>[15 Cal. 3d 838, 845, 544 P.2d 561, 126 Cal. Rptr. 633 (1976)].\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>183 Conn. 96, 100, 438 A.2d 839 (1981).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They do not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>mere gratuities; see <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 413, 488 A.2d 803 (1985); as the interest in receiving such benefits is contractual in nature. \u201cWhether the plan is contributory or noncontributory, the employee receives a lesser present compensation plus the contractual right to the future benefits payable under the pension plan. . . . [Vested pension benefits] are contract rights of value . . . .\u201d <em>Majauskas </em>v. <em>Majauskas, </em>61 N.Y.2d 481, 491, 463 N.E.2d 15, 474 N.Y.S.2d 699 (1984). As contractual rights, pension benefits are \u201ca type of <em>intangible </em>property,\u201d and, as such, are encompassed in Black\u2019s definition of \u201cproperty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1990) \u00a7 11.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 46b-81 indicates an intent to narrow the plain meaning of \u201cproperty\u201d from its ordinarily broad and comprehensive scope. Indeed, the term \u201cproperty\u201d has been broadly defined elsewhere in the General Statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-278 (for purposes of attachment, property is defined as \u201cany present or future interest in real or personal property, goods, chattels or <em>choses in action, </em>whether such is vested or contingent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Interpreting the term property broadly is also consistent with the purpose of equitable distribution statutes generally. It is widely recognized that the primary aim of property distribution is to recognize that marriage is, among other things, \u201ca shared enterprise or joint undertaking in the nature of a partnership to which both spouses contribute\u2014directly and indirectly, financially and <em>nonfinancially\u2014the fruits of which </em>are distributable at divorce.\u201d (Emphasis added.) J. Gregory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The Law of Equitable Distribution (1989) \u00a7 1.03, pp. 1-6; see <em>O\u2019Neill v. O\u2019Neill, </em>13 Conn. App. 300, 310-11, 536 A.2d 978, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Pension benefits are widely recognized as among the most valuable assets that parties have when a marriage ends. <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 846 (\u201c[a]s the date of vesting and retirement approaches, the value of the pension right grows until it often represents the most important asset of the marital community\u201d); <em>Deering </em>v. <em>Deering, </em>292 Md. 115, 122-23, 437 A.2d 883 (1981) (\u201c[I]t is significant that over the past several years, pension benefits have become an increasingly important part of an employee\u2019s compensation package which he or she brings to a marriage unit. Moreover, in a situation where economic circumstances prevent a husband and wife from saving or investing a portion of the wage earner\u2019s income, the pension right swells in importance as retirement or vesting approaches, and may well represent the most valuable asset accumulated by either of the marriage partners.\u201d); see also <em>In re Marriage of Grubb, </em>745 P.2d 661, 664 (Colo. 1987); <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>464 A.2d 915, 920 (D.C. 1983). Pension benefits are an \u201ceconomic resource acquired with the fruits of the wage earner spouse\u2019s labors which would otherwise have been utilized by the parties during the marriage to purchase other deferred income assets.\u201d <em>Deering </em>v. <em>Deering, </em>supra, 124. \u201cBoth the nonemployed spouse and his or her wage earning marital partner have the same retirement goals and expectancies regarding the pension benefits as they would if they provided for their later years by using wage income to purchase other investments.\u201d Id., 125. It would be unfair and contrary to the purpose of the statute to \u201cstrip the nonemployee spouse of the value of the retirement asset by precluding [the trial court] from evaluating its worth prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>adjudicating the property rights of the estranged marriage partners.\u201d Id. Thus, it would not make sense, where the legislature has acted to expand the range of resources subject to the trial court\u2019s power of division, to adopt a narrow construction of the operative term \u201cproperty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Classifying vested pension benefits as property does not run afoul of the limitation, recognized in the context of inheritance and trust interests, that \u00a7 46b-81 applies only to presently existing property interests, not \u201cmere expectancies.\u201d <em>See Bartlett </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>220 Conn. 372, 380-81, 599 A.2d 14 (1991); <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>204 Conn. 224, 236-39, 527 A.2d 1184 (1987). An expectancy is only \u201cthe bare hope of succession to the property of another, such as may be entertained by an heir apparent.\u201d <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>174 Conn. 361, 365, 387 A.2d 548 (1978). As we have stated, \u201c \u2018[sjuch a hope is inchoate. <em>It has no attribute of property, </em>and the interest to which it relates is at the time nonexistent and may never exist.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. \u201cThe expectancy may never be realized because of diminution of the donor\u2019s wealth or a change in the planned disposition of his property.\u201d <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>supra, 235. \u201cThe term expectancy describes the interest of a person who merely foresees that he might receive a future beneficence .... [Tjhe defining characteristic of an expectancy is that its holder has no <em>enforceable right </em>to his beneficence.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 844-45. As we have stated, vested pension benefits represent an employee\u2019s <em>right </em>to receive payment in the future, subject ordinarily to his or her living until the age of retirement. \u201cThe fact that a contractual right is contingent upon future events does not degrade that right to an expectancy.\u201d Id., 846 n.8.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Thus, we conclude that \u201cproperty\u201d as used in \u00a7 46b-81,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> includes the right, contractual in nature, to receive vested pension benefits in the future.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We next must determine how vested pension benefits should be valued and distributed. The task of properly valuing pension benefits is complex because such benefits may be defeasible by the death of the employee spouse before retirement and the amount of benefits ultimately received depends upon a number of factors that remain uncertain until actual retirement. Therefore, a trial court, in valuing the parties\u2019 assets upon dissolution, has considerable discretion in selecting and applying an appropriate valuation method. \u201cIn assessing the value of . . . property . . . the trier arrives at his own conclusions by weighing the opinions of the appraisers, the claims of the parties, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value, and then employs the most appropriate method of determining valuation. . . . The trial court has the right to accept so much of the testimony of the experts and the recognized appraisal methods which they employed as he finds applicable; his determination is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>reviewable only if he misapplies, overlooks, or gives a wrong or improper effect to any test or consideration which it was his duty to regard.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Turgeon, </em>190 Conn. 269, 274, 460 A.2d 1260 (1983); see also <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>30 Conn. App. 560, 568-71, 621 A.2d 309 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">There are three widely approved methods of valuing and distributing pension benefits. The first, called the \u201cpresent value\u201d or \u201coffset\u201d method, \u201crequires the court to determine the present value of the pension benefits, decide the portion to which the nonemployee spouse is entitled, and award other property to the nonemployee spouse as an offset to the pension benefits to which he or she is otherwise entitled.\u201d 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 36.13 [3], p. 36-72; see <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 848 (recognizing offset method); <em>In re Marriage of Grubb, </em>supra, 745 P.2d 666 (same); <em>Robert C.S. </em>v. <em>Barbara J.S., </em>434 A.2d 383, 387-88 (Del. 1981) (same); <em>Kikkert </em>v. <em>Kikkert, </em>177 N.J.

For defined benefit pensions, present value represents \u201c \u2018the sum which a spouse will take at the present time in return for giving up the right to receive an unknown number of monthly checks in the future.\u2019 \u201d 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 36.13 [3] [a], p. 36-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Calculating a pension\u2019s present value depends on several factors, including the employee spouse\u2019s life expectancy, the proper interest rate for discount and the date of retirement. See id.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As we observed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number><em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 101, \u201cthese contingencies are susceptible to reasonably accurate quantification . . . by using generally accepted actuarial principles.\u201d (Citation omitted.)

Once the court has determined the present value of the benefits at issue, it may, in light of relevant equitable considerations, award those benefits to the employee spouse and/or may offset the nonemployee\u2019s equitable share in the pension benefits with an award of other assets.

Further, this method is not feasible when there are insufficient other assets by which to offset the value of the pension; see 2 Valuation and Distribution of Marital Property (J. McCahey ed., 1991) \u00a7 23.02 [4], pp. 23-21 through 23-25; 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 36.13 [3] [a], pp. 36-73 through 36-77; or \u201cwhere no present value can be established [by expert testimony] and the parties are unable to reach agreement\u201d as to the value of the pension. <em>Kikkert </em>v. <em>Kikkert, </em>supra, 177 N.J. Super. 478. If there are sufficient other assets, however, several courts have favored this approach. See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>131 Ariz. 38, 42, 638 P.2d 705, modified and affirmed, 131 Ariz. 47, 638 P.2d 714 (1981); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 N.W.2d 795, 798-99 (Minn. 1983); <em>Kuchta </em>v. <em>Kuchta, </em>636 S.W.2d 663, 666 (Mo. 1982); <em>Kikkert </em>v. <em>Kikkert, </em>supra, 477-78; <em>Endy </em>v. <em>Endy, </em>412 Pa.

Under the \u201cpresent division\u201d method, the trial court determines at the time of trial the percentage share of the pension benefits to which the nonemployee spouse is entitled. The court may then, through a QDRO for pensions covered by ERISA or some equivalent if the nonERISA plan permits, presently divide or assign the pension benefits between the spouses. See 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 38.04 [2], p. 38-42. In other words, the court will declare that, upon maturity, a fixed percentage of the pension be distributed to each spouse. <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 838; see <em>Workman v. Workman, </em>106 N.C.

Once matured, the trial court will determine the proper share to which each party is entitled and divide the benefits accordingly. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>supra, 150 Vt. 259-60 (such a method allows a court \u201cto base its distribution upon actual figures [as to what benefits are being paid] rather than assumptions as to retirement age and other variables\u201d); 2 Valuation and Distribution of Marital Property, supra, \u00a7 23.02 [4], pp. 23-21 through 23-25; 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 37.11 [2] [b], pp. 37-163 through 37-164; see also <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Whitfield, </em>222 N.J.

These methods are favored when there are insufficient assets to offset the award of the pension to the employee spouse alone or when the evidence is inadequate to establish present value. <em>Laing </em>v. <em>Laing, </em>741 P.2d 649, 657-58 (Alaska 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">These methods are not exclusive.

In response to the plaintiff\u2019s requests for an express valuation of the pension asset, the trial court repeatedly emphasized that present value was unacceptable in light of the nonliquid nature of the asset.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court offered no substitute valuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>method. Although, as we have stated, the trial court possesses considerable discretion in selecting a method by which to take account of the value of vested pension benefits in making a property distribution pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81, or an award of alimony pursuant to \u00a7 46b-82; see footnote 25; it constitutes an abuse of that discretion to reject present value or any value for vested pension benefits merely because the asset is non-liquid, thereby effectively removing this property interest from the scales in determining an equitable division of all of the property before the court. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>561 A.2d 1018, 1020-21 (Me. 1989). To hold otherwise would defeat the purpose of the equitable distribution statute, by permitting the trial court to treat such benefits as a mere expectancy rather than property. \u201cThe issues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven.

Pension plans, although existing in many forms, are often grouped into two broad categories: defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. What distinguishes them is the source and allocation of funding and the way in which benefits are calculated. 3 A. Rutkin, supra, \u00a7 36.13 [1], pp. 36-69 through 36-71; see also W. Troyan, E. Poll, W. Cantwell &amp; W. Weston, 3 Valuation and Distribution of Marital Property (1991) \u00a7\u00a7 45.08 through 45.10, pp. 45-26 through 45-32. Generally, \u201cdefined contribution plan\u201d refers to a plan under which \u201ccontributions are made at a fixed rate, as defined in the plan, but the ultimate benefits are unknown. The important features of this type of plan are the maintenance of individual accounts and use of a plan formula to calculate allocations to the accounts.\u201d 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 36.13 [1], p. 36-70. In contrast, a \u201cdefined benefit plan\u201d refers to a plan which is \u201cfunded to provide a definitely determinable benefit to the employee upon retirement. Contributions, therefore, are made in an amount that actuaries calculate will be required to yield the promised benefit, that is, a fixed amount per month upon retirement for the remainder of the employee\u2019s life. The plan trustees are not required to keep an individual account for each employee.\u201d Id. Plans may, of course, combine elements of both of these categories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\"> We reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 96, settled either the status of vested pension benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u00a7 46b-81 or the proper valuation of such benefits. In <em>Thompson, </em>we addressed nonvested pension benefits and concluded only that such interests were not too speculative to be taken into account in some fashion by the trial court in crafting its financial orders in a dissolution action. Id., 100-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> Moreover, we are persuaded that pension benefits are sufficiently susceptible to valuation to distinguish them from the type of potential inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>est in money that might be received under a will whose validity is being contested. Cf. <em>Eslami </em>v. <em>Eslami, </em>218 Conn. 801, 591 A.2d 411 (1991). In <em>Eslami, </em>although the trial court had failed to consider the value of the wife\u2019s vested interest in her father\u2019s estate, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court. We noted that, even though the wife\u2019s interest had been \u201cvested\u201d because her father had died, it was impossible to determine whether that interest had any value whatsoever. If the will was declared invalid, the wife would have been entitled only to an intestate share of the estate which might not have exceeded her liability for attorney\u2019s fees expended in the will contest. See id., 806 n.4. We therefore affirmed the judgment of the trial court, noting that \u201c[ajlthough the interest involved here had vested in the wife at the time of trial, the court could reasonably have concluded that uncertainty as to the amount she would eventually receive from her father\u2019s estate militated against consideration of that interest for the purpose of the financial awards.\u201d Id., 807. In this case, the right to receive such benefits is not nearly so uncertain, as some benefits will be paid unless the defendant dies before retirement. Moreover, the problem of estimating the <em>value </em>of such benefits is more properly dealt with not as a problem of classification, but as a problem of valuation and distribution. See part I B of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\"> To the extent that <em>Askinazi </em>v. <em>Askinazi, </em>34 Conn. App. 328, 641 A.2d 413 (1994), may be read to permit various pension related interests to be considered either as property or as a source of alimony, we reject that conclusion. Section 46b-81 requires a trial court to make an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 <em>property; </em>to go about doing so sensibly, a court must determine at the outset which of the parties\u2019 resources are subject to division and assignment under that provision. Although \u00a7 46b-82 authorizes the trial court to award alimony \u201cin addition to or <em>in lieu of [a </em>distribution of property] pursuant to section 46b-81,\u201d (emphasis added), the trial court may decide to exchange alimony for property only <em>after </em>determining the value of the property in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">This classification is significant for two reasons. First, property, even if not so characterized by the trial court, will ultimately be awarded to one of the parties; the statutory duty to distribute property equitably contemplates that the trial court effect such awards consciously rather than by default. Second, although it may be permissible in the distribution phase to exchange some form of alimony for a property award when equitable to do so; see part I B of this opinion; it must be remembered that these awards are of different quality and consequence for the recipient spouse. An award of property is final; the party who receives property pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81 owns it in his or her own right and controls it. Periodic alimony, on the other hand, is conditional, subject to modification or elimination. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\"> Our conclusion that vested pension benefits, as contract rights to payment in the future, constitute property subject to distribution on divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>is in accord with the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions\u2014including common law, equitable and community property\u2014reaching the issue. See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 838; <em>In re Marriage of Grubb, </em>supra, 745 P.2d 665; <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>supra, 464 A.2d 915; <em>Majauskas </em>v. <em>Majauskas, </em>supra, 61 N.Y.2d 481; <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>511 A.2d 961, 965 (R.I. 1986); see also annot., 94 A.L.R.3d 176, 180 (\u201c[wjhether or not they regard pensions or retirement pay as property which is subject to award to or division between spouses in settlement of their property rights, virtually all courts do recognize or assume, as an initial matter, that these benefits do constitute \u2018property\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Although we do not reach non vested pension benefits here, we note that the same reasoning has been applied to find that such benefits also, as an initial matter, constitute property. See <em>Laing </em>v. <em>Laing, </em>741 P.2d 649 (Alaska 1987); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>131 Ariz. 38, 638 P.2d 705, modified and affirmed, 131 Ariz. 47, 638 P.2d 714 (1981); <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 838; <em>Robert C.S. </em>v. <em>Barbara J.S., </em>434 A.2d 383 (Del. 1981); <em>Deering </em>v. <em>Deering, </em>supra, 292 Md. 115 (rejecting as dispositive on issue of status as property the concept of vesting); <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Whitfield, </em>222 N.J.

Thus, where it is equitable to do so, the trial court may offset the allocation to one spouse of the entire value of the pension with alimony instead of or in addition to assets. It must be kept in mind, however, that awards of property and of alimony are different in quality and consequence for the recipient. Periodic alimony, unlike a property award, is subject to modification on a number of grounds. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86. As the amicus points out, to award alimony instead of assets, may leave the recipient spouse, often a woman, dependent on the employee spouse, without sufficient resources, and may not adequately or fairly recognize the nonemployed spouse\u2019s contribution to and expectations of security from the pension benefits. See <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, <em>13 </em>Conn. App. 300; cf. <em>Diffenderfer </em>v. <em>Diffenderfer, </em>491 So. 2d 265, 268 (Fla. 1986); see also 3 Family Law and Practice, supra, \u00a7 37.01 [2] [a], pp. 37-12 through 37-13 (\u201cModem equitable distribution systems also facilitate the goal of affording a means of support for an economically dependent spouse which is not subject to the vagaries of periodic alimony and does not require continued contact between the divorced spouses. . . . [Ejquitable distribution statutes also promote the finality of the parties\u2019 actual separation and parting. The goal of leaving each party in a self-sufficient state so as to preclude the need for future dealings between the parties or return trips to the courthouse, is advanced by use of property distribution instead of support payments.\u201d); H. Foster &amp; D. Freed, \u201cSpousal Rights in Retirement and Pension Benefits,\u201d 16 J. Fam. L. 187,188-91 (1977-78). We need not decide in this case whether, in light of these concerns, alimony properly could be substituted for an award of property to this plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\"> We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that to consider vested benefits for purposes of equitable distribution and also, as allocated, as a source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>of alimony constitutes impermissible \u201cdouble dipping.\u201d Our alimony statute expressly provides that \u201c[i]n determining whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration and amount of the award, the court . . . shall consider . . . the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to section 46b-81.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. Relying on the pension benefits allocated to the employee spouse under \u00a7 46b-81 as a source of alimony would be improper only to the extent that any portion of the pension assigned to the nonemployee spouse was counted in determining the employee spouse\u2019s resources for purposes of alimony.
