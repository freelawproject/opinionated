The plaintiff, John T. Derwin, sought certain additional retirement benefits from the defendant, the state employees retirement commission (commission), under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-173 and 5-192b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission denied the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>tiff\u2019s request and, after granting the plaintiff\u2019s application for reconsideration, affirmed its original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>decision. The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the commission after reconsideration to the Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>which sustained his appeal. The commission appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute. The plaintiff was continuously employed by the state of Connecticut from April, 1970, until his retirement in May, 1990, serving first as a correctional officer and then as a state police officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff had accumulated over twenty years of hazardous duty service, he was entitled to hazardous duty retirement benefits pursuant to \u00a7 5-173.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Prior to his state service, the plaintiff had been employed as a police officer by the town of Windsor Locks from April, 1967, to April, 1970. During the period of his municipal service, the plaintiff had been a member of the municipal employees retirement system and had contributed to the municipal employees\u2019 retirement fund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because his membership in the municipal retirement system terminated upon his resignation from the Windsor Locks police department, the plaintiff petitioned the commission to transfer his municipal retirement funds to the state retirement system. See footnote 2. The commission granted the plaintiff\u2019s request on February 29, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Upon his state retirement, the plaintiff applied for and received hazardous duty retirement benefits under \u00a7 5-173. The commission, however, declined to include the plaintiff\u2019s municipal service in its calculation of the plaintiff\u2019s retirement benefits. On July 5, 1990, the plaintiff filed a claim with the commission under General Statutes \u00a7 5-155a (j)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seeking credit for his municipal service in the determination of his hazardous duty retirement benefits. The commission granted the plaintiff a hearing on his claim pursuant to \u00a7 5-155a (g)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, on August 20, 1992, denied his request for additional hazardous duty retirement credit. The commission also voted to refund to the plaintiff all moneys that he had paid into the municipal retirement fund, with five per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cent annual interest from the date on which those payments were transferred from the municipal retirement fund to the state retirement fund. The plaintiff thereafter sought reconsideration of the commission\u2019s decision under \u00a7 5-155a (k).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commission granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for reconsideration and, after a hearing, affirmed its original decision denying the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the commission to the Superior Court under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> claiming that the commission improperly had failed to include his years of municipal service in its calculation of his hazardous duty retirement benefits. The commission filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over it. The trial court, on March 3,1993, denied the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss. On August 4,1993, the commission sought reconsideration of its motion to dismiss, citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 792, 629 A.2d 367 (1993), which had been released on August 3,1993. After denying the commission\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and remanded the case to the commission for a recalculation of the plaintiff\u2019s retirement benefits to include credit for his prior municipal service. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The commission claims that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s appeal because the commission\u2019s decision upon reconsideration was not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of the UAPA. The plaintiff maintains that the commission\u2019s denial of his claim after reconsideration <em>was </em>an appealable final decision under the UAPA and, further, that the trial court properly-determined that he was entitled to credit for his prior municipal service in the calculation of his hazardous duty retirement benefits. We conclude that the decision of the commission after reconsideration was not a final decision and, accordingly, that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The appealability of an agency decision is governed by \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA, which provides that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a <em>final decision </em>may appeal to the superior court as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we have consistently held that the Superior Court has jurisdiction only over appeals from a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of an administrative agency. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>231 Conn. 391, 400 n.13, 650 A.2d 158 (1994); <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 811-12. Under General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3), \u201c \u2018[fjinal decision\u2019 means (A) the agency determination in a contested case, (B) a declaratory ruling issued by an agency pursuant to section 4-176 or (C) an agency decision made after reconsideration. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the trial court correctly concluded that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs appeal because the commission\u2019s denial of his request constituted \u201can agency decision made after reconsideration\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the plaintiff\u2019s view, the language of \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) is clear on its face and, consequently, we need look no further than the words of the statute to determine its meaning. The commission, on the other hand, contends that \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C), when read in context, cannot be interpreted literally to include all agency decisions made after reconsideration but, rather, must be construed to apply only to those agency decisions that were \u201cfinal decisions\u201d before reconsideration because they were made in contested eases. We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Because our fundamental objective in construing a statute \u201c \u2018is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature\u2019 <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); we will not undertake an examination of \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) \u201cwith blinders on regarding what the legislature intended [it] to mean.\u201d <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). Accordingly, our analysis of \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) is not limited solely to the words of the statute. Instead, we must also \u201clook ... to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 409; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Furthermore, we are guided by the principle that \u201cthe legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019 Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 510, 624 A.2d 876 (1993); see also Simms v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 187-88, 640 A.2d 601 (1994). Indeed, this tenet of statutory construction, which requires us to \u201cread statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter\u201d; <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 188; has special applicability here because the \u201c \u2018main objective [of the UAPA is] uniform procedure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Windsor Hall Rest Home, </em>232 Conn. 181, 189, 653 A.2d 181 (1995), quoting <em>Hirschfeld </em>v. <em>Commission on Claims, </em>172 Conn. 603, 607-608, 376 A.2d 71 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In determining the proper scope of \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C), we look first to General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>governs the reconsideration of agency decisions pursuant to the UAPA. Under \u00a7 4-181a (a) (1), an agency is authorized to reconsider only final decisions in contested cases. Thus, an agency decision is subject to reconsideration under the UAPA only if the decision already is a final decision for purposes of appeal. The plaintiff, however, urges an interpretation of \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) that would convert a nonfinal decision for purposes of appeal into an appealable final decision, a construction that is inconsistent with the dictates of \u00a7 4-181a. Absent a clear legislative mandate to do so, we will not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>strue \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) so as to render it incompatible with another provision of the same statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">No such mandate can be found in the pertinent legislative history. On the contrary, that history squarely supports the conclusion that \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) applies only to those agency determinations that are subject to reconsideration under \u00a7 4-181a, namely, final decisions in contested cases. In 1988, the legislature undertook \u201c \u2018a comprehensive revision of the UAPA, based upon recommendations made after nearly three years of study and review by the Connecticut law [revision] commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 853, 633 A.2d 305 (1993). Among other amendments to the UAPA, the legislature expressly authorized the reconsideration of final agency decisions in contested cases under \u00a7 4-181a and, in addition, defined \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (3) to include in subsection (C), \u201can agency decision made after reconsideration.\u201d Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 107. In its report to the General Assembly regarding the proposed changes to the UAPA, the law revision commission explained that \u201c[\u00a7 4-181a] . . . set[s] detailed standards for <em>reconsideration of final decisions </em>.... A petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite for seeking judicial review [under \u00a7 4-183 (a)] and does not stay the time to appeal. If, however, the reconsideration petition is granted, the agency\u2019s subsequent action affirming, modifying, or reversing the <em>final decision </em>is, under [\u00a7 4-166 (3)], a <em>new final decision </em>to which a new appeal period applies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1987 13th Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly, March, 1988, p. 38. As understood by its drafters, therefore, \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) was not intended to create a new category of appealable decisions for noncontested cases but, rather, to clarify that a party in a contested case may appeal <em>either </em>from a final decision of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>agency under \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A) <em>or </em>from an agency decision rendered after reconsideration pursuant to \u00a7 4-181a.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">These conclusions were echoed during the public hearings on the proposed changes to the UAPA before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary. For example, Stephen F. Frazzini, the executive director of the Hartford County Legal Aid Society and a member of the advisory group that had worked with the law revision commission on the proposed revision to the UAPA, testified as follows: \u201cThe final thing that [the bill] does is, that I\u2019d like to call your attention [to also involves] the appeal process. Let\u2019s say that you are dissatisfied with an agency decision, that you think you can get the agency to change its mind because it\u2019s overlooked a point. You ask for reconsideration. [Case] law allowfs] you to ask for reconsideration, but it doesn\u2019t make clear what the standards are . . . what standards of the agency should apply or many of the procedures related to consideration. We realize[d] that that was true and we tried to set up some standards in the act for <em>how an agency reconsiders its decision once it\u2019s issued a final decision, and how . . </em>. <em>appeals [will then be taken] from that decision </em>if you still don\u2019t like the reconsidered decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., p. 265. Similarly, during the floor debate on No. 88-317 of the 1988 Public Acts in the House of Representatives, Representative Martin M. Looney, a proponent of the legislation, remarked that the act \u201cclarifies when <em>a final decision can be reconsidered </em>or modified [under the UAPA] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 31 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21,1988 Sess., p. 7321. In view of these comments, it is apparent that the proponents of the proposed legislation did not intend for \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) to convert a nonfinal decision for purposes of appeal into an appealable final decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>When read in the proper statutory and historical context, \u00a7 4-166 (3) (C) may fairly be construed only to include decisions after reconsideration in contested cases. Because the commission\u2019s denial of additional retirement benefits was not a final decision in a contested case, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-173 provides in relevant part: \u201cSTATE POLICE; CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION GUARDS AND INSTRUCTORS; EMPLOYEES AT WHIT<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ING FORENSIC INSTITUTE; HAZARDOUS DUTY MEMBERS OF TIER I.

As we have recently stated, however, a \u201ccontested case\u201d is a case in which an \u201cagency is <em>required by statute </em>to provide an opportunity for a hearing to determine a party\u2019s legal rights or privileges.\u201d (Emphasis <em>added) Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 811; see also General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2) (definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d). The plaintiff\u2019s right to a hearing on his request for additional retirement credit was governed by \u00a7 5-155a (g), which provides that \u201c[t]he commission <em>may </em>hold hearings when deemed necessary in the performance of its duty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 7. \u201cTo conclude that [\u00a7 5-155a (g)] mandates that the [commission] make a . . . determination in a hearing or after an opportunity for a hearing would confuse \u2018[may]\u2019 with \u2018must\u2019 and would establish by judicial fiat a statutory requirement that the legislature did not in fact create.\u201d <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 805. Because the hearing was not statutorily mandated, the fact that the commission actually held a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s claim does not convert his case into a \u201ccontested case\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (2). Id., 811. Furthermore, since the commission was not statutorily required to conduct a hearing in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s request for reconsideration under \u00a7 5-155a (k); see footnote <em>8; </em>the commission\u2019s decision after reconsideration likewise was not a \u201cdetermination in a contested case\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-181 a provides: \u201ccontested cases, keconsidekAtion. modification, (a) (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, a party in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>a contested case may, within fifteen days after the personal delivery or mailing of the final decision, file with the agency a petition for reconsideration of the decision on the ground that: (A) An error of fact or law should be corrected; (B) new evidence has been discovered which materially affects the merits of the case and which for good reasons was not presented in the agency proceeding; or (C) other good cause for reconsideration has been shown. Within twenty-five days of the filing of the petition, the agency shall decide whether to reconsider the final decision. The failure of the agency to make that determination within twenty-five days of such filing shall constitute a denial of the petition. (2) Within forty days of the personal delivery or mailing of the final decision, the agency, regardless of whether a petition for reconsideration has been filed, may decide to reconsider the final decision. (3) If the agency decides to reconsider a final decision, pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, the agency shall proceed in a reasonable time to conduct such additional proceedings as may be necessary to render a decision modifying, affirming, or reversing the final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u201c(b) On a showing of changed conditions, the agency may reverse or modify the final decision, at any time, at the request of any person or on the agency\u2019s own motion. The procedure set forth in this chapter for contested cases shall be applicable to any proceeding in which such reversal or modification of any final decision is to be considered. The party or parties who were the subject of the original final decision, or their successors, if known, and intervenors in the original contested case, shall be notified of the proceeding and shall be given the opportunity to participate in the proceeding. Any decision to reverse or modify a final decision shall make provision for the rights or privileges of any person who has been shown to have relied on such final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u201c(c) The agency may, without further proceedings, modify a final decision to correct any clerical error. A person may appeal that modification under the provisions of section 4-183 or, if an appeal is pending when the modification is made, may amend the appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> As we have previously noted in a similar context, the plaintiff\u2019s construction would tend to discourage an agency from granting a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>reconsideration because such review would spawn a final decision under \u00a7 4-166 (3), thereby enabling the aggrieved party to appeal an otherwise nonappealable agency decision.
