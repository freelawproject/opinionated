We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly instructed the jury that the defendant, a convicted felon who had been transferred to a \u201ccommunity residence\u201d to complete his sentence, could be found guilty of escape in the first degree solely for repeatedly failing to report to his supervising parole officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>without also finding that he actually had absconded from his designated residence. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On February 4, 1992, pursuant to his authority under General Statutes \u00a7 18-100 (e), the commissioner of correction transferred the defendant from prison to a \u201ccommunity residence\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to complete a three year term of imprisonment for burglary in the third degree that had begun on December 4, 1991.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the day of his transfer, the defendant met with his supervising parole officer, John Kelly, and reviewed and signed a standard written list of \u201cConditions of Community Residence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those conditions included reporting to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>supervising officer as directed. During their initial meeting on February 4, 1992, Kelly informed the defendant that he was under \u201cintensive supervision\u201d and would be required to report to Kelly\u2019s office at 40 Fairfield Avenue, Bridgeport, every Tuesday and Thursday. A further condition provided that the defendant would be guilty of escape in the first degree \u201cif [he] escape[d] from a community residence to which [he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>been] transferred pursuant to subsection (e) of section 18-100.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The defendant adhered to his reporting schedule for approximately two months. On April 9,1992, however, he failed to report as scheduled. Thereafter he failed to report at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Kelly made several attempts to ascertain the defendant\u2019s whereabouts. He telephoned the defendant\u2019s brother on two occasions. During the second of these calls, Kelly asked the defendant\u2019s brother to tell the defendant to report on April 28. The defendant failed to do so. On May 8, Kelly sent a letter to the defendant at 117 Asylum Street. That letter subsequently was returned undelivered. On May 13, Kelly visited 117 Asylum Street and concluded from a visual inspection of the outside of the premises and a conversation with an unidentified neighbor that the defendant no longer resided there. On May 27, Kelly contacted the defendant\u2019s brother and concluded from his conversation with the brother that the defendant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown to his family at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Kelly then had the defendant\u2019s case reviewed by a parole supervisor, who signed an application for an arrest warrant for the defendant on June 8,1992. The defendant was served with the warrant and arrested on August 29, 1992. The defendant subsequently was convicted by a jury and sentenced by the court to a three year term of incarceration, to be served consecutively to his underlying sentence for burglary in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of escape in the first degree based solely on his repeated failures to report to his supervising officer. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cthere are several elements which you must consider in arriving at a conclusion of whether or not the defendant is guilty of violating section 53a-169, subsection (a) (2). The first element is the escape. The second element is that at the time of the escape the defendant was a sentenced prisoner subject to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction, and third, <em>whether the defendant did escape by failing to report to his parole officer on more than one occasion. </em>The fourth element being whether the defendant elected community residence that had been approved by his parole officer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court repeated this instruction in substantially the same language twice in response to two inquiries from the jury asking for clarification of the definition of the word \u201cescape.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The defendant\u2019s principal disagreement with the court\u2019s instruction centers on what the court termed the third \u201celement\u201d of the crime of escape. In instructing the jury on how to answer the question of \u201cwhether the defendant did escape by failing to report to his parole officer on more than one occasion,\u201d the trial court correctly explained that \u201cmultiple failures to report to one\u2019s supervising parole officer are not, in and of themselves, an escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The court, however, then instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIt is for you, the jury, to decide whether the multiple failures to report to his supervising authority in this supervised home release setting constitute absconding from supervision or escape. ... In considering this, you should consider whether repeated failures to report as scheduled would reasonably support an inference of present or imminent custodial irregularity. The defendant . . . was required to report . . . twice per week on Tuesday and Thursday of each week. . . . <em>Now, both the third\u2014that is the element, the failing\u2014 the repeated failures to report, and the fourth element, which is the unauthorized change of residence, do not have\u2014both do not have to be proven to constitute escape. Either standing alone, if you find either exist in accordance with the instructions I give you\u2014have given you, are sufficient to constitute escape.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> . . . </em>[I]f you find . . . that the defendant did, in fact, fail to report to his parole officer on several occasions, you must then determine whether those failures to report constitute an escape or an absconding from supervision. If you find all those elements, then you should find the defendant guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant thereafter excepted to the jury charge, arguing that failures to report, by themselves, do not constitute an escape and that \u201cabsconding from <em>supervision\u201d </em>is not a proper definition of escape. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u201cTo determine whether an error in the charge to the jury exists, we review the entire charge to determine if, taken as a whole, the charge adequately guided the jury to a correct verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268-69, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 206, 445 A.2d 314 (1982); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 268, 438 A.2d 80 (1980). In appeals not involving a constitutional question the court must determine whether it is reasonably probable that the jury [was] misled; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 305, 551 A.2d 26 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 660, 453 A.2d 427 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra [268]; but in appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra [660]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra [268]; see also <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1967). A failure to provide adequate instructions on the elements of a crime, because of its potential for violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 269; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 268-69; invokes the reasonably possible standard of review. In this case, because the alleged error relates to the elements of the crime charged, reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction and a new trial are mandated if, in the context of the charge as a whole, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 269; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 581, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 204-205, 562 A.2d 481 (1989). Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that a reasonable possibility exists that the jury was misled as to the conduct that constitutes an escape under \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201cInterpretation of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) must begin with the proposition that penal statutes are to be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create liability which no language of the act purports to create. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); <em>Nowak </em>v. <em>Nowak, </em>175 Conn. 112, 125, 394 A.2d 716 (1978); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 579, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>556 A.2d 584 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 430, 538 A.2d 193 (1988). ... The rule that terms in a statute are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>supra, 579; also guides our interpretive inquiry.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>216 Conn. 402, 406-407, 581 A.2d 1045 (1990). Reliance upon the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cescape,\u201d moreover, finds support in the 1969 debates surrounding the enactment of the state penal code, wherein the escape provisions were described as having \u201cthe customary definitions and penalty.\u201d 13 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1969 Sess., p. 5046.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u201cIn this case, neither the defendant nor the state argues that the word \u2018escape\u2019 in \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) is unclear or ambiguous, nor does the fact that opposing counsel contend for different meanings support such a characterization. See <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 194, 198, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981). Furthermore, the text of the statute nowhere indicates that the legislature intended to assign to the word anything other than its ordinary meaning. Accordingly, in the absence of other statutory guidance, we may appropriately look to the meaning of the word as commonly expressed in the law and in dictionaries. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">This court previously has stated that \u201c[t]he unifying overall theme of \u00a7 53a-169 is that an individual will risk punishment for \u2018escape\u2019 for an unauthorized departure from, or failure to return to, whatever may be designated as <em>his place of incarceration or confinement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 409. The nexus between escape and custody recognized in <em>Lubus </em>finds support in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979), which defines \u201cescape\u201d as \u201c[t]he departure or deliverance out of cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tody of a person who was lawfully imprisoned before he is entitled to his liberty by the process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Further support can be found in the New York penal code and the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code, upon which our legislature relied when it revised the state penal code in 1969. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1969 Sess., p. 11. Both contain \u201cescape\u201d provisions that have custodial overtones. The New York Court of Appeals, interpreting the escape provisions of the New York penal code, understood escape to mean \u201c \u2018to get away (as by flight or conscious effort): break away, get free or get clear (the prisoner escaped from prison) . . . .\u2019\u2019\u2019(Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>56 N.Y.2d 868, 870, 438 N.E.2d 1109, 453 N.Y.S.2d 394 (1982). Under the Model Penal Code, a person commits the crime of \u201cescape\u201d if he \u201cunlawfully removes himself from official detention or fails to return to official detention following [a] temporary leave granted for a specific purpose . . . .\u201d II A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1962) \u00a7 242.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 409, after reciting the above definitions of \u201cescape,\u201d we concluded that \u201c[a] single failure to report [by an inmate released to an approved community residence under \u00a7 18-100 (e)] cannot . . . reasonably be construed as an unauthorized <em>departure </em>or failure to return.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We specifically did not decide in <em>Lubus </em>\u201cwhether, at some juncture, repeated failures to report as scheduled <em>would reasonably support an inference </em>of present or imminent custodial irregularity and thus evidence a violation of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. <em>Lubus </em>did not, however, hold that repeated failures to report could alone support an escape conviction without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of actual departure from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>defendant\u2019s designated <em>place </em>of confinement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our task, then, is to determine whether, strictly construed, the ordinary meaning of the criminal prohibition against \u201cescapes from ... [a] community residence\u201d in \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) encompasses the repeated failures to report to a supervisor without a finding that the defendant absconded from his designated place of confinement, in this case, his approved residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The jury was charged that it could find the defendant guilty if it found only that he had repeatedly failed to report. Such an instruction improperly equates failure to report with an escape. While failure to report may be evidence that the defendant has left his designated place of confinement, it is not enough, standing alone, to prove an unauthorized physical departure from the designated place of confinement. Such a departure is necessary for there to be an \u201cescape\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the supervising officer telephoned the defendant, sent letters and visited the designated residence might well support a finding of physical departure. Although we recognize that such evidence existed in this case, the reasonable possibility that the jury was misled to convict the defendant solely because of his failure to report requires a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Viewing the charge as a whole, we are persuaded that it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled to believe that it could find the defendant guilty of escape in the first degree solely on the basis of his failure to report to his supervising officer as scheduled. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s charge to the jury did not fulfill its mandate to \u201cbe accurate in law, adapted to the issues and adequate to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 269; <em>Berniere </em>v. <em>Kripps, </em>157 Conn. 356, 358, 254 A.2d 496 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-169 provides in relevant part: \u201cESCAPE IN THE FIRST DEGREE: CLASS C FELONY, (a) A person is guilty of escape in the first degree . . .

The Appellate Court affirmed the conviction in <em>Jemison </em>on the ground that, under the facts of that case, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s repeated failures to report as scheduled . . . reasonably support an inference of present or imminent custodial irregularity and thus evidence a violation of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We agree with the defendant that to the extent that <em>Jemison </em>permits a conviction for escape to rest solely on a jury\u2019s finding that the defendant repeatedly did not report to his supervising officer as scheduled, it must be overruled. As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 409, Connecticut\u2019s escape statutes encompass \u201cunauthorized departure from, or failure to return to . . . [the inmate\u2019s] <em>place of inear aeration or confinement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\"> For instance, one who is imprisoned who merely stays in his cell and refuses to report for roll call may not be criminally punished for escape because, although he has violated the rules of the department of correction, and may be subject to disciplinary measures in connection therewith, he has not breached the physical confines of his custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
