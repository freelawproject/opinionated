After the DPUC issued its rate-making decision,-Hartford and the other plaintiff, the office of consumer counsel (OCC), appealed from that decision to the Superior Court, claiming that the DPUC lacked authority to grant a multiyear rate increase. CL&amp;P then filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, contending that Hartford and the OCC were not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the final decision and, therefore, that they lacked standing to appeal. The trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>determined that the OCC, but not Hartford, was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the decision of the DPUC. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment granting CL&amp;P\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as to Hartford only. Hartford appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>judgment of the trial court, although for a reason different than that upon which the trial court relied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. By application received by the DPUC on December 11, 1992, CL&amp;P requested, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-19,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> approval to increase its rates and revenues. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>In its application, CL&amp;P made two separate proposals: (1) a three year rate plan designed to increase its revenues by $127 million or 6.2 percent for rates effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>tive March 1, 1993, by $111 million or 5.2 percent for rates effective January 1, 1994, and by $120 million or 5.1 percent for rates effective January 1,1995; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(2) a one year plan designed to increase its revenues by $250 million or 12.5 percent for rates effective May 1, 1993.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The rate application was assigned to a panel of three commissioners of the public utilities control authority (PUCA) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-2 (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of the following- was recognized to be a party to the proceeding:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (1) CL&amp;P; (2) the OCC; (3) the prosecutorial division of the DPUC; (4) the state of Connecticut department of economic development; and (5) the state of Connecticut office of policy and management. Each of the following was granted intervenor status:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Hartford;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) Dan Carlinsky; (3) the Connecticut Business and Industry Association; (4) the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities (CCM); (5) the Connecticut Cogeneration Coalition; (6) the Connecticut Industrial Energy Consumers; (7) the Conservation Law Foundation; (8) the Enfield town council; (9) the Heritage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Village Civic Association; (10) the Heritage Village Master Association; (11) the Housatonic Valley Council of Elected Officials; (12) the state of Connecticut office of the attorney general; (13) the Taylor and Fenn Company; (14) the town of New Milford; (15) the town of Southbury; and (16) the Western Connecticut Industrial Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">After the DPUC and CL&amp;P had discussed preliminary matters, Hartford filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss the Multi-Year Rate Plan\u201d dated February 3, 1993. The DPUC requested and received written comments and heard oral argument on the motion, and thereafter, on February 18,1993, the PUCA denied that motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On February 16,1993, CL&amp;P filed supplemental information with the DPUC proposing a base rate increase of $152 million or 7.3 percent in May, 1993, $141 million or 6.3 percent on May 1, 1994, and $70 million or 3.2 percent on May 1, 1995. Thereafter, on February 19, 1993, Hartford filed motions requesting the PUCA to dismiss CL&amp;P\u2019s amendment of February 16, 1993, and to order CL&amp;P to comply with \u201cStandard Filing Requirements with Regard to CL&amp;P\u2019s Rate Increase Proposals for the Years 1994 and 1995.\u201d After requesting and receiving written comments, the PUCA denied these motions on March 10,1993. On March 12, 1993, CL&amp;P filed revised data indicating a proposed one year increase of $279 million or 13.9 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Between February 11,1993, and April 23,1993, the DPUC held a public hearing on CL&amp;P\u2019s application. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-19. The DPUC conducted the proceedings at its offices, but received comments from members of the public at various locations throughout the state. At the regional locations, a total of 370 customers were in attendance, eighty-five of whom spoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>on the record. These customers generally disagreed with the proposed increases and expressed concern about the impact that such increases would have on the already ailing state economy. Others commented on the overall rate structure (i.e., which rate classes should bear more or less of the proposed burden) and the availability of special programs. For example, Hartford emphasized the economic plight of its citizens, and recommended the use of low income discounts, special conservation projects for depressed cities, and energy efficiency for public and low income housing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">On April 29, 1993, after negotiations among Hartford and others, there was filed with the DPUC a \u201cPartial Settlement Agreement of City of Hartford, Office of Consumer Counsel, Office of Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>eral, Prosecutorial and The Connecticut Light and Power Company\u201d (partial settlement). The partial settlement provided for some low income discounts and increased funding for energy conservation programs, as requested by Hartford, in return for Hartford\u2019s agreement not to challenge the authority of the DPUC to consider multiyear rate increases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The partial settlement stipulated, however, that all of the signatories\u2019 legal claims would be revived if the DPUC rejected any of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The hearing was closed by \u201cNotice of Close of Hearing\u201d on May 3, 1993. On May 4, 1993, the DPUC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>notified all parties and intervenors that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-19 (a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it had extended by thirty days the time by which it would issue a final decision. On June 1,1993, the DPUC issued a draft decision and invited all parties and intervenors to file written exceptions and present oral arguments. The DPUC issued its final decision on June 16, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In its decision, the DPUC approved, with modification, CL&amp;P\u2019s proposal for a three year rate increase. It approved increases of approximately $46 million for 1993, approximately $47 million for 1994, and approximately $48 million for 1995, or approximately 2 percent for each year.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In doing so, it stated, inter alia, that CL&amp;P \u201cproposed the three-year plan to provide customers with a predictable, gradually increasing, rate path over the next three years that would assist both business and residential customers in planning and budgeting for their needs. The Plan shifts rate increases from the near term, when the recession is creating a hardship on customers, to a period when economic recovery can make paying higher rates somewhat easier.\u201d Furthermore, it expressly rejected the partial settlement and, accordingly, recognized Hartford's contractual right to pursue its \u201cjurisdictional challenge to the authority of the [DPUC] to act on CL&amp;P\u2019s multiyear rate plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On July 29, 1993, Hartford and the OCC appealed from the decision of the DPUC to the Superior Court<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-35 and 4-183,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> claiming that the DPUC lacked subject matter jurisdiction to approve a rate-change for more than one year.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thereafter, CL&amp;P moved to dismiss the appeal on the basis that Hartford and the OCC had failed to establish that they were \u201caggrieved\u201d by the final decision of the DPUC as required by \u00a7\u00a7 16-35 and 4-183 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">On May 9, 1994, the trial court granted the motion as to Hartford and denied it as to the OCC. In doing so, the court applied the two-part aggrievement standard set forth in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 168, 173, 592 A.2d 386 (1991), requiring an appellant to show both \u201ca specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cthat the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court determined that the OCC had met the first part of the test on the basis of General Statutes \u00a7 16-2a (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>and concluded that the second part was satisfied due to the $47 million and $48 million increases that the DPUC had approved for 1994 and 1995, respectively. The court granted the motion to dismiss as to Hartford, however, because that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate \u201ca legal interest in the subject matter of the [DPUC\u2019s] decision that is different from that of other members of the public when they purchase electric service.\u201d Hartford appealed from the judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">\u201cPleading and proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter of an administrative appeal. <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). It is [therefore] fundamental that, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved. <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>214 Conn. 726, 729, 573 A.2d 736 (1990) <em>(CBIA I); Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>175 Conn. 415, 419, 399 A.2d 1274 (1978). Standing [however] is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962); <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>165 Conn. 190, 192, 332 A.2d 78(1973). . . <em>. Board of Pardons v. Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 646, 648-49, 556 A.2d 1020 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u201cThe fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision. . . . <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>[supra, 193 Conn. 65]. <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>[203 Conn. 295, 299-300, 524 A.2d 636 (1987)]. . . . Aggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The parties agree that this two-part test controls the issue of aggrievement in this case. They disagree, however, as to whether the trial court correctly determined that Hartford lacks the \u201cspecific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision\u201d necessary to satisfy the first part. Additionally, they disagree about whether any such interest was \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the decision of the DPUC sufficient to satisfy the second part.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Hartford essentially argues that it possesses a specific personal and legal interest in the decision of the DPUC on the basis of the following two factors: (1) the existence of the comprehensive statutory framework for public utility rate-making, under which \u201c[a]ll public service company ratepayers are legally entitled to have their rates adhere to\u201d specific requirements; and (2) its extensive participation in the underlying admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>istrative proceedings. Hartford contends that the presence of these factors distinguishes its case from our decisions in <em>CBIA I, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 726, and <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>218 Conn. 335, 589 A.2d 356 (1991) <em>(CBIA II), </em>in which we determined that the plaintiffs had not been aggrieved by the decision of the commission on hospitals and health care (CHHC) that had permitted increased hospital revenue because the plaintiffs had failed \u201cto demonstrate a legal interest in the subject matter of the decisions [of the agency] that can be distinguished from the interest of the general public in hospital rate increases.\u201d <em>CBIA I, </em>supra, 734. In Hartford\u2019s view, this case is more analogous to <em>Light Rigging Co., </em>in which we concluded that the plaintiffs, holders of certificates of public convenience and necessity, had been aggrieved by a decision of the DPUC granting a similar certificate to one of the plaintiffs\u2019 competitors. <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">CL&amp;P asserts, on the other hand, that the trial court properly concluded that the public utility regulatory scheme affords Hartford no greater interest in this decision of the DPUC than that afforded by the hospital regulatory scheme to the unsuccessful plaintiffs in <em>CBIA I </em>and <em>CBIA II, </em>and that Hartford\u2019s participation, no matter how extensive, cannot compensate for its lack of interest. Further, CL&amp;P contends that, regardless of whether Hartford satisfies the aggrievement requirement, Hartford lacks standing to appeal the decision of the DPUC because it has failed to show that \u201cit was or ought to have been made a party\u201d to the rate-making proceedings as independently required by \u00a7 16-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We agree with CL&amp;P that \u00a7 16-35 requires an appellant to establish in the Superior Court that \u201che or it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>was or ought to have been made a party\u201d to the particular proceeding of the DPUC from which \u201che or it\u201d seeks to appeal, and that Hartford has failed to satisfy this requirement. Consequently, we conclude on this basis that Hartford lacks standing to appeal the rate-making decision of the DPUC.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\u201cAppeals to courts from administrative agencies exist only under statutory authority. <em>Charles Holdings, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 476, 479, 544 A.2d 633 (1988); <em>Tazza </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>164 Conn. 187, 190, 319 A.2d 393 (1972). A statutory right to appeal may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created. <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356, 514 A.2d 749 (1986); <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 6, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975). Such provisions are mandatory, and, if not complied with, the appeal is subject to dismissal. <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 322, 497 A.2d 48 (1985); <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 587, 418 A.2d 939 (1979). <em>Vernon Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>[217 Conn. 130, 142, 585 A.2d 76 (1991)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Raines </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 482, 489-90, 604 A.2d 819 (1992). Dismissal is required in such a situation because, if the appellant lacks standing to appeal the case, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 223, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992). A jurisdictional defect may be brought to the attention of the court at any time, and, if the court lacks jurisdiction, it must dismiss the case either on the motion of a party or on its own motion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>202 Conn. 492, 497-98, 522 A.2d 264 (1987); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>196 Conn. 208, 213, 491 A.2d 1096 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The right to appeal from a rate-making decision of the DPUC is set forth in \u00a7 16-35 of the General Statutes. That section provides: \u201cAny company, town, city, borough, corporation or person aggrieved by any order, authorization or decision of the department of public utility control, except an order, authorization or decision of the department approving the taking of land, in any matter to which he or it was or ought to have been made a party, may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. The party so appealing shall give bond to the state, with sufficient surety, for the benefit of the adverse party, in such sum as the department fixes, to pay all costs in case he or it fails to sustain such appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">While it is well established that an appellant must be \u201caggrieved\u201d to have standing to appeal under this statute; see, e.g., <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 172; this court has not yet specifically construed the meaning of the phrase \u201cin any matter to which he or it was or ought to have been made a party\u201d in \u00a7 16-35. Because it involves statutory interpretation, this issue presents a question of law for this court. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 225; <em>Elections Review </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 692, 595 A.2d 313 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The purpose of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F. D. Rich Construction Co., </em>233 Conn. 14, 20, 658 A.2d 83 (1995); <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 225. If the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words actually used because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F. D. Rich Construction Co., </em>supra, 20; <em>American Universal Ins. Co. v.DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). In such a case, therefore, we need not construe the statute by reference to its history and purpose. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 225; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 538, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990). In every case, however, we interpret a statutory term in light of its context and not in isolation. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 226; <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Reliable Refuse Co., </em>212 Conn. 661, 669, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">CL&amp;P contends that the language of \u00a7 16-35 requires an appellant affirmatively to show either that it was a party to the underlying administrative proceeding, rather than an intervenor or some other form of participant, or that it ought to have been made an actual party. In contrast, Hartford argues that, on the basis of our decision in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 217, the term \u201cparty\u201d does not require actual party status. Instead, in Hartford\u2019s view, the term \u201cparty\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 has the same broader meaning that it had in <em>Rose: </em>\u201c \u2018[a] person concerned or having or taking part in any affair, matter, trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>action, or proceeding, considered individually\u2019 . . . [and] not restricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or defendant in a lawsuit.\u201d Id., 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 217, this court was required to interpret the meaning of the term \u201cparty\u201d within the framework of General Statutes \u00a7 1-21i (d). That provision provides in relevant part: \u201cAny <em>party </em>aggrieved by the decision of [the Freedom of Information Commission] may appeal therefrom, in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In construing the term, we first recognized that the term \u201cparty\u201d ordinarily has a \u201ctechnical legal meaning, referring \u2018to those by or against whom a legal suit is brought . . . the party plaintiff or defendant, whether composed of one or more individuals and whether natural or legal persons.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 226, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). In <em>Rose, </em>we decided not to afford the term that narrow a meaning, however, because it would have led, in the context of \u00a7 1-21i (d), to \u201cunacceptable results.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 226. Instead, we interpreted the term \u201cparty\u201d in its broader sense, namely \u201c \u2018[a] person concerned or having or taking part in any affair, matter, transaction, or proceeding, considered individually\u2019 and . . . \u2018not restricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or defendant in a lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d Id., 227, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We declined to interpret the term \u201cparty\u201d narrowly to mean only those who had been granted actual party status by the agency because doing so would have vested in the presiding officer of the freedom of information commission (FOIC) \u201cthe authority to decide not only who could appear before the agency but also who could challenge an adverse decision of the agency. . . . We [were] doubtful that the legislature\u2019s use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>word \u2018party\u2019 in \u00a7 1-21i (d) was intended to grant unfettered discretion to the FOIC to decide who can appeal the merits of its decisions.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Moreover, our examination in <em>Rose </em>of the legislative history of \u00a7 1-21i (d) confirmed that the legislature had not intended the word \u201cparty\u201d to be defined more narrowly as \u201cactual party.\u201d We noted that prior to a 1977 amendment, \u00a7 1-21i (d) had provided that \u201c \u2018[a]ny <em>person </em>aggrieved by the decision of [the FOIC] may appeal therefrom . . . .\u2019 (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 1-21i (d).\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 227. The legislative history of No. 77-403 of the 1977 Public Acts, which repealed the language using the word \u201cperson\u201d and added language using the word \u201cparty,\u201d revealed that the word \u201cperson\u201d was defined in the Freedom of Information Act to mean \u201cnatural person, partnership, corporation, association or society\u201d; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-18a (c); and that the legislature had made the change to the word \u201cparty\u201d merely to allow \u201c \u2018state agencies who are aggrieved by a decision to appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228, quoting House Bill No. 8080, statement of purpose; see also 20 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1977 Sess., p. 2798, remarks of Senator Salvatore C. DePiano. In view of the provision\u2019s past use of the word \u201cperson,\u201d and in recognition of the general proposition that \u201c[a]n amendatory act is presumed not to change the existing law further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied . . .\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 229; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 63, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); we necessarily concluded that \u201cthe use of \u2018party\u2019 in \u00a7 1-21i (d) does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>not now require party status in an FOIC proceeding as a precondition for standing to appeal the decision.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">As in <em>Rose, </em>we must begin our interpretation in this case by looking to the ordinary legal meaning of the word \u201cparty.\u201d As we stated previously, this word ordinarily refers \u201cto those by or against whom a legal suit is brought . . . the party plaintiff or defendant, whether composed of one or more individuals and whether natural or legal persons.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). Hartford would not qualify under this interpretation because it was an intervenor, rather than a party, to the rate-making proceedings. See footnote 8. Moreover, it neither pleaded nor established at the trial level that it should have been made an actual party to the proceedings. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-35 (\u201cin any matter to which he or it was or <em>ought to have been made </em>a party\u201d [emphasis added]). Thus, of necessity, Hartford contends that <em>\u201cRose </em>sets forth an analysis of the meaning of the word \u2018party\u2019 that is equally applicable to the DPUC as to the FOIC\u201d and that its status as an intqrvenor therefore satisfies the broader meaning of \u201cparty\u201d within \u00a7 16-35. We are unpersuaded that the <em>Rose </em>decision dictates a similar interpretation of \u201cparty\u201d in the context of \u00a7 16-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">First, an examination of the words actually used by the legislature in \u00a7 16-35 reveals language functionally distinct from that used in <em>$ </em>l-21i (d), which was at issue in <em>Rose. </em>Section l-21i (d) refers generally to \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved\u201d by a decision of the FOIC. Section 16-35, on the other hand, specifies certain entities (i.e., cities, corporations or persons) that may appeal a decision of the DPUC \u201cin any matter to which he or it was <em>or ought to have been made a party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, unlike \u00a7 l-21i (d) in which the legislature used the word \u201cparty\u201d only in combination with the word \u201caggrieved,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>thereby suggesting that the legislature had intended \u201cparty\u201d to be interpreted in its broader sense as a synonym of \u201cparticipant,\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 the legislature expressly used the word \u201cmade,\u201d which denotes the act of seeking and attaining actual party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature \u2018did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u2019 <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute. See <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 418, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990) (\u2018[a] statute should be read as a whole and interpreted so as to give effect to all of its provisions\u2019); <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>180 Conn. 474, 476, 429 A.2d 952 (1980) (it is a \u2018well established principle that statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\u2019).\u201d <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 100-101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995). Consequently, if we were to interpret the word \u201cparty\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 based on our interpretation of the language used in \u00a7 1-21i (d), we would be disregarding the distinct language of \u00a7 16-35 and rendering the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cmade\u201d meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Second, unlike our holding in <em>Rose, </em>our construction of the word \u201cparty\u201d in accordance with its ordinary technical meaning will not lead to \u201cunacceptable results.\u201d Indeed, the existence of the language \u201cought to have been made a party\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 eliminates any concern that, as in <em>Rose, </em>a narrow construction of the term \u201cparty\u201d possibly could permit an administrative agency to restrict judicial review. Because a judge of the Superior Court, in deciding whether an appellant in an appeal from a decision of the DPUC has satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 16-35, must determine whether the appellant either was a party <em>or </em>ought to have been made a party, the DPUC cannot unilaterally restrict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>judicial review merely by refusing to grant party status to an applicant who would otherwise be entitled to party status. Instead, just as the trial judge must determine \u201caggrievement\u201d as a threshold question of fact; see, e.g., <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>226 Conn. 105, 120, 122, 627 A.2d 1257 (1993); <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>225 Conn. 1, 7, 621 A.2d 279 (1993); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 65; so too must the trial judge, in a case in which the appellant had not been made a party to the administrative proceedings, review the record to determine whether the DPUC nonetheless should have made the appellant an actual party to the proceedings. General Statutes \u00a7 16-35; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 16-1-16 through 16-1-21 (setting forth standards pursuant to which DPUC grants party and intervenor status). In turn, the protection thus afforded in \u00a7 16-35 distinguishes this statutory scheme from our concern in <em>Rose </em>that \u201cdenial of party status so as to limit appellate review might violate the due process rights of a person aggrieved by an FOIC decision.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Third, unlike in <em>Rose, </em>our inquiry is not illuminated by the legislative history of the provision. The relevant language of \u00a7 16-35 was first enacted in chapter 128 of the 1911 Public Acts, which was based on the Fourth Substitute for Senate Bill No. 7. This language was based on language that had been used previously for other sections relating to judicial review of the decisions of administrative agencies. Our review of the history of the 1911 enactment reveals that no debates, statements or other indicia of legislative intent are available for evaluation. Consequently, we have no reason to believe, as we did in <em>Rose, </em>that the legislature used the language of this provision \u201cto broaden, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>not to limit, access to judicial review.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 229.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In summary, we conclude that \u00a7 16-35 places the burden on the appellant to establish in the Superior Court that it was made an actual party <em>or </em>that it should have been made an actual party to the proceedings of the DPUC from which it seeks to appeal. Like the issue of satisfaction of the aggrievement requirement, compliance with this part of \u00a7 16-35 is first a threshold question of fact for the trial court. In this case, it is undisputed that Hartford was granted intervenor, but not party, status in the rate-making proceedings conducted by the DPUC. Thus, in order to have standing to appeal the decision of the DPUC pursuant to \u00a7 16-35, Hartford was required to have alleged in the Superior Court that it should have been made a party to the proceedings. Such an allegation would have afforded the trial court the opportunity to review the rate-making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>proceedings and to determine whether Hartford should have been made a party to those proceedings. If the trial court had determined that Hartford should have been made a party, Hartford would have satisfied this aspect of \u00a7 16-35.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because Hartford neither alleged nor established that it should have been made a party, it has failed to establish all the elements necessary for strict compliance with \u00a7 16-35.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal as to Hartford for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed and the stay of ancillary proceedings is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., and Callahan and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> On September 14,1994, this court denied CL&amp;P\u2019s motion for supervision to the extent that it sought to vacate the stay of ancillary proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>that had been granted by the Appellate Court, and granted the motion to the extent that it sought to vacate the stay of the rate increase, subject to CL&amp;P\u2019s filing of a corporate assurance, that had been imposed by the Appellate Court. This court granted a modified stay of the rate increase. <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>Supreme Court, Docket No. 15002 (order, September 14, 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\"> Because this appeal involves only the issue of whether the trial court properly concluded that Hartford lacks standing to appeal the rate-making decision of the DPUC, our discussion of the proceedings and analysis of the legal questions are necessarily limited to our determination of that issue. Thus, this decision is not intended to suggest our view of the merits of the underlying administrative appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-19 provides in relevant part: \u201camendment op RATE SCHEDULE; INVESTIGATIONS AND FINDINGS BY DEPARTMENT; HEARINGS; DEFERRAL OF MUNICIPAL RATE INCREASES; REFUNDS; NOTICE OF APPLICATION FOR RATE AMENDMENT, INTERIM RATE AMENDMENT AND reopening OF RATE proceeding, (a) No public service company may charge rates in excess of those previously approved by the authority or the department of public utility control except that any rate approved by the Public Utilities Commission or the authority shall be permitted until amended by the authority or the department, that rates not approved by the authority or the department may be charged pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and that the hearing requirements with respect to adjustment clauses are as set forth in section 16-19b.

Application of Town of Southbury to Intervene as a Party (filed on February 4,1993; denied party status, but granted intervenor status on February 10, 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\"> We distinguish, as did the DPUC in its rate-making decision, between acts of the DPUC and those of the PUCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b653-5\"> The deputy city manager of Hartford, Patricia M. Williams, testified as to Hartford's poor fiscal condition and the effect that CL&amp;P\u2019s proposed rate increase would have on it. She stated that Hartford\u2019s main source of revenue, the property tax, had consistently decreased over the years while the delinquency rate had increased. Thus, the reduction in revenue placed great strain on the city\u2019s ability to provide for its citizens, a disproportionate number of whom were poor and at or below the poverty level. Additionally, she testified that Hartford was the country\u2019s fourth poorest city, had the nation\u2019s second highest rate of poverty among children, and had higher rates of unemployment and those on public assistance. Further, she stated that Hartford was one of only eleven \u201cdistressed municipalities\u201d in Connecticut, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 32-9p (b), due to its \u201chigh unemployment and poverty, aging housing stock and . . . low or declining [rate] of growth in job creation, population and per capita income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Moreover, Williams stated that \u201cHartford\u2019s declining tax base and revenue collections, coupled with the staggering cost of supporting the city\u2019s poverty population, has created a fiscal crisis that will only intensify with CL&amp;P\u2019s proposed rate increases once approved. The deferral of any such increases pursuant to Section 16-19 (e) of the General Statutes will minimally aid the City under the circumstances I have described in my previous testimony. . . . These increases [proposed by CL&amp;P] would seriously reduce the City\u2019s ability to provide the necessary services to its residents.\u201d In light of these factors, Hartford urged the DPUC to consider: (1) the use of a marginal-cost-based rate for low income customers that assures such customers of access to essential energy services; and (2) targeting collaborative conservation and load management budget funds to programs for low income, commercial, industrial and other customers in urban areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b654-5\"> Hartford also agreed, subject to DPUC\u2019s approval of the partial settlement, to waive the claim that it had made on the basis of General Statutes \u00a7 16-19j. That section provides: \u201cportion of department staff to BE MADE PARTY TO CERTAIN RATE proceedings, (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or of any regulation to the contrary, on and after July 1,1984, the Public Utilities Control Authority may require a portion of the staff of the department to be made a party to the proceedings on any proposed rate amendment under section 16-19, provided the authority shall require a portion of the staff to be made a party during the fiscal year beginning July 1,1985, to the proceedings on each rate amendment proposed by an electric company or a telephone company, as defined in section 16-1, having more than five hundred thousand customers and, on and after July 1,1986, to the proceedings on each rate amendment proposed by each public service company, as defined in said section, having more than seventy-five thousand customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\u201c(b) The department staff assigned to participate as a party to any such proceedings shall review the proposed rate amendment filed by the company and shall file with the commissioners of the department proposed modifications of the rate amendment.

Furthermore, although the dissent implies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>that <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 700, 345 A.2d 563 (1974), stands for the proposition that a litigant need only establish aggrievement to appeal a decision of the DPUC, there is nothing to suggest that the issue of the meaning of the term \u201cparty\u201d in the phrase \u201cin any matter to which he or it was or ought to have been made a party\u201d had been raised by the parties or otherwise brought to the attention of the court in that case. Consequently, we do not <em>read Public Utilities Commission </em>as suggesting a different conclusion in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\"> On the contrary, to the extent that the history of this provision\u2019s enactment bears on the issue presented in this case, it indicates that the legislature intended the word \u201cparty\u201d to be interpreted more narrowly. For example, in <em>Bethel &amp; Redding Lime Co. </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co., </em>82 Conn. 135, 141, 72 A. 728 (1909), a case predating the 1911 enactment of the relevant language of \u00a7 16-35, we had construed the language of General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 3747, which gave the right to appeal to \u201cany person aggrieved by any order of the railroad commissioners, upon any proceeding relative to the location, abandonment, or changing of stations to which he was or ought to have been made a party.\u201d Although we did not expressly consider the issue now presented, we did suggest that \u25a0 the appellant, who had been made a party to the administrative proceeding, was entitled to appeal, inter alia, because it \u201cwas a party to [the commission\u2019s] final order\u201d and was \u201cfully a party to the proceedings.\u201d Id., 141. These references, in highlighting the appellant\u2019s status as a party to the administrative proceedings, impliedly indicated our construction of the word \u201cparty\u201d in this context to mean an <em>actual </em>party rather than a mere participant. We may presume that the legislature knew of <em>Bethel &amp; Redding Lime Co. </em>and our references to the word \u201cparty\u201d within the phrase \u201cwas or ought to have been made a party\u201d when it used the same language in \u00a7 16-35. See <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 200 n.14, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b669-4\"> Because the trial court was never afforded the opportunity to make this threshold determination, we need not discuss the standard of review that would have governed an appeal of the trial court\u2019s determination of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b669-5\"> The dissent relies on <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 36, 653 A.2d 168 (1995), for the proposition that we should remand the case to the trial court and afford Hartford the opportunity to show that it \u201cought to have been made a party.\u201d This reliance is misplaced. In <em>Mannweiler, </em>after concluding that we lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action because the plaintiffs had failed to notify all indispensable parties, we afforded the plaintiffs an opportunity on remand to cure that jurisdictional defect only because those circumstances fell within an exception to the general rules concerning subject matter jurisdiction. Indeed, we recognized that <em>\u201c[ujnlike other jurisdictional defects </em>implicating the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction . . . the bringing of a declaratory judgment action is not itself precluded by a failure to comply with the notice requirement.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because this case does not fall within the <em>Mannweiler </em>exception, we do not have subject matter jurisdiction over Hartford\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> We need not elaborate in this case on the scope of judicial review of a decision of the DPUC to grant or not to grant party status to a particular applicant or other entity. Moreover, we have cited the DPUC\u2019s regulations pertaining to the granting of intervenor and party status merely to illustrate the factual nature of the inquiry, and we do not mean to suggest that these regulations would necessarily control the trial judge\u2019s determination of whether a particular entity should have been granted party status. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 16-1-16 through 16-1-21. Indeed, because this case does not require us to decide the scope of judicial review, we neither address nor conclude, contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, that \u201cto be a \u2018party\u2019 for a right to appeal under \u00a7 16-35, the person or entity must comply with the rigorous statutory definition of \u2018party\u2019 set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 4-177a (a) of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d Thus, we certainly do not decide, as does the dissent, that \u201cHart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ford, or for that matter any ratepayer, and even all the ratepayers collectively, are not eligible technically to be admitted as a \u2018party\u2019 to an administrative agency proceeding under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Furthermore, although we thank the dissent for endeavoring to enlighten us as to the proper role of this court, we believe that it would be both improper and imprudent for us to attempt to address these questions. It would be improper because, having decided that Hartford lacked standing to appeal the decision of the DPUC, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the remainder of the issues implicated by its appeal. \u201c \u2018Once it becomes clear that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, any further discussion of the merits is pure dicta. Lacking jurisdiction, neither the trial court nor this court should deliver an advisory opinion on matters entirely beyond our power to adjudicate.\u2019 <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 38, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987) <em>(Peters, C.

Also, it would be imprudent for us to reach these issues in this case because the parties briefed only the question of whether the phrase \u201cwas or ought to have been made a party\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 requires an appellant to show that it was or should have been named a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceedings at the DPUC from which it seeks to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b670-5\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aes\">dissenting. Today, the majority denies the plaintiff, the city of Hartford, standing to appeal a decision of the department of public utility control (DPUC), allowing the defendant, Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P), an increase in its electric rates, solely on the narrow interpretation of the term \u201cparty\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 16-35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>What makes this case particularly troubling is that Hartford sought in its appeal not only relief for itself as a ratepayer from substantial rate increases of $141 million granted to CL&amp;P over a three year period, but also sought to protect the interests of its inhabitants who depend upon electric power. For Hartford, electricity is a major item in the city\u2019s budget, with over $1.5 million spent on street lighting in the 1991-92 fiscal year. Decisions regarding this modern necessity of life, for which the state grants CL&amp;P a monopoly, must be subject to judicial review when challenged, and in that judicial review the voice of Hartford must be heard. Such rate increases, as Hartford alleged in its petition to intervene before the DPUC, will \u201cseriously jeopardize the ability of the city of Hartford as a consumer of electricity, and of its inhabitants as electricity consumers, to continue to meet existing financial burdens and economic necessities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Hartford\u2019s deputy city manager, Patricia M. Williams, testified before the DPUC that Hartford is the fourth poorest city in the United States, is ranked the highest in Connecticut for the number of persons living below the poverty level in the state, and is the second highest nationally for poverty among children. These statistics and dire underlying concerns make it essential that the low income residents of the city have a voice through Hartford in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In response to the city\u2019s severe poverty, one of Hartford\u2019s proposals before the DPUC was the initiation of a \u201clife line\u201d rate which would give low income residents a discount for electricity, but still cover the operating costs of CL&amp;P. Indeed, Hartford, CL&amp;P and others who participated in the hearings before the DPUC agreed to a partial settlement which provided for discounts for low income ratepayers and increased funding for energy conservation programs. For rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>sons that are not disclosed in the record, the DPUC rejected this partial settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In their amici brief, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc., indicate that <em>\u201ca </em>narrow interpretation of standing would limit the ability of all but public service companies and state agencies to appeal from decisions of the DPUC.\u201d The amici brief further highlights that only through active participation by ratepayers in rate setting proceedings can public service monopolies be kept to their statutory mandate of \u201cjust, reasonable and adequate\u201d rates. General Statutes \u00a7 16-19a. Participation, however, will not be active if the ratepayers are prohibited from appealing adverse decisions. Indeed, both the office of consumer counsel of the DPUC and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities argued forcefully that because Hartford has actively participated in the proceedings and was legally aggrieved by the DPUC\u2019s decision, the city is entitled to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In this case, the majority dismisses the broader meaning of \u201cparty\u201d and employs the narrow technical definition of the term, requiring formal party status, when construing \u00a7 16-35. Presumably, the majority implicitly holds that to be a \u201cparty\u201d for a right to appeal under \u00a7 16-35, the person or entity must comply with the rigorous statutory definition of \u201cparty\u201d set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 4-177a (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Uniform Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>istrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189. Consequently, the majority affirms the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Hartford\u2019s appeal because the city, pursuant to \u00a7 4-177a (b), participated in the DPUC\u2019s administrative hearing as an \u201cintervenor.\u201d Hartford, however, argues that it is entitled to appeal under \u00a7 16-35 because \u201cparty\u201d includes intervenors who appear before the DPUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">A review of the legislative history reveals that the relevant language of \u00a7 16-35 first appeared in chapter 128 of the 1911 Public Acts, while \u00a7 4-177a was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>recently enacted in 1988. Thus, the legislators who enacted \u00a7 16-35 could not have intended to define \u201cparty\u201d in terms of the specific and restrictive definition of \u00a7 4-.177a (a). Moreover, the 1911 legislators could not have intended to distinguish between a \u201cparly\u201d and an \u201cintervenor,\u201d which are terms of art in modern administrative law. Consequently, the term \u201cparty\u201d was utilized in \u00a7 16-35 in its general sense, to encompass any individual or entity who participates in an administrative hearing before the DPUC, including those individuals who participated as \u201cintervenors.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The technical definition of \u201cparty,\u201d set forth in \u00a7 4-177a (a), is extremely constrictive. Hartford, or for that matter any ratepayer, and even all the ratepayers collectively, are not eligible technically to be admitted as a \u201cparty\u201d to an administrative agency proceeding under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. This standard is more rigorous than the aggrievement standard which merely requires that a ratepayer have a \u201cspecific personal and legal <em>interest </em>in the subject matter of the decision.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 168, 173, 592 A.2d 386 (1991). Adherence to such a technically rigid standard would be counter to the promotion of full, active participation in the process of rate setting and the protection of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Not only does the majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of the term \u201cparty\u201d stand in direct opposition to our recent interpretation of the term in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992), but it also ignores the legislature\u2019s apparent intent to allow the voices of rate-paying consumers to be effectively heard. Additionally, the majority disregards the harsh public policy implications of its narrow interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Just three years ago, this court interpreted the term \u201cparty\u201d as it is used in General Statutes \u00a7 1-21i (d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 217. In <em>Rose, </em>we held that the use of the term \u201cparty\u201d by the legislature did not require formal party status under \u00a7 4-177a in a freedom of information commission (FOIC) proceeding as a prerequisite for standing to appeal a decision of the commission that aggrieved the appellant. Id., 229. Rather, we construed \u201cparty\u201d broadly to mean \u201c \u2018[a] person concerned or having or taking part in any affair, matter, transaction, or proceeding . . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 227, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. Under this definition of \u201cparty,\u201d Hartford, which participated as an intervenor before the DPUC, would certainly qualify to appeal under \u00a7 16-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Today the majority performs linguistic gymnastics in an effort to distinguish <em>Rose </em>from the facts before us. The language of the statute at issue in <em>Rose, </em>\u00a7 1-21i (d), and the language of statute at issue in this case, \u00a7 16-35, are practically identical. The majority distinguishes the respective language by highlighting the phrase, \u201cmade a party\u201d which is present in \u00a7 16-35.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>They assert that the use of the word \u201cmade\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 \u201cdenotes the act of seeking and attaining actual party status.\u201d If \u201cparty\u201d is given its broad definition under \u00a7 16-35 as we gave it in <em>Rose, </em>then Hartford was \u201cmade a party\u201d before the DPUC when it was allowed to participate as an intervenor. This is the same result we reached in <em>Rose. </em>In <em>Rose, </em>the plaintiffs were intervenors before the FOIC and were deemed \u201cparties\u201d for the purposes of appeal. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn 221. Therefore, any distinction that may exist between deeming someone a party and \u201cmaking\u201d someone a party is insufficient to deny Hartford the more expansive interpretation of \u201cparty\u201d we articulated in <em>Rose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">As we noted in <em>Rose, </em>the technical use of a term is not to be employed when to do so may lead to \u201cunacceptable results.\u201d Id., 226. Unless the language is \u201cabsolutely clear,\u201d a statutory term should be construed in a way that \u201cgive[s] effect to the intended purpose of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 225. In this instance, to construe \u201cparty\u201d in the technical sense leads to the unacceptable result of ignoring the intervening status of Hartford in the DPUC\u2019s proceeding and Hartford\u2019s advocacy for its low income inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Construing \u201cparty\u201d technically in \u00a7 16-35 for a contested case flies in the face of the legislature\u2019s intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to treat ratepayers the same as the publie services company. This legislative intent is demonstrated by General Statutes \u00a7 16-19pp, which provides that the DPUC \u201cshall not hold an uncontested proceeding on any issue affecting ratepayers of the state unless such proceeding provides ratepayers with equal status and the same rights of participation as that of a public service company.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 16-19pp demonstrates a clear legislative intent that the regulator and the monopolistic public service company are not to ignore the consumer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Beyond our holding in <em>Rose, </em>and beyond the legislative intent to allow ratepayers an opportunity to have their voices judicially heard, public policy requires that \u201cparty\u201d in \u00a7 16-35 be defined to include \u201cintervenors.\u201d Despite the foreboding predictions of CL&amp;P, the inclusion of intervenors in the definition of \u201cparty\u201d will not open the floodgates of litigation. \u201cIntervenor\u201d status in a \u201ccontested case\u201d is not granted to just anyone. Rather, to be an intervenor, a person, upon submitting a timely petition, must state \u201cfacts that demonstrate that the petitioner\u2019s participation is in the interests of justice and will not impair the orderly conduct of the proceedings.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-177a (b). This standard adequately separates those ratepayers who have claims meriting the right to participate and appeal individually, from those who have general concerns that can be raised and appealed by the office of consumer counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>As this court has stated, \u201c[sjtanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 172. In this case, Hartford has actively participated in the proceeding and now suffers from an adverse decision of the DPUC. Unquestionably, there is a \u201chot controversy\u201d to be decided on appeal. Therefore, rather than impose a constrictive, technical standard that will preclude virtually all ratepayers from appeal, regardless of their aggrievement, this court should recognize that those individuals or entities that have participated actively in the DPUC\u2019s proceeding as intervenors have standing to appeal an adverse decision as a \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 16-35. Accordingly, this court should go on to address the issue of whether Hartford was aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Finally, even on the basis of the majority\u2019s analysis, at the very least, procedural fairness requires that we not merely affirm the dismissal of Hartford\u2019s appeal. Rather, the matter should be remanded to the trial court to determine whether Hartford \u201cought to have been made a party\u201d as provided in \u00a7 16-35. Cf. <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 36, 653 A.2d 168 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In doing so, despite the majority\u2019s refusal, we should clearly define \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 16-35.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The majority, however, claims that Hartford \u201cneither pleaded nor established at the trial level that it should have been made an actual party to the proceedings.\u201d Nevertheless, Hartford should not be deprived of the opportunity to do so for two compelling reasons. First, CL&amp;P conceded at oral argument that Hartford had requested \u201cparty\u201d status, but was denied such by the DPUC. For some reason, however, the majority ignores this concession. Second, the issue of whether Hartford had a right to appeal under \u00a7 16-35 was raised for the first time by CL&amp;P in its brief and was never raised before the trial court. The sole issue before the trial court, and the issue which dominated oral arguments before this court, was whether Hartford was aggrieved, not whether Hartford is a \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 16-35. The majority, realizing that Hartford was sufficiently aggrieved under <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 168,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> now switches its focus, and bases its decision on a claim that was never made at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-35 provides that \u201c[a]ny company, town, city, borough, corporation or person aggrieved by any order, authorization or decision of the department of public utility control, except an order, authorization or decision of the department approving the taking of land, in any matter to which he or it was or ought to have been made a party, may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. The party so appealing shall give bond to the state, with sufficient surety, for the benefit of the adverse party,, in such sum as the department fixes, to pay all costs in case he or it fails to sustain such appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-177a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The presiding officer shall grant a person status as <em>a party </em>in a contested case if that officer finds that: (1) Such person has submitted a written petition to the agency and mailed copies to all parties, at least five days before the date of hearing; and (2) the petition states facts that demonstrate that the petitioner\u2019s legal rights, duties or privileges shall be specifically affected by the agency\u2019s decision in the contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\u201c(b) The presiding officer may grant any person status as <em>an intervenor </em>in a contested case if that officer finds that: (1) Such person has submitted a written petition to the agency and mailed copies to all parties, at least 5 days before the date of hearing; and (2) the petition states facts that demonstrate that the petitioner\u2019s participation is in the interests of justice and will not impair the orderly conduct of the proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-5\"> The majority asserts, in footnote 23 of its opinion, that it does not define \u201cparty\u201d in terms of \u00a7 4-177a (a), yet the majority does not specifically inform us what does constitute a \u201cparty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-35. Rather, the majority states merely that Hartford was not a party in this instance. If \u201cparty,\u201d as used in \u00a7 16-35, is not given its ordinary meaning as stated in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 227, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992)\u2014\u201c \u2018a person concerned or having or taking part in any affair, matter, transaction, or proceeding . . .\u2019 \u2019\u2019\u2014the definition of \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 4-177a (a) of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act would then logically control. If the majority believes that an ordinary ratepayer would satisfy the requirements of a \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 4-177a (a), or that there may be some third definition of \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 16-35, it seems to me that the majority has an obligation to disclose its reasoning or its understanding of what \u201cparty\u201d might otherwise mean. As an appellate court, we write opinions not only for the benefit of deciding a case and for the parties before us, but also to furnish guidance to the trial court for future cases. Furthermore, in a case such as this, we do so to furnish notice to the legislature of the interpretation that we have placed on a statute that is <em>in issue </em>before us, so that if the legislature disagrees with our interpretation, that branch of government can take corrective action. The issue of how to interpret \u201cparty\u201d under \u00a7 16-35 is clearly before us. The majority does a disservice to the trial court, to future litigants and to the legislature when it refuses to explain what it understands that word to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The majority claims that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction to do this. If the majority has jurisdiction to deeide who is <em>not </em>a party, and the majority has jurisdiction to write a voluminous opinion on the subject, surely it would not offend our subject matter jurisdiction for the majority to define \u201cparty\u201d for the purpose of determining whether we have jurisdiction. A court always \u201chas authority to determine its own authority, or as it is sometimes put, \u2018jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments $ 11, comment (c), p. 110 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\"> In <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 345 A.2d 563 (1974), this court allowed the city of New Haven to take an appeal from an adverse decision of the public utilities commission, the predecessor to the DPUC, although the city was not a formal \u201cparty\u201d in that action. It is true, as the majority points out, that the meaning of \u201cparty\u201d status apparently had not \u2018 \u2018been raised by the parties or otherwise brought to the attention of the court in that case.\u201d Nevertheless, it is ironic that in this case the majority effectively deprives Hartford access to the courts, yet <em>in New Haven </em>this court never questioned the city\u2019s right to appeal. Furthermore, although \u00a7 16-35 was first enacted more than eighty years ago, in 1911, the majority is unable to cite a single case in which an entity that had actively participated in proceedings before the public utilities commission or the DPUC was <em>not </em>considered a \u201cparty\u201d for appeal purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-211 (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the decision of [the freedom of information commission] may appeal therefrom . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> In defense of its constrictive interpretation, the majority also points out that the legislature amended \u00a7 1-21i (d) in 1977 as evidence of legislative intent that \u201cparty\u201d be interpreted broadly only in that context. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>legislative history, however, can equally support employing the broader construction of \u201cparty\u201d in this case. The legislature altered \u00a7 1-21i (d) from \u201c[a]ny <em>person </em>aggrieved\u201d to \u201c[a]ny <em>party </em>aggrieved\u201dso that state agencies would be able to appeal. (Emphasis added.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 227-28. Thus, rather than add \u201cstate agency\u201d to the statutory definition of \u201cperson\u201d (General Statutes \u00a7 1-18 [a]), or change the statute to read, \u201c[a]ny person or state agency aggrieved,\u201d the legislature chose to replace \u201cperson\u201d with \u201cparty.\u201d Therefore, it appears to be the legislature\u2019s understanding that \u201cparty\u201d is a more expansive term than \u201cperson,\u201d thereby evidencing the legislative intent that the term encompass more than just individuals who have obtained formal party status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b677-5\"> This intent is also reflected in the legislative history of \u00a7 16-19pp. Prior to enacting the statute, Senator Gary A. Hale commented that \u201cthe Department of Public Utility Control shall not hold an uncontested proceeding into any issue affecting ratepayers without a notice of intent to the public so that ratepayers themselves will have the ability <em>to be a party </em>in the proceedings.\u2019-\u2019 (Emphasis added.) 35 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1992 Sess., p. 1040. Not only does this statement indicate the legislative intent to empower ratepayers to participate in DPUC proceedings, but this statement also serves to illustrate how the legislature liberally uses the term \u201cparty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\"> Just as the record can be corrected by furnishing proper notice to achieve subject matter jurisdiction in an action for a declaratory judgment; see <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 36; so, too, should Hartford be allowed in this case to establish a record in the trial court on the issue of whether it \u201cought to have been made a party\u201d under \u00a7 16-35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> See footnote 3 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b679-5\"> This court concluded that the city of New Haven was aggrieved and could take an appeal in <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 345 A.2d 563 (1974). That case involved an attempt by the United Illuminating Company to run high voltage power lines through the city of New Haven. Id., 690. The trial court had found \u201cthat the city of New Haven, as a municipal body, has a substantial interest in the matter of construction of facilities by public service companies within its corporate limits.\u201d Id., 699. We refused to overturn the trial court\u2019s conclusion as contrary to law. Id., 704. Under this same rationale, Hartford must be deemed aggrieved in this case. If a municipality has a sufficient interest in its corporate limits to demonstrate aggrievement, certainly a municipality that itself spends more than $1.5 million annually on electricity for street lighting, and the inhabitants of which will bear a substantial share of any increase in electricity rates, similarly is aggrieved for the purpose of taking an appeal from the DPUC.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
