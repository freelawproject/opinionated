Michael Almeida, the plaintiff in the first case and the defendant in the second case (plaintiff), was injured in a motor vehicle accident and subsequently filed a claim for underinsured motorists benefits with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the defendant in the first case and the plaintiff in the second case (defendant). The defendant denied coverage and the parties submitted the claim to compulsory arbitration. The arbitration panel found for the defendant. The plaintiff filed an application to vacate the arbitration award and the defendant filed an application to confirm the award. The trial court vacated the arbitration award and the defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. On September 11,1987, at approximately 12:43 a.m., on Rubber Avenue in Naugatuck, the plaintiff was seriously injured when he was struck by an insured vehicle driven by Arthur D. Vernon. Vernon was intoxicated, speeding and driving without the aid of headlights. The plaintiff collected $20,000, the maximum coverage on Vernon\u2019s liability insurance policy, and then filed a claim with the defendant for underinsured motorist insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">On the evening of the accident, the plaintiff had been driving a 1977 Chevrolet Blazer that was owned by Georgette Almeida, the plaintiff\u2019s stepmother, and insured by the defendant. The plaintiff contended that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>at the time of the accident, he had been \u201coccupying\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the insured vehicle and thus was covered by his stepmother\u2019s policy. The defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle. Pursuant to the terms of the policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff\u2019s claim was submitted to compulsory arbitration before a three member arbitration panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The specific facts of the accident were vigorously contested at the arbitration hearing. The plaintiff testified that the accident had occurred after he had crossed Rubber Avenue from north to south, and had reached the Blazer, which he claimed had been parked on the southern shoulder of the road. He testified that, as he had placed his hand on the door handle with his thumb on the depressor, his wife had called out to him to warn him of Vernon\u2019s vehicle, which was proceeding east on Rubber Avenue. The plaintiff further testified that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>an effort to avoid being struck, he had turned away from the Blazer and had headed north, back across Rubber Avenue. At the time that he was struck by Vernon\u2019s vehicle, the plaintiff claimed to have been three or four feet away from the Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The defendant claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was not credible in that it contradicted the police report,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the testimony of the investigating police officer, Ken Butler, the plaintiff\u2019s prior assertions in his proof of loss statement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to how the accident had occurred and the assertions in his complaint in court that he had filed against Vernon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to these statements, the plaintiff had not reached the Blazer prior to the accident, but had been walking south across Rubber Avenue toward the Blazer when he was struck by Vernon\u2019s vehicle. In addition, Butler testified that, at the time of impact, the plaintiff had been in the middle of the street and that the Blazer had not been parked on the street as the plaintiff had contended, but instead had been parked in a parking lot adjacent to the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>On December 17, 1992, the panel issued its unanimous decision denying the plaintiffs claim. The panel\u2019s decision provided in relevant part: \u201cThe Claimant\u2019s testimony was that he had crossed from north to south to the Blazer parked east on Rubber Avenue and had placed his hand on the door handle with his thumb on the depressor getting ready to open the door when, having heard his wife call out to him, he became aware of the Vernon vehicle driving east on Rubber Avenue. In response, he turned away from the Blazer and to his right in the direction of the oncoming truck and headed back across Rubber Avenue in a northerly direction when struck at a point he testified was three to four feet from the Blazer in the eastbound lane of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\u201cThe Plaintiff\u2019s testimony established he was not, at the time of impact \u2018in\u2019 the vehicle, \u2018getting in\u2019 the vehicle, \u2018getting on\u2019 the vehicle, \u2018getting out\u2019 of the vehicle, or \u2018getting off\u2019 the vehicle since his back was then turned toward the Blazer\u2014which he had not ever entered\u2014and was three to four feet away from it. The Connecticut Supreme Court has concluded the word \u2018upon\u2019 cannot be expanded so as to eliminate the necessity of physical contact with the insured vehicle. <em>Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 126, 133-34, [328 A.2d 686] (1973). Absent physical contact with the vehicle, \u2018it cannot be said that he was \u201cupon\u201d that vehicle.\u2019 Id., 134. Prior intent to enter a vehicle is not \u2018entering\u2019 a vehicle within [the] policy meaning. Id. That conclusion is made more inescapable here where the Claimant is struck <em>(accepting the Claimant\u2019s version of events as true) </em>at a point in time when he no longer intended to enter the vehicle but was in fact moving away from it. <em>Testone </em>makes clear the Claimant\u2019s status as pedestrian or occupant is determined at the time of impact. Id. The policy definition of \u2018occupying\u2019 establishes the Claimant was not an occupant of the Blazer when struck. \u201cThe arbitrators are unanimous in finding there can be no recovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>The plaintiff filed an application in the trial court to vacate the award, claiming that the arbitrators \u201cimperfectly executed their powers,\u201d \u201cmisconstrued and misapplied the law,\u201d and \u201cmade legal rulings predicated on factual findings which are contrary to the evidence submitted.\u201d The defendant, in a separate action, filed a motion to confirm the award stating that \u201cthe [finding of the arbitrators conforms to the submission, is in compliance with the law, and is based on substantial evidence.\u201d The two actions subsequently were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The trial court granted the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In its decision, the trial court stated: \u201cAccepting that version of events put forth by the arbitrators, the plaintiff reached his vehicle and placed his left hand on the door handle with his thumb on the door handle button and was about to open the door to that motor vehicle when his wife alerted him to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>oncoming Vernon vehicle.\u201d On the basis of this factual predicate, the trial court concluded that the panel improperly had required actual physical contact with the vehicle under <em>Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 165 Conn. 126. The trial court determined that under certain emergency circumstances, \u201cphysical contact may not be required to satisfy a policy\u2019s definition of \u2018occupying\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>See Katz v. Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corp. Ltd., </em>202 Misc. 745, 112 N.Y.S.2d 737 (1952). The trial court stated that it would be \u201cbizarre and illogical to deny coverage to this plaintiff who attempted to avoid injury while providing coverage to an individual who makes no such effort to avoid injury.\u201d The trial court concluded that \u201cunder the facts <em>as found by the arbitrators,\u201d </em>the plaintiff was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits and, accordingly, granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Thereafter, the defendant moved to open the trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of mutual mistake. As evidence, the defendant submitted an articulation, rendered after the trial court\u2019s decision, by two of the three members of the arbitration panel. In their articulation, the arbitrators stated that they had not credited the testimony of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to open, stating that \u201cnowhere in the arbitrator\u2019s finding does it indicate that the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>tors discredited the claimant\u2019s version of events.\u201d Further, the trial court stated that the. attempted articulation by the arbitration panel was signed by only two of the arbitrators and therefore violated \u00a7 38a-336 (c), which requires that \u201cthe arbitration proceeding shall be conducted ... by a panel of three arbitrators <em>77</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award on the basis of the trial court\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the award as a finding that the arbitrators had credited the plaintiff\u2019s version of events. The defendant claims that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the arbitrators\u2019 award and, therefore, that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion to confirm the award. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">A party not satisfied with a compulsory arbitration award may move to vacate the award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418. See footnote 7. \u201cIt is the established policy of the courts to regard awards with liberality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Costello Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Teamsters Local </em>559, 167 Conn. 315, 320, 355 A.2d 279 (1974). \u201cEvery reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of an award of arbitrators and of their acts and proceedings.\u201d <em>Ramos Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Construction Co., </em>174 Conn. 583, 590, 392 A.2d 461 (1978); <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987). \u201cHence, the burden rests on the party attacking the award to produce evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it.\u201d <em>Von </em>Langendorff v. <em>Riordan, </em>147 Conn. 524, 527, 163 A.2d 100 (1960). Thus, a reviewing court must uphold an arbitration award unless it determines that the factual findings of the arbitrators are not supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>evidence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the record. <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 8, 21, 615 A.2d 1032 (1992); <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 660-61, 591 A.2d 101 (1991); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Howe, </em>31 Conn. App. 132, 135-36, 623 A.2d 1031 (1993). In cases where the arbitrators do not explicitly state findings, which they are not required to do, a reviewing court must search the record to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the award. See <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In reviewing the arbitrators\u2019 award, the trial court \u201c[accepted] that version of events put forth by the arbitrators.\u201d We conclude, however, that the award made no findings of fact, but merely recited testimony. \u201c[T]he statement of what a witness testified to is not, in that form, even a statement of an evidential fact.\u201d <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>174 Conn. 606, 614, 392 A.2d 476 (1978). The arbitration award simply recounted the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, as evidenced by its use of such phrases as \u201cthe Claimant\u2019s testimony was.\u201d Such recitations of testimony are not findings. <em>C.I.T. Corp. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>117 Conn. 159, 161, 167 A. 102 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The only portion of the arbitration award that even arguably could be considered a finding of fact is the statement in the arbitrators\u2019 decision that the decision \u201cis made more inescapable here where the Claimant is struck <em>(accepting the Claimant\u2019s version of events as true) </em>at a point in time when he no longer intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>enter the vehicle but was in fact moving away from it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The practice of accepting facts as true for the purposes of argument, however, does not transform those facts into findings by the arbitration panel. See, e.g., <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>28 Conn. App. 660, 664, 613 A.2d 838 (1992) (construing similar language in context of motion to strike); <em>Whitely </em>v. <em>Sebas, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Ansonia-Milford, Docket No. CV90031783S (August 20, 1990) (\u201c[t]he practice of accepting well pleaded facts in the complaint as true for purposes of a motion to strike does not transform those facts into admissions\u201d). We determine that, although inartfully stated, the language of the award demonstrates that the arbitrators accepted the plaintiffs version of the facts as true for purposes of argument only. In other words, the arbitrators construed the facts in a manner most favorable to the plaintiff to demonstrate that, <em>even if </em>the plaintiffs version were credible, the plaintiff still could not prevail on his underlying claim. The wording of the arbitrators\u2019 decision does not transform such statements into findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the arbitrators did not make any findings of fact and, therefore, that the trial court lacked the factual basis on which to decide whether the arbitration panel had improperly ignored the existence of an emergency exception to <em>Testone. </em>Normally, in a case such as this, we would remand to the trial court with instructions to conduct a new review of the arbitration award. \u201cNonetheless, because the administrative record before us on appeal is identical to that which was before the trial court, the interests of judicial economy would not be served by a remand in this case.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>216 Conn. 627, 639, 583 A.2d 906 (1990). We therefore review whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>On the basis of the record before them, the arbitrators reasonably could have found that the plaintiff was not in the process of getting into his vehicle before he was struck. The defendant introduced into evidence the plaintiffs proof of loss statement; see footnote 5; the plaintiffs complaint filed against Vernon; see footnote 6; as well as a statement from his stepmother, the owner of the car.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All of these documents support the defendant\u2019s version of events, namely, that prior to the accident, the plaintiff was a pedestrian, walking across Rubber Avenue toward his vehicle. This rendition is also supported by the police report; see footnote 4; and the testimony of Butler, the investigating officer at the scene. In the police report, Butler stated that \u201cMr. Almeida\u2019s wife stated that she and Mr. Almeida were crossing the street from Dean\u2019s Restaurant to the parking lot, in the crosswalk, when Michael was struck by the truck. . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, Butler testified that he was familiar with the Blazer and that it was not parked on the street as the plaintiff had contended, but instead was parked in the parking lot adjacent to the road. Therefore, on the basis of our independent review of the record, we conclude that there is substantial evidence in this record to support the arbitrators\u2019 award. See <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety </em>Co., supra, 218 Conn. 660-61 n.15. Consequently, we need not reach the question of whether physical contact with the insured vehicle at the time of impact is required, as we articulated in <em>Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 165 Conn. 133-34, or whether it may be excused in emergency circumstances for purposes of underinsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment confirming the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\"> The insurance policy issued to the plaintiffs stepmother defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off\u201d of the insured vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\"> The policy provides in relevant part: \u201carbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">\u201cA.
