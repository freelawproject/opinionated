We agree and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The following facts are undisputed. At approximately 1 p.m. on February 25,1991, as the defendant, Quincy Hough and Shannon Lee were walking down Eastern Street in New Haven, they observed an automobile moving slowly toward them. The car, which was operated by Todd Reynolds and contained a lone passenger, Devlin Prescott, continued past the three men and disappeared from their view. Several minutes later, however, the car returned, this time with two additional occupants, Tracey Rumley and Raymond Barrows (victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">As the car approached the three men, the victim, who was seated in the back seat of the vehicle, told Reynolds to pull over because he wanted to speak to the defendant. Reynolds did so, and the victim exited from the rear passenger seat, walked behind the car and proceeded across the street toward the defendant. The vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>tim had both hands in his jacket pockets as he approached the defendant. After a brief verbal confrontation with the victim, the defendant withdrew a handgun from his pocket and fired five shots into the victim, fatally wounding him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The defendant fled on foot, but was soon apprehended and detained by the police in the parking lot of the Ailing municipal golf course, about one mile from the scene of the shooting. Following the defendant\u2019s capture, the police transported Lee, Rumley and Hough to the golf course parking lot, where they identified the defendant as the shooter. The police subsequently arrested the defendant for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The defendant testified at trial and admitted that he had shot and killed the victim. He claimed, however, that he had done so in self-defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>defense, the defendant testified to a series of events that, he claimed, caused him to believe that he was in serious and imminent danger when the victim approached him moments before the shooting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the defendant, he and Rumley, a close friend of the victim\u2019s, had had a fistfight on or about Thanksgiving Day in 1990, over Rumley\u2019s failure to pay the defendant for some marijuana that Rumley had obtained from the defendant. Several days thereafter, the defendant was informed by his sister, Vicki Joyner, that she had been attacked and badly beaten by a group of people, including Rumley, Rumley\u2019s sister, and the victim, in retribution for the defendant\u2019s altercation with Rumley. Joyner also told the defendant that, immediately after the beating, she had been instructed by the victim to tell the defendant \u201cwhen we see him, he\u2019s through.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Joyner testified as a witness for the defendant and corroborated the defendant\u2019s version of the events.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendant further testified that he had attended a birthday party at the home of his girlfriend, Denise Moye, on January 16, 1991. The victim\u2019s brother arrived at the party and instructed Moye to tell the defendant that he wished to speak to him. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ant, fearful of a confrontation with the victim\u2019s brother because of the threat that had been made against him by the victim, ran to an upstairs bedroom. When he heard Moye yelling that the victim\u2019s brother had a gun, the defendant jumped from a second floor window and departed the area. The defendant claimed to have obtained a gun and bullets after this incident for protection against the victim and the victim\u2019s family and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Moye testified concerning her knowledge of what had occurred at the party on January 16, providing detailed corroboration of the defendant\u2019s account. Moye further stated that she had also received a visit from the victim not long after her confrontation with the victim\u2019s brother. According to Moye, the victim, who was brandishing a handgun, told her that he would \u201ckill all of ya\u201d if Moye did not disclose the defendant\u2019s whereabouts. Later that evening, Moye informed the defendant of the victim\u2019s visit and that the victim had been armed and had threatened to kill Moye and her guests. She also told the defendant that the victim \u201cwas after him to kill him.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Raquel Reed, a friend of Moye\u2019s who was also present at the party, testified that she, too, had witnessed the victim point a gun at Moye and her guests, and that he had threatened to kill them. Reed further testified that she had heard Moye report to the defendant that the victim, armed with a handgun, had directed Moye to \u201c[t]ell Cedric when [I] see him, [I\u2019m] going to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The defendant also testified concerning the events immediately preceding the shooting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>when he observed Reynolds\u2019 car return to the area with the victim as a passenger, he thought that Reynolds had sought the victim out to tell him of the defendant\u2019s whereabouts because he knew that the victim had been looking for him. The defendant also indicated that he was extremely frightened when he saw the victim exit Reynolds\u2019 car and walk toward him. According to the defendant, the victim confronted him and demanded to know \u201cwhat\u2019s all this shit I hear you have been talking?\u201d The defendant replied that there was no problem and that he, the defendant, did not want any trouble.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The victim rejected the defendant\u2019s overture to resolve their dispute peaceably, however, and instead raised the subject of the defendant\u2019s fight with Rumley, claiming that the defendant had \u201cjumped my man.\u201d The defendant testified that although he had backed away as the victim moved toward him, the victim continued to close in on him until the two men were less than three feet apart. The defendant claimed that the victim had then appeared to turn and reach for something in his jacket pocket. The defendant stated that he had believed that the victim was reaching for his gun and that he had intended to shoot him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant further testified that he was overcome with fear and, as a result, had lost control of himself and had shot the victim. According to the defendant, he fled immediately after the shooting because he was afraid of retaliation by the victim\u2019s friends.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The defendant also elicited testimony from two eyewitnesses who purported to have seen the victim in possession of a gun when he exited Reynolds\u2019 car and approached the defendant on Eastern Street. Reynolds testified that he had witnessed the victim place a pistol in one of the pockets of his leather jacket prior to exiting the car. Prescott, a passenger in Reynolds\u2019 car, also testified that the victim had a black handgun concealed in his jacket pocket when he encountered the defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Notwithstanding the testimony presented by the defendant, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction on the elements of self-defense, concluding that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to warrant such an instruction. The jury thereafter returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial court sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of sixty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">On appeal, the defendant contends that he had adduced sufficient evidence at trial to raise a plausible claim of self-defense and, consequently, that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on self-defense violated his federal constitutional right to due process of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The legal principles applicable to the defendant\u2019s claim are well established. \u201c[T]he fair opportunity to establish a defense \u2018is a fundamental element of due process of law\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>228 Conn. 412, 427, 636 A.2d 821 (1994), quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). \u201cThis fundamental constitutional right includes properjury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a).\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>232 Conn. 537, 545, 656 A.2d 657 (1995). Thus, \u201c[i]f the defendant asserts [self-defense] and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to [an] . . . instruction [on self-defense].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). \u201cBefore an instruction is warranted, however, [a] defendant bears the initial burden of producing sufficient evidence to inject self-defense into the case. . . . To meet that burden, the evidence adduced at trial, whether by the state or the defense, must be sufficient [if credited by the jury] to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a rational juror as to whether the defendant acted in self-defense.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 545. This burden is slight, however, and may be satisfied if there is \u201cany foundation in the evidence [for the defendant\u2019s claim], no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id., 546; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 278. Furthermore, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s request for a jury charge on self-defense, \u201cwe must adopt the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 619, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Finally, \u201c[i]n order sufficiently to raise self-defense, a defendant must introduce evidence that the defendant reasonably believed his adversary\u2019s unlawful violence to be \u2018imminent\u2019 or \u2018immediate.\u2019 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law (1972) \u00a7 53, p. 394. Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a), a person can, under appropriate circumstances, justifiably exercise repeated deadly force if he reasonably believes both that his attacker is using or about to use deadly force against him and that deadly force is necessary to repel such attack. . . . The Connecticut test for the degree of force in self-defense is a subjective-objective one. The jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. Section 53a-19 (a) requires, however, that the defendant\u2019s belief ultimately must be found to be reasonable.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 545-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Adopting the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant, the jury could have concluded that bad blood existed between the victim and the defendant, and that the victim, a violent person who carried a handgun, had threatened to kill the defendant on at least two occasions. Although the victim did not himself communicate these threats to the defendant, the jury could have credited the defense testimony that Joyner and Moye had, at the victim\u2019s direction, informed the defendant of the victim\u2019s hostile intentions. Given the defendant\u2019s explanation of the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ner in which he was approached by the victim and the victim\u2019s alleged furtive movements as he proceeded to within a few feet of the defendant, we cannot, in the context of the other defense testimony, conclude that the evidence introduced at trial was of \u201csuch a nature that the jury needed to resort to speculation that the defendant reasonably believed that [he] had to act in self-defense.\u201d Id., 549; <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 275, 576 A.2d 139 (1990). Because the evidence, if believed, may have been sufficient to have raised a reasonable doubt in the mind of a rational juror as to whether the defendant had shot and killed the victim in self-defense, the defendant was entitled to a jury determination of his claim. The trial court, therefore, improperly rejected the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201cmurder, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">\u201c(c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the supreme court . . .

The state also produced a tape-recorded statement by Prescott in which he told the police shortly after the shooting that the victim had not possessed a gun on the day he had been killed.
