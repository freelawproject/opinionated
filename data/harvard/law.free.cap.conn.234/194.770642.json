The trial court granted the petitions to terminate his parental rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The respondent mother, who has sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>custody of the children, appealed from that judgment to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that \u00a7 45a-717 (f) required that the trial court consider the financial condition of the parents, including the parent who is seeking to terminate his or her parental rights, as a factor in determining the best interest of the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re Bruce </em>R., 34 Conn. App. 176, 640 A.2d 643 (1994). Thereafter, we granted certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cIn the circumstances of this case, was the financial condition of the natural parents a required consideration in determining whether termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children?\u201d <em>In re Bruce R., </em>230 Conn. 902, 644 A.2d 915 (1994). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The Appellate Court in its opinion narrated the following undisputed facts. \u201cDuring the petitioner\u2019s mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>riage to the respondent, they had two children issue of the marriage, a son born June 18,1980, and a daughter, born December 2,1987. On March 25,1988, their marriage was dissolved by the Superior Court. In the decree of dissolution, the respondent was granted custody of the two minor children and the petitioner was granted liberal rights of visitation. The decree further ordered the petitioner to pay $75 per week for the support of each minor child, [to] maintain medical and life insurance for their benefit, and to pay one-half of all their unreimbursed medical expenses. After the dissolution, problems arose between the petitioner and respondent that affected the petitioner\u2019s rights of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u201cOn May 14, 1991, the petitioner filed petitions in the Court of Probate for the district of Derby seeking to terminate his parental rights with respect to both children. Both petitions alleged the following reasons for seeking such termination of parental rights: \u2018Since the date of dissolution, the children have been used as pawns. I have been denied visitation when requested. Allegations have been raised that I am not a fit father which led the Superior Court to enter supervised visitation. Since that order, additional problems with visitation have arisen which are now affecting the well-being of the children. In mid-winter 1990/1991, Respondent, mother of the minor [children], suggested that in the best interest of the children, that I consent to termination of my parental rights. After careful consideration and thought and after reviewing the inability of Respondent and me to discuss any difficulties that we have, including important matters in the [children\u2019s lives], it is clear that I agree with her contention that my parental rights be terminated. The [children\u2019s] well-being is affected adversely by the difficulties between Respondent and me which I do not believe can be cured through counseling. It is further clear that the ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>best interest of the children will be served by the termination of my parental rights to allow Respondent to live her life without any concern for me or of me and thereby ease the pressure on the [children] emotionally.\u2019 Along with the petitions seeking to terminate parental rights, the petitioner executed and filed the consent form required by General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715 (d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Probate appointed an attorney for the children and ordered the department of children and youth services (DCYS)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>to make an investigation and subsequent written report regarding the proposed termination. [See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (e).] DCYS contracted with a private agency, Community Children and Family Services, to conduct the investigation and that private agency thereafter submitted a written report to the Court of Probate. The report was based on the information gathered from interviews with the petitioner, the respondent, and both children. The report recommended that the petitions for termination of parental rights be denied on the ground that \u2018it does not seem to bear that inability to get along with his ex-wife relieves [the petitioner] from responsibility for providing for his children.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cOn motion of the respondent, the petitions for termination of parental rights were ordered transferred from the Court of Probate to the Superior Court, Juvenile Matters, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715 (g). On July 7,1992, the attorney for the children requested that the court issue an order to obtain updated evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ations of the petitioner, the respondent, and the minor children. By agreement of all counsel, Ralph S. Welsh was appointed to conduct these evaluations. The evaluations were conducted on December 8 and 29, 1992, and written reports were submitted to the trial court. The trial court conducted a hearing regarding the termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights on May 21 and 24, 1993. The petitioner, the respondent, Welsh, and the son\u2019s therapist, Annette Bonomo, testified at the hearing. The trial court granted the petitions to terminate the petitioner\u2019s parental rights on May 24, 1993.\u201d <em>In re Bruce R., </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 178-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The respondent mother, who contested the termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights in the trial court, appealed. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that when the parent whose rights are being terminated consents to the termination, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715 et seq. \u201crequires that the trial court consider, as one of the elements necessary to make the determination of what is in the best interests of the children, the financial condition of the natural parents.\u201d Id., 184-85. The Appellate Court stressed: \u201cWe do not hold, nor do we imply, that the financial conditions of the parents may alone determine the best interests of a child. We do hold that the trial court must be adequately apprised of such financial condition, must give it due consideration, and must accord it as much weight in its decision as the trial court in its discretion deems appropriate in light of all the other facts and circumstances surrounding the proposed termination of parental rights.\u201d Id., 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">On appeal, the petitioner contends that \u00a7 45a-715 et seq. contain no mandate that the trial court consider the financial condition of the parents in determining the best interest of the child in consensual termination proceedings and, therefore, that the Appellate Court improperly construed the statutory scheme to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>such a requirement. In addition, the petitioner claims that such a requirement constitutes a constitutionally impermissible classification based on wealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Before turning to the petitioner\u2019s claims, it is necessary to understand fully the significance of the issue before this court. \u201c[T]he termination of parental rights is a most serious and sensitive judicial action.\u201d <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). A judgment terminating a parent\u2019s rights not only severs the emotional and physical ties between parent and child, but also absolves that parent of all future support obligations. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-707 (g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It would be anathema for our law to allow parents to terminate voluntarily their parental rights \u201csolely for the purpose of evading or relieving [themselves] of responsibility to pay child support.\u201d 3 D. Kramer, Legal Rights of Children (2d Ed. 1994) \u00a7 28.14, p. 45. As one court wrote, \u201c[s]imply put, no parent may blithely walk away from his or her parental responsibilities.\u201d <em>In Interest of A.B., </em>151 Wis. 2d 312, 322, 444 N.W.2d 415 (Wis. App. 1989). Against this backdrop, we turn to the petitioner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The petitioner first claims that the Appellate Court improperly required that the financial condition of the parents be considered by a trial court as one of the criteria for determining the best interest of the child in consensual termination proceedings. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the procedure and criteria for the consensual termination of parental rights are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>clearly set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f), and therefore, the Appellate Court improperly looked to \u00a7 45a-717 (e) (1)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for guidance in interpreting the phrase \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d contained in \u00a7 45a-717 (f). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The termination of parental rights is governed strictly by statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715 et seq.; see also General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (termination of parental rights of children committed to commissioner of children and families). Pursuant to \u00a7 45a-715 (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a petition to terminate parental rights can be initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>by the child\u2019s parent,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> guardian or blood relative, the town selectmen, the commissioner of children and families or a child care agency authorized by the state. The petition must state the facts upon which the termination is sought and the legal grounds for authorizing termination. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715 (b) (6). Within thirty days of filing, a hearing on the petition must be held. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-716 (a). Notice of the hearing must be served on the parents of the minor child and the commissioner of children and families. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-716 (b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>At the hearing, the court may order a physical or psychiatric evaluation of the child and/or one or both parents; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (d); and \u201cmay, and in any contested case shall, request the commissioner of children and families ... to make an investigation and written report ... [as to the] physical, mental and emotional status of the child and shall contain such facts as may be relevant to determine whether the proposed termination of parental rights will be for the welfare of the child, including the physical, mental, social and financial condition of the natural parents . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (e) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In evaluating a petition, the court employs a standard that varies depending upon whether the parent whose rights are being terminated consents to the termination. To grant a consensual petition, the court must find \u201cupon clear and convincing evidence that the termination is in the best interest of the child and that, with respect to any consenting parent, such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of his parental rights with respect to such child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f); see footnote 2. Thus, the consensual termination of parental rights under \u00a7 45a-717 (f) turns on two findings, both of which must be established on the basis of clear and convincing evidence. Initially, the trial court must find that the parent whose rights are being terminated has \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly\u201d consented to the proceedings. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715 (d) (written consent form must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>be signed).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court must determine that termination would be in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Nonconsensual termination proceedings, also governed by \u00a7 45a-717 (f); see footnote 2; involve a different two step process. First, the petitioner must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, one of the specified statutory bases for termination, namely, that: (1) \u201c[t]he child has been abandoned by the parent\u201d; (2) \u201cthe child has been denied ... the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being\u201d; or (3) \u201cthere is no ongoing parent-child relationship.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (1) through (3); footnote 2; see <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 517, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); see also <em>In re Kelly S., </em>29 Conn. App. 600, 617-18, 616 A.2d 1161 (1992). Second, if one of the statutory bases is proven, then the court proceeds to the dispositional phase in which the petitioner must prove, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that the termination would be in the best interest of the child. <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 355-57, 641 A.2d 378 (1994); <em>In re Valerie D., </em>supra, 511. \u201cOur statutes and case law make it crystal clear that the determination of the child\u2019s best interests comes into play only after statutory grounds for [non-consensual] termination of parental rights have been established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., </em>supra, 511. In the dispositional phase of a <em>nonconsensual </em>case, when the focus is on the best interest of the child, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (h)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>requires the trial court to consider and make written findings on certain specified criteria. Among these criteria, the trial court must consider whether \u201cthe economic circumstances of the parent\u201d have \u201cprevented [that parent] from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (h) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Unlike \u00a7 45a-717 (h) which enumerates certain factors that <em>must </em>be considered regarding the affected child\u2019s best interest in granting a nonconsensual petition, no statute describes the factors that must be considered in the case of a consensual petition. <em>In re Bruce R., </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 182-83. Identification of the relevant factors in this context is a question of legislative intent. We approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). \u201c \u2018In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431-32, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">As discussed above, the trial court\u2019s paramount objective, pursuant to \u00a7 45a-717 (f), is to determine what would be in the child\u2019s best interest. This phrase is purposefully broad to enable the trial court to exercise its discretion based upon a host of considerations. What is clear, however, is that in deciding whether to grant a consensual petition to terminate parental rights, focus must be on how the child\u2019s well-being would be affected by the loss of the consenting parent, not on the consenting parent\u2019s desire to rid himself or herself of the unwanted obligation to support that child.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Although the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) are silent on the issue before the court, the legislature clearly expressed the policy that guides our determination in this case. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-706 expressly provides that \u00a7 45a-717 \u201cshall be liberally construed in the best interests of any child for whom a petition has been filed . . . .\u201d See <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>196 Conn. 260, 266, 492 A.2d 175 (1985) (broadly construing statutes regarding parental support of minor children); <em>Faraday </em>v. <em>Dube, </em>175 Conn. 438, 443, 399 A.2d 1262 (1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The petitioner argues that we must strictly construe all statutory provisions regarding the termination of parental rights, including the phrase \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 45a-717 (f). Although it is true that we have insisted upon strict compliance with the statutory criteria in the adjudicatory phase of non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>consensual termination proceedings; <em>In re Jessica M., </em>217 Conn. 459, 466, 586 A.2d 597 (1991); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 672, 420 A.2d 875 (1979); such strict compliance was necessary in that context to guard against improper interference with a parent\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in maintaining a relationship with his or her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The present situation is different in that the petitioner has initiated this action in order to abandon his responsibility to support his children. Hence, the mandate of \u00a7 45a-706 compels the conclusion that the legislature intended that the best interest of the child be construed generously and broadly, rather than strictly and narrowly, in consensual termination proceedings. This construction is in accord with our decisions, albeit in other contexts, in which we have liberally interpreted the phrase \u201cbest interest of the child.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Oller </em>v. <em>Oller-Chiang, </em>230 Conn. 828, 848-49, 646 A.2d 822 (1994) (guardianship); <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 165, 554 A.2d 722 (1989) (custody); <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Wawruck, </em>209 Conn. 407, 414, 551 A.2d 738 (1988) (visitation); <em>In re Kezia M., </em>33 Conn. App. 12, 22, 632 A.2d 1122, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 915, 636 A.2d 847 (1993) (foster care).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u201cStatutes are to be construed consistently with other relevant statutes, because we presume that the legislature intended to create a coherent body of law. <em>Baybank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Thumlert, </em>[222 Conn. 784, 790, 610 A.2d 658 (1992)].\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., </em>supra, 223 Conn. 533. Thus, we must assume that the subsections of \u00a7 45a-717 form a consistent body of law. \u201c \u2018A statute is passed as a whole and not in parts or sections and is animated by one general purpose and intent. Consequently, each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole. Thus, it is not proper to confine interpretation to the one section to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>strued.\u2019 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 46.05, p. 103 . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 91, 662 A.2d 80 (1995); <em>see Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 57, 392 A.2d 491 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Our analysis of what factors must be considered in evaluating the child\u2019s best interest in a consensual termination petition is informed, therefore, by the other subsections of \u00a7 45a-717. Specifically, \u00a7 45a-717 (e) (1) requires that, in any contested case, the mandatory investigative report prepared by the department of children and families, or its designee, contain information relevant to the financial condition of the parents. The statute also provides that in a noncontested case the commissioner may request such information. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that information regarding the financial support of the minor child is considered as a factor, along with the child\u2019s emotional, physical and educational well-being, in assessing the affected child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Because the present case is contested by the respondent mother, \u00a7 45a-717 (e) (1) requires the court to ensure that adequate information regarding the financial condition of the parents is before the court. It would be illogical to require a trial court to receive this material, but then not to require the trial court at least to consider the information therein contained. This requirement is particularly important in cases such as this one, where a father seeks to divest himself of responsibility for his children. Requiring that the parents\u2019 financial condition be a consideration in determining the children\u2019s best interest will deter the filing of a consensual petition that is no more than a ruse or a sham to avoid support obligations. Further, such information will enable the trial court to make a determination that is searching, penetrating and thorough. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Although the financial condition of the parents is not dispositive, the trial court must consider it in reaching a decision as to the best interest of the child. This requirement is in accord with the state and federal policies imposing on parents the responsibility of providing for the support of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Indeed, to interpret the current statutory scheme to permit a trial court to forgo consideration of the financial condition of the parents would ignore the clear federal and state policies that indisputably mandate that, in all but the most extreme cases, children should be maintained and supported by their parents. \u201c[Bjoth state and national policy has been, and continues to be, to ensure that all parents support their children and that children who do not live with their parents benefit from adequate and enforceable orders of child support.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713-20, 595 A.2d 297 (1991); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 et seq.

Indeed, General Statutes \u00a7 53-304 (a), the criminal nonsupport statute, establishes that \u201c[a]ny person who neglects or refuses to furnish reasonably necessary support to his . . . child under the age of eighteen . . . shall be deemed guilty of nonsupport and shall be imprisoned not more than one year, unless he shows to the court before which the trial is had that, owing to physical incapacity or other good cause, he is unable to furnish such support.\u201d These statutory provisions demonstrate, without doubt, our legislature\u2019s position regarding the duty of parents to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In addition, we repeatedly have recognized that children must be supported <em>adequately. </em>See, e.g., <em>Masters </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>201 Conn. 50, 67-68, 513 A.2d 104 (1986) (review of child support awards); <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 266 (parent cannot, without court approval, contract away obligation of support for minor children); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>137 Conn. 74, 79, 75 A.2d 42 (1950) (common law prohibited parents from contractually restricting or defeating their children\u2019s right to support); see also <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 352, 488 A.2d 790 (1985) (recognizing that established public policy of state is to protect children and to make home safe for children); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 Conn. 310, 318-19, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983) (recognizing state\u2019s \u201ccontinuing parens patriae interest .. . in the well being of children\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>179 Conn. 155, 170-71, 425 A.2d 939 (1979) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>(recognizing state\u2019s \u201cexpress public policy... to provide all of its children a safe, stable nurturing environment\u201d). This commitment would be undermined if we permitted a consensual petition, which frees the petitioner from any further obligation to support his or her children, to be granted without considering the financial condition of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Likewise, current federal child support enforcement legislation clearly demonstrates a federal policy of ensuring the financial support of children by their parents. See, e.g., Family Support Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-485, 102 Stat. 2343 (child support can be withheld from paychecks of parents delinquent for one month); Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-378, 98 Stat. 1305 (federal law requires that states provide for imposition of liens against property of defaulting parent-obligor and reporting of delinquencies in excess of $1000 to credit companies); Title IV-D of Social Security Act (unpaid support obligations can be deducted from federal and state income tax refunds); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 653 (deserting parents can be located through Parent Locator Service).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Similarly, the courts of our sister states universally have held that parents may not voluntarily terminate their parental rights simply to avoid their responsibility to support their children. See, e.g., <em>Ex parte Brooks, </em>513 So. 2d 614, 616-17 (Ala. 1987), overruled on other grounds sub nom. <em>Ex parte Beasley, </em>564 So. 2d 950 (Ala. 1990) (termination of parental rights statutes not meant to be \u201cmeans for a parent to avoid his obligation to support his child\u201d); <em>Husband (K) </em>v. <em>Wife (K), </em>343 A.2d 597, 599 (Del.

Surely the legislature did not intend that \u00a7 45a-717 (f) be used as a means for a parent to avoid the obligation to support his or her children. To interpret the statutory scheme as such would alter radically the parental support obligation which our laws consistently have reinforced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Our courts are entrusted with the responsibility of determining the best interest of children who come before them. When a child\u2019s welfare is threatened by the continuation of parental rights, the law provides a means for terminating those rights. The termination of parental rights, however, is a drastic solution; it severs all ties between parent and child, including the parent\u2019s duty to support his or her children. As such, parental rights should not be terminated solely to advance the convenience and interests, either emotional or financial, of the parent. See <em>In Interest of A.B., </em>supra, 151 Wis. 2d 322. Such petitions seek judicial imprimatur on a parent\u2019s own, voluntary abandonment of his or her parental responsibility. This court cannot condone such actions without a careful consideration of the financial condition of the parents as part of judicial review. Therefore, trial courts should grant consensual petitions only in those rare situations where, after considering the totality of the circumstances, including the financial condition of the parents, granting that petition truly would be in the best interest of the child. See <em>In re Welfare of Alle, </em>supra, 304 Minn. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On the basis of the statutory scheme and the overwhelming public policy in support of requiring that par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ents be held financially responsible for their children\u2019s support, we conclude that the trial court must consider the financial condition of the parents as one of the factors in determining the best interest of the child in contested consensual petitions to terminate parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The petitioner\u2019s second claim is that requiring that the financial condition of the parents be considered in a consensual termination of parental rights proceeding would violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Connecticut and United States constitutions by creating an impermissible classification based on wealth.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This claim is not reviewable because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>not adequately briefed. The petitioner has cited no case or authority which recognizes any constitutional right, under either the state or the federal constitution, to abandon his obligation to provide for his children financially. We have declined to review constitutional claims, deeming them to have been abandoned, when the petitioner has not properly briefed and analyzed them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 510 n.17, 594 A.2d 906 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>196 Conn. 395, 397-98 n.2, 493 A.2d 209 (1985); see <em>Latham &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 297, 300, 589 A.2d 337 (1991); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Security Title &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>212 Conn. 436, 437 n.1, 562 A.2d 510 (1989); <em>Isaac v. Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>210 Conn. 721, 732, 557 A.2d 116 (1989). Because the petitioner did not adequately brief the constitutional issue, we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">For the above reasons, we conclude that, in a consensual termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court is required to consider the financial condition of the child\u2019s parents in order to determine whether the termination of a parent\u2019s rights is in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\"> The petitioner filed a petition to terminate his parental rights with respect to each of his minor children, Bruce R. and Jodi R.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f) provides: \u201cAt the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve the petition terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence that the termination is in the best interest of the child and that, with respect to any consenting parent, such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of his parental rights with respect to such child or that, with respect to any nonconsenting parent, over an extended period of time which, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, shall not be less than one year: (1) The child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of the child; or (2) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; or (3) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship which is defined as the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of the parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the child. If the court denies a petition for consent termination of parental rights, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving, and the plan of the parent for the child.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (similar criteria and procedure for terminating parental rights of children committed to commissioner of children and families).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> At oral argument before this court, the petitioner conceded that the trial court made no specific finding that it had considered the financial condition of the parents.

This obligation is deeply rooted in our law. For example, in the 1750s, Blackstone stated: \u201cThe duty of parents to provide for the <em>maintenance </em>of their children is a principle of natural law .... By begetting them therefore they have entered into a voluntary obligation, to endeavor, as far as in them lies, that the life that they have bestowed shall be supported and preserved. And thus the children will have a perfect <em>right </em>of receiving maintenance from their parents. . . . [A]nd the manner in which this obligation shall be performed, is thus pointed out. The father, and mother, grandfather, and grandmother of poor impotent persons shall maintain them at their own charges, if of sufficient ability . . . and if a parent runs away, and leaves his children, the churchwardens and overseers of the parish shall seize his rents, goods, and chattels, and dispose of them towards their relief.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 1 W.

The amicus suggests that the Appellate Court interpreted \u00a7 45a-717 (e) (1) as requiring that the financial condition of the parents be considered in determining the best interest of the child in all contested petitions, whether or not based on consent. As such, the amicus argues that such a requirement in the context of nonconsensual petitions could adversely impact minority groups, the poor and the uneducated and could produce racially disparate results. This concern was recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 762-64, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L.

As discussed above, this appeal concerns our interpretation of the best interest of the child standard as enunciated in \u00a7 45a-717 (f) in consensual petitions. We are persuaded that the combination of \u00a7\u00a7 45a-717 (e) (1) and 45a-706, and the overwhelming public policy of this state and our nation mandate that the financial condition of the parents be considered in determining the best interest of the child when terminating, pursuant to a consensual petition initiated by the parent, parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>rights. As such, we do not reach the question of whether the parents\u2019 financial condition must be considered in nonconsensual termination proceedings. Indeed, \u00a7 45a-717 (h) explicitly lists what factors must be considered in determining the best interest of the child in the nonconsensual context and subdivision (6) states that the economic circumstances of the parent can be considered only to the extent that they have prevented a meaningful relationship with the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
