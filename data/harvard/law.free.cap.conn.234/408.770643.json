We agree and therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In June, 1987, the plaintiff was in her automobile, which was stopped at a traffic light on Route 1, in Bran-ford, when her automobile was struck from behind by the automobile of Benjamin D\u2019Acunto, an uninsured motorist. Two of the arbitrators, citing <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Cordova, </em>171 Conn. 303, 370 A.2d 933 (1976), determined that the plaintiff had not introduced sufficient evidence to remove the issue of D\u2019Acunto\u2019s negligence from the area of surmise and conjecture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In response to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the rear end collision constituted a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-240,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the majority of the arbitrators ruled that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>in accordance with the Superior Court opinion of <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>State, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford, Docket No. CV 8893573S (April 15, 1993), 8 Conn. L. Rptr. 600 (May 10, 1993),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 14-240 did not apply where the plaintiffs car was stopped when the defendant first saw it or should have seen it. Accordingly, by an award dated July 12, 1993, the panel denied the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The plaintiff applied to the trial court to vacate the award. The trial court determined that the arbitrators had manifestly disregarded the applicable law. The court, therefore, rendered judgment granting the application to vacate the arbitration award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u201c[A]n award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the arbitrator has \u2018exceeded [his] powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u2019 We emphasize, however, that the \u2018manifest disregard of the law\u2019 ground for vacating an arbitration award is narrow and should be reserved for circumstances of an arbitrator\u2019s extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 10, 612 A.2d 742 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On the basis of our decision in <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>State, </em>234 Conn. 401, 661 A.2d 1034 (1995), it is clear that, in deciding this voluntary arbitration claim, the arbitrators did not manifest an egregious or patently irrational application of the law to those facts, and they did not exhibit an extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles. Their award, therefore, was not subject to being vacated under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the application to vacate the award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> Because the only issues before the arbitrators involved the negligence of the uninsured motorist and the damages incurred by the plaintiff, and did not involve any issues of coverage, the parties agree that the arbitration proceeding was voluntary, rather than compulsory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> The third arbitrator inferred from D\u2019Acunto\u2019s testimony that he had been negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-240 provides: \u201cvehicles to be driven reasonable distance apart, (a) No driver of a motor vehicle shall follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having regard for the speed of such vehicles, the traffic upon and the condition of the highway and weather conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">\u201c(b) No person shall drive a vehicle in such proximity to another vehicle as to obstruct or impede traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">\u201c(c) Motor vehicles being driven upon any highway in a caravan shall be so operated as to allow sufficient space between such vehicles or combination of vehicles to enable any other vehicle to enter and occupy such space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>without danger.
