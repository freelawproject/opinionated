J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsN\">The Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), General Statutes \u00a7 7-467 et seq., imposes compulsory arbitration on a municipality and the representatives of its employees whenever the parties have reached an impasse in their collective bargaining. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The issue in these cases is whether the procedures statutorily prescribed for such compulsory arbitration govern stipulated arbitral awards arising out of the subsequent agreement of the parties on all disputed issues. We conclude that, when the parties expressly waive their rights under the compulsory arbitration statute, such stipulated awards are properly characterized as collective bargaining agreements, governed by General Statutes \u00a7 7-474,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rather than arbitration decisions governed by General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Each of the plaintiffs, the National Association of Government Employees, Local RI-52, and the Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>national Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 564 (unions), had a collective bargaining agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the defendant, the borough of Jewett City, that expired on July 1,1992. Because the parties were at an impasse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the Connecticut state board of mediation and arbitration, acting pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (b), imposed binding arbitration upon them and appointed an arbitration panel to hear their disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">After several days of hearings before the arbitration panel, the unions and the defendant reached complete agreements on all unresolved issues. As a result, on May 11,1993, the unions and the defendant \u201cagree[d] to waive the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7-473c and stipulate^] to the attached collective bargaining agreement as the award of the panel of arbitrators . . . .\u201d That same day, the arbitration panel issued, as its awards, the unsigned collective bargaining agreements of the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>On March 31,1993, No. 93-4 of the 1993 Special Acts was enacted, authorizing a receivership for the defendant. The receivership was established on June 12,1993, and, on June 23, 1993, the governor appointed C. Francis Driscoll as the receiver to manage the defendant\u2019s fiscal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">On June 22, 1993, the unions filed applications for confirmation of the stipulated awards pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The unions cited the borough as the defendant, but in each case the receiver was subsequently permitted to intervene as a party defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without filing motions to vacate, modify or correct the awards, the receiver sought to have the applications to confirm dismissed or denied for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>M. Hennessey, J., </em>denied the receiver\u2019s motions to dismiss and the trial court, <em>O\u2019Neill, J., </em>granted the unions\u2019 applications to confirm. The receiver appealed from the judgments of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The receiver\u2019s appeals raise three issues. He maintains that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 52-417 authorized judicial confirmation of the stipulated awards because: (1) an award resulting from the stipulation of the parties is a collective bargaining agreement governed by \u00a7 7-474 rather than an arbitral award governed by \u00a7 7-473c and therefore \u00a7 52-417 is inapplicable; (2) the jurisdiction of the trial court to confirm an arbitral award can be challenged either by a motion to dismiss or by an objection to an application to confirm the award; and (3) the procedural requirements of \u00a7 52-417 do not govern compulsory arbitral awards under \u00a7 7-473c. Because we agree with the receiver that, in the circumstances of this case, reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgments is required on the first issue, we need not address the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Analysis of the competing claims of the parties in these appeals requires examination of the statutory background of municipal employee collective bargaining. MERA empowers the state board of mediation and arbitration to impose mandatory binding arbitration whenever collective bargaining negotiations between municipalities and the representatives of their employees have reached an impasse. General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (b). \u201cThe evident purpose of the compulsory arbitration feature of \u00a7 7-473c is to avoid strikes and their attendant disruptions of municipal services by providing a mechanism to resolve by arbitration those issues concerning which the parties to an expiring municipal collective bargaining agreement have been unable to reach agreement by negotiations.\u201d <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 631, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The mandatory binding arbitration that is authorized by MERA does not permit the arbitration panel to exercise the broad discretion normally associated with consensual arbitration. Section 7-473c (d) limits the discretion of the arbitration panel in two significant respects. First, with regard to any issue that the parties have not been able to resolve themselves, the statute confines the discretion of the arbitration panel to a choice between the \u201clast best offer\u201d of one party or another. General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (1). \u201cThis narrowing of the scope of arbitrator discretion to a choice between two proposals as formulated by the parties upon an unresolved issue significantly circumscribes what might otherwise be deemed [an unconstitutionally] broad delegation of legislative power.\u201d <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 635. Second, in the exercise of a choice between one or another \u201clast best offer,\u201d the arbitration panel must \u201cgive priority to the public interest and the financial capability of the municipal employer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (2). This further limitation on arbitral discretion lends additional support to the constitutional validity of MERA. <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">When an arbitration panel exercises the limited discretion conferred upon it by MERA, the \u201cdecision of the panel and the resolved issues\u201d ordinarily are final and binding upon the municipal employer and the union. General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (3). Pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5), however, the legislative body of the municipal employer may reject the award by \u201ca two-thirds majority vote of the members of such legislative body present at a regular or special meeting called and convened for such purpose.\u201d Such a rejection triggers further mandatory arbitral review of each \u201crejected issue\u201d by a new arbitration panel that must take as its point of departure the unresolved issues initially considered by the original arbitration panel. General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>utes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). The award of the new arbitration panel, or of the original panel in the absence of a legislative rejection, may be vacated or modified upon appeal to the Superior Court on one of the limited grounds for judicial review stated in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-419.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (3) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">MERA does not, however, require municipalities and the representatives of their employees to rely completely and exclusively on the arbitration proceedings authorized by \u00a7 7-473c. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-474, the parties continue to have the power to reach an acceptable collective bargaining agreement through negotiation, although they are required, by subsection (b), to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>such an agreement to writing. More significantly, subsection (b) goes on to provide: \u201cExcept where the legislative body is the town meeting, a request for funds necessary to implement such written agreement and for approval of any provisions of the agreement which are in conflict with any charter, special act, ordinance, rule or regulation adopted by the municipal employer or its agents ... or any [otherwise applicable] general statute . . . shall be submitted by the bargaining representative of the municipality within fourteen days of the date on which such agreement is reached to the legislative body which may approve or reject such request as a whole by a majority vote of those present and voting on the matter . . . .\u201d In contradistinction to arbitral awards under \u00a7 7-473c, therefore, collective bargaining agreements are subject to municipal legislative rejection by a simple majority vote rather than by a two-thirds majority vote. Furthermore, \u00a7 7-474 contains no provision for the appointment of an arbitration panel to review legislative rejection of a collective bargaining agreement and does not authorize judicial review in accordance with the procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 or 52-419.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The current appeals require us to determine what procedures the legislature contemplated in circumstances that include, on the one hand, aspects of compulsory arbitration under \u00a7 7-473c and, on the other hand, aspects of collective bargaining under \u00a7 7-474. The significant undisputed facts are that, subsequent to the proper initiation of arbitration hearings, the parties reached an agreement on all unresolved issues and manifested that agreement by waiving the provisions of \u00a7 7-473c and by presenting their negotiated collective bargaining agreements to the arbitration panel for issuance as the panel\u2019s stipulated awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>As a result of the agreements of the parties, the arbitration panel had no occasion to exercise the functions ordinarily contemplated by \u00a7 7-473c (d) (1). The subdivision states that the panel \u201cshall issue . . . its decision on all unresolved issues set forth in the arbitration statement .... The panel shall treat each unresolved issue set forth in the arbitration statement as a separate question to be decided by it. In deciding each such question, the panel agreement shall accept the final provision relating to such unresolved issue as contained in the statement of last best offer of one party or the other. As part of the arbitration decision, each member shall state the specific reasons and standards used in making his choice on each unresolved issue.\u201d In \u00a7 7-473c (d) (1) and (f), the legislature expressly provided authority, however, for the parties to file a joint stipulation \u201cmodifying, deferring or waiving any or all provisions\u201d of the subdivision or of the section as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Considering the import of these various provisions within \u00a7 7-473c, we must determine the extent to which the legislature intended to limit the authority of the parties to modify the arbitration procedures contemplated by the statute. Once an impasse in collective bargaining has led to the imposition of compulsory arbitration, must the arbitration process be completed and an arbitral award be issued, or do the parties retain the power to substitute consensual collective bargaining for the exercise of arbitral judgment? Apart from the waiver provisions and the implications to be drawn therefrom, the parties have pointed to no definitive language to resolve this issue, either in the text of the statute or in the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201cWe approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ture. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 499, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994); <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 507-508, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63-66, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). We are obligated to search for a construction of the statute that makes a harmonious whole of its constituent parts. <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 679, 628 A.2d 957 (1993); <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>215 Conn. 474, 482-83, 576 A.2d 510 (1990); <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 575, 522 A.2d 763 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In light of the legislature\u2019s detailed description of the limited powers of the arbitration panel authorized by \u00a7 7-473c (d), we are persuaded that the legislature intended this statutory procedure to complement rather than to displace the process of collective bargaining. As the unions themselves acknowledge in their briefs, <em>\u201cthe </em>structure of mandatory binding arbitration is designed to encourage the parties to settle their disputes.\u201d In its search for an orderly process that would avoid the disruption of labor stoppages by municipal employees, the legislature focused the authority of the arbitration panel on the parties\u2019 own last best offers in order to facilitate continued collective bargaining even after the parties had found themselves at an impasse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The waiver provisions in \u00a7 7-473c underscore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the importance that the legislature assigned to protection of the parties\u2019 autonomous control over their labor relations. Having reserved for the parties the right to waive \u00a7 7-473c proceedings in their entirety, the legislature is unlikely to have intended that the parties would irretrievably relinquish the right to resolve their differences through collective bargaining once compulsory arbitration has begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The question then becomes how the parties can effectively manifest the fact that they have returned to the bargaining table to resolve the remaining issues on which they had previously been in disagreement. In effect, the unions argue that consent to the issuance of a stipulated award by the arbitration panel reflects the understanding of the parties that, rather than relying on collective bargaining, they are continuing to invoke the authority of the arbitration panel to render an arbitration decision. The receiver argues, to the contrary, that the ministerial recording of collective bargaining agreements as stipulated arbitral awards does not automatically transform the agreements into full-blown arbitration \u201cdecisions\u201d so as to trigger judicial review pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-419. The receiver emphasizes that, in enacting \u00a7 7-473c (d), the legislature directed the arbitration panel to exercise its discretion in choosing among the parties\u2019 last best offers and that a stipulated award derived entirely from the agreement of the parties, because it preserves no opportunity for the exercise of arbitral discretion, is not within the contemplation of the statute. As the receiver observes, if the legislature had wished to provide that arbitral awards derived from settlement of the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>disputes, rather than from a decision of the arbitrators, would have the same status and effect as other arbitral awards, the legislature could have so stated, as it did expressly in enacting General Statutes \u00a7 50a-130.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tianti, </em>223 Conn. 573, 583, 613 A.2d 281 (1992); <em>Buonocore </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>192 Conn. 399, 403, 471 A.2d 961 (1984). We <em>agree </em>with the receiver and conclude, therefore, that stipulated awards are not automatically arbitral awards for the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 7-473c and 52-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We are persuaded that the stipulated awards incorporating in their entirety the collective bargaining agreements of the parties were not, in the context of these cases, arbitral awards that conferred jurisdiction on the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 52-417. That context includes the parties\u2019 concomitant express waivers of further proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c. These waivers cast serious doubt on the continued existence of the statutory underpinning for invocation of judicial review pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-419, because access to such judicial review depends upon the applicability of \u00a7 7-473c (d). In this context, the fact that the arbitration panel attached the label \u201cstipulated award\u201d to each stipulated collective bargaining agreement does not alter the reality that the awards represented nothing other than the parties\u2019 own agreements resolving all remaining issues between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In the absence of actual arbitral awards by the arbitration panel as contemplated by \u00a7 7-473c, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 52-417 to consider the applications for confirmation filed by the unions. There is no common law right to judicial review of a collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is similarly no common law right to judicial review of a compulsory arbitral award that is itself the creature of statute. The absence of compliance with the statutory requirements for such an award deprived the trial court of jurisdiction just as the absence of compliance with statutory requirements for administrative appeals deprives trial courts of jurisdiction. See <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 792, 799, 629 A.2d 367 (1993); <em>Tarnopol </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>212 Conn. 157, 163, 561 A.2d 931 (1989); <em>Park City Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>210 Conn. 697, 702, 556 A.2d 602 (1989). The trial court, therefore, should have granted the receiver\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The judgments are reversed and the cases are remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgments dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-474 provides in relevant part: \u201cNEGOTIATIONS AND AGREEMENTS BETWEEN MUNICIPALITY AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES.
