The plaintiff, Lester Katz, brought an appeal in the trial court, claiming that the defendant, the commissioner of revenue services, had improperly denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for a tax refund because: (1) the defendant had failed to act on his refund request within the required ninety day time period; and (2) the defendant had improperly concluded that the distributions received by the plaintiff were taxable under state law. The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his appeal. Because we conclude that the ninety day time period is directory, not mandatory, and that the distributions are not exempt from state taxation, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. In 1987, the plaintiff invested in the Merrill Lynch CMA Tax-Exempt Fund (fund). The fund invests in obligations of state and municipal governments that are exempt from federal income taxes. In the same year, he received payment from the fund in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the amount of $24,736. The distributions were designated by the fund as tax-exempt interest dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">On the plaintiff\u2019s 1987 federal tax form, he reported this amount as \u201ctax exempt interest income.\u201d The plaintiff did not, however, include the distributions as taxable dividend and interest income on his Connecticut tax return. On March 5, 1991, the defendant sent a tax computation notice to the plaintiff, assessing him $2968.24 in additional tax, plus interest of $1298.61. The plaintiff paid the additional tax and interest under protest, and filed a refund claim, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-515,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was received by the defendant on April 1, 1991. On December 19, 1991, the defendant notified the plaintiff that the distributions received by the plaintiff were subject to state taxation. Accordingly, the defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, claiming that: (1) the defendant\u2019s decision denying the request for a refund was invalid because he had failed to act within the ninety day period required by \u00a7 12-515; and (2) the distributions were exempt from state taxation. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>court concluded that the ninety day period was mandatory, but determined that enforcement of the time provision rested with the plaintiff, by way of a mandamus action. The court then concluded that the distributions received by the plaintiff were subject to state taxation, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed-.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 12-515 contains a mandatory provision requiring the defendant to act on a claim for a refund within ninety days. The plaintiff contends that, because the defendant failed to meet the ninety day requirement, the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s request for a refund was invalid. We disagree. We conclude that the ninety day period in \u00a7 12-515 is directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words. . . . Such a statutory provision is one which prescribes what shall be done but does not invalidate action upon a failure to comply.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mansfield Training School, </em>220 Conn. 721, 727, 601 A.2d 507 (1992). A reliable guide in determining whether a statutory provision is directory or mandatory is whether the provision is accompanied by language that expressly invalidates any action taken after noncompliance with the provision. <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>225 Conn. 432, 440, 623 A.2d 1007 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The purpose of \u00a7 12-515 is to provide a mechanism for taxpayers who have overpaid taxes to obtain a refund. The defendant has ninety days to act on a claim for a refund without having to pay interest on the refund; after ninety days, interest accrues. The ninety day requirement, therefore, is not related to a matter of substance, but serves as an inducement to the defendant to process refund claims in a timely manner, and as a remedy for a taxpayer whose rightful refund is delayed beyond ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Section 12-515 contains no language indicating that the defendant\u2019s decision regarding a refund will be void if more than ninety days elapse between receipt of the claim for a refund and notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision. To the contrary, by providing that \u201cthere shall be added interest . . . between the ninetieth day following receipt of such claim for refund by the commissioner and the date of notice by the commissioner that such refund is due,\u201d the statute expressly contemplates that some decisions will be made by the defendant beyond the ninety day time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 12-515 supports our conclusion that the ninety day period is directory rather than mandatory. Prior to 1985, \u00a7 12-515 lacked the ninety day requirement and did not provide for interest to be paid on tax refunds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Number 85-356 of the 1985 Public Acts added the ninety day requirement, in conjunction with a provision that interest be paid on any refund not paid within the ninety day period. The debate in the House of Representatives strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>suggests that the ninety day requirement was included solely to delineate the point at which interest would begin to accrue and was wholly unrelated to determining whether the defendant\u2019s actions outside the ninety day period were substantively valid. A proponent of the provision stated that \u201c[tjhis particular amendment is going to put two new sections into the bill, and basically the sections end up, requiring the payment of interest on refunds of both the succession tax, the capital gains, dividends and interest tax, when the Commissioner does not make the refund within 90 days of the claim.\u201d 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1985 Sess., pp. 6168-69, remarks of Representative Linda N. Emmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Furthermore, construing the ninety day period as mandatory would mean that some taxpayers who had claimed refunds to which they were not legally entitled would nonetheless receive them solely because of an administrative delay. Absent a clear legislative indication, we are loathe to attribute an intent to the legislature to draw down the public fisc in favor of those with no substantive entitlement thereto. The statute provides that the remedy for undue delay is interest on what is due the taxpayer, not payment of what is not due the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The plaintiff next claims that because the dividends that he received from the fund were not taxable for federal income tax purposes, they were similarly not taxable for Connecticut tax purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The parties stipulated that the distributions received by the plaintiff were designated as \u201ctax-exempt interest dividends\u201d and that the distributions were exempt from federal taxation. General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-506 (a) (l)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> imposes a tax on \u201call dividends and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>interest income earned.\u201d \u201cDividends\u201d is defined in General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-505 as \u201cthose dividends taxable for federal income tax purposes without regard to the dividend exclusion.\u201d The plaintiff argues that because the dividends he received are not taxable for federal income tax purposes, they are not within the definition of dividends in \u00a7 12-505. By falling outside the \u00a7 12-505 definition, the plaintiff insists, the dividends cannot be taxed under \u00a7 12-506. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Although the tax-exempt interest dividends do not qualify as \u201cdividends\u201d under \u00a7 12-505, they do qualify as taxable \u201cinterest income\u201d under that statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 12-518-9a (d) (3) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that interest income means any \u201cexempt-interest dividends,\u201d as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) \u00a7 852 (b) (5). See<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tion 852 (b) (5) (A) defines tax-exempt interest dividends as \u201cany dividend or part thereof (other than a capital gain dividend) paid by a regulated investment company and designated by it as an exempt-interest dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders . . . .\u2019\u2019The tax-exempt interest dividends received by the plaintiff manifestly fall within the ambit of \u00a7 852 (b) (5) (A), and thus within \u00a7 12-518-9a (d) (3). As an item of interest income, therefore, the distributions are subject to state taxation under \u00a7 12-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The plaintiff argues, however, that the defendant, in promulgating \u00a7 12-518-9a (d) (3) of the regulations, exceeded his powers, thus rendering that subdivision invalid. The plaintiff notes that, unlike subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 12-518-9a (d), which mirror the language of \u00a7 12-506, subdivision (3) of the regulation is not directly drawn from the language of the statute. The plaintiff relies on <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 604, 362 A.2d 847 (1975), for the proposition that \u201c[n]o administrative or regulatory body can modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions under which it acquires authority unless the statute specifically grants it that power. ... In the context of the taxing power, this means that an administrative rule or regulation ... is ineffective if, inter alia, it purports to enlarge an exemption or confer an exemption not conferred by the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) According to the plaintiff, <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>not only applies to expanding upon an exemption, but also to expanding the scope of a tax. The plaintiff contends that when the defendant issued \u00a7 12-518-9a (d) (3), he expanded the definition of interest income,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and so in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>effect imposed a tax not contemplated by the General Assembly. Accordingly, the plaintiff asserts, the regulation is invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The defendant has broad power, under General Statutes \u00a7 12-2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to promulgate regulations designed to carry out the purpose of the tax statutes. \u201cThis court pays considerable deference to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of tax statutes . . . [unless] the issue has not previously been the subject of judicial scrutiny, has not been the subject of a legislatively approved regulation and is not a time-tested interpretation of the statute . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ruskewich v. Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 19, 24, 566 A.2d 658 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Although our case law has not specifically addressed \u00a7 12-518-9a, the state dividends, interest income and capital gains tax has received judicial scrutiny on a number of occasions. See, e.g., id., 19; <em>Yaeger </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>188 Conn. 206, 449 A.2d 144 (1982); <em>Woodruff v. Tax Commissioner, </em>185 Conn. 186, 440 A.2d 854 (1981). In those cases we held that, because our statutory scheme is based on the federal statutory scheme, the federal treatment of dividends and capital gains applies to the dividends and capital gains income that is subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-506.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The regulation at issue here appropriately follows federal rules, because it, like I.R.C. \u00a7 852 (b) (5) (B), prescribes how tax-exempt inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>est dividends, such as those received by the plaintiff, should be treated: \u201cAn exempt-interest dividend shall be treated by the shareholders for all purposes of this subtitle as an item of <em>interest . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The regulation, then, by following the federal characterization of the distributions as interest income, is consistent with our prior cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In addition, the regulation was approved by the legislative regulation review committee, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-170.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Legislative ratification of a proposed regulation by the review committee is an important consideration in determining whether a regulation is consistent with a statutory scheme. <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 129-30, 527 A. 2d 672 (1987). Moreover, the regulation was enacted in 1985 and remains in effect today. A regulation\u2019s existence \u201cfor a substantial period of time, although not itself determinative, is persuasive as to its validity.\u201d Id., 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Because \u00a7 12-518-9a (d) (3) is consistent with our prior cases interpreting \u00a7\u00a7 12-505 and 12-506, and because the regulation received legislative approval and has been in effect for ten years, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u201cinterest income,\u201d as set forth in the regulation, is entitled to great deference and was a valid exercise of his authority. Because the distributions received by the plaintiff fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>scope of the regulation, they are an item of interest income subject to state taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-515 provides: \u201crefund claims.
