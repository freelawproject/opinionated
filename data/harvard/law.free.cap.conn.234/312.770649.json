Hearings were held before a department hearing officer, who recommended in a proposed decision that the defendant, Timothy R. E. Keeney, the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), issue the permit. The commissioner rejected the proposed decision and denied the permit on the grounds that the town had neither conducted a hydrogeological study as required by \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) (2) (A) (v) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor demonstrated a need for the expansion as required by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208d (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The town appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the trial court, which sustained the appeal and remanded the case to the commissioner with direction. The commissioner appealed from this judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case with direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The following facts are undisputed. On September 14,1989, the town applied to the department, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a and \u00a7 22a-209-4 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, for a permit to expand vertically its municipal solid waste disposal area (landfill) located on Ethan Allen Road in Newtown. The expansion would allow the town to deposit an additional 409,000 cubic yards of solid waste, extending the landfill\u2019s useful life by about ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A public hearing was held by the department on February 14, 1990, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-208a (e). Upon application, the estate of F. Francis D\u2019Addario (D\u2019Addario estate), an adjacent landowner, was granted permission to participate as an intervenor. No opposition to the application was presented. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer found that, with the exception of a preliminary determination of need, the town\u2019s application was complete and recommended the granting of the permit subject to several conditions. One of the conditions was that the town conduct a full hydrogeological study within ninety days of issuance of the permit in order to determine the extent and direction of any pollution leaching from the landfill into the Pootatuck River or into groundwater located on adjacent properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The hearing was continued pending the receipt by the town of a preliminary certificate of need pursuant to \u00a7 22a-208d. The town submitted to the department a letter dated April 12,1990, outlining the need for the landfill\u2019s expansion. In January, 1991, the department issued a preliminary determination of need for the proposed landfill expansion, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-208d (b). The department also drafted a stipulated agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>containing the draft permit with conditions, including the need for a hydrogeological study. The draft agreement and permit were distributed both to the town and to the D\u2019Addario estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The hearing was continued again until May 2,1991, at which time the D\u2019Addario estate withdrew its support for the application of the town. The D\u2019Addario estate asserted that the discharge of leachate from the landfill site was having a negative impact on both the groundwater and surface water quality. The hearing officer reopened the record of the proceeding in order to provide an opportunity for the D\u2019Addario estate to present evidence and for the town to rebut the evidence presented. A public hearing to consider the intervenor\u2019s evidence was held August 29, 1991, and continued through September, 1991. The D\u2019Addario estate introduced evidence to demonstrate migration of pollution from the landfill into the waters of the Pootatuck River and onto adjoining properties. The town and department introduced evidence to refute the D\u2019Addario estate\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On February 25, 1992, the hearing officer issued a proposed decision to the commissioner, in which the hearing officer concluded: \u201cA. The Town of Newtown has satisfactorily met its statutory burden under [General Statutes \u00a7] 22a-208a and Section 22a-209-4 [of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies] for a vertical expansion of its existing landfill. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that expansion of the landfill would cause pollution. The record clearly indicates that the intervenor has <em>significantly </em>failed to put on any substantial evidence to support its allegations that contaminants from the landfill are causing or will cause pollution to either its property, adjacent properties, or the Pootatuck River. B. It is further concluded that this proposal meets the solid waste disposal needs of the state and will not result in substantial excess dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>posal capacity.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The hearing officer also recommended that the commissioner issue the permit, as well as a final determination of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On June 19, 1992, the commissioner rejected the hearing officer\u2019s proposed decision and denied the town\u2019s application for a vertical expansion of its landfill on two grounds. First, the commissioner concluded that because the town had not submitted a comprehensive hydrogeological study as required by \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b) (2) (A) (v) of the regulations, the town had failed to meet its burden to prove that the landfill was not causing offsite pollution currently and that the proposed expansion would not cause pollution or exacerbate such pollution as may already have resulted from landfill operations. Second, the commissioner concluded that the town had failed to satisfy its burden to prove that the expansion was necessary to meet the state\u2019s solid waste disposal needs, as required by \u00a7 22a-208d (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The town appealed to the trial court, claiming that the commissioner\u2019s denial of the town\u2019s application was illegal, arbitrary and an abuse of his discretion, given the record before the hearing officer and his recommendations. The town\u2019s complaint specifically alleged that the commissioner\u2019s denial of the town\u2019s application was \u201cmade upon an error of law,\u201d because, among other things, a hydrogeological study was not required by the regulations, the commissioner\u2019s staff had made a preliminary determination of need for the landfill\u2019s expansion, and \u00a7 22a-208d (a) did not place the burden of proof with regard to the issue of need upon the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The trial court held that \u201c[t]he Commissioner\u2019s ruling [was] directly contrary to the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the hearing officer to whom the matter was assigned, and to those of pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Department of Environmental Protection technical personnel, based upon over two years of public hearings, studies, tests and reports.\u201d Although the trial court agreed with the commissioner that a hydrogeological study was required, it held that \u201c[elemental fairness mandated that the Town be apprised of the Commissioner\u2019s concern and be given the opportunity at a further hearing to address the same.\u201d By failing to provide such opportunity, the court concluded that the commissioner had abused his discretion. The trial court also held that the town had satisfied its burden of proof with respect to need when the department made a preliminary determination of need, and that the town was not required after that date to present further evidence on the subject. The trial court remanded the case to the commissioner with direction that the town submit an \u201cappropriate comprehensive hydrogeologic[al] study, as requested by the Commissioner,\u201d that the record be reopened to consider the study results and that if these results were consistent with the findings and conclusions made by the hearing officer in the proposed final decision, that a permit should issue in accordance with that proposed final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On appeal, the commissioner argues that the trial court failed to apply the proper standard of review in finding an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>In <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands </em>Agency, 226 Conn. 579, 587-88, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993), we reaffirmed the well established principles that when \u201cchallenging an administrative agency action, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. . . . The plaintiff must do more than simply show that another decision maker, such as the trial court, might have reached a different conclusion. Rather than asking the reviewing court to retry the case de novo . . . the plaintiff must establish that substantial evidence does not exist in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s decision. . . . In reviewing [a department of environmental protection] decision made pursuant to the act, the reviewing court must sustain the [department\u2019s] determination if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given. . . . The evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial; [t]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency. . . . This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied injudicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . [I]t imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and to provide a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of weight of the evidence or clearly erroneous action. . . . The United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>States Supreme Court, in defining substantial evidence in the directed verdict formulation, has said that it is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence. . . . The reviewing court must take into account [that there is] contradictory evidence in the record . . . but the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) This \u201csubstantial evidence rule\u201d is embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 \u00a9 (5) and (6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We apply this standard of review not to the decision of the hearing officer but, rather, to the decision of the commissioner, because he is the final decision maker. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-207 (1) and (2), 22a-208 (a) and 22a-208a; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-209-4. Indeed, the trial court recognized that the ultimate decision-making authority rested in the commissioner. The applicable regulations specify that the commissioner in his final decision \u201cmay affirm, modify, or reverse the proposed final decision, in whole or in part, or may remand to the hearing officer for further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ceedings, including the taking of further evidence.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-3a-6 (y) (3) (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Our focus is therefore on the commissioner\u2019s findings, and whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support his denial of the permit on any ground.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner based his decision on two grounds: (1) the lack of a hydrogeological study; and (2) the failure of the town to demonstrate need. Because we sustain the commissioner\u2019s decision to deny the permit on the basis of the lack of a hydrogeological study, we need not address the commissioner\u2019s second reason for such denial. See <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses </em>Agency, 203 Conn. 525, 539-40, 525 A.2d 940 (1987) (\u201c[t]he agency\u2019s decision must be sustained if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Section 22a-209-4 (b) (2) (A) (v) of the regulations requires that an applicant for a permit submit \u201chydrogeologic and geologic information including predictions of movement of and impact on surface and ground water, including water supply wells, from existing and proposed site activities, and the names and addresses of all landowners within the area of potentially impacted ground waters, detailed soil boring logs; details of monitor well construction and development, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the method of testing and testing results.\u201d The town was therefore on notice that it was required to submit a detailed hydrogeological study. As the applicant, the town bore this burden of proof throughout the entire proceedings;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the burden did not shift to the department upon the rendering of a proposed decision by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u201cAn application will not be deemed complete until all information required by statutes or regulations or otherwise requested by the Commissioner have been submitted in proper form.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-209-4 (b). As the trial court recognized, the question of offsite pollution \u201cremained open\u201d and an \u201cappropriate comprehensive hydrogeologic study\u201d was required. The hydrogeological study in this case was required for the commissioner to be able to satisfy his mandate to \u201cexamine all existing or proposed solid waste facilities and provide for their proper planning, design, construction, operation, monitoring, closure and postclosure maintenance in a manner which ensures against pollution of the waters of the state\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 22a-208 (a). Because the study was not submitted and the commissioner, therefore, was not allowed to satisfy his mandate, he properly denied the town\u2019s permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The trial court held that, notwithstanding the town\u2019s failure to submit the hydrogeological study, the commissioner could not reject the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations without first providing the town with either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>an additional hearing or a remand to the hearing officer, in order to give the town an opportunity to submit an appropriate hydrogeological study. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">First, \u00a7 22a-3a-6 (y) (3) (D) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, upon which the trial court relied, does not require the commissioner to remand an incomplete application to the hearing officer so that additional evidence may be given. That section provides: \u201cAfter the issuance of the proposed final decision, the filing of any exceptions and briefs, and presentation of any oral argument, the Commissioner shall issue a written final decision in accordance with section 4-180 of the General Statutes. In his final decision the Commissioner may affirm, modify, or reverse the proposed final decision, in whole or in part, or <em>may remand </em>to the hearing officer for further proceedings, including the taking of further evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The decision to remand to a hearing officer is discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Second, General Statutes \u00a7 4-179 (a), upon which the trial court also relied, does not require an additional hearing. That section provides: \u201cWhen, in an agency proceeding, a majority of the members of the agency who are to render the final decision have not heard the matter <em>or read the </em>record, the decision, if adverse to a party, shall not be rendered until a proposed final decision is served upon the parties, and an opportunity is afforded to each party adversely affected to file exceptions and present briefs and oral argument to the members of the agency who are to render the final decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is no evidence before us that would support the trial court\u2019s assumption that the commissioner considered matters outside of the record, or that the commissioner did not fully consider the record. Indeed, the commissioner\u2019s final decision shows a careful reading of the record before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Finally, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the town was not given an \u201copportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 355, 542 A.2d 672 (1988). This requirement was satisfied by the department\u2019s provision of two separate hearing proceedings prior to the issuance of the hearing officer\u2019s proposed final decision. The town was on notice throughout these proceedings that a complete hydrogeological study was required, and also that the regulations required such a study to be completed prior to the issuance of a permit. Without this study, the town\u2019s application was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We conclude that, in light of the regulatory requirement for a comprehensive hydrogeological study as a prerequisite for the granting of a permit, the town\u2019s failure to provide such a study serves as substantial evidence in support of the commissioner\u2019s decision to deny the town\u2019s permit application. Thus, the commissioner acted within his discretion when he denied the town\u2019s permit application without providing a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> Section 22a-209-4 (b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in pertinent part: \u201cpermit to construct.

That doctrine provides that when the action of an agency is overturned, and it appears \u201cas a matter of law that there is only one single conclusion that the [agency] could reasonably reach,\u201d the trial court can direct the agency to take the action on remand. <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 430, 429 A.2d 910 (1980); General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (k).
