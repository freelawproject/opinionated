J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual determinations of defamation and breach of an implied contract of employment. The plaintiff, Anushavan Torosyan, brought this action alleging that the defendant, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., had terminated his employment in violation of an express contract, an implied contract and public policy, and that it had defamed him. After a court trial, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff only on the counts alleging breach of an implied contract and defamation. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The trial court found the following facts. The plaintiff was employed as a chemist by the defendant beginning in November, 1982. Because of representations made to the plaintiff in his preemployment interviews and in an employee manual given to the plaintiff on his first day of work, there was an implied contract between the parties that the plaintiff\u2019s employment could be terminated only for cause. On May 17, 1985, the plaintiffs supervisors falsely accused the plaintiff of having falsified an expense request form. The defendant then terminated the plaintiffs employment without cause. The plaintiff made extensive efforts to seek other employment, but he was unable to earn an equivalent salary at another job. Because of the defendant\u2019s acts, the plaintiff experienced humiliation, embarrassment and damage to his reputation. The plaintiff suffered economic damages for the loss of wages between his discharge and the end of 1992 in the amount of $146,595, and noneconomic damages in the amount of $45,000. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The trial concluded on January 10, 1992. The trial court issued its first memorandum of decision, reaching only the issue of liability, on January 25, 1993. The trial court issued a supplemental memorandum of decision on the issue of damages on April 15, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">On appeal from the judgment of the trial court, the defendant makes five claims, four of which are based on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. In particular, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence of: (1) an implied contract that the employment of the plaintiff could be terminated only for cause; (2) a breach of that contract; (3) defamation; and (4) damages. In addition, the defendant argues that the jurisdiction of the trial court expired before it decided the case, because the defendant had not knowingly and voluntarily waived the temporal limit oh the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction that is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 Sl-lSSb.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject all of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the jurisdiction of the trial court to decide the case had expired prior to the court\u2019s issuance of its two memoranda of decision. The defendant\u2019s claim is based on \u00a7 51-183b, which requires a trial court to decide a case within 120 days of the conclusion of trial, unless the parties waive the requirement. The defendant concedes that it declared its intent to waive the statutory requirement three times\u2014at 120, 240 and 360 days after trial\u2014and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that both decisions were issued within 120 days of the third waiver. The defendant contends, however, that when it provided the third waiver on January 8,1993, it understood, from information received from the clerk of the court, that the court would render a decision within ten days from the issuance of that waiver. The defendant further contends that \u201cthe clerk did not inform the parties that the decision which the court would be rendering would only address liability, nor that the court intended to continue the matter\u201d for a subsequent decision as to damages. Had it known that the trial court would decide the case after January 18, 1993, and would do so in two separate memoranda, the defendant asserts, it would not have provided the third waiver. Therefore, the defendant argues, the third waiver was not knowing and voluntary. Because the waiver was not knowing and voluntary, the defendant concludes, it was invalid, leaving the trial court without jurisdiction to decide the case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">There is no requirement that a waiver pursuant to \u00a7 51-183b be knowing and voluntary in the constitutional sense in order for the trial court to retain jurisdiction to decide the case. Although a \u201clate judgment . . . implicates the trial court\u2019s power to continue to exercise jurisdiction over the parties before it\u201d; <em>Waterman v. United Caribbean, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 688, 692, 577 A.2d 1047 (1990); we repeatedly have held that the statutory time limit may be waived merely by the parties\u2019 failure to object to the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. Id., 692-93; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>164 Conn. 554, 556-57, 325 A.2d 247 (1973); <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>112 Conn. 152, 154, 151 A. 512 (1930); <em>Cheshire Brass Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>86 Conn. 551, 560, 86 A. 26 (1913). The standards <em>for </em>a waiver pursuant to \u00a7 51-183b are therefore wholly unlike those governing the waiver of a constitutional right. Cf. <em>Molinas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>231 Conn. 514, 523-24, 652 A.2d 481 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Moreover, even assuming that a waiver of the 120 day time limit would be invalid if secured by material misrepresentations or fraud, we could not conclude that the third waiver was so secured in this case. The defendant raised its claim about the third waiver directly to us, without first moving in the trial court to set aside the judgment. Cf. <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>United </em>Caribbean, <em>Inc., </em>supra, 215 Conn. 690; <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 174, 176-77 and n.4, 487 A.2d 181 (1985); <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>29 Conn. App. 157, 159, 612 A.2d 824, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 913, 617 A.2d 167 (1992); <em>Ippolito </em>v. <em>Ippolito, </em>28 Conn. App. 745, 748-49, 612 A.2d 131, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 905, 615 A.2d 1047 (1992). As a result, the trial court made no evidentiary findings concerning the extent to which, or the circumstances in which, the parties had consented to extend the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. We must review the defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, only on the basis of the pleadings and the evidence in the reeord on appeal. That record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that any material misrepresentations were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The only item in the record relating to the defendant\u2019s third waiver of the 120 day limit is the waiver letter itself. That letter makes no reference to the defendant\u2019s supposed understanding that the trial court was going to decide the case within ten days. Indeed, the letter states on its face that the defendant \u201chereby waives the one hundred and twenty (120) day requirement <em>... to the extent of an additional one hundred and twenty (120) days in which to render judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Both the initial and the supplemental memoranda of decision were issued within that additional 120 day period. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that there were any limits imposed on the trial court\u2019s discretion, within that period, to issue two separate memoranda of decision, one addressing lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>bility and one addressing damages. There is similarly no allegation that the issuance of those separate memoranda prejudiced the defendant. In sum, we are unpersuaded that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">We next review the trial court\u2019s finding that there was an implied contract between the parties providing that the employment of the plaintiff could be terminated only for cause. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Prior to November, 1982, the plaintiff was employed by the California Bionuclear Corporation as a radiochemist. In late July, 1982, the plaintiff came to Ridgefield at the defendant\u2019s invitation and expense, for job interviews with five of the defendant\u2019s employees. At several of the interviews, the plaintiff informed the defendant\u2019s employees that he was seeking \u201clong-term\u201d employment, and that he did not want to move his family from California unless the defendant could guarantee him job security. In response, one interviewer told the plaintiff that if the plaintiff did a good job, the defendant would \u201ctake care\u201d of him. Another interviewer told the plaintiff that he hoped that the plaintiff would stay forever and that the plaintiff would have the opportunity to examine the company\u2019s employee manual to determine whether it provided the guarantees that he sought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These oral representations were material to the plaintiff\u2019s decision, in late August, 1982, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to accept, by telephone, an offer to take a position with the defendant as a radiochemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">On August 31,1982, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, stating that \u201c[t]his letter confirms our offer to you for employment as Biochemist III at an initial salary of $30,000 per year.\u201d Although the letter from the defendant further represented that the defendant would provide the plaintiff with various fringe benefits, it did not state that the plaintiff\u2019s employment would be terminable only for cause. The letter also did not state, however, that it contained all the terms of the plaintiffs employment contract or that it superseded any prior or subsequent oral representations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>might be made to the plaintiff. The plaintiff countersigned the letter without adding anything thereto and returned it to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The plaintiff moved to Connecticut in late October, 1982, and began work for the defendant on November 1. On that day, he was provided a copy of the defendant\u2019s employee manual, which he immediately proceeded to read. In a section titled, \u201cThe Right to Manage,\u201d the manual provided that \u201c[t]he company recognizes its right and obligation to operate and manage its facilities. This includes the right to hire, <em>discharge for cause, </em>promote, demote, reclassify and assign work to employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In a section titled, \u201cManagement\u2019s \u2018Open Door,\u2019 \u201d the manual further provided that \u201c[the defendant] supports an \u2018open door\u2019 method of handling your ideas, areas of discontent, or job-related problems which you may feel cannot be worked out successfully with your immediate supervisor or manager. The Company\u2019s Open Door Policy provides you with access through the organization up to, and including, the office of the President and Chief Executive Officer when necessary. ... You are encouraged to try to solve problems at the immediate supervisory or management level whenever possible. If, however, you feel it is a problem that cannot be brought to the attention of your immediate supervisor or manager, the problem should be brought directly to the attention of [the defendant\u2019s] Executive Management, including the President, when necessary.\u201d The provisions in the manual were material to the plaintiff\u2019s decision to continue to work for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Sometime in 1984, the plaintiff was provided with an updated copy of the defendant\u2019s employee manual. Unlike the old manual, that document stated, on its cover, that \u201c[t]his publication is distributed for general informational purposes only, and as such is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>change without notice.\u201d The new manual, in a section titled \u201cGeneral Principles of Personal Conduct,\u201d also provided for the first time that \u201c[t]he following practices are unacceptable ... 17. Falsifying any company record or report, or I.D. badge, or giving false information to anyone in the course of company business. . . . Every employee will be presumed to be familiar with these regulations. Violation of any is proper cause for disciplinary action, including dismissal. This list should not be considered as all inclusive.\u201d In a section titled \u201cThe Right to Manage,\u201d the new manual provided that \u201c[t]he company recognizes its right and obligation to operate and manage its facilities. This includes the right to hire, discharge, promote, demote, reclassify and assign work to employees.\u201d As the trial court found, \u201c [conspicuous by its absence was the theretofore requirement \u2018for cause.\u2019 \u201d The new manual contained the same provisions relating to the \u201cManagement\u2019s \u2018Open Door\u2019 \u201d policy as did the old manual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not believe that the new manual applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">On the basis of the foregoing facts, the trial court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that there had been an express contract between the parties that the plaintiffs employment could be terminated only for cause. Nevertheless, the trial court found that there had been an implied contract between the parties containing such an agreement. \u201cThe defendant, in its brief, argues that the words \u2018just do a good job and Boehringer will take care of you\u2019 and \u2018hope you will stay forever,\u2019 even if uttered to the plaintiff, do not amount to words or action or conduct which could, arguably, constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>some form of contract commitment. This court finds that when used as part of an employment interview involving a gainfully employed chemist who was seeking reassurance that a trans-continental relocation would be a worthwhile career move, such words could and did amount to a contractual commitment to the plaintiff that if he took the job he would not be terminated without just cause. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u201cThe court further finds that regardless of [its] value as an inducement to accept a position with the defendant, the Policies and Procedures Manual (1981 edition) was provided to the plaintiff as he commenced his employment and, consequently, he has the right to hold the defendant to the terms and conditions of employment set forth therein. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u201cThe evidence permits a finding that the defendant made an offer of employment to the plaintiff and during the course of that offer assured him that his employment would be governed by the Policies and Procedures Manual. The evidence is sufficient to permit a further finding that in reliance upon and in consideration for that offer, the plaintiff accepted the offer, terminated his existing employment, relocated his family across the country and bought a new home, the mortgage on which was, in part, subsidized by the defendant. That evidence is sufficient to permit a finding that the parties had an implied agreement that as long as he performed his job properly, the plaintiff would not be excused except for cause. . . . The plaintiff [also] was . . . entitled by the Manual, to access the Company\u2019s open door policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusions on three grounds. First, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence that the alleged statements relating to job security in fact had been made by the defendants\u2019 employees. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>defendant argues that, in light of the circumstances in which the statements were made and in which the 1981 employment manual was provided to the plaintiff, and in light of the specific language contained in those statements and that manual, the trial court could not reasonably have found that there was a contract between the parties that the plaintiff\u2019s employment could be terminated only for cause, or that the plaintiff would have the right to speak to a vice president of the company before any termination was finalized. Finally, the defendant argues that, as a matter of law, at the time of the termination, the plaintiff\u2019s employment was governed by the 1984 employment manual, which no longer contained any \u201cfor cause\u201d language and cannot be read to support contractual recovery. We reject each of the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Because the plaintiff testified as to each of the alleged oral statements concerning his future job security and the trial court found that testimony credible, there was sufficient evidence for the court to find that the statements were in fact made. Although the defendant\u2019s witnesses denied having made the statements, the trial court was free to believe the testimony of the plaintiff and to disbelieve that of the defendant\u2019s witnesses. \u201cIt is the trial court which had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and parties; thus, it is best able to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary inferences therefrom. . . . A trier of fact is free to reject testimony even if it is uncontradicted . . . and is equally free to reject part of the testimony of a witness even if other parts have been found credible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 507, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings that the implied contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>between the parties incorporated the terms of the oral statements and of the 1981 manual and that the contract was not modified by the 1984 manual. Our determination as to each of these evidentiary issues is informed by the general legal principles governing actions based on implied contracts of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">At the outset, we note that all employer-employee relationships not governed by express contracts involve some type of implied \u201ccontract\u201d of employment. \u201cThere cannot be any serious dispute that there is a bargain of some kind; otherwise, the employee would not be working.\u201d 1 H. Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law and Practice (3d Ed. 1992) \u00a7 4.32, p. 326. To determine the contents of any particular implied contract of employment, the factual circumstances of the parties\u2019 relationship must be examined in light of legal rules governing unilateral contracts. See <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 394, 409-10, 499 A.2d 64 (1985) (implied contract of employment is unilateral contract), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 202 Conn. 190, 198, 520 A.2d 208 (1987); <em>Pine River State Bank </em>v. <em>Mettille, </em>333 N.W.2d 622, 630-31 (Minn. 1983) (same).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Pursuant to the legal principles governing such contracts, in order to find that an implied contract of employment incorporates specific representations orally made by the employer or contained in provisions in an employee manual, the trier of fact is required to find the following subordinate facts. Initially, the trier of fact is required to find that the employer\u2019s oral representations or issuance of a handbook to the employee was an \u201coffer\u201d\u2014i.e., that it was a promise to the employee that, if the employee worked for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>company, his or her employment would thereafter be governed by those oral or written statements, or both. If the oral representations and/or the handbook constitute an \u201coffer,\u201d the trier of fact then is required to find that the employee accepted that offer. Subsequent oral representations or the issuance of subsequent handbooks must be evaluated by the same criteria. To be incorporated into the implied contract of employment, any such representation or handbook must constitute an offer to modify the preexisting terms of employment by substituting a new implied contract for the old. Furthermore, the proposed modifications, like the original offers, must be accepted. See 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 45 and illustration 8 (1981); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 279 (1981);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see also 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1990) \u00a7 3.24, p. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Typically, an implied contract of employment does not limit the terminability of an employee\u2019s employment but merely includes terms specifying wages, working hours, job responsibilities and the like. Thus, \u201c[a]s a general rule, contracts of permanent employment, or for an indefinite term, are terminable at will.\u201d <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>202 Conn. 206, 211 n.1, 520 A.2d 217 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Pursuant to traditional contract principles, however, the default rule of employment at will can be modified by the agreement of the parties. Id. \u201cAccordingly, to prevail on the . . . count of his complaint [that] alleged the existence of an implied agreement between the parties, the plaintiff had the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that [the employer] had agreed, either by words or action or conduct, to undertake [some] form of actual contract commitment to him under which he could not be terminated without just cause. [Id.], 212 n.2; <em>Therrien </em>v. <em>Safeguard Mfg. </em>Co., [180 Conn. 91, 94-95, 429 A.2d 808 (1980)]. . . . Absent a statutory warranty or definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended to encompass in their contractual commitments is a question of the intention of the parties, and an inference of fact. As an inference of fact, it is not reversible [error] unless the [trier of fact] could not reasonably have arrived at the conclusion that it reached. <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 266, 274-75, 439 A.2d 314 (1981).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 106, 112-13, 544 A.2d 170 (1988); see also <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 198, 520 A.2d 208 (1987) (whether employment manual becomes term of implied contract of employment is question of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In this case, on the basis of the oral and written representations made to the plaintiff and the plaintiffs response to those representations, the trial court found that there were contractual agreements that: (1) the plaintiffs employment would be terminable only for cause; and (2) the plaintiff would have a right to speak to an executive officer of the company before any termination was finalized. In large part, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s findings is identical to the argument of the employer in <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal Inter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>national, Inc., </em>supra, 208 Conn. 112, that \u201call of the statements that the plaintiff testified had been made to him were, at most, merely expressions of [the defendant\u2019s employees\u2019] expectations about the future, and were not manifestations of a present intention on the part of the company to undertake contractual obligations to the plaintiff under which he could not be terminated without just cause.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s argument here, just as we rejected it in <em>Coelho. </em>The trial court found that, in the circumstances of this case, the oral and written statements constituted promises to the plaintiff. The trial court further found that, by working for the defendant, the plaintiff accepted those promises. Although we might have made a different finding in the first instance, our role is not to retry the facts. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous [only] when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Yankee Gas Services Co., </em>224 Conn. 675, 691, 620 A.2d 771 (1993); <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In light of the factual record in this case, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. The plaintiff testified that certain statements were made to him in the context of an employment interview in direct response to his inquiries about job security. One of those statements was that if the plaintiff did a good job, the defendant would take care of him. Another statement was that the plaintiff\u2019s employment would be governed by an employment manual. The offer letter sent to the plaintiff neither stated that it contained the entire terms of the employment offer nor disclaimed any guarantees of job security. The defendant\u2019s oral representations were material to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>tiff\u2019s decision to move from California and accept employment with the defendant. The employee manual was provided to the plaintiff on the first day of work, and he immediately proceeded to read it to ensure that it was consistent with the defendant\u2019s representations. The manual explicitly qualified the defendant\u2019s right to discharge with the words \u201cfor cause.\u201d The manual also stated that every employee could speak to an executive officer about \u201cjob-related problems which [he or she] may feel cannot be worked out successfully with [his or her] immediate supervisor or manager.\u201d Finally, after reading the manual, the plaintiff continued to work for the defendant for several years. See generally <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>supra, 208 Conn. 113-14, 118-19.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We also conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings are not undermined as a matter of law by the issuance of a new manual in 1984. Pursuant to the principles of contract law discussed above, for the new manual to have modified the preexisting terms of employment, the plaintiff must have consented to that modification. The trial court did not find that there had been any such consent. The defendant argues, however, that the plaintiff consented as a matter of law to the provisions contained in the new manual, because he continued to work for the defendant even after the new manual had been distributed to him. In the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>stances of this case, we disagree that the mere distribution of the manual and the plaintiff\u2019s continued work necessarily demonstrated his consent to the proposed modification of the preexisting contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">When an employer issues an employment manual that confers on an employee greater rights than he or she previously had, the employee\u2019s continued work for the employer thereafter ordinarily demonstrates that the employee has accepted that offer of new rights. See <em>Woolley </em>v. <em>Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>99 N.J. 284, 298-99, 491 A.2d 1257, modified on other grounds, 101 N.J. 10, 499 A.2d 515 (1985); <em>Pine River State Bank </em>v. <em>Mettille, </em>supra, 333 N.W.2d 629-30; 1 H. Perritt, supra, \u00a7 4.37, pp. 338-43, 339 (collecting cases from other states; explaining that because \u201cthe most likely motive for an employer to make a promise of employment security to the workforce in general is that the promise will encourage employees to continue their employment,\u201d it is logical to view continued employment as acceptance of, and consideration for, such promise); see also <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>supra, 208 Conn. 118-19 (employee\u2019s acceptance of implied contract can be demonstrated even if employee did not provide \u201cseparate consideration\u201d for such promise); see also <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">When an employer issues an employment manual that substantially interferes with an employee\u2019s legitimate expectations about the terms of employment, however, the employee\u2019s continued work after notice of those terms cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of the employee\u2019s consent to those terms. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Kings Entertainment Co., </em>653 F. Sup. 871, 875 (E.D. Va. 1987); <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich. 472, 504-506, 444 N.W.2d 114 (1989) (opinion of Levin, J.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1072, 110 S.

If we were to accept the defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, an employee whose preexisting contract provided that his or her employment could be terminated only for cause would have no way to insist on those contractual rights. The employee\u2019s only choices would be to resign or to continue working, either of which would result in the loss of the very right at issue\u2014that is, the loss of the right to retain employment until terminated for cause. The fact that an employee continues working, therefore, may be relevant to determining whether he or she consented to the new contract, but cannot itself mandate a finding of consent. See <em>Pershern </em>v. <em>Fiatallis North America, Inc., </em>834 F.2d 136, 138 (8th Cir. 1987); <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>supra, 504-506, (opinion of Levin, J.); <em>In re Certified Question, Bankey </em>v. <em>Storer Broadcasting Co., </em>supra, 459-61 (opinion of Levin, J.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Because the trial court found that the terms contained in the 1984 manual would have substantially interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s legitimate expectations under his preexisting contract, and because there was no evidence other than the plaintiff\u2019s continued work for the defendant tending to show that the plaintiff had consented to the terms of the 1984 manual, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff\u2019s contract of employment continued to be governed by the 1981 manual and the previous oral representations made to him. In sum, the trial court\u2019s findings that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>plaintiffs employment was terminable only for cause and that he had a right to invoke the \u201copen door\u201d procedure in the event of termination must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We next review the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that the discharge constituted a breach of the implied contract. We conclude that this finding also was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The following evidence is relevant to this claim. The plaintiff initially sent his resume to the defendant in 1982 in response to an advertisement in a trade magazine that represented that the defendant was seeking an employee to manage a radiochemistry laboratory that the defendant planned to construct. The plaintiff was hired for the purpose of managing this new laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">When the plaintiff arrived to begin work in November, 1982, the radiochemistry laboratory was still under construction. For the following two years, while the laboratory construction proceeded, the plaintiff was assigned to synthesize various nonradioactive compounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">On September 5, 1984, the plaintiff received his annual performance review. The plaintiff\u2019s supervisor characterized his performance as \u201c[ejxcellent\u201d and informed him that he was likely to be promoted from biochemist III to research associate, a managerial position, within six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Later that month, the plaintiff was permitted access for the first time to the newly constructed radiochemistry laboratory. He immediately expressed his concern to his supervisors that, as constructed, the new laboratory could not properly be used to synthesize radioactive compounds, because it did not contain the right kinds of plastic \u201choods\u201d for performance of the syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>theses. According to the plaintiff, without the proper hoods, there was a danger that the laboratory workers would be exposed to radiation. Between October, 1984, and May, 1985, the plaintiff repeated this and other safety concerns about the new laboratory to his supervisors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The supervisors rejected the plaintiffs concerns and instructed the plaintiff to find a way to perform the syntheses in the existing hoods. He was unable to do so. In February, 1985, the plaintiff was informed that, because of his failure to initiate work in the new laboratory, he no longer was being considered for a promotion to research associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In May, 1985, the defendant instructed the plaintiff to attend a training session in or near Boston, Massachusetts, to learn how to operate a piece of laboratory equipment that the defendant recently had purchased. The plaintiff believed that he was being sent to the training session as a form of punishment, because the new equipment was likely not to be operated by him, but by a lower level laboratory technician. Without prior authorization from the defendant, the plaintiff invited a coworker, who was employed by the defendant as a laboratory technician, also to travel to the training session with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Upon his return from the training session, the plaintiff completed a draft expense request form for expenses incurred on the trip. In the plaintiffs view, this expense request form was not designed to be an \u201cofficial\u201d request for reimbursement, but rather was supposed to list all expenses incurred, whether or not those expenses were business related. The plaintiff further believed that, according to company policy, he was required to include on his form not just his expenses, but also the expenses of his coworker, because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>coworker had a lower ranking position in the company and was traveling with him. In the plaintiffs understanding, the secretary to the chief of his department, who reviewed the form, would determine which expenses were compensable. Thereafter, a second \u201cofficial\u201d form was to be completed pursuant to the secretary\u2019s determinations, and that form was to be signed by the plaintiff and submitted to the defendant for reimbursement. In previous instances, the plaintiff had followed the procedure of submitting a draft \u201cunofficial\u201d form, receiving the secretary\u2019s corrections, and then submitting an \u201cofficial\u201d form and had never been informed that his method of completing the expense request forms was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In conformance with his understanding of company policy, the plaintiff recorded on his draft expense form all expenses incurred either by him or by his coworker. He also recorded the daily mileage traveled, as reflected by the odometer of his coworker\u2019s car, without differentiating between business related mileage and mileage for personal excursions. When he submitted the initial form to the secretary of the department chief, the plaintiff orally informed her that the form included expenses for two individuals. He did not sign the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Approximately one week later, the secretary to the department chief returned the plaintiff\u2019s expense form to him. On the form were various handwritten notations about expenses that were either not compensable or needed supporting receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Soon after the plaintiff received the secretary\u2019s annotations on his draft expense request form, his supervisor asked him to return a revised form directly to her as soon as it was completed. The plaintiff then prepared a revised \u201cofficial\u201d form pursuant to his understanding of the annotations on his \u201cunofficial\u201d form, signed the new form and returned it -to his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The next morning, the plaintiff was called into a meeting with his supervisor, the chief of his department and the company\u2019s personnel manager. At the meeting, the defendant\u2019s employees asked him to justify various items recorded on his expense request forms. The plaintiff explained his understanding of the company policy relating to the initial expense form. He further pointed out that he had filled out the second expense form in accordance with each of the instructions that he had received when the secretary had returned the form to him. The defendant\u2019s employees then accused the plaintiff of falsification of a company document in that he had recorded charges that he had not incurred or that were not compensable. The meeting concluded soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Approximately one hour after the meeting, the three employees of the defendant who had attended the meeting presented the plaintiff with a memorandum stating that his employment was being terminated, effective immediately, because he had falsified company documents. The defendant\u2019s employees instructed the plaintiff to collect his personal belongings and to vacate the premises immediately. They denied the plaintiff\u2019s request to meet with a vice president of the company to review the termination decision, and he was escorted out of the building. A copy of the memorandum provided to the plaintiff was placed in the plaintiff\u2019s personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the trial court found that \u201cthe evidence establishes that the true reason the plaintiff was discharged is the fact that he grew increasingly disenchanted with his employer\u2019s failure to provide him with the laboratory and the supervisory duties he expected to enjoy as the director of such a laboratory. The evidence demonstrates that he was denied his expected promotion .... As his memos documenting the Company\u2019s shortcomings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>lab design, purchasing, staffing and most adamantly, safety precautions, increased in number and critical comment, so did the intent of management to terminate his responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The trial court concluded that, although the termination did not violate public policy,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it did violate the terms of the parties\u2019 implied contract of employment. \u201c[The] denial to [the plaintiff of his right under the open door policy] is found to have been a direct consequence of the actions of the defendant\u2019s employees and a substantial breach of his implied contract ....</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u201c[T]he plaintiff [also] enjoyed an implied contract of employment with the defendant which required some reasonable cause for his termination .... As previously noted, the court, while mindful that it should not lightly intervene to [interfere with] the exercise of managerial discretion . . . cannot and will not condone or overlook the fact that the true reason this plaintiff was terminated was due to his insistent badgering of his superiors to obtain his contractual rights as he perceived them. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u201cThe defendant admitted in its answer . . . that it \u2018terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment\u2019 citing as a reason therefor the plaintiff\u2019s alleged <em>\u2018having falsified Company documents.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201cThe documents alleged to have been falsified were expense account reports generated by the plaintiff\u2019s aforementioned seminar in Massachusetts. . . . When taken in concert with the testimony about the extremely strained employer-employee relations, the claim of the defendant that the plaintiff intentionally falsified his expense report to obtain reimbursement of funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to which he was not entitled loses credibility. It is clear from the evidence presented that the plaintiff was terminated as a result of his disputes with his supervisors <em>. . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court could not reasonably have found either: (1) that the plaintiffs employment had been terminated for a reason other than the falsification of documents; or (2) that the plaintiff had been denied access to the open door procedure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Once again, we note that our role is not to retry the facts but only to determine whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s findings. Such evidence existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On the basis of the documents admitted in evidence and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which the trial court deemed credible, it was reasonable for the trial court to find that inaccuracies contained in the plaintiffs expense forms, if any, resulted only from his innocent misunderstandings about company policy and not from acts of falsification. It also was reasonable for the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>court to find that the plaintiffs supervisors had been motivated to discharge him not because of the expense request forms but because of the disputes regarding his laboratory. Finally, it was reasonable for the trial court to find that, at the time when the plaintiff had been informed of his discharge, he had asked to speak to a vice president of the company and that his request had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Because the defendant does not allege that there was \u201cjust cause\u201d for the discharge in the absence of actual falsification of documents by the plaintiff,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination in this case that there was no cause for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We next review the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant defamed the plaintiff. The trial court made the following factual findings in relation to this claim. \u201c[Hjaving found that the defendant falsely attributed the plaintiff\u2019s discharge to his falsifying of company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>documents . . . the court finds that the plaintiff was defamed as to his professional reputation and that he is entitled to damages for the injury .... [Tjhere was sufficient publication of the allegation both among the several supervisors present at his discharge and by virtue of the written memorandum prepared at the time of his discharge and placed in his personnel file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The defendant raises three challenges to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statements constituted actionable defamation. First, the defendant contends that the statements made were true. Second, the defendant contends that, even if the statements were not true, there was insufficient evidence of publication of those statements. Third, the defendant contends that even if there was sufficient evidence of publication, that publication was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The defendant has correctly identified the factual issues that are relevant to a finding of defamation. \u201cTo find that the defendants were liable for defamation . . . the [court] was required to find that the defendants published false statements that harmed the [plaintiff], and that the defendants were not privileged to do so.\u201d <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 563, 606 A.2d 693 (1992). We are persuaded, however, that each of the necessary facts was adequately established and therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">We already have affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff did not falsify company documents. Thus, the defendant\u2019s first claim\u2014that its statement about the plaintiff was true\u2014is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim\u2014that there was no publication\u2014is equally untenable. The trial court found that the statement about the plaintiff had been communicated among the plaintiff\u2019s supervisors and had been included in the plaintiff\u2019s personnel file. Although intracorporate communications once were considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>by many courts not to constitute \u201cpublication\u201d of a defamatory statement, that view has been almost entirely abandoned, and we reject it here. See 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 577 (1) and comment (i) (1977) (\u201cThe communication within the scope of his employment by one agent to another agent of the same principal is a publication not only by the first agent but also by the principal and this is true whether the principal is an individual, a partnership or a corporation.\u201d); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 113, p. 798 (\u201cThere may be publication to any third person. ... It may be made to the defendant\u2019s own agent, employee or officer, even where the defendant is a corporation.\u201d); R. Smolla, Law of Defamation (1994) \u00a7 15.02, and cases cited therein (finding publication on basis of communication among agents of employer in context of employment termination); see also <em>Battista </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>10 Conn. App. 486, 489, 523 A.2d 1356, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 803, 525 A.2d 1352 (1987) (affirming finding of defamation where corporation accused plaintiff employee of theft in letter that was sent to plaintiff and three other agents of corporation); but see <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>793 F. Sup. 404, 407 (D. Conn. 1992); L. <em>Cohen &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., </em>629 F. Sup. 1425, 1427 (D. Conn. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s third argument, which is that the publication was privileged. \u201cThere are two facets to the defense of privilege. The occasion must be one of privilege, and the privilege must not be abused. Whether the occasion is one of privilege is a question of law. . . . [W]hether the privilege was abused . . . depends upon whether there was malice in fact ... in uttering and broadcasting the alleged defamatory matter.\u201d <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>142 Conn. 605, 615, 116 A.2d 440 (1955); see also <em>Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>196 Conn. 498, 504, 493 A.2d 236 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>We agree with the defendant that communications between managers regarding the review of an employee\u2019s job performance and the preparation of documents regarding an employee\u2019s termination are protected by a qualified privilege. Such communications and documents are necessary to effectuate the interests of the employer in efficiently managing its business. See 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 593, and \u00a7 596 and comment (d) (1977); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 115 (3), pp. 828-29; R. Smolla, supra, \u00a7 15.07 [2] [a], and cases cited therein; see also <em>Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 504 (privilege in acting to protect interest in property); <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>11 Conn. App. 584, 594 n.8, 529 A.2d 199 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In this case, however, the trial court implicitly found that, as a matter of fact, the privilege had been abused because the defendant\u2019s agents had made the statement about the plaintiff with actual malice\u2014that is, with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard as to its truth. <em>See Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 504 (qualified privilege may be overcome on finding of malice); 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 600 (1977) (qualified privilege fails if statement made with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth). In his complaint, the plaintiff had pleaded that the statement had been made with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard as to its truth, and the defendant had denied that allegation. Moreover, in deciding the plaintiff\u2019s other claims, the trial court explicitly found that the defendant\u2019s agents had made the statement intentionally, that they had done so with an improper motive, and that they had failed to investigate or retract the statement even after the plaintiff notified them that the statement was false and requested further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In light of the pleadings, the trial court\u2019s findings on other issues and the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination on the defamation count, we are persuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>a finding of actual malice was implicit in the trial court\u2019s decision. The evidence in the record adequately supports such a finding, as the trial court reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s agents published a false statement in order to effectuate the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, even though they doubted the statement\u2019s veracity. See <em>Woodcock </em>v. <em>Journal Publishing Co., </em>230 Conn. 525, 527, 646 A.2d 92 (1994) (in suit by public figure against media defendant, finding of actual malice permissible when there is \u201csufficient evidence to permit the [inference] that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication\u201d). In any event, because the defendant failed to seek an articulation in the trial court as to whether the qualified privilege had been abused, it cannot now complain of a lack of an explicit finding on that issue. See <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 31 and n.6, 653 A.2d 168 (1995); <em>Associated Catalog Merchandisers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chagnon, </em>210 Conn. 734, 747, 557 A.2d 525 (1989); <em>Southington </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>210 Conn. 549, 563, 556 A.2d 166 (1989); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that, in three respects, the damages award was improper. First, the defendant alleges that there was insufficient evidence that the defendant\u2019s actions caused any injury to the plaintiff. Second, the defendant alleges that there was insufficient evidence to support the award of lost wages for the period between the date of the plaintiff\u2019s trial testimony and the end of 1992. Third, the defendant alleges that there was insufficient evidence to support the award of noneconomic damages. We disagree with all three of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We first address the sufficiency of the evidence to support the award of economic damages for the defendant\u2019s breach of contract. The following facts are relevant to this claim. After the termination of his employment with the defendant, the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought employment as a chemist at more than thirty companies throughout the United States. The plaintiff therefore took a series of jobs outside his field of expertise, working as, inter alia, a security guard and as a quality control inspector for a plastic molding manufacturer. At the time of trial, the plaintiff was working as a quality control inspector for a computer equipment manufacturer. The plaintiff\u2019s salary at each of these new jobs was significantly lower than the salary that he had been earning from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>To determine the amount of economic damages from lost wages, the court engaged in the following analysis. First, it estimated what the plaintiff would have earned if he had remained employed by the defendant until the end of 1992. Next, it computed the sum of: (1) the wages the defendant in fact had earned at other jobs between the date of his termination and the date of his trial testimony in October, 1991, and (2) the wages the defendant probably would have earned between the date of his trial testimony and the end of 1992. It then awarded the plaintiff the difference between the first sum and the second, a total of $146,595. We see no impropriety in the trial court\u2019s finding as to economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u201cThe general rule in breach of contract cases is that the award of damages is designed to place the injured party, so far as can be done by money, in the same position as that which he would have been in had the contract been performed. ... It has traditionally been held that a party may recover general contract damages for any loss that may fairly and reasonably be considered [as] arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself. . . . This court has consistently applied the general damage formula of <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale </em>[9 Ex. 341, 354, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854),] to the recovery of lost profits for breach of contract, and it is our rule that [u]nless they are too speculative and remote, prospective profits are allowable as an element of damage whenever their loss arises directly from and as a natural consequence of the breach.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>201 Conn. 305, 319-20, 514 A.2d 734 (1986). Thus, \u201c[t]he normal rule on an employment contract is that when the employee is prevented from fully performing because the employer wrongfully fires him, the employee can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>recover the wages he would have earned under the contract, minus any wages which he has earned or could have earned elsewhere, and the burden of proof of the latter is on the employer. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Bartek, </em>142 Conn. 448, 451-52, 114 A.2d 923 [1955].\u201d <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>172 Conn. 210, 221, 374 A.2d 193 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In this case, the trial court made explicit findings about what the plaintiff would have earned from the defendant had he not been discharged, what he did earn from other sources after his discharge, and what he was likely to be able to earn between the date of trial and the end of 1992. Because each of the findings was based on reasonable inferences and estimates from the evidence presented, the findings must be affirmed. \u201cReasonable certainty of proof is all that is required, and mere uncertainty as to the amount of lost profits may be dispelled by the same degree of proof as is required in other civil actions, that is, the amount may be determined approximately upon reasonable inferences and estimates.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We acknowledge that the Appellate Court recently has held that damages for future lost wages\u2014i.e., wages for the period after the conclusion of trial\u2014 cannot be awarded in an action for breach of an employment contract. The Appellate Court reasoned that such damages, commonly known as \u201cfront pay,\u201d are an equitable, rather than a legal, remedy and were developed specifically as an alternative to reinstatement in actions for employment discrimination. See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>36 Conn. App. 1, 10-17, 647 A.2d 1031 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Whatever the origins of damages for future lost wages, however, we are persuaded that such damages can be awarded in actions for breach of an implied con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tract of employment, as long as they are limited to a reasonable time and are supported by the evidence. Damages for future lost profits may be awarded in contract actions; see, e.g., <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 320; <em>Stern &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>International Harvester Co., </em>148 Conn. 527, 533, 172 A.2d 614 (1961); <em>Kay Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Piergrossi, </em>137 Conn. 620, 624, 79 A.2d 829 (1951); and we can discern no difference between these types of damages and damages for future lost wages. See <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co., </em>35 Conn. App. 850, 859-60, 647 A.2d 364 (1994) (front pay damages <em>are </em>appropriate under normal principles of contract law); see also <em>Ohanian </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>779 F.2d 101, 110 (2d Cir. 1985) (in action for breach of contract of employment, upholding award of front pay and the same damages computation used here); <em>Worrell </em>v. <em>Multipress, Inc., </em>45 Ohio St. 3d 241, 246-47, 543 N.E.2d 1277 (1989) (same); <em>Osterkamp </em>v. <em>Alkota Mfg., Inc., </em>332 N.W.2d 275, 279 (S.D. 1983) (same); <em>W. Pat Crow Forgings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarez, </em>749 S.W.2d 192, 195 (Tex. App. 1988) (same). Moreover, in this case, the plaintiffs complaint included a request for equitable relief, and the plaintiff\u2019s trial brief specifically asked for reinstatement or, in the alternative, \u201cthat damages extend for a reasonable time period into the future, at least for a future period of time equal to the period from the time of the wrongful termination until the date of judgment.\u201d Thus, the defendant cannot complain of lack of notice of its potential liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Finally, we address the propriety of the award of noneconomic damages. The trial court found that, as a result of the defamation and the resulting discharge, \u201cthe plaintiff suffered not only loss of income, but also suffered emotional distress, embarrassment, anxiety and humiliation . . . .\u2019\u2019To compensate the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the court awarded noneconomic damages in the amount of $45,000. Once again, we are persuaded that the award of damages must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The trial court found that the defendant falsely had charged the plaintiff with improper conduct and lack of integrity in the performance of his professional duties and that the purpose of the defamatory statement had been to effectuate the plaintiffs discharge. The defamation, therefore, amounted to defamation per se. <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Lippe, </em>162 Conn. 371, 384, 294 A.2d 326 (1972); <em>Proto </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corp., </em>136 Conn. 557, 566, 72 A.2d 820 (1950); <em>Battista </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>supra, 10 Conn. App. 491-92. \u201cWhen the defamatory words are actionable per se, the law conclusively presumes the existence of injury to the plaintiffs reputation. He is required neither to plead nor to prove it.\u201d <em>Urban </em>v. <em>Hartford Gas Co., </em>139 Conn. 301, 308, 93 A.2d 292 (1952). The plaintiff is \u201centitled to recover, as general damages, for the injury to his reputation and for the humiliation and mental suffering which the libel caused him.\u201d <em>Proto </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corp., </em>supra, 571. In light of these authorities, we are persuaded that the award of noneconomic damages was within the discretion of the trial court. See also <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 11 Conn. App. 602-603; <em>Battista </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>supra, 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-8\"> The trial court had received from the parties three successive waivers of the 120 day rule contained in General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b, which provides: \u201c(Formerly Sec. 51-29). judgments in civil actions, time limit. Any judge of the superior court and any state trial referee who has the power to render judgment, who has commenced the trial of any civil cause, shall have power to continue such trial and shall render judgment not later than one hundred and twenty days from the completion date of the trial of such civil cause.

Another way of stating the same point is that, in such a contract, there is no mutuality of obligation between the parties. See generally 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1990) \u00a7 3.24; 1 H. Perritt, supra, \u00a7 4.37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\"> Section 45 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981) provides in relevant part: \u201cOption Contract Created by Part Performance or Tender</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201c(1) Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a performance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, an option contract is created when the offeree tenders or begins the invited performance or tenders a beginning of it.\u201d Illustration 8 then gives the following example: \u201cIn January A, an employer, publishes a notice to his employees, promising a stated Christmas bonus to any employee who is continuously in A\u2019s employ from January to Christmas. B, an employee hired by the week, reads the notice and continues at work beyond the expiration of the current week. A is bound by an option contract, and if B is continuously in A\u2019s employ until Christmas a notice of revocation of the bonus is ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Section 279 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981) provides in relevant part: \u201cSubstituted Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u201c(1) A substituted contract is a contract that is itself accepted by the obligee in satisfaction of the obligor\u2019s existing duty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> In <em>D'Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 214, we held that statements made by the school district to a teacher that she would be rehired were not sufficiently promissory to support contractual recovery. The school district\u2019s statements in that case were similar to the defendant\u2019s statements here. Id., 208-209. As we subsequently explained in <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>supra, 208 Conn. 113, however, statements made to an employee must be examined in the circumstances in which they were expressed. Notwithstanding the broad language of <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo, </em>therefore, the question of whether statements are promissory should be considered as a question of fact, and factual conclusions will be reversed only when there is insufficient evidence to support them. See <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>supra, 113-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> We need not decide in this case whether, when an employer issues an employment manual that changes the rights afforded to an employee but does not materially interfere with that employee\u2019s legitimate expectations about the terms of his or her employment, an employee who has notice of the new terms accepts those terms as a matter of law by continuing to work. Cf. <em>Ferrera </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>799 P.2d 458, 460 (Colo. App. 1990); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Borden, Inc., </em>450 S.E.2d 589, 594-95 (S.C. 1994); <em>Trembly </em>v. <em>Mrs. Fields Cookies, </em>884 P.2d 1306, 1312-13 (Utah App. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> The plaintiff also requested that the defendant hire an additional laboratory aide, lock a door to the laboratory and purchase special \u201cbooties\u201d that would be worn only in the lab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\"> The trial court thus rejected the plaintiffs claim that his employment had been terminated because he had been a \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Cf. <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 427 A.2d 385 (1980) (recognizing tort claim for discharge in violation of public policy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b45-8\"> The defendant also questions whether the trial court actually found that the plaintiff had been terminated for a reason other than his falsification of an expense request. In support of its argument, the defendant points to one sentence of the opinion, which reads: \u201cIt was the expense report turned in for reimbursement which is the basis for the plaintiffs discharge\u2014 not his persistence in identifying safety hazards.\u201d Although we agree that the sentence, read out of context, might be misleading, the sentences immediately preceding and following this quoted sentence, as well as the trial court\u2019s opinion as a whole, make clear that the trial court did not believe that the plaintiff had falsified an expense report and that it did not believe that the defendant had fired him as a result of the alleged falsification. Rather, the trial court found, the plaintiff had been fired because of disputes with his supervisors. In the context in which it was written, the quoted sentence was meant to convey only (1) that the expense report was the <em>alleged </em>basis for the employer\u2019s action, and (2) that the court did not believe that the supposed \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d activities of the plaintiff, any more than the supposed falsification of an expense report, had been the real reason for the discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\"> The defendant has not claimed that, even if the plaintiff did not falsify documents, his supervisors had a good faith belief that he had committed such falsification when they discharged him and that such a good faith belief also constituted cause for dismissal. The defendant also has not argued that, even if the plaintiff did not falsify documents, his innocent or negligent inaccuracies on those documents themselves constituted cause for dismissal. Finally, the defendant has not argued that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinsistent badgering of his superiors\u201d itself constituted cause for dismissal. See generally 1 H. Perritt, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 4.46 through 4.51. We thus do not decide whether, if such claims had been made, the trial court properly could have found that there had been a breach of the implied contract between the parties. We also need not decide another legal question not raised by the parties\u2014 the question of whether it is the employer\u2019s burden to prove that there was cause for a dismissal or the employee\u2019s burden to prove the absence of cause for a dismissal. See id., \u00a7 4.52. In this case, the only evidence proffered as to a \u201ccause\u201d for dismissal was the plaintiff\u2019s alleged falsification, which the trial court found had been disproved by the preponderance of the evidence. Thus, even if the plaintiff had the ultimate burden to show the absence of cause for dismissal, the trial court\u2019s findings demonstrate that he carried that burden in the context of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\"> Because the plaintiffs evidence satisfied the actual malice test described in <em>Woodcock </em>v. <em>Journal Publishing Co., </em>supra, 230 Conn. 527, we need not decide whether, in a defamation action such as this one, a plaintiff could prove actual malice to defeat the qualified privilege on some lesser showing of recklessness. See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>206 Conn. 608, 614, 539 A.2d 108 (1988) (defining recklessness); cf. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greenmoss Builders, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 749, 105 S. Ct. 2939, 86 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1985) (first amendment does not invalidate award of damages in defamation action by nonpublic figure against nonmedia defendant involving issue of purely private concern). We also need not decide whether a plaintiff alleging defamation could overcome the qualified privilege without proving actual malice, by proving a lack of good faith on the part of the employer. Compare <em>Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 504 (qualified privilege may be overcome on finding of bad faith or improper motive), <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>supra, 142 Conn. 615 (qualified privilege may be overcome on finding of bad faith), and <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 11 Conn. App. 594-95 and n.8, to 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 600 (1977) (lack of good faith insufficient to defeat privilege; statement must be made with actual knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth), and R. Smolla, supra, \u00a7 15.07 [2] [b] (arguing that, because of importance of frankness in employee review process, privilege protecting such communications should be defeasible only upon proof of actual malice). Finally, we need not decide whether a plaintiff could overcome the qualified privilege without proving actual malice, by proving that the defamatory statement had been published to others not involved in the management or review of employees. See <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 595; see also 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7\u00a7 603 through 605 (1977) (summarizing conditions in which privilege is defeated).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
