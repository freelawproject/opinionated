J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4m\">The sole issue in this appeal i's whether a Connecticut court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant in this action, which challenges the management of a trust by a trustee bank that is incorporated in, and has its principal place of business in, New York. The plaintiffs, Barbara Joan Thomason, Jeffrey Corbett, Marjorie Biddle, Peter Corbett, James Corbett, David Biddle III, Bridget Biddle, Peter Corbett, Jr., and Reilly Corbett, are the beneficiaries of a trust created by Arthur Trowbridge. In a seven count complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, Chemical Bank (trustee bank), violated its trust obligations, was negligent, and engaged in fraud and deceit. The trustee bank filed a timely motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>miss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action was not sufficiently connected to the trustee bank\u2019s activities in this state to establish long arm jurisdiction over the bank pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It therefore granted the motion to dismiss and rendered judgment for the trustee bank. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts. On September 15, 1941, the settlor, Arthur Trowbridge, entered into a trust agreement with the Fulton Trust Company, which was a predecessor of the trustee bank. The settlor created the trust for the benefit of his granddaughter, the named plaintiff, as life tenant, and her issue, the remaining plaintiffs, as remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Although the settlor was a resident of Connecticut at the time the trust was established, the trust agreement was executed in New York and provided that it should be governed by New York law. The settlor also directed that all communications relative to the administration of the trust be addressed to him at his office in New York, rather than at his home in Darien. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Throughout the life of the trust, the assets of the trust have been held and administered in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">After the settlor\u2019s death, officers of the trustee bank held meetings in Connecticut concerning the trust on November 6, 1992, May 20, 1993, and September 10, 1993. Trustee bank officers also held meetings in Connecticut from October, 1981, to September, 1993, concerning other Trowbridge family trusts. At these meetings, the trustee bank was represented by a trust officer and an investment officer. The trustee bank represented that these meetings had been merely informational in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The trustee bank is incorporated in New York, where it has its principal place of business. It has no offices in Connecticut. The trustee bank has, however, placed advertisements in national publications, including Business Week, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, that are distributed in this state. Those advertisements represented, inter alia, that the trustee bank was \u201cnumber one for individuals and small and medium-sized businesses in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with 50% more branches than our nearest competitor.\u201d They also announced that the trustee bank had merged with the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and described the trustee bank as a \u201cbroad-based financial institution\u201d that offered \u201cdepth and breadth of services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In addition to its advertisements in this state, the trustee bank has participated, as mortgagee, in a substantial number of mortgage transactions in this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and has issued credit cards to a substantial number of Connecticut residents. In connection with its credit card business, the trustee bank regularly has sent to Connecticut customers statements that included advertisements for miscellaneous merchandise. At the time the suit was filed, all of the plaintiffs were residents of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On the basis of this evidence, the trial court concluded that the Connecticut long arm statute did not confer jurisdiction over the case. The trial court first determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action did not \u201carisje] . . . [o]ut of [a] contract . . . to be performed in this state\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c) (1); on the ground that a trust is a conveyance rather than a contract. The trial court further determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action did not \u201carisje] . . . out of . . . business solicited in this state\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2); because there was no connection between the trustee bank\u2019s solicitation of business in this state and the establishment of this particular trust by the settlor.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge both of the trial court\u2019s determinations. We conclude that the trial court misinterpreted the statutory phrase \u201carising . . . out of\u201d and therefore construed \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2) too narrowly. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action adequately \u201carisjes] . . . out of . . . business solicited in this state\u201d for purposes of our long arm statute, and because the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the trustee bank is consistent with the constitutional requirements of due process, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The parties agree, as we have previously decided, that a trial court may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>defendant only if the defendant\u2019s intrastate activities meet the requirements both of our statute and of the due process clause of the federal constitution. <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>198 Conn. 243, 252, 502 A.2d 905 (1986); <em>Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>190 Conn. 245, 250, 460 A.2d 481 (1983). The principal focus of this appeal is on the first requirement. Specifically, the parties disagree about the extent to which our statutory formulation of \u201carising . . . out of\u201d imposes limitations on jurisdiction that are substantially greater than those that would be constitutionally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Our existing precedents have addressed, on a case-by-case basis, the question of whether a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is sufficiently connected to \u201cbusiness solicited in this state\u201d by a defendant to fall within the requirements of \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2). We have not, however, undertaken an analytic overview of the relationship between the statute and the constitution to determine how closely a cause of action must be tied to \u201cbusiness solicited in this state\u201d before it may be deemed to \u201caris[e] . . . out of\u201d that business for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Because the legislature\u2019s use of the \u201carising out of\u201d language may reflect, to some extent, the use of similar language in the federal cases decided under the due process clause, it is important first to examine the federal constitutional background against which the statute was enacted. Read in light of that background, the decisions of this court, which have been ratified by recent legislative action, manifest the understanding that our statute uses the term \u201carising out of\u201d in a manner that is distinguishable from its constitutional origins. We are persuaded, furthermore, that a cause of action may be said to \u201caris[e] . . . out of . . . business solicited in this state\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2) even if the \u201cbusiness\u201d forming the basis of the cause of action\u2014in this case, the settlor\u2019s trust account deposit\u2014never was solicited in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We begin our analysis of the \u201carising out of\u201d language in \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2) by reviewing the constitutional framework in which the statute operates. For our purposes, the most significant aspect of the operative constitutional principles is that, although federal constitutional law distinguishes between causes of action that \u201carise out of\u201d the defendant\u2019s forum-directed activities and cases that do not \u201carise out of\u201d such activities, that distinction is not the constitutional touchstone for in personam jurisdiction. As a matter of federal constitutional law, state courts may exercise \u201cspecific\u201d personal jurisdiction over a defendant whenever a cause of action \u201carises out of\u201d the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum. For the purposes of defining \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction, federal courts have construed the words \u201carising out of\u201d to require some sort of causal connection between the defendant\u2019s forum contacts and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Even when the plaintiff cannot prove such a causal connection, however, a state court still may exercise \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction over a defendant who has had sufficiently continuous and systematic overall business contacts with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The federal due process clause permits state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate defendant that has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with [the forum] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316 [66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95] (1945), quoting <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463 [61 S. Ct. 339, 85 L. Ed. 278] (1940).\u201d (Internal quotation marks <em>omitted.) Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 414, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Either \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>or \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction can satisfy the constitutional requirement of sufficient minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum. A state court will have \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant whenever the defendant \u201chas \u2018purposefully directed\u2019 [its] activities at residents of the forum, <em>Keeton </em>v. <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>465 U.S. 770, 774 [104 S. Ct. 1473, 79 L. Ed. 2d 790] (1984), and the litigation [has] resulted] from alleged injuries that <em>\u2018arise out of </em>or relate to\u2019 those activities, <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>[supra, 414].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 472-73, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985). Alternatively, \u201c[e]ven when the cause of action does <em>not arise out of </em>or relate to the foreign corporation\u2019s activities in the forum State, due process is not offended by a State\u2019s subjecting the corporation to its in personam jurisdiction\u201d if the defendant has had \u201ccontinuous and systematic general business contacts\u201d with the state. (Emphasis added.) <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 414, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In the context of \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction, although the United States Supreme Court has required the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action to \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d the defendant\u2019s forum-directed activities, that court has not articulated a standard for what constitutes \u201carising out of.\u201d See <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 589, 111 S. Ct. 1522, 113 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1991) (declining to reach issue despite having certified it for review); <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 415-16 n.10 (declining to reach question). That court has held only that the availability of specific jurisdiction depends on the \u201c \u2018relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 414; <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977). The lower federal courts have held, however, that because of the requirement that the cause of action \u201carise out of\u201d the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum, specific jurisdiction may not be exercised without some causal connection between the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum and the existence of the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit. See, e.g., <em>Dobbs </em>v. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>39 F.3d 1064, 1068 (10th Cir. 1994); <em>United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America </em>v. <em>163 Pleasant Street Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1080, 1088-89 and n.9 (1st Cir. 1992); <em>Sher </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>911 F.2d 1357, 1364 (9th Cir. 1990); see also note, \u201cSpecific Personal Jurisdiction and the \u2018Arise From or Relate To\u2019 Requirement . . . What Does It Mean?\u201d 50 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1265 (1993) (arguing that federal courts have employed two different standards of causation: the \u201cbut-for\u201d test and the \u201csubstantive relevance\u201d test); M. Twitchell, \u201cA Rejoinder to Professor Brilmayer,\u201d 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1465 (1988); L. Brilmayer, \u201cRelated Contacts and Personal Jurisdiction,\u201d 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1444 (1988); M.

Rev. 77.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By contrast, because general juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>diction does not require that the cause of action \u201carise out of\u201d a defendant\u2019s activities, such jurisdiction may be exercised even when there is no causal connection between the defendant\u2019s forum-directed activities and the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit, as long as the defendant has had \u201ccontinuous and systematic general business contacts\u201d with the state. (Emphasis added.) <em>Helicopteros Naciona,les de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 415-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Like the constitutional test that differentiates \u201cspecific\u201d from \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction, \u00a7 33-411 distinguishes between cases that \u201carise out of\u201d a defendant\u2019s forum contacts and cases that do not arise out of such contacts. Unlike the constitution, however, our long arm statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction over only those cases that \u201carise out of\u2019 a defendant\u2019s forum contacts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the words \u201carising out of\u201d in the statute had the same meaning as those words in the constitutional test, the statute would limit our courts to the exercise of \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction and prohibit our courts from exercising any \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction. On the basis of our precedents and confirmatory legislative history, however, we are persuaded that the statute does not entirely preclude the exercise of \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction and that the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d in the statute, unlike that phrase in the constitutional test, does not require a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s forum-directed activities and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Our previous cases interpreting \u00a7 33-411 (c) foreclose the argument that the statute permits only \u201cspecific,\u201d but not \u201cgeneral,\u201d jurisdiction. In <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 249, for example, we concluded that the trial court, which had refused to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to the analogue of \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2), had been \u201cmistaken in requiring a causal connection between evidence of solicitation and the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d We further held that \u00a7 33-411 (c) directs us to inquire \u201cnot only into the various elements of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, spelled out in the various sub-parts of subsection (c), but also into the totality of contacts which the defendant may have with the forum. . . . [I]n enacting \u00a7 33-411 (c). . . the legislature intended to exercise its full constitutional power over foreign corporations in cases falling within one of the designated causes of action. Under [\u00a7 33-411 (c)], consistent with the constitutional demands of due process, it is the totality of the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with this state that must be considered, on a case by case basis, to determine whether the defendant could reasonably have anticipated being haled into court here.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 248-49; accord <em>Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>supra, 190 Conn. 254-55. Our reference to contacts unrelated to the particular cause of action would have relevance only if the statute permits the exercise not only of \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction, but also of \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>These precedents establish, therefore, that the words \u201carising out of\u201d have different meanings in the statutory and constitutional contexts. Although \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2) requires that the cause of action \u201carise out of\u201d a defendant\u2019s contacts with this state, it does not require that the cause of action and the contacts be causally connected. In this case, therefore, the statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction even if the trustee bank\u2019s solicitation in this state was neither the but-for cause nor the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Cf. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manheimer, </em>212 Conn. 748, 757, 563 A.2d 699 (1989) (discussing elements of causation).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We find additional support for this interpretation of the statute in recent actions of the legislature. In 1994, the General Assembly reenacted \u00a7 33-411 (c) as part of a comprehensive revision of our corporations statutes designed to bring those statutes into conformity with the Model Business Corporation Act (Rev. to 1985). See Model Business Corporation Act Task Force, Connecticut Business Corporation Act Final Working Draft (March 3,1994). In response, however, to a comment by the secretary of the state that the long arm provision contained in the Model Act was too \u201cnarrow\u201d and that the language of \u00a7 33-411 (c) should be substituted for it, the legislature specifically incorporated the language of \u00a7 33-411 (c) into the new act. See Public Acts 1994, No. 94-186, \u00a7 193 (e); Model Business Corporation Act Task Force, supra, \u00a7 15.10 (e) and Connecticut Commentary; Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 6, 1994 Sess., p. 2042, para. 37 (comments by office of secretary of the state); compare Substitute House Bill No. 5712, 1994 Sess., \u00a7 193 (e) with House Bill No. 5712,1994 Sess., \u00a7\u00a7 190,192,193. Our broad statutory interpretation therefore is sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ported by both our presumption that the legislature is aware of our previous statutory interpretations when it reenacts a statute; <em>C. R. Klewin, Inc. </em>v. <em>Flagship Properties, Inc., </em>220 Conn. 569, 579, 600 A.2d 772 (1991); <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 626-27, 594 A.2d 464 (1991); <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 134, 527 A.2d 672 (1987); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 156, 148 A.2d 334 (1959); and the express action of the legislature in rejecting a narrower long arm provision. See also <em>Cato </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>226 Conn. 1, 5, 626 A.2d 734 (1993) (interpreting long arm statute regarding actions for dissolution of marriage broadly to effectuate legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">A comprehensive analysis of \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2) must, however, go further than demonstrating that the legislature did not intend to limit the jurisdiction of our state courts only to those cases in which the plaintiffs cause of action has a direct causal relationship to the defendant\u2019s contact points with this state. Our precedents make clear that \u201carising out of\u201d in the statute does not mean the same thing as the \u201carising out of\u201d in the federal constitutional test for \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction. Our precedents also establish, however, that the legislature did not intend to authorize Connecticut courts to exercise the full measure of \u201cgeneral\u201d jurisdiction that would have been constitutionally permissible. It is this latter limitation that we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">If the legislature had meant to allow our courts to exercise the full extent of constitutionally permissible long arm jurisdiction, it could have done so explicitly. The California long arm statute, for example, provides simply that \u201c[a] court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.\u201d Cal. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Proc. Code \u00a7 410.10 (Deering 1991). Other states have followed the California example. See, e.g., Ill. Ann. Stat. c. 735 \u00a7 5/2-209 (c) (Smith-Hurd 1992); R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 9-5-33 (a) (1985); Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 5-1-107 (a) (1992). In comparison, our legislature chose to enact and then to reenact a detailed statute spelling out the various categories of cases out of which the cause of action had to \u201carise\u201d before long arm jurisdiction could be exercised. In the absence of any contrary legislative history, we must assume that these enumerated requirements are purposeful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Kaeser </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>218 Conn. 438, 442-43, 589 A.2d 1229 (1991); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 320, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 98, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); see also 1 R. Casad, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions (2d Ed. 1991) \u00a7 4.01[1][b] (arguing that state legislatures\u2019 use of \u201carising out of\u201d language should be viewed as choice not to grant jurisdiction to full extent permissible under constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Our precedents have interpreted the words \u201carising out of\u201d in \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2) as imposing some constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction that exceed those constraints imposed by the constitution. In <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 248-49, for example, we observed that \u201cin enacting \u00a7 33-411 (c) . . . the legislature intended to exercise its full constitutional power over foreign corporations <em>in cases falling within one of the designated causes of action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We concluded, in that case, that the plaintiffs cause of action had met the statutory requirement because there had been an \u201cadequate connection\u201d between the cause of action and the solicitation of business here. Id., 252.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Most importantly, we always have held that the exercise of long arm jurisdiction in this state requires a two part inquiry: first, whether jurisdiction is permitted by the statute, and second, whether jurisdiction is permitted by the federal constitution. See, e.g., id., 252; <em>Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>supra, 190 Conn. 250. If the statute allowed the exercise of all constitutionally permissible jurisdiction, the first step of this inquiry would not have been necessary. Cf. <em>Cato </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 5 (long arm statute for dissolution actions reaches full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>extent of constitutionally permissible jurisdiction; consolidating statutory and constitutional analysis into single step); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>199 Conn. 287, 292, 507 A.2d 88 (1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The words \u201carising out of\u201d therefore must be interpreted in a manner that reconciles the legislative decision to impose some limits on constitutionally permitted jurisdiction with its decision not to require a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s solicitation here and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit. Our interpretation is as follows. For purposes of \u00a7 33-411 (c) (2), a plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccause of action aris[es] . . . out of . . . business solicited in this state\u201d if, at the time the defendant engaged in solicitation in Connecticut, it was reasonably foreseeable that, as a result of that solicitation, the defendant could be sued in Connecticut by a solicited person on a cause of action similar to that now being brought by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Pursuant to our interpretation of the statute, a plaintiff need not show that, because of the acts of solicitation, the defendant was on notice that it might be sued by the plaintiff himself or herself. A plaintiff similarly need not show that the defendant solicited his or her business in Connecticut. A plaintiff need only demonstrate that the defendant could reasonably have anticipated being haled into court here by <em>some person who had been solicited </em>in Connecticut and that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is not materially different from an action that might have resulted directly from that solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">This interpretation of the statute is consistent with both of the principles we have discussed. On the one hand, because the statute does not demand proof that a particular plaintiff\u2019s business was solicited in Connecticut, the statute does not require proof of a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the solicitation and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. On the other hand, because the statute does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>demand proof that a particular plaintiffs cause of action is similar to a cause of action that could have been brought here by a person whose business the defendant did solicit, the statute is more restrictive than the federal constitutional test for general jurisdiction, under which this state could have elected to exercise jurisdiction over causes of action wholly unrelated to the defendant\u2019s conduct in this forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We now apply the relevant statutory and constitutional tests to the facts of this case. We conclude that both the statute and the constitution permit the exercise of long arm jurisdiction over the trustee bank, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Section 33-411 (c) provides that \u201c[ejvery foreign corporation shall be subject to suit in this state, by a resident of this state . . . on any cause of action arising ... (2) out of any business solicited in this state by mail or otherwise if the corporation has repeatedly so solicited business . . . .\u2019\u2019As discussed above, for purposes of the statute, the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action \u201caris[esj . . . out of\u201d the business solicited in this state as long as the trustee bank reasonably could have foreseen at the time of its solicitations here that it might be sued by a solicited person on a cause of action similar to that brought by the plaintiffs. The record in this case establishes both that the cause of action \u201caris[esj . . . out of\u201d business solicited here, as we have defined that term, and that the corporation repeatedly has so solicited business.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">The following undisputed facts of record satisfy the statutory requirement that the cause of action \u201carisefsj . . . out of . . . business solicited in this state. . . .\u201d The trustee bank placed numerous print advertise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ments in newspapers and magazines that had substantial circulations in this state. The advertisements specifically encouraged Connecticut residents to place a wide variety of banking business with the trustee bank. For example, the advertisements represented that the bank had merged with the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, that the bank was the \u201cnumber one bank\u201d for Connecticut businesses and individuals, and that the bank was a \u201cbroad-based financial institution.\u201d At the time the trustee bank placed the advertisements, therefore, it was foreseeable that one or more Connecticut residents would respond to the advertisements by opening a trust account with the trustee bank and thereafter would sue in Connecticut for the misadministration of that trust. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is similar to one that foreseeably could have been brought as a result of the trustee bank\u2019s solicitation here, the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action adequately satisfies the statutory \u201carising out of\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Moreover, the trustee bank \u201crepeatedly so solicited business\u201d in this state. In addition to the advertisements directed here, the bank has performed a substantial number of mortgage transactions in this state and has a large credit card business here. Like the activities of the defendant hospital in <em>Frazer, </em>the trustee bank\u2019s activities can be characterized as \u201caffirmative measures designed to attract Connecticut\u201d customers in that they constitute the creation of \u201can organizational network that is likely to prompt a significant number of Connecticut\u201d residents to place business with the bank. <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 251, 251-52. The trustee bank reasonably could foresee that, by advertising here, providing credit cards and taking mortgages from Connecticut residents, it would develop customer relationships that would lead to a wide range of banking business with those customers. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>It is of no moment that the trustee bank\u2019s acts of solicitation in Connecticut substantially postdate the creation of the particular trust that is the subject of this lawsuit. The relevant inquiry under the statute is not whether the trustee bank could have foreseen its amenability to suit in Connecticut by the plaintiffs when it accepted the settlor\u2019s business, but whether it could have foreseen its amenability to suit in Connecticut by persons raising claims similar to those of the plaintiffs when it solicited those persons\u2019 business in Connecticut. Jurisdiction may be exercised pursuant to \u00a7 33-411 even though the defendant was not reasonably able to foresee the exercise of such jurisdiction at the time that it engaged in the activities that make it subject to the statute. See <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel </em>Co., 157 Conn. 92, 98, 249 A.2d 58 (1968) (approving exercise of long arm jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 33-411 even though acts of defendant that made it subject to statute had occurred before statute was enacted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u201cOnce it is determined that there is an adequate connection between the [defendant\u2019s] act of solicitation and the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 [33-411] (c) (2), the long-arm statute authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction if such an exercise comports with the principles of due process.\u201d <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 252. On the facts of record in this case, we are persuaded that the trial court constitutionally may exercise general jurisdiction over the trustee bank.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Although the trustee bank has no offices in this state, it conducts a substantial credit card business here, regularly solicits general banking business here and holds title (as mortgagee) to a substantial amount of real property in Fairfield county.

All of those courts, however, have based their conclusion on the fact that the specific jurisdiction test merely requires that the cause of action \u201carise out of <em>or relate to\" </em>the defendant\u2019s forum-directed activities. (Emphasis added.) See, e.g., <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 426-27 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (reaching issue deferred by majority; arguing that court should distinguish between \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201crelating to\u201d requirements); <em>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alioto, </em>26 F.3d 201,206-207 (1st Cir. 1994) (discussing distinction without employing it); cf. L. Brilmayer, supra, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1444 (criticizing such distinction). Thus, even if the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tional test for specific jurisdiction does not require a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum and the lawsuit, it is only because that test contains not only the \u201carising out of\u2019 language, but also the \u201crelating to\u201d language. If the constitutional test employed only the \u201carising out of\u2019 language, a causal connection would be required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\"> All aspects of our long arm statute restrict the exercise of jurisdiction to cases that \u201carise out of\u2019 a defendant\u2019s forum contacts. For example, \u00a7 33-411 (b) provides that \u201c[ejvery foreign corporation which transacts business in this state in violation of section 33-395 or 33-396 shall be subject to suit in this state upon any cause of action <em>arising out </em>o/such business.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> The same precedents preclude the inference that the legislature used the words \u201carising out of\u201d in order to distinguish, for purposes of the constitutional test for specific jurisdiction, between cases that \u201carise out of\u201d a defendant\u2019s contacts and cases that merely \u201crelate to\u201d those contacts. See footnote 4. If the phrases have different purposes in the constitutional test, it is apparently because the \u201carising out of\u201d phrase requires a causal connection between the lawsuit and the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum, but the \u201crelating to\u201d phrase does not require such a eausal connection. See footnote 4. As already noted, however, our statute does not require a causal connection between the lawsuit and the defendant\u2019s forum-directed activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ties. Thus, the use of \u201carising out of\u201d in our statute cannot have been intended to limit our courts to exercising only a portion of otherwise permissible specific jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> The legislative history on this point is not particularly helpful. Section 33-411 (c) originally was enacted in 1959 as part of the comprehensive revisions to the corporations code. Almost all of the other corporations code revisions enacted at that time, including the language in \u00a7 33-411 (a) and (e), were taken from recommendations made by a special legislative task force. See Connecticut Commission on Revision of the Corporation Laws, Proposed Revision of Stock and Foreign Corporation Laws (1958) \u00a7 J-9. The language now contained in \u00a7 33-411 (c), however, did not appear in the commission\u2019s recommendations. See id. We have been unable to determine how that language came to be incorporated in the bill introduced into the legislature; Substitute Senate Bill No. 329,1959 Sess., \u00a7 131; that eventually was enacted. Furthermore, we have been unable to locate any committee testimony or floor debate that sheds light on the 1959 legislative intent in using the \u201carising out of\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The 1994 legislative history demonstrates that the legislature reenacted the language of \u00a7 33-411 (c) because it believed the long arm provision of the Model Business Corporation Act to be too narrow. See part IB of this opinion. We have been unable to locate any committee testimony or floor debate, however, that specifically discusses the meaning of the \u201carising out of\u201d language or discusses whether the language of \u00a7 33-411 (c) reached the full extent of constitutionally permissible jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> In <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 251, we concluded that the defendant hospital, which was located in Rhode Island, had \u201csolicited business\u201d in Connecticut in that it had granted admitting privileges to physicians, including the plaintiffs physician, who were licensed to practice in Connecticut. We further concluded that the plaintiffs cause of action had \u201carisen\u201d from business solicited in Connecticut on the basis of the following analysis: \u201cThe named plaintiffs cause of action in this case arose from repeated solicitation conducted by [the defendant] Hospital through the use of such a network. [The named plaintiffs doctor] treated the named plaintiff in Connecticut and arranged for him to enter [the defendant] Hospital by exercising his admitting privileges there. It was during this hospitalization that the allegedly tortious conduct that forms the basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 suit occurred. The hospital was aware that the named plaintiff\u2019s doctor maintained offices in Connecticut. Indeed, it appointed him to its medical staff only after he had received his license to practice medicine in this state.\u201d Id., 252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> In light of our disposition of this case, we need not decide whether the trustee bank \u201chas \u2018purposefully directed\u2019 [its] activities at residents of the forum . . . and the litigation [has] resulted] from alleged injuries that \u2018arise out of or relate to\u2019 those activities\u201d; <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz, </em>supra, 471 U.S. 472; such that the trial court also may exercise specific jurisdiction over the case.
