Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53a-46b and which resulted in a homicide conviction, following a plea or trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The defendant argues that this expanded universe of cases is necessary to enable this court to evaluate his claim that race has an impermissible effect on capital sentencing decisions in Connecticut, rendering the imposition of the death penalty upon him disproportionate under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The defendant argues in his motion that \u201cbecause of the fundamental distinction between the death penalty and all other punishments, there is a \u2018corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\u2019 \u201d Further, the defendant argues that \u201cproportionality review is one of the critical measures adopted by the Connecticut legislature to help achieve such reliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The defendant accordingly seeks to expand the universe of cases in order to present evidence that the death penalty scheme has been disproportionately applied to black defendants or to defendants whose victims were white.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues that \u201cthe pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>liminary evidence of racial . . . disparities in the administration of the death penalty in Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>presents a genuine risk that <em>the death penalty scheme in this State is tainted by impermissible considerations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In setting out the defendant\u2019s claim, it is useful to make explicit what the defendant does not claim. The defendant does not claim that either the federal or the state constitution requires that the universe of cases for purposes of proportionality review pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) include the class of cases that he seeks to have us include. Thus, we are not faced with a constitutional claim in passing on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Moreover, the defendant does not claim that the type of appellate review of a death sentence that he seeks to have us perform could not be conducted pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), which provides for setting aside such a sentence if we were to determine that it \u201cwas the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Indeed, the defendant\u2019s proportionality review counsel; see footnote 1; asserts that he brings this motion under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) because the defendant\u2019s other appellate counsel do not intend to raise such a claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1). The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, is that, independent of the state constitution, federal constitution or \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) requires, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that we expand the universe of cases for purposes of proportionality review to include the class of cases that he has identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The state posits four arguments in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to expand the universe of cases. The state argues that: (1) the defendant\u2019s motion is not in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 4066A (b) because it does not \u201cidentify the additional case or cases claimed to be similar and set forth . . . the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant involved\u201d; (2) this court has already rejected, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>225 Conn. 559, 561, 624 A.2d 886 (1993) <em>(Ross I),</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a claim nearly identical to that of the defendant in this case, and this court should adhere to that decision; (3) practical considerations militate against granting the defendant\u2019s motion because it would require an evidentiary hearing to determine which cases could have been charged as capital felonies, and a hearing to determine the significance of the statistical evidence revealed by such a hearing; and (4) the defendant\u2019s motion is based on a legally insufficient federal constitutional claim, and therefore it should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We conclude that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, proportionality review pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) does not contemplate the type of inquiry that would be necessitated by the defendant\u2019s motion. We also conclude that the type of appellate claim presented by the defendant in his motion under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) is more appropriately presented under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), provided that it is based on a proper, preexisting trial record. Lastly, we conclude that, despite the defendant\u2019s failure to raise this claim at trial and, therefore, to have created a proper trial record, he will be permitted to raise it by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>after appeal, if the ultimate disposition of his direct appeal in this case renders his claim still viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We first address the state\u2019s claim that we should deny the defendant\u2019s motion because it does not comply with the requirements of the Practice Book. The state argues that the defendant\u2019s motion did not identify the additional cases claimed to be similar and did not set forth the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant involved as required by Practice Book \u00a7 4066A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We reject this claim. The defendant\u2019s motion, by definition, cannot comply with \u00a7 4066A. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>requests that he be given an opportunity to identify those cases that would be relevant to proportionality review of his death sentence, and to create a record sufficient to support his claim. Although strict adherence to the requirements of \u00a7 4066A in this case would defeat the defendant\u2019s motion, we decline to rest our decision on those requirements because of the serious nature of the defendant\u2019s claim. Thus, notwithstanding its procedural deficiencies, we consider the defendant\u2019s motion on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We next address the state\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s request in this case is virtually identical to the application that was considered and rejected in <em>Ross I,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that our decision in <em>Ross I </em>controls this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>motion. The defendant counters that our decision in <em>Ross I </em>\u201cdid not address\u2014and did not foreclose\u2014the claim presented here that expansion of the proportionality universe is necessary to enable the court to assess whether Connecticut\u2019s capital punishment scheme is impermissibly influenced by racial considerations.\u201d Our review of the <em>Ross </em>motion, however, reveals that, in fact, the issue was squarely before this court by virtue of the claims contained in that motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result, our decision in that case impliedly rejected the claim presented here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nonetheless, because the published opinion did not address directly the claim that racial considerations impermissibly taint the administration of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty scheme, we decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>rely on our opinion in <em>Ross I </em>in resolving the issues presented by the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">We turn, therefore, to the merits of the question presented by the defendant\u2019s motion, namely, whether as a matter of statutory construction, \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) contemplates the universe of cases proposed by the defendant. The merits of the defendant\u2019s motion must be viewed in the light cast by the history of the concept of proportionality review within the context of capital punishment jurisprudence. In <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision effectively invalidating our capital punishment statute because it provided the sentencing jury with no clear, objective guidelines and virtually unlimited discretion in imposing a death sentence. In 1976, the United States Supreme Court examined several states\u2019 revised death penalty statutes. All of these statutes provided for automatic appeal of death sentences. Georgia\u2019s statute required the reviewing court, to some extent at least, to determine whether, considering both the crime and the defendant, the sentence was disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. In some states, such as Florida, the appellate court performed proportionality review despite the absence of a statutory requirement. Others, such as California and Texas, conducted no proportionality review whatsoever. The United States Supreme Court, without explicitly addressing the question of proportionality review, concluded that each of these states\u2019 capital punishment schemes was constitutional. See <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S. Ct. 2950, 49 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1976); <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S. Ct. 2960, 49 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1976); <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Nonetheless, until 1984, it was generally believed that any capital punishment statute that did not provide for proportionality review was constitutionally vulnerable. Therefore, in 1980, when our legislature enacted \u00a7 53a-46b, which for the first time provided for appellate review, including proportionality review, of all death sentences, the then House of Representatives chairman of the legislature\u2019s Judiciary Committee described the proposed bill as \u201cclarifying] our existing death penalty law without any expansion of it or retraction from it .... It also mandates that there be an automatic review by the Connecticut Supreme Court in order to affirm any death sentence which may be imposed on anybody. <em>Most of those standards we feel would put the existing statutes within compliance with the United States Constitutional standards.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1980 Sess., p. 2768, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Thereafter, in 1984, the United States Supreme Court explicitly concluded that \u201c[t]here is ... no basis in our cases for holding that comparative proportionality review by an appellate court is required in every case in which the death penalty is imposed and the defendant requests it. Indeed, to so hold would effectively overrule <em>Jurek </em>and would substantially depart from the sense of <em>Gregg </em>and <em>Proffitt. </em>We are not persuaded that the Eighth Amendment requires us to take that course.\u201d <em>Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>465 U.S. 37, 50-51, 104 S. Ct. 871, 79 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Although proportionality review is not constitutionally required, the statutory requirement to conduct such review remains applicable to the defendant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>The defendant\u2019s motion presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 512, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>[226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993)]; see <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 852-57, 633 A.2d 305 (1993). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici v. Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431-32, 650 A.2d 557 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The question before us, therefore, is whether the legislature intended to include the defendant\u2019s requested expanded universe of cases in our determination of whether the defendant\u2019s \u201csentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). In light of the language of the statute, its legislative history, and the historical and jurisprudential context in which it was enacted, we conclude that the legislature did not intend proportionality review to encompass a comparison with all homicide cases prosecuted since 1973 in which a capital felony could have been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We begin our analysis with the language of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). This section provides that the sentence of death shall be affirmed unless \u201cthe sentence is excessive or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.\u201d Although the statute does not define what the legislature intended to be included as \u201csimilar cases\u201d for comparison purposes, the language used strongly suggests an individualized process of comparison among cases in which the defendant has been convicted of a capital felony and in which the sentencer either has or has not imposed the death penalty. The statute contemplates a process of comparing the circumstances of one particular crime and the character and record of one particular defendant with the particular circumstances of other particular crimes committed by other particular defendants. The phrases \u201csimilar cases,\u201d \u201ccircumstances of the crime,\u201d and \u201ccharacter and record of the defendant\u201d are strongly suggestive of a process of particularized comparison. As we stated in <em>Ross I, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 562-63, \u201c[u]nder the express provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a and 53a-46a, only conviction of a capital felony . . . occasions a hearing into mitigating and aggravating factors to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed. Only conviction of a capital felony will put on the record the circumstances that are relevant to the proportionality review mandated by \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The language of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) is consistent, therefore, with a particularized case-by-case comparison of the defendant\u2019s sentence of death with those other cases in which other defendants were convicted of capital felonies. The language is inconsistent, however, with a comparison of the entire decision-making process engaged in by all the relevant actors in all homicide cases prosecuted since 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), moreover, supports the conclusion that the statute does not contemplate the kind of universe advocated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>defendant, which would necessarily be accompanied by detailed, complex fact-finding. See, e.g., <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>580 F. Sup. 338 (N.D. Ga. 1984), aff d sub nom. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Proportionality review, as required by \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), was enacted in 1980 as part of Public Acts 1980, No. 80-332, which addressed the entire issue of appellate review of death sentences.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The sparse legislative history attending Public Acts 1980, No. 80-332, did not mention proportionality review explicitly, and indicated only that \u201c[m]ost of those standards [of appellate review of death sentences] we feel would put the existing statutes within compliance with the United States Constitutional standards.\u201d 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1980 Sess., p. 2768, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano. The absence from this history of any legislative indication of an intent to require the <em>McCleskey </em>kind of extraordinary fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>finding as part of the appellate process in this court supports our conclusion that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) to include the defendant\u2019s posited expanded universe of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In general, \u201c[i]t is the function of the trial court, not this court, to find facts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>189 Conn. 360, 363, 456 A.2d 272 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>184 Conn. 455, 458, 440 A.2d 166 (1981); <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 38, 440 A.2d 782 (1981). Imposing a fact-finding function on this court, therefore, would be contrary to generally established law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cWe will not infer that the legislature intended to enact a significant change in existing law without an unequivocally expressed manifestation of legislative intent. <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 66, 566 A.2d 670 (1989) (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 699, 719, 638 A.2d 589 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We agree with the state that granting the defendant\u2019s motion would require a factual inquiry into the nature and circumstances of every case since 1973 that ended in a homicide conviction in order to determine whether that case could have been charged as a capital felony. Because the defendant seeks to include those cases that could have been, but were not, prosecuted as capital felonies, we would be required to review the prosecutorial discretion exercised in every case since 1973 in which the facts might have indicated that the death penalty could have been sought, and to determine whether the case could have been subject to a capital felony prosecution. As the Nebraska Supreme Court noted in analyzing its own proportionality review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>statute:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cIn examining prosecutorial discretion we would of necessity have to independently gather evidence. ... We would then determine what charges we think should have been filed. . . .We would make a judgment about the chances of a conviction as against an acquittal. . . . [And, w]e would need to weigh the advisability of a plea bargain to secure a conviction on a lesser charge in order to avoid a likely acquittal of all charges.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>224 Neb. 282, 325, 399 N.W.2d 706 (1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 872, 108 S. Ct. 206, 98 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Furthermore, after that expanded universe of cases had been determined, a full evidentiary hearing would be required to consider the statistical evidence and methodology offered by the defendant. This court would then, by way of fact-finding, be required to adjudicate the statistical validity of that evidence and methodology. Cf. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>supra, 580 F. Sup. 338.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The recognition that the entire process of fact-finding is normally outside of our jurisdiction, and that the fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>finding that would likely be engendered by the defendant\u2019s motion is detailed and complex, counsel strongly against reading \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) so as to require such a process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Before we were to read a statute so as to impose such a fact-finding process on this court, we should require a clear indication of legislative intent to do so. The total absence from either the language or the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) of <em>any </em>indication of such an intent, let alone a clear indication thereof, leads us to conclude that the legislature did not so intend.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Our conclusion accords with the jurisprudence of the overwhelming majority of states that have capital felony statutes. The defendant\u2019s concession that \u201cthe universe which he proposes is the minority rule,\u201d is a generous characterization of the status of the requested universe. At present, only the Pennsylvania Supreme Court conducts the type of data gathering that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>defendant requests. That court noted that \u201c[w]hile the Sentencing Code does not define \u2018similar cases\u2019 nor set forth any specific procedures for conducting this proportionality review, this Court conducts an independent evaluation of all cases of murder of the first degree convictions which were prosecuted or could have been prosecuted under the [death penalty statutes].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>504 Pa. 428, 443, 475 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 963, 105 S. Ct. 360, 83 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1984). In order to facilitate this review, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \u201cordered the President Judge of each county to supply to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (the AOPC) information pertaining to each such conviction and imposed a continuing obligation on the President Judges to update the AOPC with data pertaining to future cases. This information includes the facts and circumstances of the crimes, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances arguably presented by the evidence, the gender and race of the defendant and the victim, and other information pertaining to the conduct and prosecution of the case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court maintains such records, there is no indication that it engages in the type of proportionality review suggested by the defendant\u2019s motion in this case. Instead, that court compares the factual scenario in the defendant\u2019s case to factual scenarios in other cases. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>supra, 504 Pa. 443, for example, the extent of the court\u2019s proportionality review was as follows: \u201cWe have reviewed the information compiled by the AOPC and conclude therefrom that the sentence of death imposed in the instant case is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalties imposed in \u2018similar cases\u2019, i.e. \u2018contract killing\u2019 cases.\u201d Significantly, although the court gathers information on the race of the victim and the race of the defendant, in no instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>under proportionality review, has it engaged in statistical analysis of the effect of those factors on the imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The remaining states that conduct proportionality review do so with a significantly narrower universe of cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, there is no persuasive authority in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>jurisdiction to support the defendant\u2019s claim that proportionality should, or was intended to, include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>within its universe of cases those cases that could have been charged as capital felonies but were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The defendant, as does the dissent in this case, relies principally on the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>pretation of its prel992 proportionality review statute. Thus, the defendant offers New Jersey as a model for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>conducting our proportionality review. We agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court that \u201c[h]ow detailed a compilation of homicide cases is required to facilitate an adequate proportionality review of a given death sentence depends on the purposes to be served by that review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>130 N.J. 109, 132, 613 A.2d 1059 (1992). Unlike that court, however, we reject the conclusion under our proportionality review statute that \u201cthe purposes to be achieved by proportionality review require that the universe include clearly death eligible homicides in which the prosecutor elected not to seek the death penalty.\u201d Id., 137. Two factors persuade us not to follow the lead of New Jersey in interpreting our proportionality review statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">First, the New Jersey Supreme Court, in reaching its conclusion, was interpreting a statutory scheme significantly different from ours, because it contained no analog to our \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1). New Jersey Statutes \u00a7 2C:ll-3 e., as it stood at the time of the cases upon which the defendant relies, provided: \u201cEvery judgment of conviction which results in a sentence of death under this section shall be appealed, pursuant to the Rules of Court, to the Supreme Court. Upon the request of the defendant, the Supreme Court shall also determine whether the sentence is disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. In any instance in which the defendant fails, or refuses to appeal, the appeal shall be taken by the Office of the Public Defender or other counsel appointed by the Supreme Court for that pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>pose.\u201d Thus, the New Jersey death penalty statutory scheme contained no explicit provision, other than proportionality review, pursuant to which a defendant who sought to pursue a claim of systemic racial bias could proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Our statutory scheme, by contrast, provides, in addition to proportionality review under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), which is essentially the same as that of New Jersey, that this court \u201cshall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that: (1) The sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b). Thus, as we explicitly hold in this case, our scheme does provide a statutory mechanism by which a defendant may raise such a claim based upon an adequate factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Second, New Jersey has, subsequently, legislatively overruled the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of its proportionality review statute; In 1992, New Jersey amended that statute specifically to limit the universe of cases for proportionality review to a \u201ccomparison of similar cases <em>in which a sentence of death has been imposed </em>. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:11-3 e. The legislative history of this amendment indicates that it occurred, in part, because of the failure of the court-ordered proportionality review; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramseur, </em>106 N.J. 123, 327, 524 A.2d 188 (1987); to establish a proper and workable universe of cases. Testifying in favor of the proposed bill before the New Jersey Judiciary, Law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Public Safety Committee, New Jersey Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo stated that three years after the proportionality review imposed by the New Jersey Supreme Court had begun, in spite of considerable resources dedicated to the project, the universe of cases to be considered in conducting proportionality review still had not been defined. Public Hearing before New Jersey Assembly Judiciary, Law and Public Safety Committee (January 31,1991) p. 3, remarks of Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo. Del Tufo also argued against a universe that includes \u201call homicide cases which could have been prosecuted as death penalty cases under [the] current law, regardless of whether they were so prosecuted. The expansive review system envisioned by this universe of cases would add an unnecessary, complex, second stage to judicial review of death sentences, which would further delay an interminably long and oft-criticized appellate procedure. Once an additional appeal ... is exhausted . . . the review process would then begin anew with wholesale reevaluation and veto power over the prior decisions of prosecutors, judges, and juries. Such a back-to-square-one revisitation of capital prosecutions could further frustrate enforcement of the death penalty . . . .\u201d Id., pp. 5-6. Del Tufo also argued that the process contemplated by the New Jersey Supreme Court would be \u201cuncertain, unreliable, and ultimately futile.\u201d Id., p. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Our conclusion on this motion that the defendant\u2019s challenge may not be brought under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) does not foreclose the possibility that the defendant may mount such an attack in other ways. As both the state and the defendant agree, he could have proceeded pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), claiming that the statistical analysis he seeks to establish demonstrates that his death sentence was the product of \u201cprejudice or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>other arbitrary factor.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Alternatively, he may have a remedy by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Even under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), however, it would have been necessary for the defendant to have made his statistical record in the trial court, and to have subjected it to a full evidentiary hearing, as in <em>McCleskey, </em>before presenting it on appeal. To hold that he could raise this claim on appeal under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), without having first created an adequate factual basis in the trial court, would be incorrect for many of the same reasons that we reject his claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), because it would assume, without any clear indication, that the legislature intended this court to engage in the same extraordinary process of data gathering and fact-finding. Thus, both subdivision (1) and subdivision (3) of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) ordinarily contemplate not data gathering and fact-finding by or under the aegis of this court from disputed evidence, which the defendant\u2019s claim would require, but evaluation by this court of the trial court record of the case on appeal, and with respect to subdivision (3), of the trial court records of similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Moreover, even though the defendant has not created a trial record in this case that would permit him to present, in his direct appeal, his statistical claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), we conclude that he should be permitted to do so by way of a postappeal habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>petition, if the ultimate disposition of his direct appeal renders his claim still viable. Although ordinarily habeas corpus cannot serve as a surrogate for a claim that could have been presented on direct appeal; see <em>Summerville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 397, 419, 641 A.2d 1356 (1994); <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 568, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988); we conclude that, with respect to the claim that the defendant seeks to present by this motion, he should not be bound by that principle because the scope and meaning of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) have remained uncertain and, until now, have been the subject of only one published decision of this court, namely <em>Ross I.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Furthermore, the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim of systemic racial bias, and the seriousness and finality of the death penalty, counsel against raising any undue procedural barriers to review of such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., and Callahan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Berdon, J., with whom Norcott and Katz, Js., join, dissenting. The defendant, Sedrick H. Cobb, is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>African-American male who was sentenced to death for the murder of a white female.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before this court is the defendant\u2019s appeal of his convictions and the mandatory, statutory review of his sentence of death. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He now moves for this court to enlarge the class of cases that we should consider in determining whether his sentence of death was proportionate to the penalty that has been iinposed on other defendants in \u201csimilar cases.\u201d By doing so, he argues, he will be able to demonstrate that, in Connecticut, the race of the defendant and the race of the victim impermissibly influence the decision of whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>criminal defendant is sentenced to death. I would grant the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Section 53a-46b (b) (3) requires this court to overturn a sentence of death if we find that \u201cthe sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in <em>similar cases, </em>considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 4066A (b) limits this class of \u201csimilar cases\u201d to only those capital felony cases that (1) have been prosecuted in this state since October 1, 1973, and (2) have resulted in conviction and proceeded to a hearing on whether the penalty of death should be imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>225 Conn. 559, 561, 624 A.2d 886 (1993) <em>(Ross I),</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court indicated that, in addition to this category of \u201csimilar cases,\u201d it also is appropriate to consider \u201cany case in which a capital felony conviction has been obtained and the conviction was followed not by a hearing on the imposition of the death penalty but by an imposition of a sentence other than death . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The defendant in this case, through the special public defender appointed to represent him on that portion of his appeal that involves the proportionality of his sentence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has supplied this court with data that, in my view, requires us again to expand the universe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>of similar cases to which we look in determining whether a death sentence is proportionate. In sum, the defendant argues that this court also should consider those cases arising since October 1,1973, that represent \u201chomicide convictions in Connecticut in which a capital felony could have been charged.\u201d This, of course, would include as \u201csimilar cases\u201d those homicides that were not prosecuted as capital felonies as a result of prosecutorial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In support of his motion, the defendant cites disturbing preliminary data, the accuracy of which the state does not challenge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, the data indicates that of all the defendants who have been charged with capital felony, African-American defendants have been convicted twice as often\u2014and, therefore, have been subjected to the death penalty twice as often\u2014as defendants who are not African-American.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, if a defendant who is not African-American is charged with capital felony, there is a 200 percent greater chance that the jury will return a verdict of not guilty on that charge, and therefore not subject him to the death penalty, than if the defendant is African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Second, the data indicates that the death penalty is more likely to be imposed if the victim of the crime was white or otherwise not African-American. The defendant points to several specific instances:</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">(1) Those defendants who murder African-Americans are substantially less likely to be charged with capital felony and, consequently, substantially less likely to be subject to the death penalty, than those defendants who murder persons who are not African-Americans.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">(2) None of the defendants now on death row was sentenced to death for the murder of an African-American, although 40 percent of those persons murdered in this state since 1976 have been African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">(3) Of the twenty-eight cases in which a person was convicted of capital felony, only four, or 14 percent, have involved a victim who was African-American. As indicated previously, however, 40 percent of murder victims since 1976 have been African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">(4) Of the eighteen cases that have proceeded to the \u201cdeath penalty phase\u201d hearing, only one, or 5.5 percent, involved a victim who was African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">(5) If the victim was an African-American, those defendants who are accused of kidnapping and murder-two of the specific crimes of which the defendant in this case was convicted\u2014will not be charged with capital felony, and therefore will not be subject to the death penalty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>(6) Similarly, if the victim was an African-American, those defendants who are accused of sexual assault and murder\u2014also two of the specific crimes of which the defendant in this case was convicted\u2014will very rarely be charged with capital felony, and therefore will very rarely be subject to the death penalty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The significance of the capital felony data brought forward by the defendant may be summarized as follows. If the defendant is an African-American, he is more likely to receive the death penalty than if he were white. If the victim is white, a defendant also is more likely to receive the death penalty. If the defendant is an African-American and the victim is white, the defendant is highly more likely to receive the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Although the accuracy of the data is not challenged, the state and the defendant both recognize that it is preliminary and that additional research, as well as mathematical analysis, must be conducted in order to determine whether these results are statistically significant. The defendant states, however, that an expanded proportionality universe including all capital eligible homicides will reveal \u201cstartling information about the effect of the race of the defendant and the race of the victim on death penalty outcomes in Connecticut which calls into question whether the death penalty scheme has been proportionately applied to [African-American] defendants or to defendants whose victims were white.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">If the defendant is correct, the inevitable conclusion is that the state places a higher value on the life of a white person than on the life of an African-American. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Such a capital system\u2014in which a person\u2019s race is more likely than not a factor in whether that person lives or dies\u2014cannot withstand proportionality review under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). Indeed, it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. The Supreme Court of the United States has made clear that if there is even a \u201crisk\u201d that racial prejudice has tainted the capital sentencing process, the defendant must be provided an opportunity to ferret out that evidence. \u201cThe risk of racial prejudice infecting a capital sentencing proceeding is especially serious in light of the complete finality of the death sentence. The Court, as well as the separate opinions of a majority of the individual Justices, has recognized that the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination. ... We have struck down capital sentences when we found that the circumstances under which they were imposed created an unacceptable risk that the death penalty [may have been] meted out arbitrarily or capriciously or through whim . . . or mistake.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>476 U.S. 28, 35-36, 36-37, 106 S. Ct. 1683, 90 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1986) (holding \u201cthat a capital defendant accused of an interracial crime is entitled to have prospective jurors informed of the race of the victim and questioned on the issue of racial bias\u201d). Indeed, the state concedes that if the defendant is correct, and if reliable statistics demonstrate that defendants are being subjected to the death penalty on the basis of their race, the death penalty system would be \u201cunconstitutional as applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Nevertheless, the prevailing justices<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> reject the defendant\u2019s motion. They conclude, as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>statutory construction, that the defendant cannot raise issues of racial bias under proportionality review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They also conclude that this court is not an appropriate forum in which to conduct a factual inquiry of the type urged by the defendant. I disagree with both rationales.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In order to construe the scope of proportionality review, it is necessary to begin with the plain language of the relevant statute. \u201cThis court has consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>stated that [i]f the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature and there is no room for judicial construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/ Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 395, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). The statute that empowers this court to review the proportionality of a defendant\u2019s sentence of death is clear and unambiguous. \u201cThe supreme court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that... (3) the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The prevailing justices contend that the plain language of proportionality under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) contemplates <em>only </em>\u201can individualized process of comparison among cases in which the defendant has been convicted of a capital felony and in which the sentencer either has or has not imposed the death penalty. The statute contemplates a process of comparing the circumstances of one particular crime and the character and-record of one particular defendant with the particular circumstances of other particular crimes committed by other particular defendants.\u201d The prevailing justices do not discuss any other alternatives that fall clearly within the purview of the plain language of the statute, suggesting that there are none.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although I agree that one segment of proportionality review requires a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>parison between the sentence imposed on the defendant and the sentences imposed on other defendants who have been convicted of capital felonies, I do not agree that this is the sole comparison, nor the most important comparison, that is required by the clear language of the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">\u201cA court should accord a statutory enactment its plain meaning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 341, 636 A.2d 782 (1994). \u201cWhere a statute . . . does not define a term, it is appropriate to focus upon its common understanding as expressed in the law and upon its dictionary meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AirKaman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>221 Conn. 751, 756-57, 607 A.2d 410 (1992). Section 53a-46b (b) (3) requires this court to determine whether the defendant\u2019s sentence of death is \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d or not proportionate. The word \u201cproportion\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> means \u201cthe relation of one part to another or <em>to the whole </em>with respect to magnitude, quantity, or degree ... [a] harmonious relation of parts to each other or to the whole . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Thus, the plain language of the statute allows a defendant to compare himself or herself to persons in similarly situated groups in order to determine whether the sentence imposed is proportionate not only as to other individuals, but to the group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>as a whole. Unless one is willing to say that cases are dissimilar merely because of the race of the victim, or because of the race of the defendant, cases in which the penalties differ on the basis of race must be considered during proportionality review.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The interpretation suggested by the prevailing justices leads to a bizarre result. According to that interpretation, this court, in considering whether a sentence of death is \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d should look only at other individual defendants who have been convicted of capital felonies. Yet it is the contention of the defendant that, as a result of systemic racial bias, the individuals who comprise that class are disproportionately African-American. If the defendant is correct, the interpretation offered by the prevailing justices would not reveal this disproportionality, because that interpretation would compare an African-American defendant\u2019s sentence only with the sentences imposed on other African-Americans who similarly were victims of racial discrimination. The reasoning of the prevailing justices would lead to the conclusion that a sentence of death for an African-American defendant satisfies the test of proportionality even if the <em>only </em>persons sentenced to death or convicted of capital felonies are African-Americans. \u201cWe cannot presume that the legislature intended to create such a bizarre result, but intended a sensible statutory construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>189 Conn. 671, 679, 458 A.2d 362 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 563, 429 A.2d 960 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Nevertheless, the state and the prevailing justices contend that there are other adequate procedural vehicles that the defendant can use to raise such claims. The state, for example, contends that the first subdivision of \u00a7 53a-46b (b)\u2014which requires this court to determine whether the sentence was a \u201cproduct of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d\u2014already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>allows a defendant to raise such claims, and that allowing a defendant also to raise such claims under the third subdivision would give a defendant duplicative sources of appellate review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similarly, the prevailing justices suggest that the defendant need not be concerned about this issue because it has carved out a special exception, just for this defendant, that will allow him to raise it later during a habeas corpus proceeding, if this court affirms the judgment of conviction. These arguments must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Proportionality review of a defendant\u2019s death sentence is meant as a catchall review and a final safety net to prevent overt bias and other forms of discrimination from impermissibly affecting the decision of whether a person is to live or to die.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cProportionality review . . . acts as a check against the random and arbitrary imposition of the death penalty .... Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other suspect characteristic cannot be tolerated. As the Florida Supreme Court stated: [Proportionality rjeview by this Court guarantees that the reasons present in one case will reach a similar result to that reached under similar circumstances in another case. No longer will one man die and another man live on the basis of race, or a woman live and a man die on the basis of sex. If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>defendant is sentenced to die, this Court can review that case in light of the other decisions and determine whether or not the punishment is too great. Thus, the discretion charged in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>[408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972)], can be controlled and channeled until the sentencing process becomes a matter of reasoned judgment rather than an exercise in discretion at all. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\u201cProportionality review therefore is a means through which to monitor the imposition of death sentences and thereby to prevent any impermissible discrimination in imposing the death penalty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramseur, </em>106 N.J. 123, 327, 524 A.2d 188 (1987); <em>Ross I, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 564-65 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). It is irrelevant, therefore, whether a defendant may also allege that racial bias caused his death sentence to be \u201carbitrary,\u201d thereby bringing his claim within the rubric of the first subdivision of \u00a7 53a-46b (b). Because such a claim goes to the very heart of the proportionality of his sentence of death, the defendant may also raise it under proportionality review.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Similarly, for two reasons, I am unable to accept the assertion of the prevailing justices that habeas corpus relief for this defendant provides an adequate and timely remedy. First, the defendant must be allowed to learn now, at this stage of the proceedings, if his sentence of death was racially motivated. He should not have to live from day to day with the prospect that he may end up in the death chamber if, in fact, he likely received that sentence because of the color of his skin. Second, if our capital sentencing system is infected with racism, we must expose that ugly truth as soon as possible. The public and other branches of state government, as well as other defendants who face the death penalty, must know the answer now. This is not a problem that should wait to be resolved on a postconviction motion for habeas corpus. Indeed, by making such a suggestion, the prevailing justices fail to recognize the fundamental importance of the issue raised by the defendant. When confronted with an issue of racism, splitting hairs by a narrow construction of a statutory scheme is not acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The prevailing justices also claim that granting the defendant\u2019s motion would impose an inappropriate burden on the courts to conduct a factual inquiry into the nature and circumstances of those cases in which the prosecutor decided not to pursue the death penalty. They and the state advance several reasons why such a factual inquiry should not be conducted as part of our proportionality review: (1) \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) does not contemplate the making of such factual determinations; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>(2) this court is ill-equipped to undertake the fact-finding process necessary to determine which homicide cases could have been charged as capital felonies; and (3) such an inquiry would require the court to delve into the prosecutor\u2019s motivation in deciding how to charge a defendant for a certain criminal act, an inquiry that the state argues should be insulated from review. None of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The legislature specifically requires this court to consider facts and to assume the role of fact finder in death penalty cases. Section 53a-46b (b) requires this court, in addition to conducting its standard review of a defendant\u2019s conviction, to gauge the proportionality of a defendant\u2019s sentence of death. Furthermore, \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) requires us to engage in a comparison of the penalties imposed in \u201csimilar cases.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 4066A (b) (limiting the universe of \u201csimilar cases\u201d to which this court must look in conducting review); <em>Ross I, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 561 (same). Finally, that statute requires us to consider \u201cboth the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.\u201d All of these determinations are fact bound and require this court to assume the role of a fact finder. Accordingly, with respect to the proportionality of the death sentence, this court is required to depart from its traditional role.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Furthermore, appellate courts in other jurisdictions already undertake the same fact-finding process that the defendant in this case asks this court to adopt. In New Jersey, for example, where the proportionality review statute was strikingly similar to our own,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe purposes to be achieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>by proportionality review require that the universe include clearly death eligible homicides in which the prosecutor elected not to seek the death penalty\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>130 N.J. 109, 137, 613 A.2d 1059 (1992); and utilized data compiled by a court-appointed special master in order to conduct this review. See id., 137-88. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, where the proportionality review statute also was similar to our own,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Supreme Court \u201cconducts an <em>independent evaluation </em>of all cases of murder of the first degree convictions which were prosecuted or could have been prosecuted [as death-eligible felonies].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>504 Pa. 428, 443, 475 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 963, 105 S. Ct. 360, 83 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1984). The court explained its fact-finding process: \u201cIn order to facilitate our review, this Court has ordered the President Judge of each county to supply to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (the AOPC) information pertaining to each such conviction and imposed a continuing obligation on the President Judges to update the AOPC with data pertaining to future cases. This information includes the facts and circumstances of the crimes, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances arguably presented by the evidence, the gender and race of the defendant and the victim, and other information pertaining to the conduct and prosecution of the case. The data will be compiled and monitored by the AOPC to insure that the body of \u2018similar cases\u2019 is complete and to expedite our proportionality review.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Like the appellate courts in sister states, this court, too, could appoint a special master or a state trial referee to marshall the evidence and determine which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>homicide cases arising since 1973, resulting in convictions, could have been prosecuted as capital felonies. During such a procedure, both the state and the defendant would have an opportunity to present evidence and to be heard. Moreover, although the state argues that such a project could involve large numbers of cases and prove overwhelming, that has not been the experience in other jurisdictions. Indeed, most cases can be ruled out fairly quickly. In New Jersey, for example, the study began with 3200 homicides. After a threshold screen that excluded cases involving automobile related deaths, juvenile defendants and acquittals, only 1496 cases remained. Of those, the special master identified 246 that were clearly death eligible. Excluded from the final analysis were 250 questionable cases that were not clearly death eligible. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>supra, 130 N.J. 138-39. Finally, the bulk of the research and fact-finding would only have to be done a single time, for once a historical record of cases dating back to 1973 is assembled, it would only have to be updated on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In summary, as Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens, pointed out in his dissent in <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 335, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987), due to the nature of the death penalty, proof that \u201crace more likely than not plays a role\u201d is sufficient to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of a death sentence. Likewise, proof that race more likely than not plays a role in the decision of whether to charge a defendant with a capital felony, and, consequently, whether to subject a defendant to death, is sufficient to demonstrate that a sentence of death is disproportionate. \u201cThe determination of the significance of [this] evidence is at its core an exercise in human moral judgment, not a mechanical statistical analysis. It must first and foremost be informed by awareness of the fact that death is irrevocable, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>as a result \u2018the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination.\u2019 <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>[463 U.S. 992, 998-99, 103 S. Ct. 3446, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1171 (1983)]. For this reason, we have demanded a uniquely high degree of rationality in imposing the death penalty. A capital sentencing system in which race more likely than not plays a role does not meet this standard. It is true that every nuance of decision cannot be statistically captured, nor can any individual judgment be plumbed with absolute certainty. Yet the fact that we must always act without the illumination of complete knowledge cannot induce paralysis when we confront what is literally an issue of life and death.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Finally, the prevailing justices and the state argue that a prosecutor\u2019s decision of whether to pursue the death penalty in other cases is not a relevant factor in determining whether the death sentence is proportionate for the defendant in this case. In making this argument, the prevailing justices and the state seek to insulate prosecutorial discretion from review.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As I pointed out in my dissent in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 306-307, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, U.S. , 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> however, the available statistics \u201ccompel the conclusion that prosecutorial discretion has resulted in the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. Since 1973, there have been at least fifteen cases in Connecticut in which the defendant was initially charged with cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ital felony, but was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser crime and avoid the death penalty. This number does not include cases in which the defendant could have been charged with capital felony originally but was not. Four of the fifteen cases were factually similar to the one before us, involving murders committed in the course of a sexual assault or kidnapping.\u201d If race indeed plays a role in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion\u2014 as the defendant\u2019s preliminary data certainly seems to suggest\u2014we surely cannot complete proportionality review without considering this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Indeed, racial discrimination exercised by a prosecutor is no less repugnant than racial discrimination exercised by a fact finder at trial. \u201c[Discrimination and arbitrariness at an earlier point in the selection process nullify the value of later controls on the jury. The selection process for the imposition of the death penalty does not begin at trial; it begins in the prosecutor\u2019s office. His decision whether or not to seek capital punishment is no less important than the jury\u2019s. Just like the jury, then, where death is the consequence, the prosecutor\u2019s discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action. . . . <em>DeGarmo </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>474 U.S. 973, 975, 106 S. Ct. 337, 88 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In other words, in this case, the mere fact that discrimination in the enforcement of the death penalty may have occurred in the prosecutor\u2019s office, rather than in the trial court, is no less of a reason to overturn a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence of death. In the past, when confronted with discrimination on the basis of race, we have not hesitated to delve into the prosecutor\u2019s motivation. Indeed, this court has demonstrated great concern over the possibility that prosecutorial actions may be linked to racial discrimination. In <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 553 A.2d 166, cert.denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989), Justice Glass, writing for a unanimous court, declared that this court would go beyond federal constitutional requirements in an effort to stamp out charges of purposeful racial discrimination in a prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory jury challenges. Such discrimination, he wrote, \u201cis a matter of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The issue of purposeful racial discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges by the state may arise in any jury trial of a criminal case in which venirepersons of the same cognizable racial group as the defendant are struck from the venire. Consequently, because this issue is of such vital importance to our real and perceived adherence to the rule of law, in the exercise of our inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice, in all future cases in which the defendant asserts a . . . claim [based on <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986)], we deem it appropriate for the [prosecutor] to provide the court with a prima facie case response consistent with the explanatory mandate of <em>Batson.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Although racial discrimination in the selection of a jury is intolerable, claims of racial discrimination take on even more profound dimensions in cases where, as here, a sentence of death may have been imposed on the basis of race. Accordingly, just as this court requires a prosecutor to provide a prima facie explanation of why he or she exercised a peremptory challenge in a particular manner, so too should this court, when conducting proportionality review, require a prosecutor to provide a prima facie explanation of why he or she failed to prosecute \u201csimilar cases\u201d as capital felonies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>when the defendant was white, or the victim was African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Death is irrevocable. It is the ultimate penalty that society can impose and, once imposed, cannot be reversed. This court has an undeniable legal and moral obligation to ascertain whether, as the defendant\u2019s data suggests, race is at the core of the imposition of the death penalty in Connecticut. We cannot ignore the specter of racism, but must confront it and eradicate it from the administration of justice. Yet three justices of this court, not even a majority, take action that effectively deprives this defendant of an opportunity to demonstrate that race played a role in his sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The defendant in this case has produced preliminary data that suggests that in the prosecution of homicide cases in Connecticut, the race of the defendant and the race of the victim play a significant role in determining who is to live and who is to die. The defendant asks this court to allow him to develop the evidentiary underpinnings of such a claim. This issue, having been raised, will continue to cast a dark cloud over the courts and the integrity of our judicial system. We must put it to rest. I would grant the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\"> The defendant is represented by two separate sets of attorneys in his appeal.

Of the twenty-eight capital felony convictions, only four, or 14 percent, have involved the murder of a victim who was black, and of the eighteen that have gone to a penalty phase hearing, only one, or 5.5 percent, has involved the murder of a black victim; (5) of the sixty-six capital convictions in which the guilt phase has been concluded, twenty-one involved black defendants and forty-five involved nonblack defendants. Of the black defendants, thirteen of twenty-one, or 62 percent, were convicted of capital felonies and fifteen of forty-five, or 33 percent, nonwhite defendants were so convicted. The defendant seeks the opportunity to demonstrate the number of kidnap murders of black victims and the number of sexual assault murders of black victims that were not prosecuted as capital felonies and to demonstrate the disproportionate treatment of those crimes as compared to the treatment of comparable crimes involving white victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Four general conventions of statistical analysis, however, may affect the significance of the defendant\u2019s preliminary data. First, \u201cany statistical analysis must reasonably account for racially neutral variables which could have produced the effect observed.\u201d <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>580 F. Sup. 338, 350 (N.D. Ga. 1984), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987). Second, \u201cstatistical evidence must show the likelihood of discriminatory treatment by the decision-makers who made the judgments in question.\u201d Id. Third, \u201cthe underlying data must be shown to be accurate.\u201d Id. Fourth, \u201cthe results should be statistically significant.\u201d Id. Because the defendant\u2019s preliminary data have not been subjected to a rigorous statistical analysis to determine the accuracy of the data, to account for the racially neutral variables, and to determine the statistical significance of the data, they demonstrate nothing more than a <em>possible </em>correlation.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As we indicate later in this opinion, we express no view on whether the defendant\u2019s preliminary data, combined with additional data that may be gathered and subjected to appropriate statistical analysis, will prove what the defendant claims the preliminary data suggest. We point to these statistical conventions, which were noted by the federal District Court in <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>supra, 580 F.Sup. 338, in the context of a similar, albeit constitutional, challenge to Georgia\u2019s capital crimes scheme, to underscore the caution with which such raw data must be viewed. Thus, the alarm expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>by the dissent is premature, because it assumes that the raw data have a degree of statistical significance that has not yet been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Moreover, by our references herein to <em>McCleskey, </em>we do not intend to suggest that the defendant would be confined to the same course of proof that the habeas corpus petitioner in <em>McCleskey </em>chose to present. Our point is simply that the defendant\u2019s claim in this motion is essentially based on statistics\u2014his preliminary data, and what he necessarily claims those will ultimately prove\u2014and that, to the extent that the defendant\u2019s statutory interpretation claim in this motion resembles the federal constitutional challenge made by McCleskey, some sort of statistical evidence and fact-finding, similar to that presented and undertaken in <em>McCleskey, </em>will be necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\"> In order to avoid confusion with our opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, U.S. , 115 S.

To perform the analysis mandated by \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), this court will have to decide in the first instance whether the sentence of death imposed on a particular capital defendant is disproportionate in light of the sentences imposed on defendants in factually comparable cases. In making that determination, we are instructed to consider \u201cboth the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant\u201d in both the case directly before us and in the various cases that comprise the universe of \u201csimilar cases\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3); as those facts are described in the appendices to the parties\u2019 briefs.

Regardless of the label imposed, it clearly does not entail the type of inquiry the defendant seeks to have this court perform in the guise of proportionality review. As the <em>McCleskey </em>cases demonstrate, consideration of the defendant\u2019s claim would require crucial threshold determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of statistical evidence before any significance can be ascribed thereto. Such findings simply are different in kind from the type of determinations necessitated by conventional proportionality review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\"> The Georgia Supreme Court, also, will \u201ccompare cases as to which the death penalty could have been sought by the prosecutor but was not.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>State, </em>249 Ga. 871, 880 n.9, 295 S.E.2d 281 (1982).

See <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>State, </em>591 So. 2d 167 (Fla. 1991). \u201cBecause death is a unique punishment, it is necessary in each case to engage in a thoughtful, deliberate proportionality review <em>to consider the totality of circumstances in a case, and to compare it with other capital eases. </em>It is not a comparison between the number of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)

In so doing, the Maryland Supreme Court stated that \u201c[c]onsidering the purpose of proportionality review in death sentence cases, the language of [the relevant statute], the law in other jurisdictions with proportionality review provisions like our own, and the views expressed by legal commentators, we conclude that the legislatively intended inventory of cases from which \u2018similar cases\u2019 are to be culled encompasses only those first degree murder cases in which the State sought the death penalty . . . whether it was imposed or not.\u201d <em>Tichnell </em>v. <em>State, </em>297 Md. 464, 468 A.2d 17 (1983).

Although this statement could be interpreted as including cases in which the defendant could have been charged with a capital offense but was not, the Montana Supreme Court seems to limit its review to cases where a capital felony was actually charged, whether or not the sentence of death was imposed.

Id. (in conducting proportionality review, \u201c[t]his court has consistently affirmed death penalties in other cases involving killings during the course of a robbery\u201d). MISSOURI: Missouri does not have statutorily required proportionality review. Nonetheless, its Supreme Court compares cases to other cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reuscher, </em>827 S.W.2d 710 (Mo. 1992). Nevada: Nevada proportionality review is mandated by statute. The Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s review, however, is extremely cursory, comparing cases only to others with similar fact patterns where the death penalty had been imposed.

Rather, the defendant sought only to change this court\u2019s interpretation of \u201csimilar cases,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). In essence, the defendant argued that Practice Book \u00a7 4066A (b), which defined that term, adopted too restrictive an interpretation of what \u201csimilar cases\u201d actually means. In so arguing, the defendant made no claim that different interpretations of the language could have a racial impact. He certainly presented no evidence to this effect. Given that background, the conclusion of the prevailing justices today\u2014that the decision in <em>Ross I </em>controls the outcome of this motion and that the doctrine of stare decisis is somehow implicated\u2014eludes me.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b790-10\"> The prevailing justices imply that I am sounding a false \u201calarm\u201d with respect to the significance of the data. See footnote 4 of their opinion. I recognize that the data is preliminary. Nevertheless, preliminary or not, the data suggests that our capital sentencing system favors the life of a white person over the life of an African-American. To the extent that such a charge may be accurate, I believe that it warrants, at the very least, \u201calarm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> Although the prevailing justices assert that the plain language of the statute \u201cis inconsistent . . . with a comparison of the entire decision-making process engaged in by all the relevant actors in all homicide cases prosecuted since 1973,\u201d they offer no analysis to support this conclusion. Indeed, I fail to understand why it would be \u201cinconsistent\u201d for this court to determine whether systematic racial bias caused an undue, disproportionate number of African-Americans to be charged with capital felonies, and therefore to be subjected to the death penalty. To the contrary, this is exactly the type of inquiry that \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) demands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b792-5\"> I strongly disagree with the assertion of the prevailing justices that the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) <em>\u201csupports the conclusion </em>that the statute does not contemplate the kind of universe advocated by the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The prevailing justices themselves have noted that the legislative history on this issue is \u201csparse,\u201d and that not one legislator expressly mentioned proportionality review during the legislative proceedings. Yet the prevailing justices somehow conclude that this complete absence of legislative history supports their view. I have discovered no other instance in which this court has relied on a vacuum of legislative history to reach a particular conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\"> The definition of proportionate, which is to \u201cgive due proportions to,\u201d requires reference to \u201cproportion.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> Jack W. Fischer, the assistant state\u2019s attorney who represented the state during oral argument on this motion, took the position that if statistics show that defendants are being sentenced to death in Connecticut because of their race, this court should be \u201cabsolutely concerned, but in a proper place.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> The prevailing justices, in footnote 18 of their opinion, meticulously survey the statutes of other states in order to demonstrate the narrow scope of proportionality review in those jurisdictions. They do not, however, point to any instance, in any of those jurisdictions, in which a defendant raised a claim like the one raised by the defendant in this case: that sentences of death are disproportionate because they have been imposed in a racially discriminatory manner. Consequently, this survey is not helpful in determining whether courts in any of these states would allow such a claim of racial discrimination to be raised during proportionality review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\"> Moreover, the state\u2019s argument against hearing the defendant\u2019s claim of racial bias during proportionality review\u2014that doing so would, in effect, give the defendant two bites at the appellate apple\u2014fails under the circumstances of this case. As indicated above; see footnote 5 of this dissent; this motion has been filed on behalf of the defendant by the special public defender appointed to represent him on that portion of his appeal that involves the proportionality of his sentence. The public defender who represents the defendant on the challenge to his death sentence under the first subdivision of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) has indicated he will not raise a claim of systematic racial bias such as the one introduced in this motion. Thus, unless this court grants the defendant\u2019s motion to expand the universe of \u201csimilar cases,\u201d the defendant\u2019s claim of systematic, preprosecution racial bias will go unheard and unproven in the Supreme Court of Connecticut. Such a result is intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Indeed, by not granting the defendant\u2019s motion, this court places the defendant in an intolerable position. As indicated previously, the defendant is represented by two attorneys, both of whom were appointed by the state. One of these attorneys intends to raise the issue of racial bias, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>the other attorney does not. The state now argues that the attorney who does not intend to raise this issue is, in fact, the one who should raise it. This procedural backdrop, combined with the refusal of the prevailing justices to expand the universe of similar cases, has effectively deprived the defendant of both counsel and the opportunity to raise in a timely manner a relevant, sensitive and important issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\"> The New Jersey Capital Punishment Act provided that upon the \u201crequest of the defendant, the Supreme Court shall . . . determine whether the sentence is disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d N.J.
