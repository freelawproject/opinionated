The principal ingredients are ergot and apiol. Many other manufacturers prior to and subsequent to the year 1900 have sold preparations having the same principal ingredients under the names <em>\u201c </em>Ergot-Apiol Compound,\u201d \u201c Ergot &amp; Apiol Com.,\u201d \u201c Ergot and Apiol Comp.,\u201d \u201cApiol. and Ergotin Compound,\u201d \u201cApiol and Ergotin,\u201d \u201c Ergot and Apiol,\u201d \u201c Ergot and Apiol Capsules,\u201d \u201cApiol and Ergot \u201d and \u201c Ergot-Apiol capsules.\u201d Since the year 1926 defendants have sold capsules containing ergot and apiol and in the year 1927 placed upon the market a square cardboard box containing twenty-four capsules and sold its preparation under the designation \u201c Ergot and Apiol Compound.\u201d In June, 1932, defendants changed the name of their product and the method of packing. They changed the name from \u201c Ergot and Apiol Compound \u201d to <em>\u201c </em>Ergot-Apiol,\u201d and the receptacle, upon which the new name is printed, from a square cardboard box to a yellow tin box encased in cellophane. In addition to these findings, the undisputed proof is that the contents of defendants\u2019 package were reduced from twenty-four capsules to twenty capsules, the new tin box, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>instead of colored cream and brown, was very similar in color to plaintiff\u2019s yellow tin box and, although differing slightly in detail, was substantially the same size and shape. Defendants changed the manner of packing from a criss-cross inlay to a nest inlay nearly, if not quite, identical to the one used by plaintiff. The result of these changes is that the new name of defendants\u2019 product bears an extraordinary similarity to the name of plaintiff\u2019s product and that defendants\u2019 new package closely resembles plaintiff\u2019s package while the old name of their preparation was readily distinguishable from plaintiff\u2019s and that defendants\u2019 old package was entirely different and distinct from plaintiff\u2019s. There is also proof that defendants\u2019 sehing agent wrote upon their printed price list <em>\u201c </em>ErgotApiol capsules Similar Packages to Smith\u2019s \u201d and delivered it to a druggist. In two hundred and seventy-eight visits to drugstores where plaintiff\u2019s witnesses asked for Ergoapiol, the salesmen in forty-two instances delivered defendants\u2019 product, Ergot-Apiol.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The courts below have found as facts that defendant corporation has not at any time adopted or used a package similar to plaintiff\u2019s package and that defendants have not committed any acts for the purpose of misleading or deceiving the public into believing that defendant corporation\u2019s product is the plaintiff\u2019s product, nor is the defendant corporation\u2019s package calculated to cause such deception nor has the public been misled or deceived as the result of any acts of the defendant corporation. We think that there is no evidence to support such findings but that on the contrary the evidence leads inevitably to the opposite result.'</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The judgments should, therefore, be reversed and judgment directed for the plaintiff as demanded in the complaint, with costs in aU courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Crane, Ch. J., Lehman, O\u2019Brien, Hubbs, Crouch, Loughran and Finch, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
