JONES, Vice Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">\u00b6 1 We have previously considered an appeal from the trial court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss. In <em>Pettyjohn v. Plaster, </em>No, 86,196 (Memo. Op., Dec. 5, 1995), we affirmed dismissal of PlaintiffiAppellant\u2019s separate tort action alleging that Defendant/Appellee had fraudulently obtained a divorce judgment depriving him of equitable title to property in Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">\u00b6 2 In December, 1996, Appellant filed a \u201cpetition\u201d in the divorce action reasserting the same facts as he had alleged in the separate case, asking the court to vacate the property division in the divorce decree, or alternatively to grant money judgment for the value of the property. Appellee moved to dismiss the petition as barred by the statute of limitations in 12 O.S.Supp.1993 \u00a7 1038, because the divorce judgment had been rendered on September 1, 1988, over eight years before Appellant petitioned to vacate it. Appellee also asserted the bar of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">\u00b6 3 Appellant opposed the motion, citing 12 O.S.1991 \u00a7 100.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argued that under \u00a7 100 he had one year from the date of our former opinion to renew his fraud claim. He further argued that <em>res judicata </em>did not apply because his claim of fraud had not been previously resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-20\">\u00b64 The trial court granted Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. On appeal, Appellant contends (1) his claim for fraud by Appellee was preserved by the savings statute; and (2) <em>res judicata </em>does not apply. Appellant appears to concede that the applicable statute of limitations is three years, and so characterizes his petition to vacate as one seeking relief for irregularity in obtaining the judgment. 12 O.S.Supp.1993 \u00a7 1038; 12 O.S.1991 \u00a7 1031(Third). Appellant also has abandoned as \u201cmoot\u201d his trial court argument that the judgment might be void on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>We therefore confine ourselves to discussion of the savings statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">\u00b6 5 Section 100 of title 12, O.S.1991, saves an action from the bar of the statute of limitations when a plaintiff has obtained judgment and the judgment is later reversed (which is not the situation here), or when the plaintiff has timely filed the action and later fails \u201cotherwise than upon the merits.\u201d Appellant\u2019s separate tort action to set aside the divorce judgment, the subject of our former opinion, was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The question presented is therefore whether such dismissal constituted a failure of the action \u201cotherwise than on the merits.\u201d We conclude it did <em>not.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">\u00b6 6 The word \u201cmerits\u201d and the phrase \u201con the merits\u201d have been understood at least since the opinion in <em>Duncan v. Doming Inv. Co., </em>54 Okla. 680, 154 P. 651 (1916) <em>(per curiam), </em>as referring to the substance of a claim or defense, different from purely procedural or technical grounds. <em>See also Hutchings v. Zumbrunn, </em>86 OMa. 226, 208 P. 224, 225-26 (1922) (if demurrer to petition was sustained for failure to state a cause of action, judgment rendered thereon would amount to adjudication on the merits). A judgment is rendered on the merits \u201cwhen it amounts to a declaration of the law as to the respective rights and duties of the parties, based on the ultimate facts or state of facts disclosed by the pleadings, and evidence upon which the right of recovery depends, irrespective of formal, technical, or dilatory objections or contentions.\u201d <em>Crow v. Abraham, </em>86 Or. 99, 167 P. 590, 591 (1917). <em>Cf., Flick v. Crouch, </em>434 P.2d 256, 261(Okla.1967) (\u201cmerits\u201d means the real or substantial grounds of action or defense as distinguished from matters of practice, procedure, or form); <em>Providential Devel. Co. v. U.S. Steel Co., </em>236 F.2d 277, 280 (10th Cir.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">\u00b67 Given our conclusion that the former dismissal was rendered on the merits of Appellant\u2019s action to vacate the divorce judgment, Appellant clearly is not able to avail himself of the provisions of the savings statute. His reliance upon that statute to preserve his petition to vacate the divorce judgment is misplaced, and is hereby rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">\u00b6 8 Because we have held that the savings statute does not apply here, we need not discuss the issue of <em>res judicata. </em>The order of dismissal entered by the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">\u00b6 9 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b990-10\">JOPLIN, P.J., and GARRETT, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-13\">. Section 100 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-14\">\"If any action is commenced within due time, and a judgment thereon for the plaintiff is reversed, or if the plaintiff fail in such action otherwise than upon the merits, the plaintiff, or, if he should die, and the cause of action survive, his representatives may commence a new action within one (1) year after the reversal or failure although the time limit for commencing the action shall have expired before the new action is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
