A further question raised by this appeal is whether the factual findings by the trial court, after a hearing held on a motion to open, were also clearly erroneous. We respond in both instances in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">An appellate court may not retry facts and its duty upon review of a claim which challenges the factual basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is limited to a determination of whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was clearly erroneous in this respect or otherwise contrary to law.
