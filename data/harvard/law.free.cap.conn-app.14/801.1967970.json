Subsequently, we denied the parties\u2019 later motions for permission to amend their jurisdictional statements to include review of the underlying judgment rendered by the trial court. We also denied both parties\u2019 motions to reconsider our decision denying their motions for permission to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Nothing in the record, transcripts and briefs supports any contention that, in denying the parties\u2019 motions to open the judgment, the trial court abused its discretion. See, e.g., <em>Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 711, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983); <em>Lamont </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>4 Conn. App. 303, 307, 493 A.2d 298 (1985). Where the exercise of judicial discretion is called upon, its exercise will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal. <em>Sturman </em>v. <em>Socha, </em>191 Conn. 1, 7, 463 A.2d 527 (1983); <em>Montanaro Bros. Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>4 Conn. App. 46, 54, 492 A.2d 223 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
