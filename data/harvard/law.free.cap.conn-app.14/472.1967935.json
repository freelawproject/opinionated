The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in charging the jury on larceny in the second degree as a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree, (2) in giving an adverse inference instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to call an alibi witness, (3) in admitting evidence of the victim\u2019s photographic identification of' the defendant as one of her assailants, and (4) in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. We find error in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The defendant and her brother, Brian Hudson, were tried together for the January 12, 1985 robbery and assault of Sandra Gilbane. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>14 Conn. App. 463, 541 A.2d 534 (1988). The jury reasonably could have found the following facts: Shortly after 8 p.m. on January 12, 1985, the victim was assaulted by a black woman and a black man as she attempted to enter her automobile outside an office building in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Stamford. The woman attempted to remove the victim\u2019s purse from her shoulder, and, when she resisted, the man struck her on the head with what appeared to her to be a revolver. Although the victim did not positively identify her assailants from police photographs viewed the night of the assault, she did identify both the defendant and Brian Hudson after viewing additional photographs one week later. A more detailed discussion of the pertinent facts is contained in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>supra, 464-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The defendant first claims error in the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The defendant went to trial on a substitute information charging, inter alia, robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Due to the insufficiency of evidence regarding the presence of a deadly weapon, the court directed the jury to find the defendant not guilty of robbery in the first degree, and granted the state\u2019s request to instruct the jury on larceny in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3). Section 53a-123 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of larceny in the second degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and: . . . (3) the property, regardless of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>nature or value, is taken from the person of another.\u201d (Footnote added.) The defendant objected to the state\u2019s request on the grounds that she had not been put on notice that she would be exposed to a possible conviction of larceny in the second degree. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, and the defendant excepted. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u201cIn State v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), the court set out four conditions which must be met before a party is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense: \u2018(1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u2019 Id., 588. (Footnote omitted.) In this case, it is the second <em>Whistnant </em>criterion with which we are concerned.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitt, </em>8 Conn. App. 478, 486-87, 513 A.2d 731 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 801, 518 A.2d 648 (1987), see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>14 Conn. App. 216, 221, 541 A.2d 115 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply stated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>issue is whether the defendant was given notice of the charge of larceny in the second degree by the information which charged her with robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">When examining a claim of insufficient notice of a lesser included offense, we are limited to an examination of the charging documents, and do not examine the evidence presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>182 Conn. 585, 593, 438 A.2d 792 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitt, </em>supra, 487. The substitute information on which the defendant went to trial stated in pertinent part that \u201con or about the twelfth day of January 1985, at or about 8:25 p.m. at premises known as # 25 Third Street, the said SHEILA HUDSON <em>stole certain-property from one SANDRA GILBANE, </em>to wit: current monies of the United States of America, and in the course of the commission of the crime, displayed and threatened the use of what she represented by her words or conduct to be a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We must determine if it would be possible to \u201c[steal] certain property from [a victim],\u201d without taking property from \u201cthe person of [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is foreclosed by <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-4), </em>1 Conn. App. 642, 474 A.2d 485 (1984), and <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>13 Conn. App. 596, 538 A.2d 1068 (1988). In those cases, we held that, because larceny from the person requires a taking from the victim\u2019s person as opposed to a taking from his presence or control, larceny in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3) is not ordinarily a lesser included offense of robbery, the larceny component of which does not require such a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">For example, this court held in <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-4) </em>that the trial court erred in concluding that a respondent who had removed a victim's radio from the victim\u2019s presence, while an accomplice held a knife to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>victim\u2019s throat, had committed larceny in the second degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-123 (a) (3). \u201c \u2018In [the] view [of our Supreme Court], larceny from the person <em>requires an actual trespass to the person of the victim. </em>... On the other hand, the removal of property from the presence or control of the victim lacks such a trespass and is insufficient to constitute larceny from the person. . . . [L]arceny from the person is a separate and distinct offense from that of simple larceny.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-4), </em>supra 645, quoting State v. <em>Crowe, </em>174 Conn. 129, 134, 384 A.2d 340 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, the use of the term \u201cstole\u201d in the information does not supply the defendant with sufficient notice of the \u201cseparate and distinct offense\u201d of \u201ctaking property from the person\u201d of the victim. One can easily envision countless scenarios in which the defendant \u201csteals\u201d property from the victim as described in this particular information, without actually removing it from the victim\u2019s person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, we have held that the word \u201csteal\u201d means \u201cto commit larceny.\u201d <em>Lauder </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>11 Conn. App. 161, 165, 526 A.2d 539 (1987). We conclude that the information did not put the defendant on notice of the second degree larceny charge and, therefore, it was error to instruct the jury on larceny in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could draw an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to call an alibi witness. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendant claimed as an alibi defense that on the night of the crime she was with her sister, Jackie Hudson, visiting Everett Hodge, a family friend. Hodge testified on the defendant\u2019s behalf, but the defendant failed to call Jackie Hudson to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">A party is entitled to a so-called <em>\u201cSecondino </em>instruction,\u201d whenever it is shown that a witness is available, and is a witness whom the party in question would naturally produce. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>supra, 468; <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, 12 </em>Conn. App. 655, 657, 533 A.2d 890 (1987). Because the state satisfied its burden of proving both prerequisites, the <em>Secondino </em>instruction was properly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The record indicates that prior to the commencement of the trial defense counsel was cognizant of Jackie Hudson\u2019s whereabouts. The following brief colloquy indicates that the witness at issue was in fact available;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I spoke with [the defendant] this morning and there is a possibility that her sister, Jackie Hudson, may be called as a witness. I\u2019d ask Your Honor please if you would mention that to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cThe Court: Are there any other witnesses that the court should mention? We have Jackie Hudson and Jackie Hudson\u2019s address is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: She\u2019s from Stamford, Your Honor, Hope Street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The record also indicates that the defendant\u2019s mother, Pearl Hudson, testified that she knew the telephone number and address of Jackie Hudson\u2019s employer, as of July 31,1985, only two days before she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>appeared in court to testify. Further, there was no testimony presented by the defendant that the number had changed or that the defendant\u2019s mother was unwilling to give it to the defendant, if requested. The trial court appropriately concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could find that the witness was available. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>supra, 469-70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watley, </em>195 Conn. 485, 489, 488 A.2d 1245 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The record also shows that Jackie Hudson was the only person claimed to be present with the defendant between 7:30 and 10 p.m. on the night of the assault. Such a critical witness would be one naturally produced to support the alibi testimony. The defendant\u2019s arguments that Jackie Hudson was an \u201cinferior\u201d witness, because her credibility as the defendant\u2019s sister could be questioned, and because her testimony would be \u201ccumulative,\u201d is without merit. \u201cThe testimony of an additional witness upon a significant disputed issue can hardly be characterized as cumulative. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 662, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). . . . Though each party is ordinarily empowered to place an available witness on the stand, such a witness often may be expected to furnish testimony more favorable to one side than the other. . . . We do not equate the requirement that the witness be one whom a party would <em>naturally </em>produce with the judgment of counsel that the witness would be effective.\u201d (Emphasis in original; citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>202 Conn. 316, 325, 521 A.2d 1025 (1987). We conclude that the trial court did not err in giving the <em>Secondino </em>instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of error is that evidence of the photographic identification of the defendant made by the victim should have been suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u201c \u2018The trial court held an evidentiary hearing regarding the identifications and specifically found that none of them was the result of an impermissibly suggestive procedure, and that they were reliable. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilhotti, </em>11 Conn. App. 709, 713-18, 529 A.2d 235 (1987). It would serve no useful purpose to recite those findings here. We have fully reviewed the record, and we conclude that those findings are amply supported by the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 203, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, U.S. , 108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>13 Conn. App. 133, 135, 534 A.2d 1253 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>supra, 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error alleges that the trial court impermissibly requested that the jury \u201cobserve everyone in the courtroom,\u201d immediately after an in-court identification of the defendant and her codefendant had occurred. We find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in the manner in which it conducted this identification procedure, and conclude that our ruling on the identical claim made by Brian Hudson, the codefendant in this case, is dispositive of this matter. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>supra, 466-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">There is error in part, the judgment is set aside as to the conviction of larceny in the second degree only and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty on the first count of the substitute information.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> The defendant was originally charged with robbery in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134, and larceny in the second degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123. The state then amended that information to charge robbery in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), and assault in the second degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2). A subsequent information was filed which charged the defendant with the crimes he faced at trial, namely robbery in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), and assault in the second degree, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-60 (a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"> We note that although the defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the fourth, rather than the second criterion of the <em>Whistnant </em>analysis had not been met, the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel contends that such argument was the result of confusion concerning the analysis. The state concedes that the defendant\u2019s appellate argument regarding the second criterion of the <em>Whistnant </em>analysis is reviewable, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Kristy, </em>11 Conn. App. 473, 481, 528 A.2d 390 (1987), cert. denied, 206 Conn. 801, 535 A.2d 1315 (1988). We agree with the parties that such a claim would be reviewable, both in light of the defendant\u2019s objection and exception, and in the absence of a proper exception, under the <em>Evans </em>doctrine as noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kristy, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> For example, the defendant could force the victim to allow the defendant access to the victim\u2019s bank account by requiring the victim to open her account through an automatic bank teller machine. If the defendant then proceeded to withdraw monies from the victim\u2019s account, the defendant would thereby \u201csteal\u201d money from the victim without committing larceny in the second degree. Further, any scenario in which a defendant would remove property from the presence or control of the victim without committing a physical trespass, could satisfy the language of the information, without constituting a \u201ctaking from the person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\"> The defendant also alleged that the <em>Secondino </em>instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the federal constitution. We addressed this claim thoroughly in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>14 Conn. App. 463, 470-71, 541 A.2d 534 (1988) and, as the defendant in that case relied upon this defendant\u2019s brief for his argument, we conclude that our discussion in that case necessarily resolves any claims raised in the present appeal with regard to this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
