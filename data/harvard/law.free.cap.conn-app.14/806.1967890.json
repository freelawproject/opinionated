The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in finding that his oral statements to the police were given voluntarily, in light of a comment by a police officer to the defendant that \u201ccooperation would probably help and wouldn\u2019t hurt him.\u201d Our review of the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statements were given voluntarily and were not induced by a promise of leniency by the police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Householder, </em>7 Conn.
