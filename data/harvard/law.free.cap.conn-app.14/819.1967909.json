Our review of the record, transcripts and briefs clearly indicates that there was ample evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s finding that all of the plaintiff\u2019s back injuries were causally related to his original work-related injury. Further, there is ample evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s factual finding that the defendant was legally noticed under General Statutes \u00a7 31-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
