The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress pretrial and in-court identifications, (2) in directing the jury to \u201cobserve the courtroom\u201d upon completion of the in-court identification, (3) in giving an adverse inference instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to call an alibi witness, and (4) in refusing defense counsel\u2019s request to allow the defendant to stand at the jury box during summation. The defendant also claims that the cumulative impact of the claimed errors deprived the defendant of a fair trial. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Shortly after 8 p.m. on January 12,1985, the victim parked her car near an office building in Stamford, intending to visit a friend who was at work within the building. She attempted to enter the building but the door was locked, and her attempts to call to her friend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>were of no avail. Upon returning to her car, she noticed a man and woman standing near the only other automobile on the block, approximately fifty feet away. As she was about to enter her car, she felt a strong tug at her pocketbook which was slung over her left shoulder. Turning, she saw that a black woman, one of the two people she had noticed at the nearby automobile, was attempting to seize the pocketbook. A tug-of-war ensued until the defendant, a black male, approached brandishing a pistol and commanded, \u201cGive her the purse or I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d The victim began screaming, and after disregarding a second warning from the defendant she was struck on the head with the gun. As the victim brought her hands up to protect her head, she loosened her grip on the purse and also upon a brown paper bag she was carrying. The female assailant, later identified as Sheila Hudson, the defendant\u2019s sister, yanked the purse from the victim\u2019s arm, and both the defendant and his sister backed away, momentarily stopping to view the contents of the paper bag now lying in the street. The two attackers then turned and ran and, although the victim attempted to pursue them, the defendant and his sister eluded her. One week after the assault, the victim selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from a photo array at the Stamford police station. She also made an in-court identification of the defendant as her male attacker. She later identified Sheila Hudson as her female assailant. Sheila Hudson\u2019s conviction is the subject of the appeal in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>14 Conn. App. 472, 541 A.2d 539 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The defendant first claims the trial court erred in failing to suppress the victim\u2019s pretrial and in-court identifications of the defendant as one of her assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u201cThe trial court held an evidentiary hearing regarding the identifications and specifically found that none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>of them was the result of an impermissibly suggestive procedure, and that they were reliable. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilhotti, </em>11 Conn. App. 709, 713-18, 529 A.2d 235 (1987). It would serve no useful purpose to recite those findings here. We have fully reviewed the record, and we conclude that those findings are amply supported by the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 203, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, U.S. , 108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>13 Conn. App. 133, 135, 534 A.2d 1253 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error concerns the in-court identification of the defendant as one of the victim\u2019s assailants. The victim chose the defendant and his sister from a group of six black males and six black females, seated in a row in the courtroom. The identification occurred outside the presence of the jury, and prior to their being sworn. After the jury was brought in and sworn, the court instructed the jurors to \u201ctake a few moments and observe everyone in the courtroom.\u201d The jury was then excused without comment concerning the identification. The defendant argues that this procedure \u201cimpermissibly bolstered\u201d the state\u2019s evidence, because the jury was able to view the other subjects of the \u201clineup\u201d after the victim had identified both the defendant and his sister as her assailants out of the jury\u2019s presence. The defendant\u2019s argument is meritless. \u201cThe manner in which in-court identifications are conducted is not of constitutional magnitude but rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 470, 512 A.2d 189 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>9 Conn. App. 548, 555, 520 A.2d 250 (1987). The defendant had requested that an in-court identification occur outside of the jury\u2019s presence, prior to trial. The record indicates that the trial court allowed the jury to observe the people seated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>in the courtroom so that the twelve people in the lineup were not required to remain in court throughout the suppression hearing which preceded the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The action of the trial court merely ensured that the jury had the benefit of the most accurate picture of the circumstances of the in-court identification, to prevent either party from exploiting the jury\u2019s absence from the procedure. We note further, that the defendant does not raise on appeal the admission into evidence of photographs of the lineup taken by the state\u2019s attorney. \u201cThe innate weakness in any in-court testimonial identification is grounds for assailing its weight rather than its admissibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 470. The court neither bolstered the state\u2019s evidence nor abused its discretion in instructing the jury to \u201cobserve everyone in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The defendant next claims that it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to call certain alibi witnesses. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">After consideration of each party\u2019s request to charge, the trial court rejected the state\u2019s request to give a <em>Secondino </em>instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to produce two alibi witnesses. The court denied the request on the grounds that the state had not established the availability of the witnesses. In response to the denial, the state requested that the court take judicial notice of the fact that one of the alibi witnesses, Pearl Hudson, the defendant\u2019s mother, was present in the courtroom and obviously available to testify. The defendant moved to reopen its case to offer Pearl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Hudson\u2019s testimony; the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and Pearl Hudson testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The defendant next presented the testimony of Vasco Willis, an investigator with the public defender\u2019s office. Willis testified that he was unable to locate the second alibi witness, the defendant\u2019s brother, Lorenzo Hudson. Willis also related that the defendant\u2019s mother told him that Lorenzo was incarcerated, but that he ascertained that Lorenzo Hudson was not incarcerated at the Bridgeport Correctional Center and that he did not have a telephone listing in New Haven. This evidence was then presented to the jury. The court subsequently delivered a \u201cmissing witness\u201d charge regarding Lorenzo Hudson.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201c \u2018The failure of a party to produce a witness who is within his power to produce and who would naturally have been produced by him, permits the inference that the evidence of the witness would be unfavorable to the party\u2019s cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>202 Conn. 316, 324, 521 A.2d 1025 (1987), quoting <em>Ezzo </em>v. <em>Geremiah, </em>107 Conn. 670, 677, 142 A. 461 (1928). \u201c \u2018 \u201cThere are two requirements for the operation of the <em>[Secondino] </em>rule: The witness must be available, and he must be a witness whom the party would naturally produce.\u201d . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>12 Conn. App. 655, 657, 533 A.2d 890 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the evidence presented is sufficient to support a finding that a missing witness was available to the defendant, the court\u2019s charge was properly given. <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 657-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The standard which determines a witness\u2019 availability to testify is- \u201cwhether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding by the jury that the missing witness was available to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>180 Conn. 101, 110, 429 A.2d 813 (1980). In <em>Daniels, </em>the state\u2019s attorney questioned the defendant about a potential witness\u2019 whereabouts and elicited the response, \u201cShe\u2019s home, I guess.\u201d Id. Our Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]his testimony provided the jury with sufficient evidence to support a finding by it that [the potential witness] was available to the defendant as a witness at the time of trial.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s first alibi witness, Pearl Hudson, testified on cross-examination that Lorenzo Hudson resided in New Haven at the time of trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While this evidence is by no means conclusive on the question of Lorenzo Hudson\u2019s availability, under the standard set in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the witness was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We note that despite the defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, the testimony of the public defender\u2019s investigator, that he could not locate Lorenzo Hudson, is of no consequence. The investigator testified that he did nothing more in New Haven than check directory assistance for Lorenzo Hudson\u2019s telephone listing. Pearl Hudson testified, however, that Lorenzo did not have a telephone. We conclude such testimony does nothing to bolster the defendant\u2019s allegation that Lorenzo was unavailable to testify. Further, such testimony does not negate the evidence elicited by the state\u2019s attorney that Lorenzo Hudson resided in New Haven at the time of trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The defendant also claims that the <em>Secondino </em>instruction shifted the state\u2019s burden of proof in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Both this court and our Supreme Court have held that questions concerning the propriety of a <em>Secondino </em>instruction do not rise to the level of a constitutional challenge: \u201cIn this appeal the defendant suggests that the <em>Secondino </em>charge, \u2018even if otherwise proper under local rules of evidence,\u2019 implicates constitutional rights because \u2018it violates the presumption of innocence and shifts the burden of proof from the prosecution to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>defendant.\u2019 This court, however, has held to the contrary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 538, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 182, 405 A.2d 626 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 966, 99 S. Ct. 2417, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>205 Conn. 39, 43-44, 529 A.2d 1308 (1987), affirming State v. <em>Shashaty, </em>8 Conn. App. 387, 513 A.2d 172 (1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s <em>Secondino </em>instruction was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in refusing his request to allow him to stand before the jury box during his counsel\u2019s summation. The defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. \u201cThe court, in its discretion, may permit in-court experiments and demonstrations if they will aid the fact finder. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leopold, </em>110 Conn. 55, 67, 147 A.118 (1929); Tait &amp; LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 9.6.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 22, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). In this case, however, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s facial features had been presented during the trial, and the purpose of this request was to permit the jury to observe at close range certain facial characteristics of the defendant after the presentation of evidence had concluded. After reviewing the record we conclude that the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>abuse its discretion in disallowing defendant counsel\u2019s request to stand the defendant before the jury box during summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error is that the cumulative effect of the claimed errors deprived him of a fair trial. Because we find that none of the challenged trial court actions was erroneous, we conclude that the cumulative impact of those actions did not deny the defendant a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>182 Conn. 220, 230-33, 438 A.2d 38 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>14 Conn. App. 146, 149-51, 539 A.2d 1037 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> The defendant concedes the second requirement of the rule, namely, that Lorenzo Hudson was a witness whom the defendant would naturally have produced to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-6\"> The colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201cQ: All right. How about Lorenzo, wasn\u2019t he around?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6l\">\u201cA: No. Lorenzo lives in New Haven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cQ: Where is Lorenzo now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201cA: New Haven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cQ: He lives in New Haven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">\u201cQ: How long has he lived in New Haven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\u201cA: Over a year now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">\u201cQ: At the same address?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\">\u201cQ: Do you know whether Brian ever visited him in New Haven or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATj\">\u201cA: Brian went up there one time before he was arrested to try to find employment because he was staying up there with Lorenzo looking for a job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahp\">\u201cQ: Oh, he was living with Lorenzo? In New Haven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-17\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-18\">\u201cQ: Did you know when that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-19\">\u201cA: It was back in \u201884.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-20\">\u201cQ: But Lorenzo is still living in New Haven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-21\">\u201cA: Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-22\">\u201cQ: Do you know when the last time you saw Lorenzo was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-23\">\u201cA: Three weeks ago.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> We note further that the trial court stated earlier in the proceeding, before the evidence of Lorenzo Hudson\u2019s New Haven residence was elicited, that it allowed a <em>Secondino </em>instruction in a similar case because \u201cthere was much discussion about that witness\u2019 residing in the area. I didn\u2019t have any hesitation in that case whatsoever.\u201d It appears that upon hearing the testimony elicited by defense counsel with regard to Lorenzo Hudson\u2019s whereabouts, the trial court changed its opinion of the propriety of the <em>Secondino </em>instruction. In defending its <em>Secondino </em>instruction in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial, the trial court stated \u201c[TJhere was evidence, if I recall, that [Lorenzo Hudson] lived in New Haven and that he was seen recently in the Stamford area. . . . And he\u2019s part of the defendant\u2019s family.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> The defendant also claims that the remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney concerning the <em>Secondino </em>instruction were improper. We need not address this claim, however, in light of our conclusion that the instruction was properly given, and in light of the defendant\u2019s failure to present this claim in his preliminary statement of issues filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1), or in the statement of issues presented in his brief. See Practice Book \u00a7 4013; <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Protection, </em>12 Conn. App. 251, 257 n.ll, 530 A.2d 641 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>13 Conn. App. 420, 426, 537 A.2d 496 (1988) (having failed to preserve claim of prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the defendant is not entitled to review of his claim under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>[165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973)] or the plain error doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
