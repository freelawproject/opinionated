The sole issue is whether the trial court erred in finding that the plaintiff had accepted the defendants\u2019 counteroffer prior to the defendants\u2019 revocation of that counteroffer and thus created an enforceable contract between the parties. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The trial court found the following facts. The defendant Edward Sherman had engaged Y.R. Brokers as listing agent for the sale of a business with the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>asset being a real estate advertisement publication known as the \u201cShowcase of Homes.\u201d The plaintiff contacted V.R. Brokers as a prospective purchaser. On December 5, 1985, the plaintiff, made a written offer to purchase the business for $75,000, and attached certain conditions to the offer. Later the same day, Sherman signed a written counteroffer to sell the business for $80,000, and indicated that two of the conditions which the plaintiff attached to his offer were not acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On December 7, at 11:35 a.m., the plaintiff, purporting to accept the counteroffer, signed it before a notary public, and then brought it to the office of V.R. Brokers around noon on that day. At about 9 a.m. on that same day, Sherman informed the principal of V.R. Brokers, Robert Renault, that he wanted to cancel his counteroffer. This information was communicated to the plaintiff by Renault verbally immediately before the plaintiff handed the signed counteroffer to Renault at noon on December 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the counteroffer was not effectively revoked because the revocation was not communicated to the plaintiff before he accepted the counteroffer. The court specifically found that there was a contract enforceable against the defendants when the plaintiff signed the counteroffer before a notary public at 11:35 a.m. on December 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of contract law that in order to form a binding contract there must be an offer and acceptance based on a mutual understanding by the parties. <em>Bridgeport Pipe Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>DeMatteo Construction Co., </em>159 Conn. 242, 249, 268 A.2d 391 (1970); <em>Zahornacky </em>v. <em>Edward Chevrolet, Inc., </em>37 Conn. Sup. 751, 754, 436 A.2d 47 (1981).\u201d <em>Cavallo </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>1 Conn. App. 519, 520, 473 A.2d 338 (1984). The coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>teroffer by Sherman created a power of acceptance in the plaintiff. <em>Cavallo </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra; 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 35. That counteroffer, however \u201cwas revokable by the defendant at any time before acceptance by the [plaintiff].\u201d <em>Lloyd &amp; Elliot, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parke, </em>112 Conn. 504, 507, 152 A. 825 (1931); J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, The Law of Contracts (2d Ed.), \u00a7 2-20 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the counteroffer was effective when he signed the counteroffer was contrary to our law. \u201cRevocation of an offer in order to be effectual must be received by the offeree and 'before he has exercised his power of creating a contract by acceptance of the offer.\u2019 Restatement, 1 Contracts, \u00a7 41 and \u00a7 69, Comment a; 1 Page, Contracts, \u00a7 134. Acceptance is operative, if transmitted by means which the offeror has authorized, as soon as its transmission begins and it is put out of the offeree\u2019s possession . . . irrespective of whether or when it is received by the offeror.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>L &amp; E Wertheimer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wehle-Hartford Co., </em>126 Conn. 30, 35, 9 A.2d 279 (1939). See also 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 56, 63. The plaintiff\u2019s act of signing the written counteroffer was not sufficient to constitute an acceptance of the counteroffer. The act of signing the counteroffer in this case failed to communicate the acceptance to Sherman or his agent and failed to put the acceptance out of the plaintiff\u2019s possession. It was, therefore, ineffective to create a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">When Sherman, through his agent, informed the plaintiff that the counteroffer was withdrawn, the plaintiff\u2019s power to accept the counteroffer no longer existed. 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 42. This was done before the plaintiff had properly accepted the counteroffer by transmitting the signed counteroffer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Renault. Accordingly, no enforceable contract between the parties was ever created.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and'the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> The defendants in this action are Adgraphics, Inc., and Edward Sherman, individually and as executor of the estate of Ellen Sherman. At all times relevant to this action, Edward Sherman acted on behalf of Adgraphics, Inc., in those capacities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
