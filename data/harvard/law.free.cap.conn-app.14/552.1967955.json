The trial court quashed the subpoena on the ground that the information sought was protected by the psychiatrist-patient privilege created by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The sole issue on appeal is whether General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (a) (10),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which authorizes the department of health to investigate members of the health profession, overrides the psychiatrist-patient privilege of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In holding that the legislature did not intend the psychiatrist-patient privilege to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>nullified by General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (a) (10), we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff, Julian Lieb, a physician licensed in this state, is engaged in the private practice of psychiatry. Lieb is on the faculty of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and is widely respected by those in the profession as a specialist in the treatment of depression. Several of the plaintiff\u2019s patients suffer from severe depressive disorders for which he has prescribed psychostimulant medication. On March 27, 1986, the department of health services (hereinafter department) requested that the plaintiff attend a \u201ccompliance conference,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a meeting which addresses the concerns of the profession. Specifically, the department sought information regarding the plaintiff\u2019s prescribing of the psychostimulant medication. Thq plaintiff voluntarily attended this conference where various prescriptions and the amount of medications prescribed were discussed. Subsequently, the department contacted six of the plaintiff\u2019s patients in an attempt to secure consent for their medical records for the department\u2019s records. The plaintiff, in an attempt to address the concerns of the department while protecting the confidentiality of his patients, provided blind case summaries from which the personal communications of the patients had been deleted. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to secure consent from the patients, the department issued a subpoena duces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>tecum to the plaintiff, requiring him to provide the complete patient records of five named patients, relevant medical records, notes, medication sheets, and medical releases provided by the patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On July 1,1986, the plaintiff moved pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-146f<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to quash the department\u2019s subpoena. The trial court, on September 2,1986, granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The defendant argues that the public policy concerns which enable the department to investigate the qualifications of licensed physicians supersede the psychiatrist-patient privilege. In support of its argument, the department cites <em>In re Board of Medical Review Investigation, </em>463 A.2d 1373 (R.I. 1983). The state legislature of Rhode Island had authorized the board to investigate allegations of professional misconduct within the medical field and a physician appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum. The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling, stating: \u201cA physician under investigation for professional misconduct subverts rather than supports the rights of the patient by distorting the patient\u2019s privilege to his own ends.\u201d Id., 1376. The defendant further maintains that General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> enumerates the situations in which consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of the patient is not required, specifically, subsection six which provides \u2018\u2018[communications or records may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>be disclosed to the commissioner of health services in connection with any inspection, investigation or examination of an institution . . . .\u201d We find that the defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">We begin our analysis by noting that in Connecticut there is no common law physician-patient privilege. <em>Zeiner </em>v. <em>Zeiner, </em>120 Conn. 161, 167, 179 A.2d 644 (1935) (\u201cinformation acquired by physicians in their professional capacity has never been privileged\u201d). Our legislature has created a privilege to cover \u201call oral and written communications and records thereof relating to diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s mental condition between the patient and psychiatrist, or between any of such persons and a person participating under the supervision of a psychiatrist in the accomplishment of the objectives of diagnosis and treatment, wherever made, including communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">An examination of the statutes concerning the privilege is determinative of the issue in this case. Communications between a psychiatrist and a patient \u201cshall be confidential and shall be subject to the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146j, inclusive. Except as provided in sections 52-146\u00cd to 52-146\u00cd, inclusive, no person may disclose or transmit any communications and records or the substance or any part or any resume thereof which identifies a patient to any person, corporation or governmental agency without the consent of the patient or his authorized representative.\u201d General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 52-146e (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the enactment of the privilege statute, our legislature anticipated circumstances in which disclosure might be appropriate. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd (1) through (6) dictates six statutory-exceptions to the privilege which, however, are inapplicable to this case. The defendant vigorously argues that the statutory exception of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd (6) quoted above is determinative of this case. The defendant\u2019s argument is incorrect as subsection (6) clearly applies to the investigation of institutions and not individual psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">This court has recently stated that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that courts are required to read a statute in light of its purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rado, </em>14 Conn. App. 322, 329, 541 A.2d 124 (1988). It is commonly understood that \u201cthe purpose of the privilege is to give to the patient an incentive to make full disclosure to a physician in order to obtain effective treatment free from the embarrassment and invasion of privacy which could result from a doctor\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 234-35, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975). In reviewing this statute, courts must presume that the legislature incorporated the purpose of the statute in every sentence, clause, phrase and item of punctuation of the statute. See B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 50. In this case, we must assume that if the legislature had intended to make the medical records of psychiatrists available to the department of health, it would have clearly and unequivocally expressed the intention to do so in the statutes. Requiring the judicial branch to create a procedure on a case by case basis is uncertain and undoubtedly unintended manner of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The defendant correctly argues that the exceptions to the psychiatrist-patient privilege \u201care not limited to those found in General Statutes \u00a7 52-146\u00cd.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 629, 424 A.2d 293 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 234. The defendant\u2019s claim, in substance, is that the department\u2019s statutory duty to conduct all necessary investigations of licensed physicians throughout the state constitutes a sufficient basis for an exception, in addition to those provided in \u00a7 52-146\u00cd, to the psychiatrist-patient privilege. The fact that the department, as licensing authority, is charged with the maintenance of health care standards pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-13e is not in dispute. Moreover, it is not in contention that the department has the power to issue subpoenas and \u201corder the production of books, records and documents\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (10).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These general provisions, however, do not permit the department to derogate the explicit statutory privilege between a psychiatrist and the patient. Our Supreme Court has held that, in construing two statutes, the clear language of a narrowly tailored provision is not to be superseded by the broad, general provisions of another statute. See, e.g., <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School Dist. No. </em>15, 169 Conn. 613, 363 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>1038 (1975). Furthermore, the general language providing the authority the power to carry out its duties is not specific enough to put a patient on notice that his or her communication with a psychiatrist would not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Furthermore, our holding today is substantiated by the department\u2019s failure to show reasonable cause for the production of complete patient records. Recently, the California Court of Appeals decided a case based on circumstances virtually identical to those in the present case. In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>166 Cal. App. 3d 1138, 1150, 212 Cal. Rptr. 811 (1985), the California medical quality board, similar to the department in the present case, conducted an investigation of physicians\u2019 practice of prescribing certain controlled substances. As in the present case, the board in <em>Wood </em>issued administrative subpoenas requiring the physician to produce complete medical records of certain named patients. The court overturned the trial court\u2019s order of compliance holding that the patient\u2019s privacy interests were invaded and that the board\u2019s showing was insufficient to sustain the omnibus demand for the complete medical records of the patients. The court concluded that: \u201cIf the trial court is to make the decision of reasonable cause other than as a rubber stamp the root facts upon which an inference of improper prescribing is based must be laid bare. Here we have some facts about the prescriptions and the conclusions of board personnel that they are suspicious but no mediating fact revealing why the conclusion is warranted. The board has made no evidentiary showing of how often physicians similarly situated to petitioners might prescribe these drugs. Alternatively, the board has made no showing of the likelihood that the prescriptions could have been properly issued, given what is known of the circumstances of issuance. Absent this information the trial court had no means by which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>gauge the likelihood that the records sought will reveal physician misconduct. Without this there can be no independent judicial assessment of good cause.\u201d Id. We hold that the trial court correctly granted the motion to quash because the defendant did not provide the trial court with probable cause for the desired medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We conclude by noting that the public interest in health care, combined with confidence in the initial and ongoing checks on qualifications of psychiatrists is abundantly clear. Despite these strong interests, we have no basis to establish an exception to the psychiatrist-patient privilege that has been created by our legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe department of health services shall have the following powers and duties with regard to the boards and commissions . . . which are within the department of health services.
