On July 29, 1985, at approximately 1 p.m., Thadeuz Rzap and Stephen Shields were released from Connecticut Valley Hospital following their treatment for alcoholism. The two men embarked on a drinking escapade which led them wandering throughout Middle-town. At approximately 1 a.m., they fell asleep in a grassy portion of Spears Park in Middletown.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Rzap was awakened when he and Shields were attacked by a Hispanic male and a black male. Both Rzap and Shields were beaten with a black stick, kicked and punched. As the attackers left their victims, a striking sound was heard in the vicinity of a wrought iron fence after a throwing movement by the taller man. Rzap fled from the park and called the police at a nearby newsstand. Rzap suffered welts to his arms and body with bruises on his forehead, while Shields was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>rendered unconscious and suffered a brain injury. Rzap\u2019s wallet, which was attached to a chain, and his sneakers were taken from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Officer Graig Elkin of the Middletown police department responded to the call by meeting Rzap at the newsstand and proceeded to Spears Park. At the scene, Elkin found Shields unconscious and unresponsive. A stick was discovered nearby, leaning against one of the walls of the park. As Officer Joseph Waite proceeded to the scene, he spotted two individuals, a black male and a shorter Hispanic male, who matched the descriptions provided by Elkin on the radio. Waite stopped the two individuals, identified as Michael Foster and the defendant, and patted them down. During the patdown, Waite discovered a chain running from the defendant\u2019s belt to a square object in his pocket. Waite proceeded to take the square object out of the defendant\u2019s pocket and, after looking through the object, which he determined was a wallet, he returned it. At this point, Officer David Cristiana arrived and observed Foster pulling his hands away from some bushes. Cristiana pulled a pair of sneakers out of the bushes and brought them to Spears Park where Rzap identified them as the ones taken from him during the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The defendant and Foster agreed to accompany Waite to Spears Park. After discussing the missing wallet with Rzap, Waite again patted down the defendant but did not feel either the chain or square object. Ten minutes later, Waite returned to the scene of the first patdown and found a wallet on the ground with a chain attached to it five feet from the patdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">At trial, Rzap identified the wallet as the one taken from him during the assault. The state introduced photographs of the bushes where the sneakers had been found, and of Spears Park. In addition to the photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>graphs, the state introduced into evidence the stick found near the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In his first claim of error, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict of assault in the first degree against Shields and assault in the second degree and robbery in the first degree against Rzap. The defendant maintains, inter alia, that no identification of him was established, that there was a failure to connect the stick with the offenses and that there was a lack of causation between Shield\u2019s injury and the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The defendant was convicted of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 53a-8,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with respect to victim Shields. \u201c \u2018When a claim on appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we undertake a two part task. We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. We then determine whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 116, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Summerville, </em>13 Conn. App. 175, 184-85, 535 A.2d 818 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Applying this standard to the record before us, we conclude that the evidence reasonably supports the jury\u2019s conclusion. An eyewitness testified that both victims were kicked and beaten by a tall black male and a shorter Hispanic male. The defendant and Foster were picked up in the vicinity of Spears Park shortly after the incident. It was a reasonable inference that the defendant was present at the assault since the sneakers and wallet were at the scene where he was originally stopped by the police. The state did not have to connect the stick with the defendant since it was not a necessary element of the offense. Likewise, the state did not have to prove that the defendant brandished the stick, even if it were an element of the offense, since the defendant was being charged as an accessory.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The defendant was convicted of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with respect to victim Rzap. Rzap sustained welts on his back and arms with bruises on his forehead from being punched, kicked and hit with a stick-like object. In addition to being assaulted, Rzap was robbed of his wallet and sneakers. It is important to note that the defendant was charged as an accessory to the assault and, therefore, the state did not have to prove that he actually beat the victim with the stick. Moreover, it was not necessary to prove that the defendant wielded the stick during the robbery, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the accessory statute applies to any participant in the crime. Using the above standard in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence, we conclude that the jury could readily have inferred that the defendant was guilty of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error entails a speedy trial issue. The defendant claims that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the matter due to the state\u2019s failure to prosecute in a timely manner. The defendant was arrested and incarcerated on July 30, 1985. An information was filed on July 31, 1985. On April 8,1986, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 956B (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> claiming that eight months had elapsed since his arrest without a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The trial court, on May 20,1986, denied the motion determining there were eighty-seven days which could be excluded in calculating the eight months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant argues that retroactive computation of time was improper and, additionally, that only the actual days when the hearings were held should be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 956C provides that any \u201cdelay resulting from the hearing on any pretrial motion\u201d is excluded in computing the time within which a trial shall commence under \u00a7 956B. Practice Book \u00a7 6 provides that the rules are to be liberally construed. The rules, however, do not provide that excludable time notations be made simultaneously by the trial court or be waived. Moreover, there is nothing in the rules that limits delays resulting from a hearing to the hearing time itself. In the interest of reading the rules liberally, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of error is that the trial court erred by improperly admitting into evidence a stick found near the scene of the crimes charged. Specifically, the defendant argues that the introduction of the stick was irrelevant and prejudicial. Evidence is relevant if it \u201c \u2018tends to establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 168, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987). Determinations of relevancy are within the broad discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned in the absence of clear abuse of discretion. Id., 167-68. In making such determinations, a trial court is not required to find as a prerequisite to admissibility that evidence is conclusively linked to other evidence. \u201cEvidence is not rendered inadmissible simply because it is not conclusive. It is admissible if it tends to support a relevant fact even in a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative. . . . The defendant\u2019s objection goes essentially to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 548-49, 498 A.2d 76 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In the present case, the introduction of the stick into evidence was necessary to support \u201crelevant facts\u201d in the crimes charged. The defendant was convicted of committing assault in the second degree and robbery in the first degree. Both of the crimes share the common element of the use of a dangerous instrument. Rzap testified that he was struck repeatedly with a \u201cblack stick.\u201d This testimony is evidence of the dangerous instrument element of the crimes. Moreover, the stick is relevant in that it corroborates Rzap\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Furthermore, the admission of the stick into evidence was not unduly prejudicial. The defendant\u2019s argument that the stick, because it is real evidence, has a greater impact on the jury without any probativeness, is incorrect. It is well established that relevant evidence may be excluded if its capacity to prejudice outweighs its probativeness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). \u201cTo the extent that the evidence tended to prejudice the defendant, it was for the trial court, in the exercise of judicial discretion, to decide whether the probative value of the testimony outweighed the prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 129, 422 A.2d 749 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 Conn. 328, 333, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1980). Our Supreme Court has adopted four situations from C. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 185, pp. 439-40, in which the potential prejudicial effect of a particular piece of evidence would suggest its exclusion. \u201cThese are: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982). None of these dangers is present here. The defendant\u2019s assertion that the admission of the stick created a side issue is incorrect because the stick merely corroborated other evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 435 A.2d 3 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In his fourth claim of error, the defendant argues that Waite should not have been allowed to testify as to the discovery of the wallet lying on the ground within five feet of the initial stop of the defendant. The trial court, after hearing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress any testimony regarding the observation of the wallet, the removal and return of the wallet to the defendant, questioning about the wallet, and the discovery of the wallet, ruled that the initial patdown was legal, but the subsequent search was improper. The result of the court\u2019s ruling was that the wallet was admissible, but Waite\u2019s taking of the wallet out of the defendant\u2019s pocket was inadmissible. Specifically, the defendant claims that the police found the wallet only by exploiting an illegal search, making the wallet tainted and that there was no evidence that the wallet would have been inevitably discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u201cUnder the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the \u2018fruit\u2019 of prior police illegality. <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 485. All evidence is not, however, a \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have been discovered but for the illegal action of law enforcement officials. Id., 487-88; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 655, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 464 A.2d 758 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>(1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). \u2018Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d \u2019 <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 488, quoting Maguire, Evidence of Guilt (1959) p. 221.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 619-20, 522 A.2d 788 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The police would have discovered the wallet \u201cindependent[ly] of any constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 443, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 81 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1984). The inevitable discovery rule as set forth in <em>Nix </em>and followed by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 433, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986), holds that evidence is admissible if it would have been discovered regardless of the illegal search. \u201cTo qualify for admissibility the state must demonstrate that the lawful means which made discovery inevitable ... were being actively pursued <em>prior </em>to the occurrence of the constitutional violation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. The United States Supreme Court stressed in <em>Nix </em>that the inevitable discovery rule is fair in that it \u201cplacfes] the State and the accused in the same positions they would have been in had the impermissible conduct not taken place.\u201d <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In the present case, it is clear that Waite believed that the defendant possessed a wallet as a result of the original, legal patdown. Waite\u2019s belief came from the original patdown when he felt the chain and square object, and independent of the subsequent illegal search. When the wallet disappeared it was logical for Waite to retrace his steps to where he had last encountered it. Furthermore, the sneakers were discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>prior to the illegal search and the police in photographing the area of the original patdown would have discovered the wallet by lawful means. As in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 472, 100 S. Ct. 1244, 63 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1980), \u201cthe toxin in this case was injected only after the evidentiary bud had blossomed; the fruit served at trial was not poisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In his final claim of error, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of robbery in the third degree<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and larceny in the second degree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A criminal defendant is entitled to a charge on a lesser offense, if and only if, the following conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that an instruction on third degree robbery should have been, given is incorrect. Despite getting past the first two prongs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>test, the defendant has failed to meet the requirements of the fourth prong. The defendant claims that the dangerous instrument (i.e., the stick) was never sufficiently identified and connected with the offenses. Furthermore, the defendant alleges that there was no evidence of the use of a dangerous instrument. The use of the stick constitutes a dangerous instrument which distinguishes first degree robbery from third degree robbery. Moreover, an examination of the record indicates that the robbery did not occur without the use of this dangerous instrument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, 5 </em>Conn. App. 40, 45-46, 496 A.2d 533 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Although the defendant requested a lesser included offense request on larceny in the second degree, he based the request on simple larceny. Robbery in the first degree, the actual charge, entails simple larceny. Larceny from the person is a separate and distinct offense from that of simple larceny. Second degree larceny requires an actual, trespass to the person of the victim. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-4), </em>1 Conn. App. 642, 645, 474 A.2d 485 (1984). One could, however, commit larceny in the first degree without committing a trespass to the victim. Therefore, the second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>is not satisfied and the trial court did not err in failing to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when . . .
