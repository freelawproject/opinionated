The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in failing, in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 711 and in violation of his constitutional right to due process of law, to inform him during the plea' canvass of the maximum possible sentence and the elements of each crime with which he was charged, and (2) in failing to use the correct standard of proof in granting the state\u2019s amended request to correct the transcripts of the plea canvass.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to apprise him of the elements of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The disposition of this issue is controlled by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>8 Conn. App. 491, 513 A.2d 193 (1986), cert. denied, 203 Conn. 801, 522 A.2d 293 (1987). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>we interpreted the constitutional stricture that a plea of guilty must be knowingly and voluntarily made; <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); as requiring not only that there be a voluntary waiver during a plea canvass of the right to a jury trial, the right of confrontation and the right against self-incrimination, but also that the defendant \u201cmust be aware of and have an under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>standing of all of the elements of the crime or crimes with which he is charged . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>supra, 494B. Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 711 (1) requires that a trial court not accept a guilty plea until it is satisfied that the defendant \u201cfully understands . . . [t]he nature of the charge to which the plea is offered . . . .\u201d \u201cThe provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 711 are mandatory when challenged on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>supra, 494B.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The record clearly discloses that the defendant was not informed by the trial court during the plea canvass of the essential elements of the crimes with which he was charged. We find error because of this failure to inform the defendant. Since we find error in this regard, we need not address the defendant\u2019s other claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">There is error, the judgments are set aside and the cases are remanded with direction to permit the defendant to withdraw his guilty pleas and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> The defendant did not raise this claim in the trial court. Because the error claimed by the defendant involves the violation of a fundamental constitutional right, however, we will consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 417, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S.
