The amended complaint alleged two grounds for termination of the father\u2019s parental rights: abandonment; and the absence of an ongoing parent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>child relationship. The court concluded that the petitioner had failed to prove her complaint by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\">The trial court properly considered and followed General Statutes \u00a7 45-61f (f). On the basis of its findings of fact, the court concluded that there had been no abandonment because the respondent had maintained a reasonable degree of interest, concern and responsibility for his child by his visitations, gifts and cards. See <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn. App. 194, 196, 504 A.2d 532 (1986). The court also correctly concluded that the child and the respondent have an ongoing parent-child relationship. See <em>In re Rayna M., </em>13 Conn. App. 23, 35, 534 A.2d 897 (1987); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 479, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">After a thorough review of the record and briefs, and having afforded the petitioner\u2019s additional claims of error the appropriate scope of review, we conclude that there is no merit to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
