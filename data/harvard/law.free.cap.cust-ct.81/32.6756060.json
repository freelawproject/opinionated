The merchandise was classified by the government under item 149.28 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), as modified by T.D. 68-9, which covers .plums, prunes, and prunelles, otherwise prepared or preserved, and assessed with duty at the rate of 17.5% ad valorem) Plaintiff chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>lenges this classification and claims the imported merchandise is properly classifiable as \u201cplums [prunes] dried\u201d under item 149.26, dutiable at the rate of 2j\u00a3 per pound.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The provisions of TSUS pertinent to the classification and claim are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Schedule 1, Part 9, Subpart B</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0W\">\n<em>Subpart B head-note:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">1.

Defendant, on the other hand, argues that the merchandise is not \u201cdried prunes\u201d as that term is used in the commerce of the United States and, hence, is not within the common meaning of the tariff term \u201cprunes * * * dried,\u201d as used in item 149.26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, according to defendant, the imported merchandise is otherwise preserved than by drying, desiccation or evaporation, and was thus properly classified under item 149.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">To the extent relevant to the present motions, the record consists of the pleadings; revised interrogatories directed by plaintiff to Francis M. Y. Wong, sales manager of the shipper herein, Mee Chun Canning Co. of Hong Kong; cross-interrogatories directed by defendant to Mr. Wong; five affidavits proffered by defendant; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>exhibit which is a copy of a March 20, 1973 letter ruling of Customs (ORE ruling 73-0364, abstracted as T.D. 73-262(25)) to the effect that prunes made from the fresh fruit which have been soaked in salt water and then sun dried are classifiable under item 149.28 as prunes otherwise prepared or preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We now turn to the cross-motions which present the question as to whether the merchandise in issue is properly classifiable under item 149.26, as claimed by plaintiff, or under item 149.28, as assessed by the government. As to this, we note first that Mr. Wong, the sales manager of the shipper, the Mee Chun Canning Co. of Hong Kong (Mee Chun), described via answers to interrogatories and cross-interrogatories the manner in which the imported merchandise was processed prior to shipment to the United States. From his answers to these interrogatories and an affidavit of Mr. Doemeny, the following undisputed facts appear:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The imported merchandise consists of dried salted plums grown in Japan, Taiwan or Mainland China and purchased by Mee Chun in Hong Kong. Before shipment to Hong Kong, the fresh plums (prunes) were immersed in a salt water solution for at least 14 days and then put in the sun for drying. These semi-dried plums were shipped to Hong Kong where they were exposed to the sun for further drying by Mee Chun prior to shipment to the United States. If the semi-salted dry plums received by Mee Chun did not contain sufficient salt they were soaked in salt water for 14 days. On occasion, Mee Chun purchased fresh plums (prunes), in which case they were placed in dry salt at the ratio of 30-35 pounds of salt per 100 pounds of plums. The imported merchandise which was subjected to the two separate preparative or preservative operations of brining and drying contained 44.1% salt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It is in this context that we determine the common meaning of the term \u201cdried prunes\u201d bearing in mind that it is axiomatic in customs jurisprudence that the common meaning of a tariff term is presumed to be the same as its commercial meaning unless the contrary is shown. So considered, it is clear from the affidavits submitted by the defendant that the imported merchandise is <em>not </em>within the common meaning of the tariff term \u201cprunes * * * dried\u201d since the merchandise is not \u201cdried prunes\u201d as that term is used in the commerce of the United States. Thus the uncontradicted affidavits of Professor Miller,, Mr. Dada, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Miller establish that brining is not-a treatment normally involved in the drying of prunes in the United States. Rather, dry prunes result from the drying of fresh prune-plums, by a process consisting of heat and air, or heat and water,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>followed by dehydration.. Chemical additives are not used other than as a mold inhibitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">To similar import is the following statement with respect to \u201cdried prunes\u201d in the <em>Summaries of Trade and Tariff </em>Information, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">Prunes are certain varieties of plums, which have a firm flesh and a high sugar content that makes them adaptable to drying. The bulk of the prunes grown in the United States are dried * * *. <em>Virtually all dried prunes are forced-air dried in dehydrating tunnels. </em>* * * [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The defendant\u2019s affiants are also in accord that a dried prune that had been salted prior to drying so as to contain approximately 44% salt \u2014 as is the case here \u2014 would not be a dried prune which would meet the standards for dried prunes as established by the United States Department of Agriculture.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Professor Miller stated that the high salt content would make the fruit more than mere dried prunes. Mr. Dada expressed the opinion that a prune product which had a salt content of 44% would not be a dried prune, but one \u201cpreserved in part due to its being salted prior to being dried.\u201d Professor Miller added that a product identified as \u201cdried, salted prunes\u201d is not merely a dried fruit product, but one which has been otherwise prepared or preserved due to brining.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Significantly, Mr. Wong also recognized that there is a difference between a \u201cdried plum\u201d and a \u201csalted dried plum.\u201d In response to cross-interrogatory 10, Mr. Wong used different Chinese characters to identify the terms \u201cdried plum\u201d and \u201csalted dried plum.\u201d Further, Mr. Wong conceded in response to cross-interrogatory 12 that: \u201cIt would be misleading and incorrect to describe 'salted dried plums\u2019 merely as \u2018dried plums.\u2019 \u201d Thus, it cannot be disputed that labeling the instant merchandise as \u201cplums * * * dried\u201d would be misleading and incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">It is to be added that plaintiff does not challenge the fact that the importations are preserved. Father, it argues that as between the term \u201cdried\u201d and the term \u201cotherwise prepared or preserved,\u201d the courts have always held that the former is more specific than the latter. In this connection, plaintiff places major reliance on the following language in <em>Kwan Yuen Company et al. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>31 Cust. Ct. 192, 196, C.D. 1569 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">* * * the term \u201cdried\u201d is more specific than the term \u201cprepared or preserved,\u201d and merchandise which has been dried and additionally processed by such operations as cutting, shredding, or powdering, is classified as dried, rather than as prepared or preserved. <em>United States</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">Dried primes are prepared from sound, properly matured prune plums from which the greater portion of moisture is removed hy drying. The dried prunes are cleaned to assure a wholesome product; they may he treated with water or steam; and a safe and suitable preservative may be added. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>v. <em>Aki Co., </em>12 Ct. Cust. Appls. 415, T.D. 40588 (fish, skinned, boned, and dried); <em>F. H. Shallus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>18 C.C.P.A. (Customs) 332, T.D. 44585 (egg albumen, dried and broken into pieces); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Enbun Co., </em>19 C.C.P.A. (Customs) 79, T.D. 45224 (fish, dried and shaved or shredded); <em>United States </em>v. <em>D. L. Moss &amp; Co., </em>22 C.C.P.A. (Customs) 249, T.D. 47159 (egg albumen, dried and powdered); <em>F. F. G. Harper &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>27 C.C.P.A (Customs) 9, C.A.D. 53 (flake whole egg and flake egg yolk, dehydrated, \u201cscreened\u201d into flakes, and kept in freezing temperatures); <em>Jacques Missir </em>v. <em>United States, </em>65 Treas. Dec. 941, T.D. 47093 (figs, boiled, dried, and subjected to steam and carbon dioxide); <em>Naumes Forwarding Service </em>v. <em>United States, </em>24 Cust. Ct. 93, C.D. 1214 (chestnuts, dried and shelled).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">But there is a fundamental difficulty with this argument. The difficulty is that the present importations, for reasons already discussed, do not fall within the common meaning of the term \u201cdried prunes\u201d as used in item 149.26 and hence no question of relative specificity is involved at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Nor does <em>F. F. G. Harper </em>&amp; <em>Co., Inc., et al. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>27 CCPA 9, C.A.D. 53 (1939) \u2014 on which plaintiff also relies \u2014 support plaintiff\u2019s position in the instant case. In <em>Harper, </em>dried and flaked egg yolk was held to be properly classifiable as dried egg yolk notwithstanding that the merchandise had been frozen. In <em>Harper </em>the processing done was normal and incidental to the accepted commercial procedure for producing the end product. 27 CCPA at 11. In the present case, however, the affidavits of Mr. Miller, Mr. Dada, Mr. Dunham and Professor Miller establish that the brining of the prunes is not a normal part of the commercial process used to produce dried prunes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In sum, since the prunes have undergone two separate and distinct preservative processes they were properly classified by the government under item 149.28 which covers plums, prunes, and prunelles \u201cotherwise prepared or preserved\u201d rather than as prunes \u201cdried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment is granted, and the action is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-16\"> \u201cPrunes are certain varieties of plums, which have a firm flesh and a high sugar content that makes them adaptable to drying.\u201d <em>Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information </em>(Schedule 1, Vol. 8, 1969), p. 249. To the same effect prunes are defined in the standard dictionaries as plums capable of being or that have, been dried without fermenting or spoiling. See, e.g., <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(College Ed., 1966); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1968); Winburne, <em>A Dictionary of Agricultural and Allied Terminology </em>(1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-18\"> Affidavits relied upon by defendant were executed by Paul A.

Thus, the court in <em>Border </em>Brokerage.concluded that blanching did not make the imported vegetables \u201cprepared other than by the process required for freezing.\u201d 60 Cust. Ct. at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Similarly, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Enbun Co., </em>60 Treas. Dec. 733, T.D. 45224 (1931) (dried, unsalted fish which had been shaved or shredded, held to be \u201cdried fish\u201d) and <em>F. H.

The processing done in those cases was a normal, accepted commercial procedure <em>required </em>in the production of the end product. Clearly, the merchandise in the present action was preserved in part prior to its being dried due to its immersion in salt water. Thus, the brining procedure may not be considered incidental to the production of the end product, i.e., dry, salted prunes. For, as pointed out above, the brining step is not a normal accepted commercial procedure involved in the production of dried prunes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
