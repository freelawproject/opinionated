Upon liquidation dumping duties ranging from $8.26 to $11.42 per long-ton were assessed by customs. These duties were equal to the difference between the foreign market value as defined in section 205 of the Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 164 (1970), and the purchase price as defined in section 203 of said act, 19 U.S.C. 162 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">The parties agree there is no issue concerning the purchase price of $46 (U.S.) per long ton. Plaintiff, however, contends there is no foreign market value within the meaning of section 205 <em>supra, </em>and the absence of a foreign market value requires the use of constructed value as prescribed by section 206 of said act, as amended <em>supra, </em>19 U.S.C. 165 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>(1970). Plaintiff alleges the use of constructed value in making the comparison with the purchase price should have been used in determining the existence and extent of any dumping margins. The constructed value, plaintiff contends, is $57.15 (Canadian) per long ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The pertinent statutory provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">Statutes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">The Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">Section 205, 19 U.S.C. 164 (1970):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">Determination of foreign market value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">For the purposes of sections 160 to 171 of this title the foreign market value of imported merchandise shall be the price, at the time of exportation of such merchandise to the United States, at which. such or similar merchandise is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale in the principal markets of the country from which exported, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption (or, if not so sold or offered for sale for home consumption, or if the Secretary determines that the quantity sold for home consumption is so small in relation to the quantity sold for exportation to countries other than the United States as to form an inadequate basis for comparison, then the price at which so sold or offered for sale for exportation to countries other than the United States), plus, when not included in such price, the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition ~packed ready for shipment to the United States, except that in the case of merchandise purchased or agreed to be purchased by the person by whom or for whose account the merchandise is imported, prior to the time of exportation, the foreign market value shall be ascertained as of the date of such purchase or agreement to purchase.

and paid, in addition to any other duties imposed thereon by law, a special dumping duty in an amount equal to such difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The record consists of seven exhibits introduced on behalf of plaintiff, the receipt in evidence, without being marked, of the official papers, and a stipulation between counsel that there were only three producers of pig iron in Canada, i.e., Comineo, Ltd., Algoma Steel \u25a0Corp., Ltd., and Quebec Iron and Titanium Corp. Plaintiff does not dispute the purchase price as it appears on the official court papers which was utilized by customs officials in determining the dumping duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">It is plaintiff\u2019s position that \"foreign market value\u201d as set forth in \u25a0section 205 of said act <em>supra </em>does not exist, and accordingly Customs \u2022should have utilized constructed value as set forth in section 206 <em>supra </em>in determining the applicability of dumping duties. In support of this position plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1 was introduced into evidence. Said exhibit is an affidavit of Michael C. D. Hobbs, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Canada Steel, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Comineo, Ltd.; the manufacturer of the pig iron involved. herein. Mr. Hobbs\u2019 affidavit states that Western Canada Steel, Ltd., handled all sales of pig iron for its parent company until production was discontinued. Said company served as marketing agent for all sales in Canada and sold for export to the United States to Associated Metals &amp; Minerals Corp. of New York (the actual importer herein \u2014 Harold Elton Ladwig \u2014 being a customhouse broker). Attached to said affidavit is a copy of a letter addressed to George Bronz, the deceased partner of counsel for plaintiff, from Mr. Hobbs of Western Canada Steel, as well as a list of home sales of pig iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The letter indicates the termination of the production of pig iron was the result of an explosion and fire which destroyed their furnace; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and reconstruction was not contemplated. It was also indicated with respect to prices in the home market that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">Our prices in the Canadian market have varied based upon a number of factors which we take into account, but there is no-regular price structure in terms of class of customer, quantity or other factors which are specifically definable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">All our sales are made on a delivered price basis, per long ton,, and all money amounts are given in Canadian currency. No-discounts are allowed. As shown in the tabulation, these prices include freight, and a standard $1 allowance per long ton for sales commission. The quality of the merchandise sold in the home market is the same as that sold for export to the United States. There is no financial relationship,_ directly or indirectly, between this company and any purchaser in Canada.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Based upon this information plaintiff contends, since there is no one price at which all could purchase the merchandise from Comineo in the home market, foreign value does not exist and therefore customs should have used constructed value to determine whether dumping duties are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Such evidence under the statutory provisions governing dumping duties and foreign value in particular as reflected in the statute is insufficient to overcome the presumption of correctness attaching to the action of customs. 28 U.S.C. 2635 (1970). Unless and until the challenging party introduces evidence to meet every material issue the value found by customs remains unrebutted. <em>Brooks Paper Company </em>v. <em>United States, </em>40 CCPA 38, C.A.D. 495 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The statutory definition of \u201csuch or similar\u201d contained in 19 U.S.C. 170a must be considered when ascertaining whether a foreign value exists. The parties have stipulated that there were two other producers of pig iron in Canada. There appears to be no dispute that pig iron of the same grade produced in Canada by the other producers is \u201clike the merchandise under consideration in component material or materials and in the purpose for which used, and approximately equal in commercial value to the merchandise under consideration\u201d as reflected in 19 U.S.C. 170a(3) (C) and (D). Additionally, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2 indicates sales to Japan by the shipper. The record is silent on sales to Japan, both as to quantity and price which may be pertinent in determining foreign value under the Antidumping Act. <em>J. H. Cottman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>20 CCPA 344, T.D. 46114 (1932), <em>red'd on other grounds, </em>23 CCPA 378, T.D. 48296 (1936). Varying prices without an explanation of the statement that \u201cthere is no regular price structure\u201d is insufficient to establish there is no one price at which all could purchase. As a matter of fact, the sales listed in exhibit 1 indicate 28 sales made at the appraised prices or approximately 32 percent of said sales. The record is- also silent on the question of sales or offers by the two other producing companies. <em>Nichols &amp; Company,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>59 CCPA 67, C.A.D. 1041 (1972). No attempt was made to ascertain this information. Letters were directed to the other two companies only with respect to general expenses and profits. See exhibits 3-6\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In view of the foregoing it is unnecessary to consider whether plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to establish constructed value. The appraised values not having been overcome are sustained. The dumping duties have therefore been properly assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Judgment will be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
