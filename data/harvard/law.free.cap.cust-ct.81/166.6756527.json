The defendant in opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment points out that plaintiff, contrary to rule 8.2(b) of this court, has not annexed to its motion for summary judgment a statement of material facts as to which there is no genuine issue for trial, and urges that significant factual matters divide the parties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>that therefore summary judgment should be denied. I uphold the defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In addition to plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with this court\u2019s rules, as aforesaid, it is noted that the crux of plaintiff\u2019s case appears to be that the imported golf sets come within the \u201cjunior edition\u201d principle. One of the cases relied on by plaintiff is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Field &amp; Co., </em>12 Ct. Cust. Appls. 543, T.D. 40738 (1925) wherein tenpins and ninepins had been classified as toys. The predecessor of this court held<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the merchandise was more properly classifiable under section 1402 of the Tariff Act of 1922 as \u201c * * * all other balls, of whatever material composed, * * * designed for use in physical exercise or in any indoor or outdoor game or sport, and all clubs, rackets, bats, or other equipment, such as is ordinarily used in conjunction therewith in exercise or play.\u201d The Court of Customs Appeals in affirming the judgment that the merchandise was not \u201ctoys\u201d wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">It is apparent from the description of the dimensions of the pins and balls that the articles are not mere playthings. They are of sufficient size to require that they be used in the playing of the game for which they were designed in order to afford amusement to children. These articles may be said, figuratively speaking, to be \u201cjunior editions\u201d of like articles used by adults in the playing of the game of \u201ctenpins\u201d or \u201cninepins\u201d rather than miniatures of such articles, so small as to be unfitted for use as ninepins or tenpins, and intended.to be used and actually used only as mere playthings for the amusement of children. [12 Ct. Cust. Appls. 545.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The Court continued (p. 545):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\"><em>The undisputed evidence </em>establishes that the imported merchandise is used by children in the playing of a game known as \u2022\u2018\u2018tenpins\u201d or \u201cninepins.\u201d * * * [Italics added.]'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The critical words are the emphasized first three. In the case at bar, no evidence at all has been adduced. This shortcoming plagues all of plaintiff\u2019s comparisons to decided decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">In plaintiff\u2019s cited case of <em>Mego Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>75 Cust. Ct. 108, C.D. 4614, 405 F. Supp. 1088, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>63 CCPA 125 (1975), it is true the question facing the court was the classification of \u201cjunior\u201d baseball gloves and boxing gloves. While the court did uphold, the \u201cjunior edition\u201d principle, some- witnesses testified and many exhibits were introduced. Here, there simply is no such record on which I may rely. Similarly, plaintiff\u2019s cited case of <em>New York Merchandise Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>62 Cust. Ct. 38, C.D. 3671; 294 F. Supp. 971; <em>appeal dismissed, </em>56 CCPA 133 (1969), was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>submitted on- a motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, defendant in its answer has specifically denied paragraphs 6 and 7 of plaintiff\u2019s complaint wherein it is alleged the articles are \u201cjunior ' edition\u201d golf sets and that the articles are suitable for use by children in a regular or organized game of golf.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">As defendant has stated: \u201cA question of fact remains as to whether the merchandise in issue is of such quality and character as is ordinarily used in the serious pursuit of the game of golf, and whether such is suitable for use in organized play of golf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">See also <em>The American Greiner Electronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>77 Cust. Ct. 164, 166, C.R.D. 76-9 (1976), wherein on a summary judgment motion it was stated: \u201cSince there are material differences be- - tween plaintiff and defendant with respect to relevant facts, * * '* defendant should not be summarily cut off from its right to a full scale trial of the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">For all these reasons, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u2022 should be denied. The case should be calendared for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AI7\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\"> <em>Marshall Field &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>45 Treas.
