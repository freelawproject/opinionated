The tr\u00e1ck tread, in its condition as imported, is cut to length and p\u00e9rf\u00f3rat\u00e9d' with holes in a specific pattern. After importation, the track tread is assembled with grouser bars, back plates, and nuts and bolt\u00e1, to make a crawler tread which is then attached to the motor vehicle,</p>\n<p id=\"b14-10\">.'Similar 'merchandise w;as before the court in <em>Flex Track Equipment, Ltd. v. United States, </em>65 Cust. Ct. 119, C.D. 4063 (1970), <em>aff\u2019d, United States v. Flex Track Equipment, Ltd., </em>59 CCPA 97, C.A.D. 1046 (1972), wherein the courts held the merchandise to be-\u201cmore than\u201d \u201cbelting \u00f3r belts, for machinery\u201d as provided for in TSXJS item 358.10 (redesig-nated as item 358.06) as classified in liquidation, and properly classifiable as'claimed by the importer as '\u201cparts of the foregoing motor vehicles\u201d under TSUS item 692.25 (redesignated as item 692.27)\u2019. The same issue is raised anew here following the Government\u2019s limitation of the holding in C.A.D. 1046 to the entry before the court in that case (see T.D. 72-283).</p>\n<p id=\"b14-11\">In the instant case the parties have stipulated that the merchandise is a processed article cut to a specified length from a material of woven ply vegetable fiber and rubber, 'that the article is 15\" in'width and punched with nine 16\" holes evenly spaced 4%\" apart, three across the width, in three rows of either 82 or 67 holes each throughout the length, .that the merchandise was, and similar merchandise is, ordinarily produced in accordance with standardized specifications, and, ,as previously indicated, that the imported merchandise is similar in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>all material' respects to the merchandise the subject of decision in C.D. 4063 and C.A.D. 1046. Plaintiff rests its case on the record in the <em>Flex Track </em>.case which was incorporated into the record in the instant case, and moves for judgment in its favor under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>Defendant opposes the motion on the basis of what it contends is \u201cnew evidence\u201d by means of which it seeks to avoid application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-4\">Defendant\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d consists of the testimony of two industry witnesses and numerous samples of flat belting, together with some documentary exhibits. The testimony of the witnesses is directed toward three types of flat belting, i.e., conveyor-belting for moving bulk materials, elevator belting for lifting bulk materials in a vertical \u25a0direction, and transmission belting for transmitting power from a flat-faced pulley to another flat-faced pulley, general agreement with various definitions of the terms \u201cbelting\u201d and \u201cbelts\u201d, identification of examples of conveyor and elevator belting which are punched with holes or equipped with cleats or ribs for particular applications, and personal appraisals of the imported merchandise as identifying either with a transmission-type belt or an elevator-type belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">Directing his attention to the imported merchandise, the witness Raymond G. Moore, product manager of the flat belting division of B. F. Goodrich, testified on cross-examination (R. 74):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b15-6\">Q. Mr. - Moore, regarding the imported merchandise, you stated your belief that you would term this to be a piece cut from a-belt, is that correct? \u2014 -A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b15-7\">\u25a0 Q. What ,kind o.f a belt would you consider this? . Would, you consider it a conveyor belt? \u2014 A. I would now consider it as .a track belt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">And in the same vein, the witness David Wiese, a' \u201ctechnical man\u201d for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, testified on cross-examination (R. 131): '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b15-9\">Q. You were here in court this morning,? \u2014 A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b15-10\">Q. And you heard the description that this is assembled together, two pieces 33 feet long, side by side, assembled with grouser bars, bolts, and plates. We have- two individual' pieces connected together with metal bands. Would you consider 'that a complete track tread assembly? Would you. consider that either \u00e1 belt or belting? \u2014 -A. I would consider-it belting, yes. A belt, rather, if it is on a machine. A belt. ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b15-11\">Neither of these witnesses testified as to any personal knowledge of or experience with the use of the imported material on the type of motor vehicle machinery for which it was intended. \u25a0- \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b15-12\">In <em>Flex Track </em>the trial court- called attention to the testimony of one of two witnesses who testified in the case. The court noted, (p. 123):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b15-13\">\u201cMr. Agassiz acknowledged that he referred to the material from which the. imported merchandise was processed as belting or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tread (R. 20), and that the imported merchandise is sold as \u2018belts', \u2018track treads\u2019, or \u2018track belts\u2019. (R. 24, 25.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b16-4\">And earlier in the opinion the court had referred to two letters (exhibits A and B) authored by the same witness in which he had referred to the imported merchandise as \u201ctrack treads or belts\u201d. Notwithstanding this evidence the court went on in <em>Flex Track </em>to hold \u201cthat the imported articles, designed as they are for a special purpose, are more than belting for machinery within the commonly accepted meaning of that term\u201d. The court pointed out that the common meaning of the term belting for machinery is defined as \u201ca flexible kind of material passing over two or more wheels to transmit power in machinery\u201d, \u201cserving to communicate motion from one part to another\u201d and \u201ca conveyor of sorts\u201d. The court noted that the imported merchandise was specially designed to do much more than transmit motion when used on motor vehicle machinery, i.e., to give the motor vehicle support, traction, and stability.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">These findings were affirmed on appeal. Our appellate court said (p. 100), \u201cWe agree with the court that the imported articles were designed and processed to incorporate features that serve multiple functions which, in the language of that court, \u2018in sum, characterize the particular article more than any single feature or function.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">In resisting plaintiff\u2019s motion for application of the rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>made at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant argues, among other things (brief, p. 20), \u201cMr. Agassiz, plaintiff\u2019s first witness in <em>Flex Track </em>had no expertise as to the commercial use of the terms \u2018belts\u2019 and/or \u2018belting.\u2019 In fact, no testimony was elicited from Mr. Agassiz as to the commercial meanings of those terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">The court finds the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>to be applicable here, and, accordingly, sustains plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment. In the court\u2019s opinion defendant\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d is <em>cumulative. </em>Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the testimony of the witness Agassiz in <em>Flex Track </em>to which the trial court called attention as aforesaid had a bearing on the <em>commercial meaning </em>of the terms \u201cbelting\u201d and \u201cbelts\u201d, and as such, the record in that case cannot be said to be devoid of such evidence. In fact, the Agassiz testimony may properly be said to be more <em>qualitative </em>on the subject of commercial meaning than that tendered by defendant\u2019s witnesses in the instant case, in view of the fact that it was related to the mode of buying and selling of the imported merchandise and the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses is not so related. The testimony of these witnesses (like the numerous exhibits introduced into the instant record) relates to conventional forms of belting and belts with which the witnesses are familiar, and on the basis of which, they gave opinions concerning the imported merchandise. However, these opinions were in conflict insofar as concerns the comparative relationship between the imported material and various conventional forms of belting. Consequently, in the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>view it was never established through the \u201cnew evidence\u201d that the imported material is in fact any one of these conventional forms of belting.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-4\">It is well settled that <em>cumulative </em>and <em>conflicting </em>evidence will not suffice to avoid application of the rule of <em>stare decisis. United States </em>v. <em>Dodge &amp; Olcott, Inc., </em>47 CCPA 100, 103, C.A.D. 737 (1960); <em>John C. Rogers &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>63 CCPA 10, 11, C.A.D. 1158 (1975). And in the absence of a clear and convincing showing of error in the instant record application of this doctrine here is salutary.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">Judgment will be entered herein for the plaintiff accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
