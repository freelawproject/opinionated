Atkin, </em>trial attorney), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-7\">KichardsoN, Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A8T\">The merchandise in this case consists of measuring spoons which were exported from Japan in February, 1971, and classified in liquidation upon entry at San Francisco, California under TSUS item 650.56 at the duty rate of 17 <em>per centum ad valorem </em>as spoons with base metal (other than stainless steel) or nonmetal handles. It is claimed by plaintiff that the merchandise should have been classified as hand tools (including table, kitchen and household implements of the character of hand tools), not specially provided for, of iron or steel, under TSUS item 651.47 as modified by T.D. 68-9 at the duty rate of 10 <em>per centum ad valorem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The imported article is described on the invoice as Item No. 2700, stainless steel four-piece measuring spoon set with plastic handles in one solid color. And each set consists of four spoons, i.e., a tablespoon, a teaspoon, a one-half teaspoon, and a one-quarter teaspoon. Although plaintiff introduced testimonial evidence at the trial with a view toward presenting a subsidiary issue as to whether the imported article is kitchenware or householdware, the posture which plaintiff heretofore assumed in its pleading eliminates such an issue. Thus, under the pleadings it is admitted that (1) the merchandise is designed to measure food in a proper amount for cooking ingredients as called for by various recipes, (2) the merchandise is used to measure food in a proper amount for cooking ingredients as called for by various recipes, (3) the merchandise is used in the kitchen, and (4) the merchandise is held and operated by the unaided hands. And put in issue under the pleading as issues of law are the allegations that (1) the merchandise is more than a spoon, and (2) the function and use of a spoon is limited to scooping food.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Bearing on these issues Kichard B. Cronheim, plaintiff\u2019s president, testified that he was familiar with the item 2700 measuring spoons covered by the entry at bar and that he arranged for the purchase of the spoons from Japan, and that exhibit 1 (consisting of a set of four spoons, among other items, bound in a package) is similar in all material respects to the measuring spoons imported in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The witness testified that he was responsible for the descriptive advertising in the plaintiff\u2019s price lists under which the imported article (exhibit 1) is offered for sale under the specific classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>as \u201cAccurate Measuring Aids\u201d while a mixing spoon (exhibit 3) is described therein under the categorization of \u201cKitchen Tools and Gadgets\u201d. In this connection the witness testified (K. 29-30):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">Q. Why is Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1 depicted under the category for \u201c * * * MeasuriNG Aids\u201d? \u2014 A. Because that is exactly what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">Q. Is Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1 considered to have different functions and uses from Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3? \u2014 A. It certainly does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">Q. Why is Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1 not listed under 'the section for \u201cKitcheN Tools AND Gadgets\u201d? \u2014 A. Because it really isn\u2019t a tool. It is a measuring aid, and that is the only way I could describe it to you. It has a different purpose which is simply to measure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">Q. And because of that you consider its purpose as a measuring aid, which is the primary function of the Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1?\u2014 A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The witness testified that he did not consider exhibit 1 to be a spoon within the lexicographical definition of a spoon because of its shape, its accuracy, and because its capacity is marked. He stated that exhibit 1 differs from teaspoons (exhibits 5 and 6) in that the edges on exhibit 1 are purposely sharp so as to enable the user to cut through solid ingredients in a canister or other storage utensil whereas the edges of tableware are not sharp inasmuch as they are intended to be placed in the mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">H. George Maier, a manufacturers\u2019 representative with Maier &amp; Associates, Inc. and former president and part owner of Allied Western Distributors, Inc. [both of which are engaged in representing plaintiff as sales representatives] testified (R. 58-59):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">Q. Do you think that Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1 is amenable to being used as a utensil in the consumption of food? \u2014 A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\">Q. For what reason? \u2014 A. Well, it would take an awful long time to eat very much food with these small spoons. Most measuring spoons \u2014 and I feel certain these are included in that \u2014 are sharp about the edges, and they ar\u00e9 sharp for a purpose and that is to clearly cut whatever you are measuring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-12\">Q. In your experience of having participated in the sale of flatware in the western part of the United States, is flatware usually embossed with the capacity of the particular piece? Does a particular spoon have indicated on there that it measures one teaspoon or tablespoon? \u2014 A. I have never seen that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-13\">Q. Can a teaspoon be used as a flatware teaspoon to measure a fraction of a teaspoon accurately? \u2014 A.Not accurately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-14\">Q. What do you consider to be the primary purpose of Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1? \u2014 A. Well, to correctly and accurately meter or measure an ingredient or something you might be cooking, something that you might be putting into. In my instance, it was a clothes washer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-15\">Q. And you say that flatware cannot be used to measure an exact quantity of a particular article? \u2014 A. Not in my view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Louise Fiszer, a cooking teacher employed at the Judith Ets-Hokin School of Cooking in San Francisco, California, testified that she is familiar with exhibit 1, has personally used that type of article, has instructed her students with respect to the use of that article, and believes that the proper preparation of a recipe could be thwarted if the person preparing the recipe were to use a teaspoon or tablespoon as opposed to a measuring spoon. The witness also testified (R. 90-91):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">Q. Will you examine Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1, and tell me if you believe that those are specially constructed to enable an individual to measure an exact quantity of a particular ingredient?\u2014 A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">Q. In what way would they be constructed to accomplish that purpose? \u2014 A. The size of the bowl, I guess, would perform that function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">Q. Is it your experience also that measuring spoons generally have sharp edges, sharper edges than flatware? \u2014 A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">Q. What would be the purpose of a sharp edge on measuring spoons? \u2014 A. To scoop things out more readily and easily, to cut through something like shortening which it would just really cut right there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The foregoing comprises the substance of evidence offered by plaintiff on the issue of \u201cmore than\u201d a spoon. Plaintiff argues (brief, p. 19):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">It is evident that the imported articles have a more limited and specific function than spoons in general. The articles in issue are designed and constructed to measure accurately. To this end, they are marked to indicate an exact quantity, and their sharp edges facilitate the scooping of the ingredient to be measured. They generally cannot be used for eating because they are too small, and their sharp edges would cut the tongue. The shape of the bowl of the imported measuring spoon is also significantly different from the shape of spoons, examples of which were introduced as Exhibits 5 and 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The government contends that the imported measuring spoons are not more than spoons. The government argues that none of the so-called \u201climited\u201d and \u201cspecific\u201d functions of measuring spoons detract from their being classified as spoons.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">The court is in agreement with defendant. In the court\u2019s view the imported measuring spoons, of which exhibit 1 is a sample, are spoons within the meaning of item 650.56. In <em>The Englishtown Corporation </em>v. <em>United States, </em>64 CCPA 84, C.A.D. 1187, 553 F.2d 1258 (1977) our appellate court reaffirmed its earlier position on the \u201cmore than\u201d doctrine enunciated in <em>E. Green &amp; Son (New York), Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>59 CCPA 31, 34, C.A.D. 1032, 450 F.2d 1396, 1398 (1971) wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">In order to determine if an article is more than that provided for in a particular tariff provision, it is necessary to ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>common meaning of the tariff provision and compare it with the merchandise at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, </em>p. 2205 (1966) defines a \u201cspoon\" as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">[A] usu. metal, plastic, or wooden eating or cooking implement consisting of a small oval or round shallow bowl with a handle\u2014 often used in combination [e.g., teaspoon]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">and <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language, </em>p. 2349 (1956) defines the term \u201cspoon\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">A utensil having a shallow ovoid bowl and a handle, used in preparing, serving, or eating food.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">As employed in item 650.56, the term \u201cspoons\u201d is qualified, among other things, by the phrase \u201cwhich are kitchen or table ware\u201d. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, </em>p. 1247 (1966) defines \u201ckitchenware\u201d as \u201chardware (as cutlery and \u2022Cooking utensils) for kitchen use.\u201d And in view of the admissions \u2018made by the parties as framed by paragraphs 10 through 13 of the complaint, it is clear that the imported merchandise comes within the ambit of the common meaning of the terms \u201cspoon\u201d and \u201ckitchenware\u201d. The imported merchandise, as exemplified by exhibit 1, has a shallow bowl and a handle, and is used in the kitchen in cooking or preparing food.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The- common meaning of the term \u201cspoon\u201d is palpably broad, encompassing many articles whose identification as such is invariably qualified by reference to some specific function performed. Thus, a teaspoon is so named because it is used to stir sugar in tea. The same can be said with respect to <em>slotted </em>spoons, <em>mixing </em>spoons, <em>stirring </em>spoons, <em>mustard </em>spoons, ta&amp;iespoons, <em>dessert </em>spoons, <em>grapefruit </em>spoons, <em>fruit </em>spoons, <em>sugar </em>spoons, <em>relish </em>spoons, <em>soup </em>spoons, <em>serving </em>spoons, <em>salad </em>spoons. And by the same token <em>measuring </em>spoons are so named because of their specific function of apportioning exact quantities. In fact, a mere reference to the term \u201cspoon\u201d without a prefix denoting function is meaningless in terms of identifying any particular kind of spoon. Obviously, therefore, variation in function between spoons cannot be the basis for denominating one article a spoon and another not a spoon, as plaintiff seems inclined to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">It is noted that one lexicon to which the court\u2019s attention has been called expressly includes <em>measuring </em>spoon in its definition of the term \u201cspoon\u201d. See 25 <em>Encyclopedia Americana </em>528 (1973) wherein a spoon is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">[A]n implement consisting of a shallow bowl and a handle, used chiefly for handling food. It may also be used ceremonially or for <em>measuring. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Hence, a measuring spoon does not become \u201cmore than\u201d' a spoon merely because it differs from some other variety of spoon with which it may be compared. And since the measuring spoons at bar are within the common meaning of the term \u201cspoon\u201d, and are admittedly kitchenware, it follows that plaintiff has failed to rebut the presumption of correctness attaching to the classification of the imported articles under the provision for spoons which are kitchenware in item 650.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">In view of this conclusion the court does not reach plaintiff\u2019s claim for classification of the merchandise under item 651.47 \u2014 a classification provision which is at best <em>residual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Protest No. 28091-001569 is severed, and dismissed for untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The action is dismissed. Judgment will be entered herein accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
