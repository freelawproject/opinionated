The merchandise was classified by the government under item 700.52 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) as footwear of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which do not extend above the ankle, and assessed duty at the rate of 25 percent ad valorem. Plaintiff challenges this classification and claims the importations are properly classifiable as \u201cArticles not specially provided for, of rubber or plastics: Other,\u201d under item 774.60, dutiable at 8.5 percent ad valorem.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The pertinent provisions of TSUS read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>Classified under:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Footwear (whether or not described elsewhere in this subpart) which is over 50 percent by weight of rubber or plastics or over 50 percent by weight of fibers and rubber or plastics with at least 10 percent by weight being rubber or plastics:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">Hunting boots, galoshes, rainwear, and other footwear designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease, or chemicals or cold or inclement weather, all the foregoing having soles and uppers of which over 90 percent of the exterior surface area is rubber or plastics (except footwear with uppers of nonmolded construction formed by sewing the parts thereof together and having exposed on the outer surface a substantial portion of functional stitching):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Hi H\u00ab Hi % H* H* <em>He</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">700.52 Footwear (except footwear provided for in item 700.51), the uppers of which do not extend above the ankle, designed for use without closures, whether or not supported or lined _ v __ 25% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\n<em>Claimed under:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">Articles not specially provided for, of rubber or plastics:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">774.60 Other_ 8.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>'Plaintiff alleges there are no genuine issues to be tried with respect to the following material facts: (1) That the imported merchandise is used in the manufacture of \u201cThe Ice Gripper/\u2019 which is an article of rubber footwear designed for safer walking on ice and packed snow; (2) that the sample attached to an affidavit and report of one of plaintiff\u2019s affiants is similar in all material respects to the imported merchandise; (3) that the merchandise in its imported condition cannot be worn as a \u201crubber\u201d as it possesses very little traction, thereby rendering it unsafe for the wearer; (4) that the imported merchandise is never sold or offered for sale in its imported condition; (5) that after importation a mineral grit is applied to- the sole and is affixed thereto with a rubber adhesive; (6) that the cost of the grit and its application to the imported merchandise after importation exceeds the value of the imported merchandise; and (7) that the merchandise as-imported is in chief value of rubber.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Defendant agrees that the merchandise as imported is in chief value of rubber. It alleges that there are no genuine issues to be tried with respect to the following material facts: (1) That in its condition as imported the merchandise is designed to be worn over other footwear and is designed to protect the shoe over which it is worn from water, oil, grease, chemicals, and inclement weather; (2) that the merchandise is marketable as an overshoe, whether or not it is sold in its imported condition, and is therefore of a class or kind of articles chiefly worn over other shoes as protection from water, oil, grease, chemicals, and inclement weather; (3) that the imported merchandise in all entries is identical to the pair of overshoes tagged \u201cCE 902148 \u2014 \u25a0 7/19/73, style No. .110, summons No. 75-5-01099, 5/9/75, protest No. 49094000039, 8/19/74\u201d; (4) that the imported merchandise responded to the term \u201cfootwear\u201d at the time of its importation,' since it possesses the essential characteristics of \u201cfootwear\u201d of the overshoe type used as a protection against water, oil, grease, chemicals, and inclement weather; and (5) that post-importation improvements in the traction characteristics of the imported footwear, if there were any, are immaterial as the merchandise was already footwear before such alleged improvements were made. Finally, defendant asserts there is a genuine dispute as to the specific traction and construction of the imported merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Upon considering the affidavits presented by the parties and the supporting exhibits, the court must conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist which require a trial. For example, the record is not clear as to what merchandise was actually imported. Thus, the court is unable to determine the nature and characteristics of the importations in issue. See, e.g., <em>L. B. Watson Co., a\\c Murphy </em>Reir, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>75 Cust. Ct. 185, 187, C.R.D. 75-5 (1975). Further, there appears from the conflicting affidavits of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>genuine issues of fact as to, among other things, (1) whether or not the imported merchandise can, in its condition as imported, be worn as a \u201crubber\u201d or overshoe; (2) whether or not at the time of importation the merchandise is marketable as an overshoe; and (3) the specific traction and construction of the imported merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">Since triable issues of fact exist, both plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment are denied. See, e.g., <em>Fortune Star Products Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>78 Cust. Ct. 184, C.R.D. 77-3 (1977).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
