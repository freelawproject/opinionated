The evidence admitted at trial showed that defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been summarily suspended by the Department of Motor Vehicles for his failure to appear in court on several traffic citations.  The principal question involved in this proceeding is whether the suspension of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license without a hearing amounted to a denial of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Defendant cites <em>Rios </em>v. <em>Cozens </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 792 [103 Cal.Rptr. 299, 499 P.2d 979] as support for his assertion that his license was improperly suspended without due process. <em>Rios </em>stands for the principle that the retention of a driver\u2019s license and the use of a car is a sufficiently important benefit to justify a hearing requirement prior to license suspension when there is question as to the likelihood of a judgment being recovered against an uninsured motorist in an accident. Such a question arises under the provisions of the financial responsibility law. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16000-16503.) The case before us, however, is distinguishable from <em>Rios, </em>as it concerns whether the defendant was given adequate notice and opportunity to be heard when his license was suspended pursuant to Vehicle Code section 13365.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order of suspension sent to defendant by the Department of Motor Vehicles states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 15\">*Supp. 15</page-number>that the suspension was initiated \u201cbecause the records of this department show that on two or more occasions you have violated your written promise to appear in court.\u201d Defendant has conceded that \u201cit is clear that the action of the Department was based on the failure to appear and clear traffic citations. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">It would be a legal absurdity to require the Department of Motor Vehicles to grant a hearing on the question of whether a person did in fact violate his written promise to appear on a traffic citation, when the court where appearance was required has already made such a finding. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 40509, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the defaulting citee has a valid excuse for his nonappearance, the place to submit his explanation is in the court, not before the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The traffic citations issued to defendant are absent from the record on appeal. However, at the People\u2019s request, we take judicial notice that the uniform traffic citation approved by the Judicial Council states that if the holder violates his written promise to appear, the Department of Motor Vehicles may revoke or suspend the driving privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also infer that the traffic citations issued to defendant followed the standard Judicial Council form.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 16\">*Supp. 16</page-number>A similar situation was presented to the Oregon Court of Appeals in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cesaro </em>(1972) 8 Ore.App. 443 [494 P.2d 255], where the appellant Cesaro likewise argued his right to a hearing before license suspension. We think the following comments by the court are equally appropriate to the case at bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">\u201cThe issuance of an arrest warrant or the suspension of driving privileges are devices to attempt to force the defendant to appear for a hearing about which he has admittedly received notice. Since ... an ar-. rest warrant could have been issued without additional notice and opportunity for hearing, we see no reason why the same should not be true of the suspension of driving privileges. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-5\">\u2018\u201c\u201cDue process\u201d is an elusive concept. Its exact boundaries are undefinable, and its content varies according to specific factual contexts ... \u2019 [Citations].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">\u201cDefendant has not cited any authorities, nor have we found any which extend this elusive concept to the point that defendant urges, that is, to require notice and an opportunity to be heard following notice and a failure to appear to be heard.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 257-258.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">We conclude that the determination of license suspension by the Department of Motor Vehicles without affording the licensee an opportunity for a hearing beyond the court appearances directed by the summons on the traffic citations sufficiently complies with the \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d hearing requirements of due process. (See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 535, 541-542 [29 L.Ed.2d 90, 95-96, 91 S.Ct. 1586].)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Defendant next asserts that there was no proof of actual suspension of his driver\u2019s license at the time he was cited for that offense on August 17, 1981. On October 24, 1980, the Department of Motor Vehicles sent defendant a letter stating that \u201cYour privilege to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of this State is suspended, effective October 28, 1980.\u201d The letter was admitted in evidence by stipulation, and it was further agreed that it had been mailed to defendant. The arrest report, also admitted by stipulation, reveals an admission by defendant before arrest that he currently did not have a driver\u2019s license. After defendant\u2019s admission and before the arrest, an officer received confirmation from the Department of Motor Vehicles that defendant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 17\">*Supp. 17</page-number>license had been suspended \u201cfor his failure to take care of his traffic warrant.\u201d The evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Foster, Acting P. J., and Rothman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-6\"> Vehicle Code section 14601.1, subdivision (a) at the time of the alleged violation provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">\u201cNo person shall drive a motor vehicle on a highway when his driving privilege is suspended or revoked for any reason other than those listed in Section 14601 when the person so driving has knowledge of either such fact. Knowledge shall be presumed if notice has been given by the department to such person. The presumption established by the subdivision is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\"> Vehicle Code section 13365 provides: \u201cThe department may suspend or revoke the driving privilege of any person when his record contains notifications of two or more violations of subdivision (a) of Section 40509.

Such notice shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after issuance of a warrant. Whenever thereafter the case in which such promise was given is adjudicated or the person who has violated the court order appears in court or otherwise satisfies the order of the court, the magistrate or clerk of the court hearing the case shall sign and file with the department a certificate to that effect.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\">The Judicial Council determines the form of all notices that mandate appearance before a magistrate for a traffic offense. Vehicle Code section 40500, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cThe Judicial Council shall prescribe the form of the notice to appear.\u201d The uniform traffic citation form so approved contains the following notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-9\">\u201cWARNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-10\">Willful failure to appear as promised is a separate violation for which you may be arrested and punished by 6 MONTHS IN JAIL AND/OR $500.00 FINE, regardless of the disposition of the original charge (V.C. 40508).
