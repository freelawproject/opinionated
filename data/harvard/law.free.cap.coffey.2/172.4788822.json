She had not, at the time of the death of deceased, and has not, any heirs of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Deceased left a will, of which the part pertinent to this inquiry is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">\u201cI give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved daughter, Anna Josephine Fitzgerald (Lee), for her natural life, all the real and personal property of which I die seised and possessed, remainder to the heirs of the body of said Anna Josephine Fitzgerald in fee simple, but in the event of her death without surviving heirs of her body, I direct that said remainder be distributed to my heirs then surviving according to the law of descent and distribution in force in the State of California at. the date of my said daughter\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">By her petition for partial distribution, which affects one of the two parcels of real property belonging to the estate, petitioner asks the court to adjudge that the foregoing provision is in effect an absolute devise, and, to that end, to hold that the remainders therein created are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The executor and the parties represented by Mr. Carson insist upon the entire validity of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">SUMMARY OP PETITIONER\u2019S ARGUMENTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-14\">1. The second remainder is void because it is in effect a devise to petitioner for life, remainder to petitioner in fee, which is tantamount to the disposition in the first instance of the absolute fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-15\">2. The first remainder is void because it contains a provision in restraint of marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-16\">3. Both remainders are void because of the \u201cdouble contingency,\u201d or \u201cpossibility upon a possibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>THE FIRST POINT</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">involves the construction of the words \u201cmy heirs then surviving,\u201d as used in the foregoing provision. Petitioner contends that no such remaindermen do or can exist, for the reason that, she being testatrix\u2019s heir, no one of remoter degree of kinship can be her heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">It is impossible to deny the force of this construction, provided the word \u201cheirs\u201d be technically construed and the testatrix\u2019s manifest intention ignored, for it is manifest from the context that by the word \u201cheirs\u201d she meant collateral relatives. So to hold will be to render the paragraph wholly inoperative, contrary to the provisions of Civil Code, section 1325, which directs that \u201cthe words of a will are to receive an interpretation which will give to every expression some effect, rather than one which will render any of the expressions inoperative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A TECHNICAL CONSTRUCTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">From the earliest times courts have refused to approve the construction, contended for by petitioner. At common law, when a remainder was limited by deed to the heirs of A (A being in being), the maxim, \u201cNemo haeres viventis est,\u201d operated to render the remainder void. When the same remainder was limited by will, the maxim was ignored in favor of the manifest intention of the testator. So when land was deeded to A for life, remainder to the heirs female of his body, and he died leaving a son and a daughter, the remainder failed, because, as the son was the heir, the daughter could not answer to the description of both female <em>and </em>heir. Contrary, when the limitation was by will, which was a ease parallel with the one at bar: Coke\u2019s Littleton, 24 b.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">RIGID CONSTRUCTION NOT WARRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Even were the court inclined to greater rigidity of construction than that-laid down at so early a date, and thence steadfastly adhered to, the statute would not warrant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Technical words in a will are to be taken in their technical sense, unless the contest clearly indicates a contrary inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tion: Civ. Code, sec. 1327. Technical words are not necessary to give effect to any species of disposition hy will: Civ. Code, sec. 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u201cWhen applying a will it is found that .... no person .... exactly answers the description, mistakes .... must be corrected, if the error appears from the context of the will:\u201d Civ. Code, sec. 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Accordingly \u201cmoney\u201d has been held to include \u201creal property\u201d: Estate of Miller, 48 Cal. 165, 22 Am. Rep. 422. And, more in point, \u201cchildren\u201d has been held to designate \u201cgrandchildren\u201d: Estate of Sehedel, 73 Cal. 594, 15 Pac. 297; Rhoton v. Blevin, 99 Cal. 645, 34 P\u00e1c. 513. Similarly, in other states, \u201cbequeath\u201d held to mean \u201cdevise\u201d: Dow v. Dow, 36 Me. 216; Estate of Fetrow, 58 Pa. 427. And where a reservation would have been void because repugnant to estate devised, construed, an executory devise, to effectuate the manifest intention of the testator: Homer v. Sheldon, 2 Met. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Counsel for petitioner do not question that the intention of testatrix was other than the word \u201cheirs,\u201d technically construed, implies, and I am satisfied that such intent, when so clearly disclosed by the context, should, against the alternative of total intestacy as to the second remainder, be permitted to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">THE SECOND POINT</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">raises the question of the validity of the first remainder, counsel\u2019s contention being that it is void because in restraint of marriage. Say they: \u201cWe claim that because petitioner gets the life estate and the second remainder under the will if she marries and has issue surviving her, but if she does not marry and have issue, then she must necessarily, as devisee and heir, get the whole fee, therefore, the fact of marriage and having issue is in the nature of a penalty, because by so \u2022doing the estate goes to somebody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">As this contention assumes the invalidity of the second remainder, contrary to the views above expressed, it must be overruled. But were the second remainder void, it would seem that the contemplation of the estate falling to strangers, instead of to her own issue, would hasten any properly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>situted person to the altar rather than frighten her therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">THE THIRD POINT</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">is aimed at the validity of both remainders, on the ground that the contingencies on which they depend are \u201cdouble,\u201d or constitute a \u201cpossibility upon a possibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The feature of the death of petitioner may be eliminated, because it is not a \u201ccontingency\u201d; it marks the certain termination of the particular estate and vesting of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The contingency on which the first remainder is limited is the existence of heirs of petitioner\u2019s body at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The contingency on which the second remainder is limited is the existence of collateral relatives (\u201cmy heirs then surviving\u201d) of the testatrix, who shall be testatrix\u2019s descendants under canons of descent prevailing at petitioner\u2019s death, and who shall survive petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Petitioner claims duplicity in this: the petitioner\u2019s death, without issue, is one contingency, whilst the probability or possibility that the law of descent at her death may be different from what it was at testatrix\u2019s death, is a second contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">THE VIEW TAKEN BY THE COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Bach remainder stands alone, and should be construed without reference to the other, as though it alone existed, for the remainders are alternate. Counsel have fallen into the error of confounding the contingency peculiar to one with the contingency peculiar to the other, and of applying both contingencies to both remainders and to each indiscriminately. The court takes the view that the first contingency marks the vesting of the first remainder; the second contingency marks the vesting of the second remainder. The two remainders depend upon contingencies \u201centirely independent of each other, \u2019 \u2019 to use the language of counsel for petitioner, but they respectively depend only upon one contingency\u2014the survival of a person competent to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">CONFORMABLE WITH COMMON LAW AND CODE.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">This manner of disposing of future interests is conformable with the common law and with the provisions of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The statutory rule is, Civil Code, section 767: \u201cA future estate may be limited by the act of the party to commence in possession at a future day, either without the intervention of a precedent estate, or on the termination, by lapse of time or otherwise, of a precedent estate created in the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">This, and other sections not necessary to be here cited, are simply declaratory of the common law, although they have the effect of abolishing executory devises, eo nomine, and of clothing remainders with qualities formerly peculiar to executory devises.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">ALTERNATIVE REMAINDERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">And concerning alternative remainders, the Civil Code, section 696, provides: \u201cTwo or more future interests may be created to take effect in the alternative, so that if the first in order fails to vest, the next in succession shall be substituted for it and take effect accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In the present case, should \u201cthe first in order (the remainder to Anna\u2019s issue) fail to vest,\u201d where will the \u201cnext in succession\u201d vest? Not necessarily in the persons who, had petitioner predeceased testatrix, would, under section 1386 of the Civil Code, have been testatrix\u2019s heirs; but, necessarily, in the persons who, under that or any superseding section of law in existence at the time of Anna\u2019s death, shall be the \u201cheirs then surviving\u201d of testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">NO DIFFICULTY IN THE DETERMINATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Applying this test, there will be no difficulty in determining who, as alternating beneficiary with Anna\u2019s issue, should succeed to the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The executor\u2019s counsel claim that, even though the remainders be void, the life estate is not thereby enlarged, as a clear devise of an estate for life cannot be defeated by an uncertainty as to what may come after the death of the lifetermer. It is not necessary for the court to decide this point, inasmuch as it has taken the view that the remainders are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The demurrer to the petition for partial distribution should be sustained, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
