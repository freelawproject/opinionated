It was contended that section 1332, Code of Civil Procedure, sanctioned such an expense as costs because the first sentence of the section providing for the case of an unsuccessful contest used the words \u201cfees and expenses\u201d simply, although the second sentence, as to a successful contest, used the single word \u201ccosts.\u201d But the court granted the motion to strike from the cost bill the item of counsel fee.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-11\">P. Reddy, for motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-12\">J. L. Crittenden, contra.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-13\">COFFEY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaZ\">In section 1021, Code of Civil Procedure, the distinction is drawn between counsel fees and costs. \u2018 \u2018 The measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, expressed or implied, of the parties; the parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to costs and disbursements, as hereinafter provided.\u201d That clearly discriminates between what is meant by costs and what is meant by counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Section 16, which defines words and phrases, reads: \u201cWords and phrases are construed according to the context and the approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such others as have acquired a peculiar and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>propriate meaning in law, or are defined in the succeeding sections, are to be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition.\u201d It means that words and phrases are construed according to the text and the approved usage of the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Section 1332 reads: \u201cCosts and expenses, by whom paid.\u201d \u201cThe fees and expenses must be paid by the party contesting the validity or probate of the will, if the will in probate, is confirmed.\u201d That is the first sentence; the second sentence reads: \u201cIf the probate is revoked, the costs must be paid by the party who resisted the revocation, or out of the property of the decedent, as the Court directs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The word \u201ccosts\u201d has a well defined meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Mr. Crittenden.\u2014We claim it means fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The Court.\u2014Yes, sir, I understand. That is just what I am coming to. Words and phrases are construed according to the text. What is the text? \u201cThe fees and expenses must be paid by the party contesting the validity or the probate of the will, if the will in probate is confirmed.\u201d Why does the very next sentence use a different and a single word? \u201cIf the probate is revoked, the costs\u2014\u201d Why not repeat the words, \u201cfees and expenses\u201d? Why put in there another, a different word? I really do not think that the legislature meant anything more by \u201cfees and expenses\u201d than costs\u2014 that there should be some intention to restrict the charge upon the estate in case the will should be revoked after having been once probated; that it should be restricted to costs. The preceding section and all the sections of the statute, so far as I have examined them, which speak of costs mean simply the costs of the court, the expenses incidental to the proceedings in the case, apart from the counsel fees; and the section which remits the costs of contests in will eases to the category of civil actions shows that the principle maintained in such cases should govern this; and, therefore, as no counsel fees are allowed in any civil action, none should be allowed to be paid in the case of a contest; and if there be any distinction or discrimination in favor of the executors, it is dependent upon the precise letter of the statute which gives to the court expressly the right to award to the executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>or administrator reasonable counsel fees. Section 1718 gives to the court the discretion to award a counsel fee for an appointed attorney, to be paid out of the estate primarily, and ultimately to be charged against the interest represented by the appointee.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Therefore,.! do not think the counsel fee has any proper place in a bill of costs, and the motion to strike it out is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
