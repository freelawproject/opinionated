The court thinks it is an express trust under section 857 of the Civil Code, because the will has created a trust for all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>purposes mentioned in said section, and being in writing, complies in that respect with section 852, Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">It is not necessary to use the word \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ctrustee,\u201d or any particular form of words, in creating a trust, so long as the intention of the testator is expressed: Perry on Trusts, par. 82, 112; Luco v. De Toro, 91 Cal. 405, 27 Pac. 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A person may declare a trust either directly or indirectly; the former by creating a trust eo nomine, in the forms and terms of a trust; the latter without affecting to create a trust in words, by evincing an intention, which the court will effectuate through the medium of an implied trust: Lewin\u2019s Law of Trusts, p. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">An executor may be both executor and trustee: Lewin\u2019s Law of Trusts, p. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">If not named expressly a trustee, the court may determine from the whole will whether he is not to act as trustee: Perry on Trusts, par. 262; Toronto Trust Co. v. Chicago R. R. Co., 7 Am. Prob. Rep. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">When the income of property is given to one for life, and at his death the property is given over to another, and no trustee is named in the will, the executor is the trustee to hold the property during the life of the legatee for life: Perry on Trusts, par. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">By the will under consideration the executor is directed to enter into the possession of all real estate, receive all rents, etc., and out of the proceeds thereof pay all taxes, etc., and out of the residue of income pay Hibernia Bank certain sums, also to pay to Delia A. Bell and the two granddaughters certain sums of money during their natural lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">By said will all the estate is bequeathed and given to said grandchildren on the death of said Delia A. Bell, but not before such death.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The executor is also directed and empowered to invest in the purchase of productive real estate any money to be derived from foreclosure of a certain mortgage; or to purchase the property if sold under a foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">A trust has been without doubt created.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">The intention of the decedent can be executed only through a trustee, otherwise the administration of said estate could not be closed until the death of Delia A. Bell; or, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>testator had postponed the final distribution during lives in being, including the life of the administrator (Civ. Code, 715), until after the death of the administrator; during which time no final commissions or fees could, be allowed to the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Commissions cannot be apportioned until close of administration of estate: Estate of Barton, 55 Cal. 87; Code Civ. Proc., 1618.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">It is the duty of the court and executor to close the administration speedily and as soon as the debts and expenses of administration are paid and there are persons entitled to the possession of the estate: Estate of Pritchett, 51 Cal. 568; Estate of Hinckley, 58 Cal. 457, 518; Code Civ. Proc., secs. 1652,1665.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">An estate may be distributed to a trustee, he being entitled to the possession and control of the same: Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1699, amendment of 1895; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1702, amendment of 1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">A trust will not be permitted to fail for want of trustee: Hill v. Den, 54 Cal. 6-20; Estate of Hinckley, 58 Cal. 457; Smith v. Davis, 90 Cal. 25, 25 Am. St. Rep. 92, 27 Pac. 26; Code Civ.

Code, 699-867.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Application granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Commissions of an Executor or Administrator are not payable until the close of the administration and the settlement of his final account.

When there are two or more executors or administrators, the commissions should be apportioned to each in proportion to the labor he has performed. Each is not entitled to an equal share merely because of his office: Estate of Carter, 132 Cal. 113, 64 Pac. 123; Estate of Coursen (Cal.), 65 Pac. 965; Hope v. Jones, 24 Cal. 89; Dudley\u2019s Estate, 123 Cal. 256, 55 Pac. 897. Neither can one, by excluding the others against their will from any participation in the administration, deprive them of all claim to compensation: Dudley\u2019s Estate, 123 Cal. 256, 55 Pac. 897.
