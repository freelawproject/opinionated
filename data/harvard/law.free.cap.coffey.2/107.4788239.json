Lyons as referee. The referee fixed a time and place for proceeding with the reference and gave notice to the appraisers and all parties interested. The executrix did not appear, but her attorney addressed a letter to the referee refusing to attend, and claiming that the judge's appointment was void, as the law gave him no power to make such an order or reference of his own motion; the appraisers responded in person (their representation by attorneys was only after the coming in of the referee\u2019s report), and certain heirs at law appeared by their attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The testimony developed the fact that the appraisers\u2019 bill of $4,500 for services was by special agreement with the executrix upon the claim that if the appraisers traversed every portion of the extended acreage of the country lands, it would involve a large consumption of time and unnecessary labor, and it was therefore a matter of convenience and expediency to all parties that a fixed sum be agreed upon as a reasonable compensation in the premises. (See \u201cAn Act to Establish a Tax on Collateral Inheritances,\u201d etc., approved March 23, 1893, section 12, Stats. 1893, pages 196, 197.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-4\">It also appeared that one of the appraisers had been a clerk of the decedent, and was familiar with the various properties owned by him, and he was examined by the referee as to his knowledge as to the accuracy of the inventory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">The referee inquired fully .into the proceedings of the appraisers by a detailed examination of each of them, and returned with his report a verbatim transcript of the proceedings under the reference from the stenographer\u2019s notes.

But the particular section which is decisive of the questions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>this reference is section 1444, Code of Civil Procedure, perhaps the most important of all the sections relating to appraisers and appraisements, which reads: \u201cTo make the appraisement the court, or a judge thereof, must appoint three disinterested persons (any two of whom may act), who are entitled to receive a reasonable compensation for their services, not to exceed five dollars per day, to be allowed by the court or judge. The appraisers must, with the inventory file a verified account of their services and disbursements. If any part of the estate is in any other county than that in which letters issued, appraisers thereof may be appointed, either by the court or judge having jurisdiction of the estate, or by the court or judge of such other county, on request of the court or judge having jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">THE TWO QUESTIONS UNDER SECTION 1444, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The two important questions arising under this section are: 1. As to the sanction or authority given to the exercise by two of the appraisers of the powers conferred upon and vested in the required three appointees; under what circumstances it is proper and valid, and to what extent; 2. As to the official character, capacity and duty of the appraisers, and each of them; their right to compensation; upon what it rests, and by whom and how fixed and regulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">THE PRACTICE OF TWO APPOINTEES ACTING.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">As to the first question, it is and has been for years past the custom in probate practice, to more or less extent, for the executor or administrator, with or without his attorney\u2019s advice, or for the attorney himself, to select such two of the three appointed and required appraisers as may be suitable to his or their choice for the performance of the \u201cduties imposed upon the three,\u201d leaving the third appointee wholly ignorant as to the fact of his appointment, or if the fact should come to his knowledge (and the present judge of the probate department, Hon. J. Y. Coffey, has found it necessary to make a rule that the clerk give official notification of all appointments), insisting upon the legal right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>dispense with his services\u2014to disregard the appointment. This practice is not carried on with the permission of the court or judge, but often, if not nearly always, in open and indifferent opposition to the wishes and legal judgment of the court; and further, it is not merely excused, but claimed to be justified, by the \u201cvery letter of the law.\u201d *</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">THE STATUTE AS TO THE POWEB OP TWO OP THE APPOINTEES AND THE EEASON OP IT.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The following is the \u201cletter of the law,\u201d found in section 1444, Code of Civil Procedure, quoted above, which, as we have said, is not offered in extenuation, but confidently referred to in legal justification of the practice, to wit: \u2018 \u2018 The court, or a judge thereof, must appoint three disinterested persons (any two of whom may act).\u201d Upon this language it is substantially argued by those who pursue or countenance the practice referred to, that though the law provides that there must be three appointees, yet any two of them may choose for themselves, or permit themselves to be chosen by the parties interested, to the exclusion of the unchosen third appointee (with entire indifference as to the necessity of his knowledge or consent), as those of the appointees who shall perform \u201cthe duties imposed upon the three.\u201d It may be remarked here as worthy of note that the statute nowhere authorizes the court or judge to appoint, in any case, two appraisers in the place of three; neither does it give, nor in any manner intimate, the power or authority on the part of the court or judge to select or authorize the selection of the two appointees, who \u201cmay act\u201d under the appointment to the three; nor has such power or authority been ever judicially claimed or assumed, nor do we believe it would be \u25a0claimed to exist under the statute. Is it possible, then, that what the court or judge\u2014the sole appointing power\u2014cannot do or authorize, can be done by a person interested, or by any two of the appraisers? Without dilating upon it, it is undoubtedly true, as a general proposition, that where the \u25a0\u201cvery letter of the law\u201d is relied upon in opposition or indifference to the spirit and apparent intention, as well also the plain common sense of the thing, it must lead to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>evident absurdity that the result of the contention in this case brings us to, in the proposition that, although the law prescribes that the court must appoint three disinterested persons to execute an important judicial duty, yet any two of the appointees may themselves arbitrarily choose or permit themselves to be interestedly chosen to perform such duty which the law mandatorily provides that three must be disinterestedly appointed to perform. The statute, in using the language, parenthetically (\u201cany two of whom may act\u201d), 'obviously meant no more than that the valid action by two of the appraisers, where the third appointee refused to, or for some reason not imputable to the acting two did not act, would be a sufficient execution of the powers invested in and the duties imposed upon the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\"Without specifically inquiring into them, it is easily conceived that many contingencies might arise where one of the appraisers would not or could not act, and the law, with this in view, undoubtedly made the provision that such an occurrence would not cause a failure of or invalidate the whole appointment. However it is noticeable that in section 1475, Code of Civil Procedure, it is provided, with reference to the appraisement of the homestead and report thereof, that: \u201cAny two of the appraisers concurring may discharge the duties imposed upon the three, and make the report. A dissenting report may be made by the third appraiser.\u201d It might be contended that by this section the intention of the law is shown to be that in all cases the appraisers should take the oath, and proceed to the execution of their duties, but that the agreement of two in the act of appraisement is a sufficient execution of the appointment. This contention would seem to be true, at least in the ease of the appraisement of the homestead. Another thing is noticeable in the language of section 1475, just quoted, in that it provides how the appraisers \u201cmay discharge the 'duties imposed upon the three.\u201d The mere reading of this can leave no other impression than that this duty is imposed by the order of appointment, especially as the statute nowhere else speaks to the contrary; this view seems also in complete agreement \u2022 with the language of section 1445, Code of Civil Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>which provides that the appraisers take an oath \u201cbefore proceeding to the execution of their duty\u201d\u2014a duty evidently considered as imposed by the provisions of the preceding section (1444, above quoted), prescribing the order of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">This view is further in accordance with the settled principle that, where one is appointed to a position of trust, and especially' so in the ease of an official trust, like the appointment of appraisers, unless a renunciation is shown, the law will presume an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Now, it cannot be questioned that appraisers are officers of the court, and in the execution of their appointment bound to the performance of a judicial duty\u2014a duty that cannot be underestimated\u2014in the execution of which the executor or administrator, the creditors, heirs and the court are interested and concerned. The work of the appraisers is to the court, the creditors and the heirs, the beacon light and safeguard respecting the knowledge and value of the estate. Can it be said, then, that whether or not one of the appraisers shall perform such judicial duty depends upon the whim or willfulness of the executor or administrator, or the two other of the appointees? Does the renunciation or acceptance of the official trust devolving upon this one appraiser, by the order of appointment, rest upon the decision of either or all of the parties named, without the knowledge, permission or consent of the appraiser ? These questions bring their own answers\u2014 even an agent of the appraiser could not determine, or be appointed to determine, this personal trust for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">AUTHORITIES AS TO THE POWER OF TWO APPOINTEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The following authorities are submitted as decisive of the view to be taken upon this question:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In Caldwell on Arbitration (second American edition), the author says, at page 202: \u201cIf a cause be referred to three persons, and they, or any two of them, have power to make the award, it may be signed by two only, provided the third have notice of the meetings, and be not excluded by force or fraud\u201d; citing Mackintosh v. Blythe, 1 Brod. &amp; B. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In Burton v. Knight, 2 Vern. 514 (acc. Kel. 132; and see Ives v. Metcalf, 1 Atkyns, 64), a submission was to three arbitrators, or any two of them. \u201cThe award was set aside, and it was observed by the court, upon this occasion, that where parties submitted their differences to three arbitrators, or any two of them, and one of such persons was excluded by force or fraud from the meetings held for determining the matter, that alone would be enough to vitiate the award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">Strong animadversion was also cast by the court upon the partiality apparent in permitting one party to be present at their meetings, without having given the other an opportunity to attend: Caldwell on Arbitration, pp. 209, 210. To the report of this case in second Yernon, the following note is appended at page 515: \" The ground expressly taken by the Lord-keeper- for confirming the decree at the rolls is: \u2018For that there appeared a design and fraudulent exclusion of Roger Hudson the third arbitrator, <em>and that thereby the other tioo arbitrators, </em>Shallet and Nash, <em>had assumed to themselves that power which was intrusted to all three.\u2019 \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Particular attention is directed to the language of this case last underscored, as peculiarly applicable to the probate practice under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Without a seeming desire to quibble about words, it may be noticed that in the above quoted eases the submission to arbitration was to three persons, or any two of them; whereas, our statute respecting appraisers prescribes and the order of appointment is to three persons, not to three or any two of them\u2014the further provision that two \u201cmay act,\u201d meaning, as we have shown above, to become effective only in a proper case, and to prevent the failure of the entire order.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">PENAL LIABILITY IN CASE OF UNAUTHORIZED APPRAISEMENT BY TWO.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">If, as shown by the above citations, in the case of a submission to arbitration by the parties themselves, an award which is the result of a practice precisely the same as that often adopted in the making and return of appraisements in probate is thereby tainted and vitiated, so as to be rendered fraudulent, is not the probate practice which we have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>considering\u2014where the appointees are not the choice of the parties interested, but the selection of the court, and ipso facto its officers\u2014a fraud and imposition upon the law and the court, and do not all the parties implicated in the violation of the law become liable not merely to the animadversion of the court, as they did in the cases cited\u2014where the arbitrators were not officers of the court, but only the appointees of the parties\u2014but to such penalties as it might consider proper ?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">LEGAL STATUS OF APPRAISEMENTS BY TWO.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We conclude, then, on this head, that the legal status of an inventory and appraisement which is merely the act of two appraisers, without an opportunity given to the third appraiser to act, and a failure on his part so to do, through declination or other cause entitling the two other appraisers to proceed without him, is that it is invalid and fraudulent, and the act of the two appraisers without such sufficient cause is a willful violation of the law, and an imposition and fraud upon the court appointing them. If this view be adopted by the court, it might be advisable to make a rule respecting inventories and appraisements returned signed by two appraisers only; perhaps that in such cases a statement of the acting appraisers, subscribed by them, showing the reason for the third appraiser not acting, should be annexed to and form part of the appraisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">APPRAISERS MUST BE \u2018 -DISINTERESTED PERSONS. <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">It was developed in the proceedings on the reference that two of the appraisers .... were at the time of their appointment, had been, and continued in the employment of the executrix individually, also that their appointment was at the suggestion and solicitation of the executrix, and the matter was called to the court\u2019s attention. There can hardly be a doubt that they were both improper persons for the office of appraiser, in view of their relationship to the executrix at the time of their appointment; even in the case of arbitration, where the interested parties themselves appoint the arbitrators, it is naturally held that no person in the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ployment of or pecuniarily obligated to the parties is qualified to act\u2014even a cousin has been excluded on account of his mere kinship.....This circumstance illustrates the danger of such suggestions being at all entertained by the court; and the following authoritative statement as to the New York statute, upon which our own is based, is perhaps worthy of consideration in this regard: \u201cThe surrogate has the selection of the appraisers, and the reason of the statute would seem to require that he should designate these officers in order to insure as well competency as impartiality in the discharge of their duties\u201d: Dayton on Surrogates, p. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">OFFICIAL CHARACTER OF APPRAISERS AND THEIR COMPENSATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">As to the second question proposed above under section 1444, Code of Civil Procedure\u2014the official character, capacity and duty, and the compensation of the appraisers\u2014no difficulty can be perceived. The appraisers being appointed by the court for the performance of a judicial duty, are of course ipso facto officers of the court for that purpose; therefore their character, capacity and duty are official.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Their compensation, and how and by whom it is fixed and regulated, rest upon the following simple and plain language of said section 1444, viz.: \u201cWho [the appraisers] are</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">entitled to receive a reasonable compensation for their services, not to exceed five dollars per day, to be allowed by the court or judge. The appraisers must, with the inventory, file a verified account of their services and disbursements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">AUTHORITIES AS TO THIS COMPENSATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">In the Suec\u00e9ssion of Caballero, 25 La. Ann. 646, the court of last resort of Louisiana held: \u201cThe law fixes fees of appraisers ; where illegal charges are apparent on the face of the record, they can be corrected.\u201d Here the court, of its own motion, reduced the charge of $300 to $16.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">In Walton v. Creditors, 3 Rob. (La.), 438, held: \u201cA notary\u2019s fees being fixed by the law, he can under no pretense demand additional compensation.\u201d In this case the court said: \u201cThe lower court ruled that \u2018evidence to establish a quantum meruit is entirely misplaced in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>those official services for which a tariff is fixed by law.\u2019 It does not appear to us that the court erred. If the fees allowed to notaries by law for services rendered by them be insufficient, they must seek relief by an application to the legislature for a new tariff or by resigning their offices. Courts of justice cannot countenance any other mode.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">So, in Hawford v. Adler, 12 La. Ann. 241, held: \u201cA notary cannot increase his legal fees for official acts by evidence of a quantum meruit for extra services. A relaxation of the rule would make the fee bill a dead letter.\u201d (Also: Dayton on Surrogates, p. 255; McClellan\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Court Practice, 2d ed., pp. 371, 372; North\u2019s Probate Practice (Ill.), sec. 316; Horner\u2019s Probate Law, sec. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">CONCLUSION AS TO BASIS AND LIMIT OF COMPENSATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The above authorities necessitate no comment or explanation, nor does the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We therefore conclude that the law fixes the fees of appraisers in conjunction with the allowance by the court; that the maximum allowance is $5 to each appraiser for every day\u2019s service by him; that evidence of a quantum meruit in excess of $5 per day is not admissible; and under no pretense, nor by any ingenuity whatsoever, can the law be evaded or violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">APPRAISEE\u2019S DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE INVENTORY, SECTIONS 1445, 1449, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The extent of the appraiser\u2019s duty was called in question on the reference, it appearing that \u201che might have received memoranda as appraiser, or had access to or knowledge of such, showing a statement of property differing from that returned in the official inventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">While our statute is not as clear as it could be, yet we believe the same idea is found in sections 1445 and 1449, as is clearly expressed in the New York statute, namely: That the inventory is not necessarily made up by the executor or administrator alone; but more properly in conjunction with the appraisers. In section 1449 it is clearly expressed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>appraisers must sign the inventory, and that then the executor or administrator must take and attach the oath as to its correctness. This oath seems proper upon reading the section (especially in connection with section 1445) only after the inventory and appraisement have been completed; not before the appraisement has been made, as is always the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">NOTE AS TO SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS AND SPECIAL RULE OF JUDGE COFFEY AS TO APPRAISEMENTS AND APPRAISERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Under directions of Judge Coffey whenever appraisers are appointed by him, the clerk sends a printed notification to each appraiser, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">[Title of Court and Cause.]</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">I am instructed by the Judge presiding in the Probate Department of the Superior Court to inform you of your appointment as Appraiser in the above estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Accompanying this notice is the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\n<em>Instructions to Appraisers.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The attention of appraisers is especially called to the provisions of the law governing them in the discharge of their duty. (Part III, Title XI, Chapter IY, Article I, Code of Civil Procedure.) The compensation of appraisers is limited to five dollars a day for each day of actual service. No \u201cconstructive\u201d charge will be allowed. The subjoined directions should be read and pursued by appraisers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">1.

In all cases where the circumstances merit gratuitous service the court will appoint competent persons to act without charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">\n<em>Admonition to Appraisers.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\"><em>Nota </em>Bene.\u2014The attention of appraisers is especially called to the provisions of the law governing them in the discharge of their duties. (Part III, Title XI, Chapter IV, Article I, Code of Civil Procedure.) The compensation of appraisers is limited to five dollars for every day <em>actually </em>and <em>necessarily </em>employed in the appraisement. No \u201cconstructive\u201d charge will be allowed. In case no charge be made and compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>is waived, that fact must be noted in the <em>return </em>of the appraisers : See Stats. 1893, pp. 196, 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In all proper cases the discretion of the court may be invoked to appoint competent appraisers to act without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>.An Itemised Aooount 6y Appraisers Necessary.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The attention of appraisers is also directed especially to the necessity of making an <em>itemised </em>account of their charges and disbursements. <em>Day </em>and <em>date </em>must be given in <em>every </em>instance. Experience has taught the Court the necessity of rigorously enforcing this rule, which, although in existence for years, has been occasionally disregarded. It is enjoined, 'therefore, upon the appraisers appointed by the Court to preserve <em>data </em>in <em>detail </em>of their charges and <em>annex the same to their report.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
