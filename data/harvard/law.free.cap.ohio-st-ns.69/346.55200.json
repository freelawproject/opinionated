The lodge, admitting its liability in the sum claimed, brought the money into \u2022court, taking appropriate steps to have a j\u2019udicial determination of the adverse claims to the fund which had been made by Mrs. Lange and the plaintiff in error, William F. Lange, each of whom was the holder of a certificate under which a claim to the fund had been made. The claim of Mrs. Lange was founded on a certificate dated December 23,1893, that of William upon a certificate dated January 7,1897, both, as is alleged, issued under the rules of the order. She alleged that the certificate under which she claimed naming her as beneficiary was, by her husband, delivered to her at its date, and that it was ever afterward in her possession; and, that she, having no knowledge of any attempted substitution of another beneficiary, out of her own funds, paid the dues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>assessments on account thereof from May, 1897, until the death of her husband, February 14, 1900. She further alleged that by the rules of the order the beneficiary could not be changed without the surrender of the previous certificate or the showing by affidavit that it was lost, or its production impossible; and that in fraud of her rights as beneficiary, William and \u2022other members of the family, when her husband was ill and mentally incapable of transacting business, induced her to absent herself from his room for a time, and that Avhile she was absent they procured from him such affidavit, and the certificate under which he claimed Avas thereupon issued. In the court of common pleas, a jury being Avaived, the cause was tried upon the pleadings and the evidence, and a judgment was rendered in favor of Mrs. Lange. William thereupon took an appeal to the circuit court, which it dismissed upon the ground that the action was not appealable. The order of dismissal is assigned here as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\"><em>Messrs. McKemy &amp; Belville </em>and <em>Messrs.

Whether the third of these; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>traits appears in the present case is the question with respect to which counsel differ. The determination of that question is not aided by the consideration that interpleader is equitable in its origin and nature. However uniformly it may appear that appealable \u2022 actions are equitable, the legislature has not used appropriate terms to make all equitable actions appeal-able. While the constitutional requirement that the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate has been effective to continue that right in all cases which were \\ triable to a jury at the time of the adoption of the constitution, it has not prevented, nor was it intended to ^ prevent, the extension of the right of trial by jury to cases which were not so triable at the time of the adop- 1 tion of the constitution; and every case included in <em>( </em>such extension of the right of trial by jury is thereby / excluded from the category of cases appealable, how- , ever clearly it may appear that the rights of the par- * ties depend upon the application of principles which ( are of equitable origin and nature. Actions for \u00bb money only, founded upon the principles of contribution and subrogation, are examples of those which are noAV included within the provisions of section 5130, Revised Statutes, that, \u201cissues of fact arising in actions for the recovery of money only, or specific real or personal property, shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived, or a reference be ordered as hereinafter provided.\u201d When, as in the present case, a party, admitting his indebtedness, resorts to a court for the purpose of procuring a judgment determining to which of tAvo or more claimants payment should be made, he does not tender any issue nor seek any relief not relating to the payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Conceding that one or more of the rival claimants may assert a right to the stake on grounds which call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>for equitable relief, do counsel for the plaintiff in error correctly assert that such grounds appear in Mrs. Lange\u2019s allegations respecting the manner and. purpose of the procurement of the second certificate?' It is not alleged that any instrument had been procured from her which at law would, bar the assertion, of her claim as holder of the prior certificate, and. which she would therefore be entitled to have canceled, by the decree of a court of equity.- There was no-prayer for relief by any of the modes peculiar to-courts of equity, nor were there allegations of fact-making such relief necessary or appropriate. There-being no suit for equitable relief by either party, there Avas an \u201caction for money only.\u201d Whether a party,, plaintiff or defendant, tenders issues of fact not triable to a jury as of right, must always be determined by regarding, not the principles which the court is, required to consider and apply in determining the. rights of the parties, but what decree it is required, to enter upon its journal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-6\">Burkict, C.
