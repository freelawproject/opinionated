He left a large personal estate, also real estate situate in Cincinnati, which descended to his daughter Leora. All this he had derived by deed of gift from his father. In 1897 the guardian of Leora applied to the probate court of Hamilton for authority to sell certain of the real estate, under favor of section 6280, Revised Statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>on the ground that a better investment could be made-in government bonds or ground rents. The court, made the order prayed for directing the sale. The-net proceeds amounted to $8,253.14. Prior to this, the guardian had received $5,000, the proceeds of certain policies of fire insurance upon buildings belonging to his ward and inherited by her from her-father. The guardian invested this entire fund in government bonds, and subsequently sold the bonds,, and, in pursuance of the order of the probate court,, invested the proceeds, together with the proceeds of the real estate, in a ground rent. October 3, 1898,. the guardian resigned, and the defendant in error,, Harry L. Cooper, was by the probate court appointed, trustee. The privilege of purchase being exercised as to the above named ground rent, $20,000, the proceeds, were received by the trustee, and that amount, was thereupon by him reinvested in other ground rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">Subsequently, in 1900, Leora McCammon died,, aged fifteen, intestate and unmarried. The trustee-settled his account in the probate court, and was ordered, on motion of the mother, now Ida Leora Olmstead, to convey to her the said real estate or ground i^ents in his name as trustee, in fee simple, and to turn, over to the administrator of Leora deceased, the-money and personal property' in his hands. From this order plaintiffs in error, Wm. McCammon, the-brother of George McCammon, and John L. McCammon, the nephew of George McCammon, his only heirs-at law, having theretofore appeared in the probate court to resist the motion, and having filed their claim tq said two funds, $8,253.14 and $5,000, appealed the-case to the court of common pleas. In that court, upon, hearing, the same order was made as that of the; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>probate court That judgment was affirmed by the \u25a0circuit court, and the McCammons bring error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-4\"><em>Mr. Harlan Cleveland; Mr. John E.

Stat .</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">' Spear, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azp\">The .claim of plaintiffs in error is that the property inherited by Leora McCammon from her father, having been ancestral property, and the plaintiffs in error being the only heirs at law of the ancestor, they are entitled, by force of our statute of descent and distribution, to the inheritance. Not that the precise estate which was owned by Leora Mc-Cammon, at her decease, came to her by inheritance, for without question, it did not, but that that property was purchased by the proceeds of the real estate which she did inherit, and which had been sold by her guardian; and that by applying the rule of equitable conversion, the funds derived from the sale continued during the life of Leora, in whatever form they were invested, to be impressed with the character of ancestral property for purposes of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We think the proposition cannot be maintained. It is conceded that under the authority of <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Ohio, 119, and <em>Pence </em>v. <em>Pence, </em>11 Ohio St., 290, the proceeds of the sale of land would have become personal property, with all the incidents of such property as to distribution, in the event of the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of Leora, but for the act of March 18, 1890, which added a proviso to section 4163, Revised Statutes (the section which directs the distribution of personal property), which proviso is: \u201cprovided, that any fund in the hands of any administrator, guardian, assignee or other, trustee which has arisen from the sale of real estate, which real estate came to such intestate by descent, devise or deed of gift from an ancestor, shall descend according to the course of descent described by section 4158 for ancestral real estate.\u201d And the contention with respect to this proviso is that the term \u201cany fund in the hands of any * * * guardian * * * or other trustee\u201d means the proceeds of the sale so long as held by the guardian or trustee under his trust and unexpended, into whatsoever form he may in fact change them by investment, thus seeking by construction to engraft upon our statute the equitable rulfe, enforced in many jurisdictions, that when for any reason the court changes the character of the property belonging to infants, it will not permit the change to alter its devolution. The proposition, as applied to this* case, is open to many answers. One is that the proviso, in its language and apparent intent, is dealing with present conditions. It does not- deal with the past except that if the fund which then exists has arisen from the sale of ancestral real estate its devolution is controlled by this proviso. But the proviso cannot be aided or enlarged by the application of any equitable* rule. As held in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>45 Ohio St., 77, \u201cthe statutes of descent and distribution are not to be construed and administered upon equitable principles, but by rules of law,\u201d and in <em>Hutchings </em>v. Davis, 68 Ohio St., 160, \u201ccourts cannot, by reason of any real or imagined equities limit, qualify or annul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>rights granted by legislative enactment.\u201d In other words, the general assembly must be held to have intended to express its entire meaning by the natural import of the words used. The natural import of the term \u201cfund which has arisen from the sale of real estate\u201d implies a fund which has directly arisen from that source. The principle of <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Bunt, </em>18 Ohio St., 311, is applicable here. It is there held that: \u201cThe title to real estate which must have come to an intestate by devise, or deed of gift from an ancestor, to constitute ancestral property, is the title under which the intestate <em>immediately </em>held.\u201d Not that the word \u201cdirectly\u201d is found in this proviso, but neither was the word \u201cimmediately\u201d found in the statute under review in the case above cited. If the intention had been by this proviso to give ancestral heirs any right to the proceeds of the sale of infants\u2019 real estate inherited from the ancestor, in any form it may be made to assume in the future, such intention would have been expressed in apt language. It is not, we think, reasonable to assume that the legislature intended to go farther in the adoption of the doctrine of equitable conversion than the ordinary meaning of the words used imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">But it seems hardly worth while to pursue this line further. Another answer fully covers the case. The proviso does not apply because the property in question was not a fund in the hands of the trustee. A fund is well defined as money or its equivalent gathered for, or to be appropriated to, a specific object. The property in controversy is not personal property of any kind; it is a right to real estate, and it isn\u2019t of consequence what form the inheritance of the minor assumed from time to time after her father\u2019s decease and before her own. At the time of the latter event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the inheritance had taken the form of real estate to which she had a right. And this applies as well to the insurance money as to the other; so that no different rule of law is involved. The descent of real estate as to which the owner dies intestate, is controlled by either section 4158 or 4159, Revised Stab utes, depending upon whether the estate thus left came to the deceased by descent, devise, or deed, of gift, or by purchase. If by purchase, and that is the character of this estate, then , the latter section controls, and the estate in controversy. would \u25a0 under the fifth clause of that section, and by force of the ruling in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>and <em>Pence </em>v. <em>Pence, supra, </em>pass to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">There is no error in the judgment of the circuit court affirming that of the common pleas, and it will be</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-7\">Burket, C.
