L., 190.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b554-5\">Spear, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC8\">Whether or not the cause had beem finally submitted to the jury at the time that body was permitted to separate at the noon hour is the important question in the case. Primarily .it is a. question of fact, but the actual facts not being in dispute it becomes a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Without doubt it is the policy of our statutes that, the jurors to whom shall be committed the questiom of the guilt or innocence of one charged with crime,., should be prevented from receiving impressions during the trial calculated to influence the verdict, except such as are legitimately conveyed to them by the-evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the charge of \" the court. Hence our.statute, section 73.12,, provides; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that: \u201cWhen the case is finally submitted, the jurors must be kept together in some convenient place, under the charge of an officer, until they agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by the court; the officer having them in charge shall not suffer any communication to be made to them, nor make any himself, except to ask them if they have agreed upon a verdict, unless by order of the court; * * * and if the jurors be permitted to separate during the trial, they should be admonished by the court that it is their duty not to converse with, nor suffer themselves to be addressed by, any person, nor to listen to any conversation on the subject of the trial, nor to form or express an opinion thereon, until the cause is finally submitted to them.\u201d This section, as it stood in the criminal code (section 164), prohibited the separation of jurors in the trial of felonies after being sworn until discharged, and in the trial of misdemeanors separation was forbidden after the charge of the court until discharged. The clear implication is that, by the amendment now embodied in the section above cited, it was intended to permit separation in all criminal cases during trial, and before submission, coupled with the admonition to the jury above stated, and that such separation would not naturally tend to subject the jury to improper influences, nor in any way prevent a fair trial. Another feature of the amendment is of importance in this connection. \u201cAfter receiving the charge of the court,\u201d is the concluding phrase of the old section; \u201cuntil the cause is finally submitted to them,\u201d is the concluding phrase of the section as it now stands, and the entire section (7312) hinges on the condition with which the section begins, viz.: that the case has been- \u201cfinally submitted.\u201d Another implication from this same section would seem to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>fairly clear, and that is that the giving of the charge-of the court might not in all cases afford the test of' whether or not the case had been finally submitted. It is true that a preceding section (7300) provides; that at the conclusion of the evidence either party-may request instructions to the jury on points of law to be given before argument, and it is suggested that-these instructions might be regarded as a charge and that this induced the changed phraseology of the-amendment. But this provision was also embodied in the criminal code (section 151), and remains substantially the same. So that, the fair inference is,, that the charge referred to in the code is the general charge which is to be given immediately after argument. This inference is strengthened when we remember that it has been customary in our courts from time immemorial for the court, at the end of' the argument, or of the evidence where no argument is had, to give a general charge to the jury, and our legislation respecting the conduct of trials always has. been, and we think should be, construed in the light of the practice which has prevailed. Hence, when the old statute forbade separation of the jury after-receiving the charge of the court, it was this general charge which was referred to, and were that language-in the present law no doubt would exist as to the requirement to keep the jury together after receiving the charge until discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">It is the contention of defendant in error that while-the language of the old and the new is different, yet there is no difference in the meaning; therefore that the separation of the jurors was a violation of the mandatory provision of the statute, a statute enacted to protect- the rights of persons charged with crime,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>and prejudice will be conclusively presumed; hence-the error is fatal to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Several objections occur to this proposition. If it had been the purpose of the lawmakers to provide that the giving of the judge\u2019s charge should invariably' be regarded as a final submission, no reason whatever\u2019 is apparent for the change of the statute. The former rule was a simple one, easily understood and as easily followed. For some reason the change was deemed important. We think the natural inference is that it was intended to remove the iron-clad rule and leave-some discretion in the trial judge as to when he would finally submit the case. The statute requires the delivery to the jury of the written charge when a written) charge has been requested, and it is usual to deliver also the indictment, blank verdicts, and such exhibits-as may be put in evidence, and the submission would not be fully completed until that had been done. Nor does it follow, though this separation be deemed an irregularity, that prejudice to the rights of th\u00e9 defendant is to be presumed. We suppose the rule is well settled that where the failure to observe a statutory requirement naturally works prejudice to* a party, the burden is not on him to show that he was; in fact prejudiced. It is observed in <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>State,. </em>42 Ohio St, 154, opinion by Okey, J., that: \u201cOrdinarily, if a statutory provision or principle of the-common law, applicable to the case, is disregarded on the trial of a person charged with crime, where its enforcement would tend to preserve his right to an impartial trial, he.is to be'regarded as prejudiced in his substantial rights, as he is always to be deemed so prejudiced where he is deprived of a constitutional' guaranty designed for the protection of the person\u2014 still, if there has been a failure to observe some mere: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>matter of form, where the officer or other person ..charged with the duty acted in good faith, the court must determine whether the failure to observe such form tended in any way to deprive the accused of a-fair trial, and whether, looking to the statutory provisions relating to criminal procedure, it was intended' that such failure should necessarily require a reversal of the judgment.\u201d But in this, case the. jurors, by virtue of the statute, might properly be-permitted to separate before the evidence and arguments had been, concluded, and. this permission of the statute is on the assumption that such a separation will not naturally work prejudice. If this be true, how can it be affirmed that a separation at the. \u2022conclusion of the charge, the jurors being instructed \u2022that they had not yet received the c\u00e1se finally, as they In fact had not, and being carefully cautioned, would naturally work prejudice to the defendant? We -think the assumption unwarranted. The situation would be essentially different if that body had entered' npon its deliberations, and there is manifestly strong Teason .for the statutory requirement that during deliberation they be kept together.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Affidavits of the jurors were given in evidence all \u2022showing that they had obeyed the court\u2019s caution, and \u2022tending to. rebut any presumption of prejudice. We do not regard this evidence as relevant, there being no issue as to prejudice, although it is somewhat comforting.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In the days when courts were prompted, because \u2022of the rigidity of the criminal law, to look for technicalities in order to protect human rights, it was natural perhaps to givp strained construction to language in order to secure that object. But in this (enlightened day there is no occasion for unnatural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>scrutiny. A reasonable construction of language we think more in consonance with the spirit of our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is our conclusion that, giving fair construction to the statute, the evidence shows that the case was not finally submitted until the return of the jury at one P. M., and the indictment, written charge, and other papers then delivered. -</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The judgment of the circuit court will, therefore, be reversed and that of the common pleas affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-8\">Davis, Sha\u00fcck, Price and Crew, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
