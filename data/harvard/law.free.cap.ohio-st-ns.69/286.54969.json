It is further-averred in the petition that on September 24, 1899, in the night of said day, the defendant in error was passing along said sidewalk on Front street when he came to the point where said alley intersects with' Front street, and while using due care on his part, the billboard fell upon the plaintiff crushing him to' the stone, pavement and sidewalk, and injured him. For all of which he claims a judgment against the city in the sum of $15,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">There was a demurrer to the petition, which was overruled in the court of common pleas. The city answered, denying each and every allegation in the petition except that it is a municipal corporation as alleged, and that the sidewalk on the west side of Front street is much traveled upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to arrest the testimony from the jury and to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant, which motion was overruled and defendant excepted. The motion was renewed at the close of all of the evidence, and was again overruled and the same exception taken. Verdict was rendered in favor of the defendant in error, and judgment was entered thereon after overruling a motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>trial in the court of common pleas. On petition in \u25a0error in the circuit court the judgment was affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-4\"><em>Mr. A. E. Culbert, </em>city solicitor, and <em>Mr. James Hunt, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">First. We claim that granting all that is charged, and proven by plaintiff below, there is no liability upon the part of the city. It is well settled that the municipality is a part of the state, and as such is not liable in damages in actions of this character unless expressly made so by statute, or unless the injury or damage arises from negligence of the municipality in connection with the exercise by it of some proprietary interest or control over the thing or object causing the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">It is true that section 2640, Revised Statutes, provides that: \u201cThe council shall have the care, supervision and control of all public highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, public grounds and bridges within the corporation, and shall cause the same to be kept open and in repair and free from nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">It will be noticed that this statute contains no provision that a failure to exercise any of this authority or to perform any of these duties shall make the municipality liable in damages to a person injured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-9\">There is a distinction between the powers of a municipality, which are exercised by virtue of its proprietary rights and powers and those which it exercises by virtue of its governmental authority. <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>33 Ohio St., 336.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">The city had no proprietary interest in, or control over, this signboard, or the building to which it was attached. It did not authorize the placing of the signboard where it was at the time of the injury, and it had no actual knowledge of its existence or condition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>If the character and condition of this signboard was such as to make it an object of danger, and a nuisance, which in the exercise of ordinary care the city was bound to take notice of and abate, then by not doing so the city failed merely to exercise a governmental power or duty, and for such failure it is not liable. <em>Frederick </em>v. <em>Columbus, </em>58 Ohio St., 538; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Greenville, </em>42 Ohio St., 625; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>19 Ohio St., 19; <em>Western College </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>12 Ohio St., 375; <em>City of Dayton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>62 Ohio St., 11; <em>Custer </em>v. <em>New Philadelphia, </em>11 Circ. Dec., 9; 20 C. C. R., 177; Elliott on Roads and Streets (2 ed.), sec. 658, It will be noticed from its opinion that the circuit court lays some stress upon the case of <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>not reported, but referred to in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Greenville, </em>42 Ohio St., 625. We think that this court have fully disposed of the case of <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Fry </em>in <em>Frederick </em>v. <em>City of Columbus, </em>58 Ohio St., 538,</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\">Second. We contend further that aside from the question of the responsibility of the municipality for failure to take notice of nuisances and abate them that there is no liability in this case for the reason that failure to take notice of the condition and existence of this, particular signboard did not amount to culpable negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">Now we understand, of course, that negligence is a mixed question of law and fact, and it may be claimed that the question, as to whether or not the existence of this board in this alley was negligence, was a question for the jury. We claim not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">It is not a* case where there is any dispute as to the facts, and it is not a case about which reasonable' minds might differ as to the proper inference to be drawn. We think that the facts disclosed by the evidence call for a legal as distinct from the logical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>deduction, and the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">We think it was clearly a question for the, court <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>28 Ohio St., 340; <em>Railway Co., </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>24 Ohio St., 631; <em>Pennsylvania Co. v. Rathgeb, </em>32 Ohio St., 66; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>6 Circ. Dec., 516; 10 C. C. R., 362; <em>Street Railway Co. v. Isaacs, </em>10 Circ. Dec., 49; 18 C. C. R., 177.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>Messrs. Garver, Garver &amp; Garver </em>and <em>Messrs. Fine-frock &amp; Garver, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">The judgment of the court below, we strenuously insist, is fully sustained by the following authorities: <em>City of Circleville </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>59 Ohio St., 285; <em>Village of Oak Harbor </em>v. <em>Kallagher, </em>52 Ohio St., 183; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>8 Ohio St., 358; <em>White </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>11 Ohio St., 553; Deering on Neg., 153, 154; <em>Brogand </em>v. <em>Broadway Foundry Co., </em>87 Mo., 321; Boone on Corp., sec. 293, n. 12, p. 456; <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>32 Me., 431; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Leavenworth, </em>15 Kan., 87; Moak\u2019s Underhill on Torts, 712; <em>Requa </em>v. <em>City of Rochester, </em>45 N.

Supp., 296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We call especial attention of the case of the <em>City of Circleville </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>59 Ohio St., 285, for we believe that this case solves many of the doubts heretofore existing as to the law of these cases and fully and conclusively answers the contention urged by the plaintiff in its brief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">We contend that the billboard was a nuisance, according to the provision of section 2640, Revised Statutes, that it remained in a dangerous condition for nearly a year; that being there so long the city was bound to take notice thereof, and their failure to abate the nuisance was negligence. <em>Moore v. Townsend, </em>78 N. W. Rep., 880; <em>Kunz </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>10 N. E. Rep., 442; <em>Langan </em>v. <em>City of Atchison, </em>57 Am. Rep., 165; <em>Duffey </em>v. <em>Dubuque, </em>63 Ia., 171; 50 Am. Rep., 743.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">It would only require the foresight of an ordinary school boy to know that a board with a surface of fifty-six square feet, weighing fifty or sixty pounds, standing against a building in an alley where the wind has a clean sweep, with buildings on either side of the alley for a number of feet, forming a funnel or passageway for the wind, would do just what was. done on this occasion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b321-8\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoU\">In this case the question is raised on the record and argued, that the cityj if it failed at all in its duty, merely failed to exercise a governmental power or duty, and that for such failure it is not liable under any circumstances. But assuming for the purposes of this case that the city might be liable for an injury resulting from the alleged nonfeasanc\u00e9, still it could not be held liable before reasonable notice of the unsafe condition of the street had been brought home to the corporation. <em>Circleville </em>v. <em>Sohn, </em>59 Ohio St., 285. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>It does not appear that actual notice was given to this corporation or its officers; but it is claimed that under the circumstances the city ought to have known that the billboard was dangerous and threatening to people passing along the street, and therefore that the city is chargeable with constructive notice of the alleged nuisance. In those jurisdictions where municipal corporations are held liable to individuals for negligence in respect to keeping its streets open, in repair and free from nuisance, it is held that while the corporation is not an insurer of the safety of its streets, alleys and sidewalks, it will be held liable for injuries to persons resulting from neglect of the corporation to keep its ways in a reasonably safe condition for travel in the ordinary modes under ordinary circumstances. In <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>44 Ohio St., 505, it is said in the opinion: \u201cWe do not understand that a city is bound at all hazards to have knowledge of defects in sidewalks. Municipal corporations are not insurers of the safety of their public ways, or of the lives and limbs of pedestrians. The law provides that such corporations shall have the care, supervision and control of the streets, and shall cause them to be kept open and in repair, and free from nuisance. This requires a reasonable vigilance, in view of all the surroundings,, and does not exact that which is impracticable. When the authorities have done that which is reasonable in this regal\u2019d they have discharged the entire obligation imposed by the law. They are not bound to use all possible vigilance in inspection or in obtaining information.\u201d Also in <em>Village </em>v. <em>Kallagher, </em>52 Ohio St., 183, it is held that a municipal corporation \u201cis not bound to anticipate improbable or unprecedented events, and provide against their possible results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Under the law as thus stated, and upon the undisputed facts of this case, we do not think that the defendant in error has shown a right to recover against the plaintiff in error. It is not claimed that the city had actual knowledge of the existence of the billboard and of the danger to the public therefrom. Constructive notice is claimed from the fact that it was loose and stood leaning against a building, in an alley and near to the street. If it stood there six or eight months, as claimed by the defendant in error, it does not appear to have been such a permanent, inconvenience or obstruction, or that it was such a threatening danger as to have attracted much, if any, attention, or to have caused any alarm, or to have induced any complaint to the officers of the city. It is perfectly plain that under ordinary circumstances it was not dangerous, nor in any serious sense an obstruction. If the billboard was as large and heavy as the plaintiff claims, it could not have been expected to be thrown out into the street with the force and violence claimed, by a light breeze or any ordinary wind. The city was not bound to interfere with private rights to prevent an \u201cimprobable\u201d result, or one which in ordinary experience might not have been foreseen. In short, upon the undisputed facts, it is palpable that the city was not guilty of want of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The judgment of the circuit court and that of the court of common pleas are</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment for plaintiff in error.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-8\">B\u00fcrket, C.
