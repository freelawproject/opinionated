It is said that it is one of the conditions of the policy that if the interest of the plaintiff was not truly stated, or if he was not the sole and unconditional owner of the property insured, or if the property was encumbered by chattel mortgage, then the policy is void. I say to you that in such case, the policy would be rendered void in part, but not necessarily in its entirety; that is to say it would be void, and plaintiff would have no right of action upon it as to any item or items of the property insured to which either of these misstatements or defective statements applied; but the policy in other respects, and as to the other property insured would remain in force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">\u201cThis defense is particularly applicable to the so-called surgical chair mentioned in the policy. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the undisputed evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not \u25a0entitled to a verdict for any loss sustained by the destruction of said chair or damage to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">And the court refused to instruct the jury to the effect that if they should find from, the evidence that at the time of securing the policy of insurance the plaintiff was not the sole and unconditional owner of the surgical chair, and that he fraudulently concealed this fact from the insurance company, then this was such a concealment and misrepresentation as would avoid the whole policy, and the plaintiff could not recover. Verdict was rendered for the plaintiff in the :sum of $430. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and a bill of exceptions taken, and petition in error filed in the. circuit court, which court affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-6\"><em>Mr. O. </em>IF. <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Messrs.

Beattie, </em>for defendant in error, argued orally but submitted no brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-8\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsB\">It has been twice adjudged by this court that policies of insurance, like other contracts, should ibe reasonably construed, so as to give effect to the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>press words of the parties and not to defeat their <em>in</em>tention. <em>West et al. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>27 Ohio St., 1, 9-10; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>62 Ohio St., 529. See also Joyce on Insurance, secs. 208, 216. And this, rule of construction should be observed notwithstanding the rule that when a policy is open to two interpretations which are equally fair, that one should be preferred which would give to the insured the greater-\" indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">There is no ambiguity in this policy; and it is not. contended that it is ambiguous. Counsel for the defendant in error insists that the words: \u201cThis entire policy shall be void,\u201d etc., have no more force than if the word \u201centire\u201d were omitted, and that therefore-this case is controlled by <em>Coleman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>49 Ohio St., 310. There is much force in the argument that the clauses, \u201cThis policy shall become-void\u201d and \u201cThis entire policy shall become void,\u201d' mean the same thing; but by no legitimate construction can the latter clause be restricted to less than the-whole policy and whatever is included in it, and therefore the strength of the argument, if it has any, goes-to the soundness of the decision in <em>Coleman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. </em>The two cases, however, are plainly distinguishable. In the former case the language used in the policy, whether ambiguous in itself or not, had frequently been the subject of construction and- ingenious debate, resulting in diametrically opposite conclusions in the courts. In this case the parties, no-doubt with knowledge of previous controversies, seem to have endeavored to put the indivisible character of their contract beyond controversy by inserting the word \u201centire;\u201d and in our judgment they succeeded in their purpose. Unless we reject this controlling word and thus'make a new contract for the parties, the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>policy means precisely what it says and cannot be valid in part and void in part. The parties have agreed that it should not be a severable risk and they have clearly expressed that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In one case the policy provided that: \u201cThis entire policy, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed thereon or added hereto, shall be void,\u201d etc. It was held that: \u201cThe stipulation in regard to the forfeiture is applicable to the policy <em>as an entirety .\u201d Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>82 Md., 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">In another case the policy contained these words: \u201cThis entire policy, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed hereon or added hereto, shall be void, if the subject of insurance be a building on ground not owned by the insured in fee simple.\u201d The insured owned the building which was insured but did not own the land on which it stood. The court said: \u201cWe have looked to see whether the suit might not go on as to the chattels contained in the building. The words of the written contract are: \u2018This entire policy, etc.,, shall be. void if the subject of insurance is a building,\u2019 etc. This language is plain and must control;\u201d and the court directed the lower court to enter judgment for the defendant. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>57 N. J. Law, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">In New York the court of appeals has distinguished a policy providing that \u201cthis entire policy and every part thereof shall be void\u201d from cases which are cited, and which are like <em>Coleman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., supra, </em>the court saying: '\u201cThis policy is quite different in its legal effect from those considered in' the cases cited, it not being expressly provided in those policies, as in this, that a misrepresentation of the situation of one of the subjects insured should invalidate the insurance on all other property covered bv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the policy.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>118 N. Y., 518, 526. \u201cEvery part thereof\u201d includes the whole the same as \u201cThis entire policyand we therefore do not regard this New York policy as materially differing; in its provisions from the one in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The judgments of the circuit court and the court of' common pleas are</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-7\">Burket, C.
