Oliver Hewitt testified as follows: \u201c In May, 1848, at the instance of the plaintiff\u2019s son, I enquired of Russel Wheeler, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>one of the defendants, whether he and Dudley R. Wheeler, the other defendant, had ever paid over the money to Kinney. He replied that they had not, and should not pay him, until he gave security to finish the house, or assigned over the policy of insurance. He did not say how much they had, but said they had never paid him anything. This conversation I communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s son, and her suit was commenced. The defendants had always told me that they had refused to pay over the money, until Kinney had given security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">\u201c Afterwards, when the cause was on trial in. the county court, said Russel, when asked by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, whether they, the defendants, had funds in their hands, said they had, and always intended to keep them, until security was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">\u201c In January, 1852, when the plaintiff was about to take the deposition of Gideon P. Grant, the said Russel was present, and- requested that the taking of the deposition might be postponed, that the defendants might have an opportunity to procure the assistance of counsel; that while there, Denison Hewitt, in the presence of several persons, asked the said Russel, if he paid the plaintiff\u2019s debt, if it would come out of his hands, and he replied, \u2018 No.\u2019 Denison then said,\u00a3 You have the money, and it is immaterial to whom you pay it,\u2019 and the said Russel replied, \u2018 Yes.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Afterwards, said Dudley, in a conversation with me at his store, said, that after the suit against Kinney was commenced, he went to the plaintiff to pay her the debt, and spoke to her about it. She said the suit could be settled if he would pay her the amount due to her. He replied that he knew that before. And he further stated that he did not settle with her, because she would not make the deduction that others did, who copied at the same time. This was previous to the former trial in the superior court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">\u201c Prior to the commencement of the original suit, the defendants always said to me that they were owing Kinney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and should not pay him, until he gave security, or assigned the policy, and requested me to sign the contract with them.\u201d Upon his cross examination he said, \u201c This was stated at different times. That before the commencement of the original suit, perhaps in the month of April or May, said Russel wished me to come down, as he wanted to pay some money to Kinney, $1,500; they said they had the money. They had the funds paid into their hands by subscribers, for sums subscribed to be paid by the building committee. He wanted to pay over $1,500, and save the interest upon it. They told me they had funds to pay over to Kinney, and, at one time, the said Russel said he told Kinney that he wanted to pay him $1,500, but would not do it, unless they could do it safely. He said he had not paid, but was under an obligation to pay.\u201d Upon being shewn the contract with Kinney, and asked if that was not the contract, he replied that he believed that to be the contract which the said Russel showed him; it was like it. He knew of no other contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">2. The deposition of Gideon P.

I told him I had been to see Kinney about getting my pay. Wheeler told me to go back and get an order on the committee ; he would accept one; the committee would. I told him that was of no use; I had been to see Kinney; he would not give any order. Wheeler then advised me to sue and take the same course the rest had taken. I told him who had sued, and how many; he told me there was money enough in their hands to make me whole. I said at the time of giving my former deposition there were some two thousand dollars in their hands, but I will not now state positively.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">Questions by defendants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">Question. \u201c Did you get your pay ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Answer. \u201c I got the most of it; I did not get all of it; I got the pay of Dudley R.

I had received, up to May 16th, 1848, but $1,724.44, and had paid out, and become obligated to pay, $1,867.67. The house was in an unfin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ished state, and hardly any part finished off according to contract, so as to entitle Kinney to any payment.\u201d The witness then proceeded to enumerate the several sums which he had received, the sums which he had paid out, and assumed to pay, and the particulars in which the house was not built according to the contract. He then proceeded: \u201c I supposed I was not indebted to Kinney. The plaintiff copied us first, and Grant the next day. Kinney settled with the attaching creditors, and we paid them as fast as he did the work. We had to pay bills to prevent the materials from being attached. There were no funds in our hands for which Kinney could sue; no agreement to pay him anything except what arose under that contract, and no obligation to pay.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">2. Russel Wheeler testified: \u201c I was one of the building committee, made no other contract with Kinney than the one produced, and was not indebted to him except upon that. It was understood that Dudley R. Wheeler should receive all the moneys and pay them out. I have received no money except in one instance, ten dollars, and paid it over the next day. Kinney owed Grant some $200 or $300. Grant came to my house. I told him if Kinney fulfilled his contract, we should owe him from $1,000 to $2,000. That was the substance of what I said. I did not say I had funds, or would accept an order; and had refused to accept drafts that night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">\u201c I recollect going to the meeting-house with Oliver Hewitt ; was desirous of getting the .policy of insurance which Kinney had obtained; offered by way of inducement to advance him some $1,000; did it to induce him to assign the policy; never stated, that I had funds of his; have at all times been in advance to him; should not have stood about the amount to be advanced to him, had he given us security, which he refused to do. He never completed the house, to the acceptance of the building committee. The society took it off his hands, before it was completed, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>was dedicated, June 27th, 1848. The house was taken as it then was.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">3. The deposition of Sanford P. Brown, as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">\u201c I worked on, the meeting-house in North Stonington then being built by Joseph Kinney. I began to work May 15th, 1848, preparing for laying the steps, there being then none laid. May 16th, moved dirt sufficient today the foundation for steps and drew stones for that purpose. May 18th, placed the first step; May 19th, at work on the same; then discontinued work until May 29th, except half a day May 27th. I worked on the area wall, also worked May 29th and 31st, and three-quarters of a day June 1st, and did no more work for pay, the steps being not finished. The flagging on which the pillars were to stand, was not placed, and the buttresses at the end of the Steps were not up, and not completed. The four Ionic pillars for the front of the house were lying on the ground beside the wall. When I began work, nothing was done to the area wall; when I quit, it was about one-third finished. George W. Bentley worked on the steps when I did. When I left work there was no iron railing to the front steps. I afterwards worked inside the house, puttying nail holes, &amp;c., for which I made no charge; the work had been primed but not grained. Can\u2019t say the exact date, made no entry, worked part of two days, from the 19th of May, to the 29th. We were waiting for steps, which had to be brought from Hopkinton.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">4. The deposition of Gideon P. Grant, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">\u201c I was at work for Joseph Kinney, when Russel Wheeler and Dudley R. Wheeler contracted with him to build the meeting-house in Milltown, and said Kinney became indebted to me for work. I left him a short time before said house was finished, and went to work for another man, and I was informed that persons he was indebted to had sued him and copied the committee. I wen# to see Kinney where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>was at work at the meeting-house, and told him I felt uneasy about my pay, and asked him for security; he wished to know what security I wanted; I told him I would accept of an order from him on the committee; he refused giving any order; he said he would give no man an order. Then I went to Russel Wheeler\u2019s house, and told him that I had been to see Kinney, about getting my pay, and he told me that he would not give any order to any one. I told Russel Wheeler that I was anxious to have my pay, and 1 told him who had copied, told him the number, and he told me, that they were owing Kinney, over two thousand dollars, (it was twenty-two or twenty-three hundred dollars, I think,) and if he would not give an order on the committee, that I should sue him and copy the committee; that they had money enough in their hands that belonged to him, to make me whole, and I ought to have my pay. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">Question by plaintiff. <em>u </em>Was the time you had the conversation with Russel Wheeler, the day after Mrs. Hewitt copied the two Messrs.

The votes of the Congregational society, which were introduced upon the former trial of the cause, appointing the defendants their committee, and authorizing them to build and finish said meeting-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-10\">The foregoing was substantially all the evidence in the case relative to the indebtedness of the defendants to the said Kinney, and there was no evidence of any indebtedness from the defendants to Kinney, except such as grew out of their dealings, in relation to the building of said meeting-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-11\">Upon this evidence, the defendants requested the court to charge the jury, that if their declarations and acts, as testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, were made, and done, in their character and capacity of a committee, for building a meeting-house for the society, and under and by virtue of the aforesaid contract, they were not liable to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in their argument to the jury, admitted that the contract, produced in evidence by the defendants, was not binding upon them personally, but was a contract between the society and Kinney, and that it had so been decided by this court; that if the jury should find no other indebtedness to Kinney on the part of the defendants, than such as arose under, and by virtue of that contract, the plaintiff could not recover. But they claimed to have proved, by their evidence, an indebtedness of the defendants to Kinney, outside of, and independent of such contract, for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>they were liable personally to Kinney, and upon which ground alone, they claimed that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">The court instructed the jury, in conformity with the admissions made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, informing them, that if they should find no other indebtedness of the defendants, than such as arose under and by virtue of said contract, the defendants were not liable in the present action. That, although said contract did not bind' them personally, but only the society, whose agents they were, yet it did not preclude them, in . the course of subsequent dealings with Kinney, from becoming personally indebted to him, as claimed by the plaintiff, and that if they had in fact become so indebted, and in a manner rendering them personally liable to Kinney, such indebtedness could lawfully be attached by the plaintiff, and would entitle her to a verdict. And whether there was any indebtedness on the part of the defendants, when the copy was left with them in service, and if so whether it arose under said contract, or in some other manner, were questions of fact for them to determine from the evidence before them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">The jury, having rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">They also moved, in arrest of judgment, 1. Because the declaration did not aver that the defendants were, in any other way, or capacity, described in the original writ, than as acting and contracting committee for building a Congregational meeting-house, nor that any copy of the writ and declaration was left with them in service, in any other way or capacity, or that they were indebted to said Kinney, in any other way or capacity, than as said committee. 2. Because, it did not aver that the officer, into whose hands the execution, in favor of the plaintiff in the original suit, was put, ever served the same, or made demand of the defendants, of the debt, or debts, due from them to said Kinney, or of the goods, or effects, of said Kinney, in their hands; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>merely averred that said officer, who served said execution, made his return thereof, with his endorsement thereon, that he made such demand, and that they refused to expose said goods, or pay said debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">The questions arising on both these motions were reserved for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-6\"><em>Pomeroy </em>and McCurdy, in support of the motion, conten-ded, that the declaration was insufficient,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-7\">1. Because it showed that the defendants were the acting and contracting committee of the society, and averred that they became indebted as such committee. Being, therefore, agents, with a responsible principal, they were not personally liable. The argument, that because they were not liable as a committee, therefore they must be as individuals, is absurd. The averment is a material one, and cannot be regarded as surplusage. Chitt. Pl., 174. The term, <em>\u201c </em>as committee,\u201d has already been decided not to be descriptive of the persons, but of their character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\">2. Because it contains no averment that the officer made demand, &amp;c., but only a recital of the evidence. 1 Sw. Dig., 614. 5 Conn. R., 594.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">3. That the verdict was against the evidence. There was no transaction between the parties, except such as grew out of their dealings, in relation to the building of the meetinghouse. The defendants made a contract on this subject, covering the whole ground, as a committee, and there is no evidence that they made another contract with the same man, of precisely the same kind, on the same subject, as individuals.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-10\"><em>Foster </em>and Wait, contra, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-11\">1. That the addition to the names of the defendants, in the original writ, in the suit of Hewitt against Kinney, and in the <em>scire facias </em>against the defendants, is merely <em>descriptio </em>personarum, and may be rejected as surplusage. <em>Magill </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Hinsdale, 6 Conn. R., 464. <em>Simonds </em>v. Heard, 23 Pick., 125. <em>Windsor et al. </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>5 Cush., 210. The suit was therefore brought against them as individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">2. That the declaration sets forth distinctly, that the officer, into whose hands the execution, in favor of Mary Hewitt against Kinney, was placed, made demand of the defendants as by statute required, and that they refused to pay the same, and to expose property for the officer to levy on. The form is the same that has been in use, in our state, for the last twenty-five years, and has been repeatedly approved, and sustained by our judges, on the circuit, when this question, now made, has been raised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">3. That the jury, in the present case, having been called on to pass upon a naked question of fact, and the evidence being contradictory, and its effect depending, to some extent, on the credibility of witnesses, a new trial ought not to be granted. To justify a court in s\u00e9tting aside a verdict, it must be so palpably against the evidence, as to show conclusively that the minds of the jury were not open to reason, and conviction, or that an improper influence was brought to bear on their deliberations. Our reports abound in cases, which establish this principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">The object in granting new trials, being to submit the facts to another jury, that they may be investigated and considered with greater deliberation and attention; then, in a case like this,, where there have been two trials, and two verdicts, the court will not set aside the second verdict, unless the verdict is such as to shock the sense of justice and right. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>2 Texas, 381. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Texas, 490. <em>State Bank </em>v. <em>Wooddy, </em>5 Eng., 638.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b309-8\">Ellsworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afs\">We think the motion in arrest cannot prevail. The objection that the defendants cannot be made personally liable, because, as it is said, they were copied as a committee, is without foundation. They were copied as the debtors of Joseph Kinney, if at all, and could not be copied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>otherwise; being named as a committee, is mere surplusage. We say, if they were not personally liable as debtors, they are not liable at all, and then they could not be copied as a committee, in any intelligent or legal sense of that process. The plaintiff\u2019, throughout the proceedings, has put her case upon the personal liability of the defendants, and for that very reason the defendants resist the claim. <em>Magill </em>v. <em>Hinsdale, </em>6 Conn. R., 464. <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>23 Pick., 464. <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>5 Cush., 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Nor is there more weight in the objection, that the declaration does not contain an allegation that the officer made demand of the debtor on the execution. The declaration contains averments, broad enough to let in such evidence, and we cannot admit that the court would have permitted a verdict for the plaintiff, if the fact of demand had not been duly proved. Besides, the allegation, that the sheriff \u201c duly served the execution on the 5th of March, 1849, and that he made return thereof, with his endorsement, that he had made demand of said debtor,\u201d is sufficient after verdict. The return on the execution was, of course, before the jury, and proved the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The motion .for a new trial for verdict against evidence, we think must be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On the former trial of this case, we held\u2018that the written contract, on which the plaintiff then relied for her claim, proved only an indebtedness of the Congregational society, and not of the defendants. We will not repeat the reasons there given.- It is now conceded, that the plaintiff cannot recover under the written contract, nor by reason of any indebtedness, growing out of it; but she claims to have proved a personal indebtedness of the defendants, outside of the contract, so that while the written contract shows that the society are the principals, and the committee are agents, in some way the agents have become principals, and the real principals have passed out of sight. This extraordinary transformation she endeavors to make out, chiefly, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>entirely, from the declarations of the defendants, said to have been made on different occasions and to different persons. We look with hesitation upon any such construction of the supposed admissions, for it is a construction alike unnatural, and without probable cause. Upon the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, however, we see no admissions, inconsistent with the original and continued relation of principal and agent, as claimed by the defendants. They were always a committee, and, we think, should be taken to have always spoken in that capacity. What they said, what they did, what they admitted, and what they were ready to do, and wished to have done, are entirely consistent with this view of the matter, and inconsistent with any other; it would be unjust to consider the defendants as meaning to express themselves otherwise. We have carefully looked over the testimony of all the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and have likewise compared it with the defendants\u2019 testimony, and every reexamination convinces us, that, under the charge of the court, the verdict is manifestly against evidence. The testimony of the plaintiff by itself, when considered alone, is exceedingly feeble and unsatisfactory, but when the testimony of the defendants comes in and we learn that the written contract and title subsists, we are quite satisfied that the defendants should be held to stand in no new or different relation, from that created by the contract itself; and further, we are not sure that the Congregational society themselves were debtors, according to the terms of the contract, and the admissions of the defendants. The defendants uniformly denied it; but at any rate, as to themselves, and any liability because funds were in their hands, it appears that one of them had never collected but ten dollars, and that sum he had paid out, and that the other, at the service of the copying process, the 16th of May, 1848, had received $1,724.44, and paid out, and become responsible for $1,867.67. We are always unwilling to interfere with the verdict of the jury, but it is indispensable at times, and in a case so bald and palpable as this, we cannot hesitate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>moment. It is not one of balanced testimony, but well nigh one, without any at all, and taking the whole together, there is not the least question in our minds, that the defendants were never the debtors of Mrs. Hewitt. For this reason we advise a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred, except Waite, J., who was disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">New trial to be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
