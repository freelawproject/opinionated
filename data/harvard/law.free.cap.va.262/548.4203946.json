At the plea hearing, the prosecutor represented to the court that Tidwell \u201cwill surrender his license to practice law immediately - immediately upon his entering this plea.\u201d Thereafter, the court accepted the plea and entered an order of conviction. Upon notification of Tidwell\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department, entered an order striking Tidwell\u2019s name from the roll of attorneys authorized to practice law in New York state. Pursuant to New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 90(4)(a), Tidwell\u2019s disbarment was automatic on his conviction of a felony, and no additional procedures were provided under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">Paragraph 13(G) requires that the Disciplinary Board issue an order to show cause why an attorney should not be disbarred from the practice of law in this jurisdiction when the Disciplinary Board is notified that the attorney has been disbarred from the practice of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>in another jurisdiction. The rule provides only three grounds upon which an attorney, in response to a show cause order, may allege that disbarment is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The Disciplinary Board received notice that Tidwell was disbarred by New York state and issued a show cause order directed to him. In response, Tidwell alleged that disbarment was improper because \u201cthe record of the proceeding in the other jurisdiction would clearly show that such proceeding was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a denial of due process.\u201d Part Six, \u00a7 IV, Para. 13 (G)(1). Following a hearing, the Disciplinary Board found that Tidwell failed to show that he was denied due process and ordered that his license to practice law in this Commonwealth be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">On appeal, Tidwell\u2019s primary complaint is that the Disciplinary Board erred in concluding that he failed to show that he was denied due process because he established that New York did not afford him the opportunity for notice and hearing prior to disbarment. In making this assertion, Tidwell maintains that under Paragraph 13(G), the relevant proceeding under review is the disbarment proceeding alone which, under New York law, consists of automatic disbarment upon conviction of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">This construction of Paragraph 13(G) is too narrow. It is well settled that legislatures have a right to prescribe standards of practice for attorneys and may identify situations in which an attorney\u2019s misdeeds will result in automatic disbarment. <em>See, e.g., Hawker v. New York, </em>170 U.S. 189, 195-96 (1898); <em>In re Collins, </em>188 Cal. 701, 704-06, 206 P. 990, 991-92 (1922). Therefore, the question in this case is not whether automatic disbarment violates due process, but whether the record shows that the entire process resulting in disbarment was so flawed that it denied Tidwell due process.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus the Disciplinary Board properly considered the record of the criminal proceeding along with the disbarment proceeding in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In considering a license revocation order of the Disciplinary Board, this Court makes an independent review of the record, giving the factual findings of the Disciplinary Board substantial weight and viewing them as prima facie correct. The conclusions of the Board will be sustained unless they are not justified by a reasonable view of the evidence or are contrary to the law. <em>Blue v. Seventh Dist. Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>of Virginia State Bar, 220 </em>Va. 1056, 1061-62, 265 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The record clearly establishes that Tidwell was not denied notice because he had notice of the crime of which he was charged and notice that conviction of such crime would result in disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Similarly, the record shows Tidwell was not denied the opportunity to be heard. Tidwell had the right to defend against the criminal charge but he chose to plead guilty. Regardless of whether Tidwell \u201csurrendered his license\u201d or his license was revoked automatically, he knew that as a result of pleading guilty to the felony, he would be disbarred. Tidwell does not claim he was coerced or otherwise denied due process in connection with his guilty plea and criminal conviction. He chose to plead guilty and was fully aware of the consequences that decision would have for his law license. Furthermore, Tidwell was entitled to appeal the disbarment order to the New York Court of Appeals, which he did not do. (N.Y. Jud. Law \u00a7 90(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Based on our review of the record, we hold that the Disciplinary Board did not err in concluding that Tidwell failed to satisfy his burden to show that he was denied due process because the evidence before the Disciplinary Board supported a finding that the New York proceedings resulting in Tidwell\u2019s disbarment did not violate Tidwell\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Tidwell\u2019s remaining assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board is affirmed. The appellant shall pay to the appellee $30.00 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">This order shall be certified to the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board and shall be published in the Virginia Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">A Copy, Teste: David B. Beach, Clerk</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> Tidwell\u2019s specific assignment of error challenging the admission of the transcript of the criminal proceeding was waived because he did not object to its admission at the hearing before the Disciplinary Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
