Tyler, who is African-American, alleged he appeared at Harrah\u2019s Casino in July 2003 to apply for a job and was told he must apply online; a \u201cglitch in [the] program ... prevented [him] from applying\u201d; he did not see any African-Americans working at the casino; and he was thus the victim of job discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-24\">We grant Tyler leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude preservice dismissal was inappropriate because Tyler\u2019s complaint, liberally construed, satisfied federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>pleading requirements by providing Harrah\u2019s Casino notice of Tyler\u2019s claim of race-based discrimination in its employment-application process. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2); <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A, </em>534 U.S. 506, 514-15, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <em>Smith v. St. Bernards Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>19 F.3d 1254, 1255 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
