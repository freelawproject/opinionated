Spatt, <em>District Judge), </em>dismissing their July 2002 complaint alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendants (1) committed \u201cconsumer harassment;\u201d (2) rejected their mortgage payments in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>lation of a settlement plan; (3) conspired to force them to leave their home; (4) \u201cdeceived the court\u201d and initiated a foreclosure action based on \u201cmisleading information;\u201d and (5) caused them to suffer medical and credit problems. In August 2003, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), holding that under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction: even reading the complaint liberally, the court found that the Swiatkowskis\u2019 lawsuit was effectively seeking to re-litigate a judgment of foreclosure entered against them by the state court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Luckett v. Bure, </em>290 F.3d 493, 496 (2d Cir.2002). It is well settled that inferior federal courts lack jurisdiction to review state court decisions. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482,103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. v. Distajo, </em>107 F.3d 126, 138 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Gentner v. Shulman, </em>55 F.3d 87, 89 (2d Cir.1995). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars not only claims that involve direct review of a state court decision, but also claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court decision. <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 198 (2d Cir. 1996). As we agree that the Swiatkowskis\u2019 claims are plainly covered by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court was correct in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear their lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The district court found that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking for still another reason: jurisdiction was predicated on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and there was not complete diversity between the parties. <em>See Cresswell v. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, </em>922 F.2d 60, 68 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201cIt is well established that for a case to come within this statute there must be complete diversity and that diversity is not complete if any plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant.\u201d). Because the Swiatkowskis and two of the defendants are New York citizens, the requirements for diversity jurisdiction cannot be met in this case. Accordingly, we also affirm on this alternative ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We have carefully considered all the Swiatkowskis\u2019 arguments, including those advanced in their 28J letter of June 2004, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
