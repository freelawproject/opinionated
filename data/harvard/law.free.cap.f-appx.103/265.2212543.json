The immigration judge found that Fonseca had been subjected to past violence, but that the evidence did not establish that he held a political belief or that his attackers targeted him because of any such belief. Fonseca\u2019s case is indistinguishable from <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), in which the Supreme Court held that a guerilla group\u2019s attempt to conscript unwilling civilians by force to further the guerillas\u2019 political views was not persecution on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion. Substantial evidence supported the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Fonseca did not prove past persecution on account of his political opinion or well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Fonseca also contends that the immigration judge erred in taking into account Fonseca\u2019s failure to relocate within his native country of Costa Rica to avoid persecution. Because Fonseca failed to prove that he had been subjected to persecution on account of his political opinion or that he had a well-founded fear of such persecution, it is unnecessary to decide whether the immigration judge properly considered the feasibility of relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-16\">. The official docket sheet spells petitioner's name \"Fonceca,\u201d but petitioner\u2019s brief refers to him as \"Fonseca,\u201d as do most of the administrative records. We therefore will adopt petitioner's spelling of his own name.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
