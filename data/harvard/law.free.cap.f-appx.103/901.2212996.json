He raises various issues, including the constitutionality of his <em>Terry </em>stop. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b936-20\">Ivory was spotted at night by two police officers in a remote, high-crime courtyard of the Green Hills apartment complex in Knoxville, Tennessee. Fearing that Ivory was a \u201cpeeping Tom\u201d or burglar, the officers decided to investigate and made their way to Ivory\u2019s location. By this time, Ivory had moved further down the building, away from the window, and was talking on his cellular telephone. After Ivory told the officers that he neither lived in the Green Hills Apartments nor knew anyone who lived there, they asked that Ivory turn around so that they could make sure that he was not armed and that he had not dropped anything on the ground around his location. When Ivory complied, one of the officers detected the outline of a gun along Ivory\u2019s waistband. He then frisked Ivory and discovered a loaded pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-21\">Ivory was indicted and tried on one count of being a felon in possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>firearm. His defense was that the gun was not his, that it belonged to a person named \u201cTiko,\u201d and that Ivory had discovered the gun minutes earlier in the seat cushion of a couch in one of the apartments and had confiscated the weapon so as to prevent children from mishandling it. (Ivory testified that he had been in the apartment of a friend of a friend.) The jury was instructed on the defense of necessity, and Ivory was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Ivory asserts four alleged errors on appeal: (1) the district court\u2019s finding that the police\u2019s investigatory <em>(\u201cTerry\u201d) </em>stop of Ivory was supported by reasonable suspicion, (2) an instruction to the jury that the interstate commerce element of the charged offense could be satisfied simply by showing that the gun at issue at some point crossed state lines, (3) a failure to instruct on the defense of temporary innocent possession, and (4) excusing Juror Tate after the jury had begun deliberations. We find these asserted errors to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">\u201c[A]s a general matter determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal,\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), though \u201c[h]aving said this, ... a reviewing court should take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ivory\u2019s Commerce Clause challenge amounts to a constitutional assault on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and is therefore a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Loney, </em>331 F.3d 516, 524 (6th Cir.2003). \u201cA district court\u2019s refusal to give a specifically requested jury instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>266 F.3d 587, 591 (6th Cir.2001), as is a district court\u2019s decision to excuse a juror after deliberations have begun and its finding that the dismissed juror had not infected the jury by injecting prejudicial extraneous information. <em>See United States v. Ramos, </em>861 F.2d 461, 466 (6th Cir.1988); <em>see also United States v. Davis, </em>177 F.3d 552, 557 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">A. Whether Ivory\u2019s Seizure was Supported By Reasonable Suspicion</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Determining whether Ivory\u2019s seizure was permissible requires a two-step analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-12\">First, [the court] determined whether there was a proper basis for the stop, which is judged by examining whether the law enforcement officials were aware of specific and articulable facts which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion. Second, [the court] decided whether the degree of intrusion into the suspect\u2019s personal security was reasonably related in scope to the situation at hand, which is judged by examining the reasonableness of the officials\u2019 conduct given their suspicions and the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-13\"><em>United States v. Garza, </em>10 F.3d 1241, 1245 (6th Cir.1993) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">On the first step of the analysis, Ivory\u2019s detention by the officers was appropriate. The officers had \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d leading them to believe that Ivory \u201cha[d] been or [was] about to be involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 12, 109 S.Ct. 1581,104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">As to the second step of the analysis, the scope of the intrusion into Ivory\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>security was not improper. <em>Terry </em>itself made clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the person! ] with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others\u2019 safety, he is entitled ... to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to uncover weapons which might be used to assault him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-5\"><em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The facts of <em>Terry </em>are very much akin to those here.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">In the instant case, the totality of the circumstances indicates that the officers\u2019 seizure of Ivory was supported by reasonable suspicion. The detainment and frisk was therefore proper under <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">B. The Commerce Clause Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Ivory\u2019s Commerce Clause challenge to the statute under which he was convicted fails because the argument Ivory advances in support of his challenge has recently been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Loney, </em>331 F.3d 516, 524 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">C. The Court\u2019s Refusal to Instruct on the Defense of \u201cTemporary Innocent Possession\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-10\">The court will reverse an appellant\u2019s conviction for failure to give a requested jury instruction only when: \u201c(1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction is not substantially covered by other delivered instructions; and (3) the failure to give the instruction impairs the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Chesney, </em>86 F.3d 564, 573 (6th Cir.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Carr, </em>5 F.3d 986, 992 (6th Cir.1993)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5B\"><em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>266 F.3d 587, 594 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Applying the criteria as set forth in <em>Alvarez, </em>the temporary innocent possession instruction requested by Ivory was a correct statement of the law. <em>See United States v. Wolak, </em>923 F.2d 1193, 1198 (6th Cir.1991) (noting that the Sixth Circuit has recognized that such a defense exists, albeit only in \u201crare situations\u201d). Nonetheless, because the district court instructed on the defense of necessity, the temporary innocent possession defense was substantially covered by another instruction. Also, the failure to give the temporary innocent possession instruction in no way impaired the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, which was that he had possessed the firearm to keep it out of the hands of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Instructing on necessity but not temporary innocent possession fairly and adequately submitted the issues and applicable law to the jury. It was not an abuse of discretion to decline to instruct on this rare defense, and if it was, any error was harmless. <em>See id. </em>(opining that \u201cthe trial judge would have been better advised to give an instruction on the innocent possession theory\u201d but finding any error to be harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">D. Dismissal of Juror Tate</p>\n<p id=\"AQm\">Tate was excused from the jury after a note was sent to the judge indicating that he could not make a decision in the case because \u201cthe decision would complicate daily life environment due to personal conflict with parties involved\u201d and that he wished to withdraw from the jury. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>record does not support the intimation, first articulated at the post-trial hearing, that Tate\u2019s exeusal had anything to do with the merits of the case. This reason for exeusal does not mesh with the reason given by Tate at trial, just after the note was written and under questioning by the trial court. Given the discrepancy between Tate\u2019s trial and post-trial hearing testimony, the district court cannot be faulted for crediting jury foreman Killough\u2019s account over Tate\u2019s. Moreover, even taking Tate\u2019s testimony at face value, Tate\u2019s familiarity with the case\u2019s location and players would seem to have not simply justified, but <em>required </em>his exeusal. Given these obvious conflicts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it granted Tate\u2019s request \u2014 articulated through Killough\u2019s note \u2014 to be removed from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in finding that Tate did not relay any prejudicial extraneous information. The only thing he said to the other jurors as a group was that he had heard of Tiko. While it is true that Tate also told Killough privately that Tiko had been barred from the Green Hills apartments, Killough did not share this information with the rest of the jurors. Nor did he consider the information in weighing the evidence himself. Moreover, even if Killough <em>had </em>shared with other jurors the information about Tiko\u2019s being barred from the complex, it is unclear whether such information would help or hurt Ivory. Because it was Ivory\u2019s burden to show actual prejudice, <em>see United States v. Corvado, </em>304 F.3d 593, 603 (6th Cir.2002), the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining Ivory\u2019s request for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
