We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (repealed). <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1051 n. 1 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence the decision that an applicant has failed to establish seven years of continuous physical presence in the United State <em>v. Vera-Villegas v. INS, </em>330 F.3d 1222, 1230 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-26\">The IJ concluded that Flores Luna was not credible regarding when he first entered the United States. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based on her observations of Flores Luna\u2019s testimony and a discrepancy between his testimony and his earlier asylum application. The IJ also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>questioned the authenticity of his tax returns from 1989, 1990, and 1991, noting that it was implausible that Flores Luna would continue to use an address for his tax returns three years after he had moved from that address and that there was no corroborating evidence that Flores Luna actually filed the returns. The record evidence does not compel a contrary result. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Flores Luna\u2019s contention that the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act violates equal protection is inapposite because the IJ applied the more lenient rules of suspension of deportation in this case. <em>See Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1162-63 (9th Cir.2002) (describing the \u201csuspension of deportation\u201d rules in place prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) and the more stringent \u201ccancellation of removal\u201d rules adopted under IIRIRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Flores Luna\u2019s request regarding \u201crepapering\u201d under IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c) because he failed to raise this argument with the BIA. <em>See Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Flores Luna\u2019s voluntary departure period will being to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b211-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
