We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the determination unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Molino-Estrada, v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-24\">The petitioners waived all contentions pertaining to the BIA\u2019s denial of their CAT claim because they did not challenge it in their petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cIssues raised in a brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>that are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners were not eligible to receive asylum or withholding of deportation and removal because they did not present evidence indicating they were persecuted or that they feared future persecution in the Philippines on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1117 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897, 901 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Mr. Mara-nan\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2004), Mrs. Maranan\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was not opposed by the government, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b349-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
