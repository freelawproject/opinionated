Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Miguel A. Mercado\u2019s petition for review of the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s decision in <em>Mercado v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>NY-844E-02-0123-I-1 (Oct. 31, 2002). Mercado has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">Mercado seeks review of the Board\u2019s decision finding an \u201cthat he \u201cfailed to meet his burden of showing that he incurred a disabling medical condition while employed in a position subject to [the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (FERS) ], and that the disability lasted for at least one year.\u201d \u201d In his informal brief, Mercado asks this court to \u201csee and review the evidence in this case.\u201d His argument is limited to the allegation that the Board erred in affirming the agency\u2019s reconsideration decision denying his request for disability retirement benefits under FERS because he \u201csubmitted enough evidence\u201d in support of his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">In <em>Anthony v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>58 F.3d 620, 626 (Fed.Cir.1995), we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">[T]his court is precluded by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(d) from reviewing the factual underpinnings of physical disability determinations, but may address whether there has been a \u201csubstantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error \u2018going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lindahl [v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985) ] (quotation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">Here, as in <em>Anthony, </em>\u201cthe petitioner simply asserts that the Board wrongly weighed the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In these circumstances, because Mercado\u2019s sole claim is that the Board\u2019s factual determinations were erroneous based upon the evidence presented, Mercado\u2019s petition for review does not fall within our limited scope of review. <em>See Smith v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>784 F.2d 397, 399 (Fed.Cir. 1986) (challenge to sufficiency of evidence of disability was not error going to heart of administrative determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">(1) OPM\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">(2) OPM\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">(3) All remaining motions are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
