Petitioner now appeals the district court\u2019s (Weinstein, <em>J.) </em>denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court certified just one issue for appeal to this Court: whether Campbell\u2019s constitutional right to due process of the laws was violated when the trial court refused to give a \u201cmissing witness\u201d charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">The only issue at trial was whether Campbell was one of the three perpetrators. One witness identified Campbell as a perpetrator. A second witness was not able to identify him in a lineup, and was not called by the prosecution at trial. Defense counsel requested a missing witness charge, contending that the witness was knowledgeable about a material issue. <em>See People v. Kitching, </em>78 N.Y.2d 532, 536-37, 577 N.Y.S.2d 231, 583 N.E.2d 944 (1991) (reversing a conviction for sale and possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, due to the trial court\u2019s erroneous denial of defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness charge). The trial court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">Having examined all the evidence before the jury, we conclude that any error was harmless under either the standard set forth in <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638-39, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) or that established by <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s claims and, finding them meritless, AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
