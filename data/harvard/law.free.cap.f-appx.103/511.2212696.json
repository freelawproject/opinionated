Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>See In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). Further, mandamus relief is only available when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Hairston has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that the relief sought is not available by other means. Accordingly, although we grant Hairston\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis, we deny the petition for \u25a0writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
