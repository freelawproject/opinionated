Because Moves Camp\u2019s brief fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s final order, we conclude he has abandoned the claims raised in the complaint. <em>Cf. Carter v. Lutheran Med. Ctr., </em>87 F.3d 1025, 1026 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (dismissing pro se litigant\u2019s appeal where brief presented no question for appellate court to decide). To the extent Moves Camp is arguing that his motions for permanent or emergency injunctions were wrongfully denied, we agree with the district court that he cannot challenge the legality of his continued confinement in a section 1983 action. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489-90, 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (inmate challenging duration of his physical imprisonment must exhaust state remedies and petition for writ of habeas corpus); <em>Schafer v. Moore, </em>46 F.3d 43, 45 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (if judgment in favor of prisoner in \u00a7 1983 action would necessarily imply invalidity of his conviction, continued imprisonment, or sentence, then no claim for damages lies unless conviction or sentence is reversed, expunged, or called into question by issuance of writ of habeas corpus).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-18\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Moves Camp\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-15\">. The Honorable Lawrence L.
