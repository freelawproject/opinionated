We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. Hussain\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent, and inconsistent with his application and supporting documentation concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the dates and locations of the alleged beatings, and the time period he received threats. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding based on the lack of clarity and implausibility of his testimony, and omission of the beatings from Hussain\u2019s application. <em>See id. at </em>1152-53; <em>Malhi, </em>336 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Because Hussain failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b163-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
