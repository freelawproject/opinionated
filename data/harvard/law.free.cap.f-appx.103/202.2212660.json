Vitto appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Central Parking Corporation (\u201cCentral Parking\u201d) and St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center (\u201cStJoseph\u2019s\u201d) on Vitto\u2019s claims of unlawful discharge under Title VII and the Arizona Civil Rights Act (\u201cACRA\u201d) as well as his claim that he was entitled to unpaid wages. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. <em>United States v. City of Tacoma, </em>332 F.3d 574, 578 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cWe determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied substantive law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">Vitto argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of St. Joseph\u2019s. He contends that employees of St. Joseph\u2019s exercised control over Central Parking\u2019s management and employees and that St. Joseph\u2019s employees were directly responsible for his discharge from his job with Central Parking. Importantly, Vitto does not allege that he was employed by St. Joseph\u2019s, and as the district court pointed out in its order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-18\">Plaintiff admits that he \u201cis not and was not a statutory employee of [St. Joes].\u201d In his Response to St. Joes\u2019 Statement of Facts, Plaintiff admits that his \u201cdismissal was generated through Central Parking\u201d because he \u201cworked under the jurisdiction of Central Parking and was hired by Central Parking[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-19\">In fact, in his Second Cause of Action for racial discrimination under Title VII and ACRA, Plaintiff alleges that he <em>\u201cwas an employee of Central Parking </em>who was stationed at St. Joseph facility.\u201d Similarly, Plaintiff discusses his \u201ctermination from Central Parking\u201d and the fact that he was \u201cterminated by Central Parking[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-20\">(alterations and emphasis in original). Additionally, there is insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that St. Jo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>seph\u2019s indirectly interfered with or retained control over Vitto\u2019s employment relationship with Central Parking. We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment for St. Joseph\u2019s on both of Vitto\u2019s causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Vitto also argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to Central Parking on his second cause of action under Title VII and the ACRA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">[A] plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Specifically, the plaintiff must show that (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly situated individuals outside his protected class were treated more favorably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"><em>Chuang v. University of California, </em>225 F.3d 1115, 1123-24 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citation omitted). We hold that Vitto failed to establish the fourth element of the prima facie case, and thus, his Title VII claim fails.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Vitto also challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Central Parking on his first cause of action regarding unpaid wages. Vitto failed to present evidence that Central Parking had a policy or practice of paying a terminated employee for accrued sick leave, vacation or birthday pay or that Vitto was entitled to such pay. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 23-350(5), 23-353(A). We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment on Vitto\u2019s first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">Vitto argues that the district court erred when it granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike Vitto\u2019s First Supplemental Disclosure Statement. The district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to strike is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See El Pollo Loco, Inc. v. Hashim, </em>316 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir.2003). We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">Vitto also contends that the district court conspired with defense counsel to ensure that Vitto\u2019s claims failed and that attorneys for Central Parking impermissibly engineered the removal of original counsel for St. Joseph\u2019s to take over the litigation. These claims find no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. To the extent that Vitto challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his claim under the ACRA, \"the Arizona Civil Rights Act is 'generally identical\u2019 to Title VII, and therefore 'federal Title VII case law [is] persuasive in the interpretation of [the Arizona] Civil Rights Act.' \u201d <em>Bodett v. Coxcom, Inc., </em>366 F.3d 736, 742 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Higdon v. Evergreen Int\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>138 Ariz. 163, 673 P.2d 907, 909-10 n. 3 (1983)) (alterations in original). We hold that Vitto\u2019s claim under the ACRA fails for the same reasons as his claim fails under Title VII.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
