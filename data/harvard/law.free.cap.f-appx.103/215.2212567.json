R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b249-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">Lakhbir Singh, native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings to apply for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir.2002), and de novo due process violations, <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir. 1994). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to submit affidavits. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (requiring that motions to reopen before the BIA be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and supporting documents). Moreover, Singh did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief because he failed to identify material evidence to support his claim. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding denial of CAT claim where petitioner failed to identify additional probative evidence outside of previously rejected asylum application to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>CAT claim); <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 965-966 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining that a motion to reopen may only be granted where the alien can establish prima facie eligibility for the requested relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Singh\u2019s due process claim lacks merit because he was not prejudiced by the BIA\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Hartooni, </em>21 F.3d at 340 (requiring petitioner to show that prejudice resulted from due process violation). Singh\u2019s equal protection argument also fails because Congress\u2019 distinction between CAT applicants placed in deportation and removal proceedings prior to March 22, 1999, and those placed in proceedings after that date is not \u201cwholly irrational.\u201d <em>See Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1164-65 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that petitioner must show that classification is \u201cwholly irrational\u201d to demonstrate equal protection violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b249-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
