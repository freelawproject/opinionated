The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) had concluded, among other things, that Mendoza failed to establish \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (repealed). Under the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E), 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), we lack jurisdiction to review for abuse of discretion that discretionary determination and dismiss that portion of her petition. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 778-79 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-19\">Mendoza also claims that the Spanish interpreter before the IJ was incompetent to interpret Mexteckel dialect. Constitutional due process claims, including the right to a competent translation, are reviewed <em>de novo. See Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 858, 869 (9th Cir. 2003). In order <em>to </em>establish a due process violation for faulty translation, Mendoza must show that the faulty translation prejudiced her hearing. <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1994). In the context of a discretionary decision of an IJ, prejudice is found if a petitioner\u2019s rights are violated \u201cin a manner so as potentially to affect the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Barraza Rivera v. INS, </em>913 F.2d 1443, 1448 (9th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Cerda-Pena, </em>799 F.2d 1374, 1379 (9th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>We look for three types of evidence in evaluating this showing: (1) \u201cdirect evidence of incorrectly translated words\u201d; (2) circumstantial evidence related to unresponsive answers; and (3) the petitioner\u2019s expression of difficulty in understanding a translation. <em>Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir.2000). Only the third type of evidence is present in this case, as Mendoza did express difficulty in understanding \u201cvery few words.\u201d However, Mendoza does not point out any misunderstandings that could have affected the IJ\u2019s decision, and absent such evidence, we \u201cmust presume that there is none.\u201d <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Finally, we address the merits of Mendoza\u2019s due process claim that the INS and IJ \u201ctortured\u201d her with \u201cexcessive\u201d cross-examination that \u201cwore down\u201d Mendoza, resulting in a fundamentally unfair proceeding. Neither the law nor the record supports Mendoza\u2019s claim. First, Mendoza bore the burden of establishing her claim to relief in this deportation proceeding. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.8(d) (2001); <em>Patel v. INS, </em>638 F.2d 1199, 1206 (9th Cir.1980). The INS appropriately probed Mendoza\u2019s recollection of facts establishing her eligibility for relief and credibility. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.2(a) (2001) (authorizing counsel to interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the deportable alien or other witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Second, the IJ had the authority to \u201cinterrogate, examine, and cross-examine\u201d Mendoza and her witnesses. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l); <em>Halaim v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir.2004). Our review of the lengthy transcript does not reveal any questioning by the IJ that rises to \u201cthe level of intimidation or advocacy for the agency.\u201d <em>Halaim, </em>358 F.3d at 1137. Accordingly, Mendoza\u2019s due process claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b267-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
