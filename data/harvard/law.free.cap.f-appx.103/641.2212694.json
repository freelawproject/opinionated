We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The district court dismissed Williams\u2019s action on grounds that it was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and the principles of abstention articulated in <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Because the record shows that Williams is no longer in prison, habeas relief may no longer be available to him. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 18, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). We therefore remand the action for consideration in light of our decision in <em>Nonnette v. Small, </em>316 F.3d 872, 877, 878 n. 7 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that plaintiff could proceed with \u00a7 1983 action because habeas relief was no longer available). Moreover, because Williams alleged that the parole revocation challenged in his state habeas petition arises from a different set facts than those asserted in his \u00a7 1983 complaint, we cannot say, based on this record, that his action is barred under the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
