Williams, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b916-22\">SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">Juan Concepcion Hernandez, a deported alien who illegally reentered the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.11 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Because the district court realized its discretion to depart under this Guideline and because it determined that Hernandez did not present a cognizable claim for departure, Hernandez has failed to raise an issue upon which we may grant' appellate relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-25\">A Mexican citizen, Juan Concepcion Hernandez first came to the United States in 1963. While in the United States, Hernandez married, had five children and eventually settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1998, Hernandez and his wife divorced. After the divorce, it appears that the children lived with their mother, though Hernandez retained close relationships with them. Hernandez remarried in early 2001, but has no additional children. His current wife resides in Grand Rapids.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-26\">On May 22, 2000, Hernandez pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>second degree. As a result of the conviction, the Government deported Hernandez to Mexico on December 11, 2001. At some point after the deportation, Hernandez learned that his two teenage sons were getting into trouble, living on the streets and not attending school. One son, he learned, was sent to a foster home. Concerned about his sons\u2019 welfare, Hernandez illegally reentered the United States in May 2002. He returned to Grand Rapids and, according to Hernandez, helped to address his sons\u2019 needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">On July 3, 2002, Grand Rapids police officers responded to a domestic disturbance report at Hernandez\u2019s home and spoke with Hernandez and his current wife. After further investigation, the officers discovered Hernandez\u2019s criminal sexual conduct conviction and deportation. On September 26, 2002, police arrested Hernandez for reentering the United States and for doing so after being deported as a result of an aggravated felony conviction, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Hernandez pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">At sentencing, Hernandez requested a downward departure based on \u00a7 5K2.11 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which gives courts discretion to depart where a defendant has committed a crime \u201cin order to avoid a perceived greater harm.\u201d In this instance, Hernandez argued that his efforts to look after his children warranted a departure. During the sentencing hearing, the district judge expressed his personal belief that Hernandez deserved a lower sentence but explained that Sixth Circuit precedent precluded him from departing under these circumstances. He sentenced Hernandez to a 46-month prison sentence, the minimum sentence required by the Guidelines. On appeal, Hernandez challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">\u201cWe have consistently held that the decision by a district court not to depart downwards from the Guidelines is not reviewable on appeal unless the record reflects that the district court was not aware of or did not understand its discretion to make such a departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Butler, </em>207 F.3d 839, 843 (6th Cir.2000). District judges, we have added, are \u201cnow quite familiar with the guidelines, and an appellate court should be reluctant to treat as ambiguous a ruling which does not affirmatively state that the judge knew he could depart downward but failed to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>53 F.3d 144, 145 (6th Cir.1995) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cRather [an appellate court] should [ ] assume[ ] that the court, in the exercise of its discretion, found downward departure unwarranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Under \u00a7 5K2.11, the \u201cLesser Harms\u201d Guideline at issue, a reduced sentence may be appropriate where \u201ca defendant [ ] commits] a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm ... provided that the circumstances significantly diminish society\u2019s interest in punishing the conduct, for example, in the case of mercy killing.\u201d Consistent with this language, we have said that a lesser-harms departure \u201capplies only in narrow, extreme circumstances such as mercy killing.\u201d <em>United States v. Barajas-Nunez, </em>91 F.3d 826, 832 (6th Cir. 1996). In <em>Barajas-Nunez, </em>we noted that a deported alien who returned to the United States to assist his girlfriend who was pregnant with his child while she underwent surgery did not deserve a lesser-harms departure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">During the sentencing hearing in this case, the district judge demonstrated an awareness of the standards that governed his discretion to depart in Hernandez\u2019s case. He cited \u00a7 5K2.11 as the relevant Guideline and read the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Guideline. He then quoted <em>Barajas-Nunez\u2019s </em>\u201cnarrow, extreme circumstances\u201d wording by which he considered himself bound and admitted to having read and reread the opinion. On this record, it is clear that the district judge understood the applicable Guideline provision, the case law construing it and ultimately his limited discretion to depart under the Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">On top of this, the district court described the circumstances in the Hernandez case as being \u201cvery similar\u201d to those in <em>Barajas-Nunez, </em>a case that the district judge himself had handled. Far from lacking an understanding of his authority to depart, the district judge knew all too well his discretion under the Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Nor, contrary to Hernandez\u2019s argument, does the district court\u2019s explanation for its refusal to depart downward alter this conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">As I reread <em>[Barajas-Nunez </em>], even rereading the dissent by Judge Siler, I don\u2019t think I have the leeway to grant the motion for a downward departure. I think the Sixth Circuit has told me I don\u2019t ... In my own mind, an appropriate sentence for this offense would be 24 months, that\u2019s my mind, but I don\u2019t operate as an individual. I operate as part of a legal system and I\u2019ve been told by the appellate court that\u2019s not something I can do. I if I could, I would, but I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">JA 34-35. In saying he \u201cwished he could\u201d depart but that he was \u201ctold by the appellate court that\u2019s not something [he] can do,\u201d the district court judge expressed disagreement with this Guideline provision, not a misapprehension of his authority under it. In <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>263 F.3d 603, 611 (6th Cir.2001), we rejected a similar argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-8\">[W]e should not be surprised when, on occasion, a district judge refers in the course of a sentencing hearing to the fact that the prescribed sentence range requires him to impose a sentence different from one he would impose in the absence of the Guidelines. We will not find, on the basis of such comments \u2014 or on the basis of expressions of frustrations with a sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines, such as \u201cmy hands are tied by the Guidelines\u201d or \u201cif it were up to me ... \u201d \u2014 that a district judge is unaware of the scope of his authority under the regnant sentencing system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACa\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 693-94 (2nd Cir.1996)); <em>see also United States v. Stewart, </em>37 F.3d 1449, 1450 (10th Cir.1994) (The district court\u2019s use of the language, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m required\u2019 and T have no choice\u2019 ... indicate[d] the court\u2019s general dissatisfaction with the sentencing guidelines rather than a misapprehension of them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
