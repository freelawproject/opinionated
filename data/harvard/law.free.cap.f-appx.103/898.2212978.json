We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Little, then fifteen years of age, was adjudicated delinquent in 1998 by the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, placed under the care and supervision of the Youth Services Bureau, and sentenced to the Shelby Training Center (STC), a subdivision of Shelby County Government, operated by the sole remaining defendant in this action, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). Little had a troubled history and had begun treatment at the age of thirteen for conduct disorder and subsequently had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Approximately one month before being placed in CCA\u2019s care, Little was hospitalized for three days for schizophreniform disorder and prescribed certain medication to control his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">Upon intake at CCA, Little was subjected to a standard screening \u2014 pursuant to CCA\u2019s procedures \u2014 to ascertain Little\u2019s medical history, psychological and substance abuse history, and whether he was taking any medications. Little told the screening nurse that he had previously been seen for behavioral problems and had been prescribed medication but had stopped taking it because it made his head hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">The day after Little\u2019s sentencing, his mother called the STC director, John Manuel. She informed Manuel that her son had a serious medical condition and needed his medication, lest he be unable to control his behavior. She continued to call thereafter, speaking with other STC personnel about her son\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">Because he was not taking his medicine, Little was unable to conform his behavior to prison rules. His sentence, initially thirty days, turned into six months on account of disciplinary infractions. All this occurred while the pleas of Little\u2019s mother concerning her son\u2019s medication went unheeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">Finally, Little underwent a mental health examination. After the examination, Little was prescribed the appropriate medication and his behavior thereafter improved dramatically. Two weeks later he was released and sent home.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Little later filed this action, naming as defendants CCA, the administrator of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>STC, the mayor of Shelby County, and Shelby County itself. Brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the action asserted claims for \u201cfailure to protect,\u201d \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d \u201cassault and battery,\u201d \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress,\u201d and \u201cfalse imprisonment.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment and Little took this appeal. All defendants except for CCA have been dismissed and the subject matter of Little\u2019s appeal is limited to the municipal liability deliberate indifference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards applied by the district court. Summary judgment is proper if, considering all the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the non-moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Davis v. Sodexho, Cumberland College Cafeteria, </em>157 F.3d 460, 462 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">\u201cIn <em>Monell [v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) ], the Supreme Court explained that municipal liability under section 1983 may only attach where the \u2018execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom ... inflicts the injury\u2019 complained of.\u201d <em>Graham v. County of Washtenaw, </em>358 F.3d 377, 382 (6th Cir.2004). A plaintiff such as Little must therefore \u201cprove two basic elements: (1) that a constitutional violation occurred; and (2) that [CCA] \u2018is responsible for that violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Doe v. Claiborne County, </em>103 F.3d 495, 505-506 (6th Cir. 1996)). Respecting this second element, \u201c[a] plaintiff ... must \u2018identify the policy, connect the policy to [CCA] itself and show that the particular injury was incurred because of the execution of that policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383 (quoting <em>Gamer v. Memphis Police Dep\u2019t, </em>8 F.3d 358, 364 (6th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Little\u2019s claim must fail because, in the first instance, he has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a constitutional violation occurred. Although a State (or political subdivision thereof) has a constitutional obligation under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to provide adequate medical care (ie., care that is not \u201cdeliberately indifferent to serious medical needs\u201d) to those whom it has incarcerated, <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and whereas to show deliberate indifference \u201cit is not necessary that ... officials consciously sought to inflict pain by withholding treatment,\u201d <em>Molton v. City of Cleveland, </em>839 F.2d 240, 243 (6th Cir.1988), \u201c[m]ere negligence is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Frey, </em>992 F.2d 1450, 1455 (6th Cir.1993). The official\u2019s conduct \u201cmust demonstrate deliberateness tantamount to an intention to punish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Molton, </em>839 F.2d at 243). In this respect, Little\u2019s proof is wanting. At worst, Director Manuel was negligent in failing to follow-up his conversations with Little\u2019s mother regarding her son\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Little\u2019s claim must also fail because, even assuming a constitutional deprivation, he has not linked that constitutional violation to any policy or custom of CCA. The bottom line is that, even assuming that the conduct of Director Manuel in failing to follow-up the warnings of Little\u2019s mother may somehow be perceived as a violation of constitutional magnitude, Little has submitted no proof that Manuel\u2019s conduct was pursuant to a policy or custom of STC or CCA. Nor has Little directed the court to evidence showing that Manuel, or any other specific individual, is CCA\u2019s final policymaker with respect to the treatment of inmates. Stated differently, Little \u201cnever adduced evidence of a definitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>[CCA] policy, custom, or usage which was an affirmative link, the moving force that animated the behavior \u2014 the acts of commission or omission \u2014 of the [official] that resulted in the constitutional violations alleged.\u201d <em>Molton, </em>839 F.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Little\u2019s brief also raises two other \u201cissues\u201d: the district court further erred by (1) dismissing Little\u2019s state law supplemental claims without prejudice, and (2) denying his motion to include his discovery responses-in the appellate record. Both objections are without merit. Dismissal is the preferred course of action in this circumstance, and the district court\u2019s ruling on the contents of the record was soundly within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
