By moving for IFP, Grant is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Grant argued in the district court that his civil rights complaint is not time-barred because he is entitled to equitable tolling. However, he has failed to brief his arguments for equitable tolling in this court. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief contentions in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Grant\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and denying Grant IFP status on appeal, we deny the motion for leave to proceed IFP, and we dismiss Grant\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Grant\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Grant\u2019s action and our dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). We caution Grant that should he accumulate three strikes, he will be unable to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">IFP DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF APPELLATE COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
