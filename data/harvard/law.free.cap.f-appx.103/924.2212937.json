The district court dismissed the Complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">Having reviewed the record, we affirm the district court on the grounds set forth by the United States Magistrate Judge who originally recommended that the case be dismissed. <em>See Jones v. Norris, </em>310 F.3d 610, 612 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (standard of review).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
