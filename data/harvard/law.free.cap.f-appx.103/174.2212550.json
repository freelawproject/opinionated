We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), see <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>138 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Petitioners make a due process claim based on <em>Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 858 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc), contending that they were prevented from presenting new evidence to the BIA during the five years before the Board decided their case. <em>Ramirez-Alejandre </em>relied, however, on BIA practice that had been superseded when the Board decided Petitioners\u2019 case in 2003. <em>See id. </em>at 864-65 (describing the BIA\u2019s former \u201cresponsibility of considering newly developed evidence in making determinations on suspension of deportation\u201d). In September 2002, the Attorney General promulgated new regulations \u201cquite different from, and much more elaborate than, those in place at the time of the appeal to the BIA in <em>[RamirezAlejandre].\u201d Id. </em>at 869. Under these new regulations, Petitioners could have filed a motion with the BIA during the pendency of their appeal requesting the Board to remand the proceedings to the IJ for consideration of new evidence. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (\u201cA party asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further factfinding must file a motion for remand.\u201d). As a result, Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Ramirez-Alejandre </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Petitioners also contend that their brief to the BIA was in fact a motion to reconsider, which \u201cmay be deemed a motion to remand the decision for further proceedings before the Immigration Judge.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). There is no indication within this brief that it was a motion to reconsider. Moreover, the purpose of such a motion is <em>\u201cnot to raise new facts, </em>but rather to demonstrate that the IJ or the BIA erred as a matter of law or fact.\u201d <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 </em>F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (emphasis added). We therefore decline to construe Petitioners\u2019 brief to the BIA as a thwarted attempt to present new evidence seven months after the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Petitioners\u2019 voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b208-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
