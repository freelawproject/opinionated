To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 488-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Fekadu fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Fekadu seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Additionally, we conclude Fekadu\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e)(4) (2002) violated her rights under the Due Process Clause is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>we held that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations do not violate an alien\u2019s rights to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
