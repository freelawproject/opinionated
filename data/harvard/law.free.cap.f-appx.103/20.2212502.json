Gines began serving his term of supervised release in May 2003, but in March 2004 the government filed a petition to revoke it, alleging that Gines had violated numerous conditions of his supervision. The district court held a hearing on the petition, and Gines admitted violating the terms of his supervision by, among other things, engaging in conduct that led to his arrest for public indecency, committing domestic battery, and testing positive for cocaine use. The court then revoked Gines\u2019s supervised release and, at the parties\u2019 request, sentenced him to 12 months and a day in prison, with no further supervised release. Gines now appeals, but his appointed counsel moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because she believes Gines\u2019s appeal is frivolous. Counsel\u2019s brief in support of the motion is facially adequate, so we limit our review to the potential issues identified in the brief, <em>see United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam), and in the response Gines filed under Circuit Rule 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Counsel first considers whether Gines could argue that his admission to violating the terms of his supervision was involuntary or that his revocation hearing was somehow deficient. Relying on <em>United States v. LeBlanc, </em>175 F.3d 511 (7th Cir. 1999) counsel points out that a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to a revocation hearing under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32.1 must be knowing and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances, <em>see LeBlanc, </em>175 F.3d at 517. This is true, but irrelevant to Gines, who, unlike the defendant in <em>LeBlanc, did </em>receive a Rule 32.1 hearing. <em>Compare LeBlanc, </em>175 F.3d at 513 (during defendant\u2019s initial appearance government informed court that no revocation hearing necessary because defendant admitted charges). As counsel points out, Gines had a revocation hearing where he appeared in court with counsel and listened as the district court explained all of the government\u2019s accusations and asked him if he admitted them, to which Gines responded, \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d Given the district court\u2019s explanation of the charges and Gines\u2019s admission to them, we agree with counsel that it would be frivolous for Gines to argue that any waiver of his rights under Rule 32.1 (such as the right to present evidence and question adverse witnesses against him, <em>see </em>Rule 32.1(C)) was involuntary under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See LeBlanc, </em>175 F.3d at 516-17 (whether Rule 32.1 waiver voluntary depends on totality of circumstances and revocation hearing need not contain procedural protections of Rule 11 hearing); <em>see also United States v. Correa-Torres, </em>326 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2003) (same); <em>United States v. Pelensky, </em>129 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1997) (voluntariness colloquy not required before court accepts defendant\u2019s admission of supervised release violations).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Counsel next considers whether Gines could argue that the district court erred by revoking his supervised release or by imposing a 12-month and one day term of imprisonment. We agree with counsel that the district court correctly determined that the most serious allegation in the government\u2019s petition was that Gines illegally possessed a controlled substance, as evidenced by his urinalysis testing positive for cocaine. <em>See United States v. Trotter, </em>270 F.3d 1150, 1154 (positive drug test supports inference of drug possession). In light of Gines\u2019s prior drug conviction, he could be imprisoned for up to two years for cocaine possession, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844, making his current offense a Grade B violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2) (Grade B violation if conduct constitutes federal offense punishable by more than one year imprisonment); <em>Trotter, </em>270 F.3d at 1155-56 (prior convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>should be considered when determining grade of violation). As counsel notes, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct the district court to revoke supervised release \u201c[u]pon a finding of a Grade A or B violation,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l), thus, it would be frivolous for Gines to argue that the court should not have revoked his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Likewise, it would be frivolous for Gines to challenge his term of imprisonment, which we would uphold so long as it is not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>365 F.3d 582, 588 (7th Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotations omitted). Given Gines\u2019s criminal history category of II, the Sentencing Guidelines recommend 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. However, since Gines\u2019s underlying conviction was a class B felony, the district court was authorized by statute to impose up to three years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Although Gines\u2019s sentence exceeded the guidelines range by a day, the range is only advisory, <em>Salinas, </em>365 F.3d at 588, and the sentence is well within the three-year statutory maximum. Moreover, Gines himself requested the sentence (the extra day rendered him eligible for good-time credits while imprisoned), thus he has waived any challenge to it. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mantas, </em>274 F.3d 1127, 1130-31 (7th Cir. 2001) (sentencing issue waived when defendants \u201caffirmatively agreed\u201d to court\u2019s choice of particular guideline).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Finally, Gines proposes arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, but such a claim is better reserved for a collateral proceeding where the record may be fully developed, <em>see, e.g., Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003), especially since Gines has the same counsel on appeal as he did in the district court, <em>United States v. Rezin, </em>322 F.3d 443, 445 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
