The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the government\u2019s motion to depart downward from the Guidelines for Garcia\u2019s substantial assistance, and sentenced Garcia to 238 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">On appeal, Garcia\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For reversal, counsel suggests that the court abused its discretion in imposing an excessive sentence. This argument fails. At sentencing, Garcia withdrew his objections to the probation officer\u2019s recommended sentencing enhancements, <em>see United States v. Tulk, </em>171 F.3d 596, 600 (8th Cir.1999), and the extent of the court\u2019s downward departure is not reviewable, <em>see United States v. Dutcher, </em>8 F.3d 11, 12 (8th Cir.1993). Upon careful review of the record, we conclude there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-16\">.
