R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-24\">Plaintiff-appellant Bobby Camp appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny his application for Social Security disability benefits. He alleges disability due to back pain, mental impairments, hypertension, diabetes, and limitations imposed by obesity. At step five of the five-step sequential evaluation process, <em>see Williams v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 748, 750-52 (10th Cir.1988) (dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>cussing five steps), an administrative lav? judge (ALJ) determined that Mr. Camp could perform a limited range of light and sedentary v?ork that existed in significant numbers in the regional and national economies. Accordingly, the ALJ held that Mr. Camp v?as not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act and was, therefore, not entitled to disability benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">On appeal, Mr. Camp asserts that the ALJ erred by failing to recognize and consider his severe mental impairments and the limitations imposed by his obesity. We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Threet v. Barnhart, </em>353 F.3d 1185, 1189 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hamlin v. Barnhart, </em>365 F.3d 1208, 1214 (10th Cir. 2004) (further quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Mr. Camp argues that the ALJ improperly determined that his mental impairments were not severe, despite evidence to the contrary. Our review of the administrative record raised one concern: Mr. Camp\u2019s Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 50. A GAF score of 41-50 indicates \u201c[sjerious symptoms ... OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d <em>American Psychiatric Assoc., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>32 (4th ed.2000). But the mental health evaluator did not indicate that Mr. Camp\u2019s GAF score impaired his ability to work. The score, without evidence that it impaired Mr. Camp\u2019s ability to work, does not establish an impairment. <em>Cf Howard v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>276 F.3d 235, 241 (6th Cir.2002) (holding \u201cALJ\u2019s failure to reference the GAF score in the RFC, standing alone, does not make the RFC inaccurate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Mr. Camp also asserts that the ALJ erroneously discounted his mental impairments because he did not obtain enough medical treatment. This argument misstates the ALJ\u2019s findings that Mr. Camp had not received mental health treatment during the relevant time period except for prescribed medications, and his physicians had not referred him for mental health treatment. Aplt.App. at 27. These findings are supported by substantial evidence, as are the additional findings that the mental health evaluation demonstrated that Mr. Camp\u2019s mental problems resulted in no more than mild restrictions. <em>See id. </em>at 27, 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Mr. Camp further claims that the ALJ failed to evaluate properly the impact of his obesity on his impairments or to consider the effect of his obesity on his residual functional capacity (RFC). But the record shows that the ALJ specifically considered Mr. Camp\u2019s obesity and its effect on his RFC. <em>See </em>ApltApp. at 27 (ALJ\u2019s holding that \u201cthe medical evidence, including the neurological findings, show [that Mr. Camp\u2019s] weight would not prevent [him] from performing light work with the limitations listed\u201d). Moreover, Mr. Camp does not point to evidence that contradicts the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. In fact, the medical reports, which acknowledge Mr. Camp\u2019s obesity, support the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>For his next argument, Mr. Camp alleges that in evaluating his obesity, the ALJ improperly relied on the opinion of his treating physician, Dr. Bisson, that he could perform light duty work, as contemplated in the workers\u2019 compensation context. He contends that such reliance was improper because the meaning of \u201clight duty work\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation purposes is not the same as \u201clight work\u201d as defined by Social Security regulations. We need not examine any differences in these definitions because here, the ALJ\u2019s decision was aided by the testimony of a vocational expert who opined that Mr. Camp could perform jobs available in the regional and national economies despite the limitations found by the ALJ, which, in turn, were based on Dr. Bisson\u2019s expert opinion. <em>See </em>Aplt.App. at 59, 67,198 (ALJ incorporated Dr. Bisson\u2019s limitations for \u201clight duty work\u201d in his hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert). Accordingly, we hold that the ALJ applied the correct legal standards and his factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b387-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. The ALJ ruled that Mr. Camp was disabled for the closed period from October 7, 1996 to January 6, 1999. This appeal challenges the ruling that he was not disabled after January 6, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
