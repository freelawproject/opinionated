We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review an adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-20\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. Singh\u2019s testimony was not credible because it was inconsistent, unresponsive, and lacked specificity. <em>See SinghKaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1152-53 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding based on Singh\u2019s failure to identify himself. <em>See Singhr-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1152-53; <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding adverse credibility finding where the IJ\u2019s \u201ccredibility findings went to key elements of the asylum application, including identity....\u201d). Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b356-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
