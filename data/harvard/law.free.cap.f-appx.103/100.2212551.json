R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b135-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Plaintiffs-Appellants, Esteban Valles, Esteban Valles, Jr., Raymond Galaviz, Nino De Franco, and Liza Ramirez (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d) filed a complaint in state court alleging that Defendant-Appellee, Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation (\u201cTwentieth Century\u201d) violated the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201cFEHA\u201d), Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940, by discriminating against them on the basis of race and national origin in terminating their employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Twentieth Century removed the action to federal court on the ground that Appellants\u2019 claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management and Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). It then moved to dismiss the action or, alternatively, for summary judgment, contending that the action was barred by the LMRA\u2019s statute of limitations. The district court dismissed the action and Appellants appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">We have consistently held that state discrimination claims brought under FEHA are not preempted by the LMRA. <em>See, e.g., Jimeno v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>66 F.3d 1514, 1522-28 (9th Cir.1995) (concluding that the LMRA did not preempt a state law claim for physical disability discrimination in employment brought under FEHA); <em>Ramirez v. Fox Television Station, </em>998 F.2d 743, 748-49 (9th Cir.1993) (concluding that a FEHA claim of employment discrimination based on national origin was not preempted by the LMRA); <em>Jackson v. S. Cal. Gas Co., </em>881 F.2d 638, 644 (9th Cir. 1989) (concluding that a FEHA claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>racial discrimination in employment was not preempted by the LMRA because \u201cenforcement of the state discrimination statutes would not require interpretation of any of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement [CBA]\u201d); <em>Chmiel v. Beverly Wilshire Hotel Co., </em>873 F.2d 1283, 1286 (9th Cir.1989) (stating that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s age discrimination law is a nonnegotiable right ... defined and enforced under state law without reference to the terms of any [CBA]\u201d and therefore concluding that a FEHA age discrimination claim was not preempted by the LMRA). In fact, \u201c[i]n every case in which we have considered an action brought under [FEHA], we have held that it is not preempted by section 301.\u201d <em>Ramirez, </em>998 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Contrary to Twentieth Century\u2019s arguments, Appellants\u2019 claims constitute a freestanding claim of discrimination dependent on state law, not on the CBA. Twentieth Century fails to explain how any of the CBA provisions it cites apply to Appellants\u2019 claims. The district court accordingly erred in concluding that Appellants\u2019 claims are preempted by the LMRA. We therefore reverse the order of dismissal and remand to the district court with directions to remand the case back to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-17\">.
