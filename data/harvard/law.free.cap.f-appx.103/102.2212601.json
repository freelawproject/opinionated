Dahlman appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the gun found in his possession. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Dahlman contends that the police officer\u2019s search was improper under the Fourth Amendment because the officer searched Dahlman incident to an impending arrest for driving with a revoked license, but then, upon discovering a weapon, arrested Dahlman for felon in possession based on the pistol seized during the search. We review the lawfulness of a search de novo. <em>United States v. Morales, </em>252 F.3d 1070, 1073 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">A search of a suspect\u2019s person incident to his arrest is valid whether it occurs immediately before or after the arrest, as long as probable cause exists for the arrest. <em>See United States v. Potter, </em>895 F.2d 1231, 1234 (9th Cir.1990). Because Officer Francis had probable cause to arrest Dahlman for driving with a revoked license, the officer\u2019s pat-down search before placing Dahlman under arrest was a valid search incident to arrest. <em>See id. </em>That the fruits of that search resulted in a different arrest does not render the search invalid. <em>See id. </em>The district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was therefore proper. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
