West Virginia Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 603, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). The district court treated Schneider\u2019s entitlement to fees as foreclosed by our denial of his request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal in case nos. 00-55798 and 00-56329, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>in which he did not prevail. In doing so, the district court apparently overlooked our order in case no. 00-55709 in which, instead of denying Schneider\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, we referred his motion to the district court for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We reverse the order denying Schneider\u2019s motion for fees and expenses, and remand the case to the district court for consideration of Schneider\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b149-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b150-6\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">OSCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">On December 3, 2002, Louis Schneider filed a notice of appeal challenging the district court\u2019s September 10th denial of his attorneys\u2019 fees. Because this was well beyond the 30-day deadline established by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), I believe that we do not have jurisdiction to consider the legal merits of that judgment, and I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The district court\u2019s second amended judgment, filed on September 10th, explicitly declined to award attorneys\u2019 fees to either party \u2014 Schneider himself conceded as much in his reply brief. It is also beyond dispute that Schneider filed his one and only notice of appeal on December 3rd, 84 days later. Because 84 days clearly exceeds the applicable 30-day time-limit set forth in Rule 4, and because Schneider never sought to expand his time to appeal, we simply lack jurisdiction over that decision. <em>Feldman v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>322 F.3d 660, 665 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cFailure to timely file a notice of appeal necessarily results in [a] ... lack of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>Celr-A-Pak v. Cal. Agrie. Labor Relations Bd., </em>680 F.2d 664, 668 (9th Cir. 1982) (\u201cCompliance with [Rule 4\u2019s] time limitations is both mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d). While there are some exceptions to the 30-day rule, none of them apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 itself provides that certain motions toll the time to appeal the merits of a district court\u2019s judgment beyond the normal deadline. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). Schneider did file a motion \u201cseeking attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses\u201d on September 27th, 13 days (excluding weekends and holidays) after the district court\u2019s order denying such fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He initially styled this motion as arising under Rule 54, but later clarified that it was also predicated on Rule 60(b). But no matter how it is ehar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>acterized, it does not properly fall within any of Rule 4\u2019s tolling provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">At least three of these provisions are plainly inapplicable, for Schneider\u2019s motion cannot be characterized as one for \u201cjudgment under Rule 50(b),\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(i), as seeking \u201cto amend or make additional factual findings under Rule 52(b),\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(ii), or as trying to obtain \u201ca new trial under Rule 59.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Neither can it properly be understood as a Rule 59 motion \u201cto alter or amend the judgment.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). For, under \u201cthe law of this circuit ..., a motion to alter or amend a judgment to award costs does not come within Rule 59(e).\u201d <em>Durham v. Kelly, </em>810 F.2d 1500, 1503 (9th Cir.1987). And even if Schneider\u2019s motion were cognizable under Rule 59, it was too late, as the \u201cDistrict Court lost jurisdiction 10 days after entry of ... judgment to grant relief under Rule 52(b) or 59.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr. of Ill., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">And although Schneider\u2019s ultimate goal was to get attorneys\u2019 fees, his September 27th motion cannot have been premised on Rule 54. A litigant cannot file a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees when such fees <em>have already been denied; </em>rather, one must appeal that denial or file a motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Cal. Med. Ass\u2019n v. Shalala, </em>207 F.3d 575, 576 \u2014 77 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that when a litigant does \u201cnot appeal the fee award,\u201d it becomes \u201cfinal and [can] be set aside only through a motion for relief\u2019). In any event, Rule 54 motions for attorneys\u2019 fees do not toll the time to appeal a judgment unless \u201cthe district court extends the time to appeal under Rule 58.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iii). There was no such extension here, and because Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(c)(1) consequently dictates that \u201c[e]ntry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time to appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees,\u201d no action by the district court regarding this motion could have affected Schneider\u2019s appeal deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The September 27th motion is thus best understood as a Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration \u2014 in fact, that is how the district court itself interpreted it. But while it may have been timely under Rule 60(b), such motion could not toll the time to appeal the merits of the outstanding decision to deny attorneys\u2019 fees because it was filed \u201clater than 10 days after th[at] judgment [was] entered.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">For these reasons, Schneider\u2019s September 27th motion does not come within any of Rule 4\u2019s tolling provisions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thus has no bearing on the question of our appellate jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s September 10th denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">There is a final exception to Rule 4\u2019s 30-day jurisdictional rule. Known as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine, this special exemption equitably tolls the time to appeal where \u201ca court has affirmatively assured a party that its appeal will be timely.\u201d <em>In re Slimick, </em>928 F.2d 304, 310 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Perhaps Schneider believes that the district court\u2019s eventual consideration of the merits of his September 27th motion was \u201cambiguous or implicitly misleading conduct.\u201d <em>Slimick, </em>928 F.2d at 310. Nevertheless, even if that were an accurate description, it would \u201cnot release [Schneider] from [his] appeal deadlines. If a party believes a court has acted ambiguously as to an appeal deadline, it bears the burden of seeking clarification.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Indeed, this Court has specifically rejected the notion \u201cthat the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits of [an appellant\u2019s] motion for reconsideration ... ma[kes] it reasonable for [an appellant] to assume that the appeal time had been tolled.\u201d <em>Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, </em>954 F.2d 1441, 1462 (9th Cir.1992). That the district court entertained Schneider\u2019s motion might have excused any untimeliness in filing it below. But the particular grounds for the court\u2019s decision to deny reconsideration \u2014 whether purporting to reach the \u201cmerits\u201d or not \u2014 -can have no effect on our appellate jurisdiction over an preexisting judgment denying attorneys\u2019 fees rendered almost two months prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Moreover, the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine only applies \u201cso long as the judicial action occurred prior to the expiration of the official time period\u201d within which to appeal. <em>Fiester v. Turner, </em>783 F.2d 1474, 1476 (9th Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Here, the time to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees expired on October 10th, but the district court took no relevant action until November 2nd, long after the time within which this exception might have been implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">For these reasons, the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine is inapplicable to this ease. Because Schneider\u2019s notice of appeal was late, and because no other exceptions excused him from filing it on time, we lack appellate jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s decision to deny attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Although we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the district court\u2019s judgment, we do not lack jurisdiction over this appeal entirely. The district court denied Schneider\u2019s post-judgment motion on November 4th, and Schneider filed his notice of appeal on December 3rd, less than 30 days later. Therefore, we retain jurisdiction over that decision, which, as noted above, is properly characterized as the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Possessing jurisdiction only over the disposition of a motion for reconsideration, rather than over the merits of the underlying judgment, is not unusual. In fact, this and other courts have confronted this situation on several prior occasions. <em>See, e.g., Glascoe v. United States, </em>358 F.3d 967, 969 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\u201cThere is no doubt that the notice of appeal came too late to bring up the district court\u2019s judgment denying the habeas petition. But the order denying reconsideration is properly before us.\u201d); <em>Mt. Graham Red Squirrel, </em>954 F.2d at 1463 (\u201cWhile we lack jurisdiction over the merits of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to intervene, we do have jurisdiction over Mountain States\u2019 appeal from the denial of its motion for reconsideration .... \u201d); <em>Fiester, </em>783 F.2d at 1475 (\u201c[Although Fiester\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely as to the underlying judgment, it is timely as to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.\u201d); <em>Cel-A-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Pak, </em>680 F.2d at 668 (concluding \u201cthat no timely appeal was taken from the underlying judgment\u201d but that there was \u201ca timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In such cases, \u201can appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review,\u201d no matter the district court\u2019s grounds for decision. <em>Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556; <em>see also Title v. United States, </em>263 F.2d 28, 31 (9th Cir.1959) (\u201cRule 60(b) was not intended to provide relief for error on the part of the court or to afford a substitute for appeal.\u201d). Rather, the order \u201cis reviewable only for abuse of discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration \u2014 not for error in the underlying judgment.\u201d <em>Feister, </em>783 F.2d at 1476.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">So whether or not the majority believes that the district court erred in denying Schneider his attorneys\u2019 fees, we simply have no power to make such an inquiry. Rather, the only question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider its prior ruling regarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Here, \u201cthe record contains absolutely no evidence of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, or fraud.\u201d <em>Historical Research v. Cabral, </em>80 F.3d 377, 379 n. 2 (9th Cir.1996). As such, longstanding precedent demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion, and that its judgment should be affirmed. <em>See id.; Mt. Graham Red Squirrel, </em>954 F.2d at 1463; <em>Fiester, </em>783 F.2d at 1475; <em>Cel-A-Pak, </em>680 F.2d at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the district court\u2019s judgment denying attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\">. Schneider claims to have filed the motion three days earlier, on September 24th, and sought to change the filing date nunc pro tunc to that date. The clerk's office was willing to alter the date, but only to September 26th. Subsequently, however, the lower court declined to change the filing date at all, and made the explicit factual finding that the motion was filed on the 27th. Schneider renews his September 24th contention on appeal, but the district court's finding is by no means clearly erroneous given that the date stamp on the motion clearly indicates that it was indeed filed on the 27th. <em>See Schnabel v. Lui, </em>302 F.3d 1023, 1029 (9th Cir.2002) (\"[T]he district court\u2019s findings of fact relevant to subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d). Indeed, the fact that Schneider eventually hoped to establish that his motion was filed within 10 days of the district court's judgment, rather than within the 14 normally required by Rule 54, suggests that he may have recognized the potential jurisdictional problems with his decision not to appeal it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. Perhaps the district court erred by denying attorneys\u2019 fees at the same time it rendered judgment, without waiting for a Rule 54 motion. Nevertheless, the proper way to correct legal error is to appeal it, and the mere existence of possible error does not confer appellate jurisdiction of its own accord. <em>See CelA-Pak, </em>680 F.2d at 668 (\u201cCompliance with [Rule 4\u2019s] time limitations is both mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-15\">. Neither can the motion be treated as a notice of appeal itself, for it simply \"evince[d] a desire to have the district court retain jurisdiction and alter its judgment rather than a desire to effectively take an appeal and thus terminate the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
