The district court held that Robertson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was barred by both prosecutorial immunity and <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477,114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Robertson has faded to brief the district court\u2019s <em>Heck </em>determination, and, therefore, that issue is waived and unreviewable. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). He consequently cannot show the district court\u2019s resolution of his claims to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">Robertson\u2019s appeal therefore lacks arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Robertson is warned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Patton v. Jefferson Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th Cir.1998). We warn Robertson that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">The district court construed Robertson\u2019s challenge to his confinement as a request for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 relief, and his notice of appeal was construed by this court as an appellate request for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the dismissal of his habeas claims for failure to exhaust state court remedies. <em>See Robertson v. Brindisi, </em>No. 03-30832 (5th Cir. Mar.10, 2004) (unpublished). Robertson, however, has not shown \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). His COA request is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED; COA DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
