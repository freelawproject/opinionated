Trobaugh argues the court abused its discretion in finding he violated his supervised release and in imposing a sentence of this length. Further, while Trobaugh admitted purchasing and using cocaine while on supervised release, he argues that rather than sentencing him to prison, the court should have placed him in either a community corrections center or an outpatient-treatment program. Finally, Trobaugh argues for the first time on appeal the district judge should have recused herself because of her involvement in a civil case Trobaugh had filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion, <em>see United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review), as the 10-month sentence was based upon the court\u2019s consideration of relevant sentencing factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e). As to Trobaugh\u2019s contention the district court\u2019s findings were erroneous, we conclude the court was entitled to credit the probation officer\u2019s testimony, which supported the court\u2019s findings. <em>See United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003). Finally, we conclude the district judge was not obligated to recuse herself from Trobaugh\u2019s case because Trobaugh offers nothing to show that recusal was warranted. <em>See Rush v. Smith, </em>56 F.3d 918, 922 (8th Cir.1995) (en banc) (standard of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>view). Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-18\">. The Honorable Linda R.
