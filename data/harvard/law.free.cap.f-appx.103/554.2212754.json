Linzay brought suit against defendant-appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>alleging, inter alia, claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000-5 et seq., and the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing Linzay\u2019s Title VII claims on their merits. On January 20, 2004, the district court conditionally dismissed Linzay\u2019s FMLA claims and closed the case, subject to reopening the case if the parties did not consummate a settlement of those FMLA claims. Linzay appeals solely the district court\u2019s summary judgment of his Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On April 9, 2004, the district court reopened this case upon information that the parties had not settled their FMLA claims. The case is currently open and being litigated in the district court. Because this case is still being actively litigated in the district court, the district court has not yet issued a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d and we must dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Way v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>815 F.2d 1033, 1033-34 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
