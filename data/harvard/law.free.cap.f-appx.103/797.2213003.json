Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812). We find no such compelling evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-19\">Mektesheva challenges the Board\u2019s use of the streamlined appeal procedures of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2004). We have recently rejected challenges to these procedures in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). In addition, we conclude that Mektesheva\u2019s challenge to the use of the procedure in her case is without merit. As we stated in <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>\u201c[i]f the [Boardj\u2019s practices result in a decision that allows a non-harmless error to slip through, there is always the avenue of an appeal to the court to correct the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. Here, we find no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>We deny Mektesheva\u2019s motion to place this appeal in abeyance pending the outcome of her application for adjustment of status. We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-16\"> Mektesheva does not challenge the denial of withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
