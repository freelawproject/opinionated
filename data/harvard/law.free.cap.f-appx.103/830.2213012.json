Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). We will reverse the BIA\u2019s asylum determination only if the evidence compels a different result. <em>Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 669 (5th Cir. 2002); <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The Attorney General may grant asylum to refugees. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A refugee is a person who is outside of his or her country and is unable or unwilling to return \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion____\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-19\">Based on the IJ\u2019s findings, the BIA concluded that Zaka had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on any of the statutorily enumerated grounds. After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. Zaka has failed to show that the Government\u2019s position in her case is inconsistent with its position in another case pending before the Attorney General. If Zaka believed that she was entitled to asylum under proposed rules applicable to victims of domestic violence, she could have raised this issue prior to the filing of her reply brief. <em>Rodriguez v. INS </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-20\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
