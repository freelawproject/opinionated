(Center). The district court had jurisdiction over Center\u2019s motion for attorneys fees pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1540(c) &amp; (g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and we have jurisdiction over Pacific\u2019s timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides that a district court \u201cmay award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney ... fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(4). Attorneys fees are \u201cappropriate\u201d when granted to a party who achieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits,\u201d <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 694, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983), meaning that the party \u201csucceeded] on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit it sought in bringing suit,\u201d <em>LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, </em>205 F.3d 1146, 1160 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citations, quotations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In this case, Center obtained two orders-a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction-before its civil action was mooted by a biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service (collectively, Services). The district court\u2019s orders were based on the merits of the case. They rested on factual findings and legal conclusions delivered orally by the district judge, and they were sufficiently detailed and final to permit immediate appellate review. <em>See Davis v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>890 F.2d 1438, 1451 (9th Cir.1989). Until the case became moot, the orders furnished the precise relief for which Center brought suit: a freeze on Pacific\u2019s logging activities within the boundaries of three harvest timber plans. As such, Center achieved sufficient success on the merits to qualify for attorneys\u2019 fees under section 1540(g)(4). <em>See Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845, 847 (9th Cir.1980) (holding that a plaintiff may obtain sufficient success on the merits by obtaining a preliminary injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">According to Pacific, Center does not qualify for attorneys\u2019 fees under section 1540(g)(4) because its action did not advance the interpretation and implementation of the ESA as required by <em>Carson-Truckee Water Conservancy Dist. v. Sec\u2019y of the Interior, </em>748 F.2d 523, 525 (9th Cir.1984). In response, Center argues that this circuit has abandoned <em>Carson-Truckee\u2019 </em>s \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d standard, <em>see Marbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, </em>182 F.3d 1091, 1094-95 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cCarson-Tmckee\u2019s holding that the \u2018substantial contribution\u2019 standard applies to prevailing defendants in ESA suits is no longer good law\u201d), and maintains that the district court\u2019s attorneys fees award was appropriate here because it \u201cobtained a \u2018judicial imprimatur\u2019 that alter[ed] the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Watson v. County of Riverside, </em>300 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir.2002), <em>quoting Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dept. of Health, </em>532 U.S. 598, 600, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">We need not resolve this doctrinal dispute, because Center\u2019s motion for attorneys fees satisfies both standards. As discussed previously, the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction each reflect a \u201cjudicial imprimatur\u201d of success on the merits, which \u201caltered] the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Center\u2019s action also satisfied <em>Carson-Truckee </em>by rendering a \u201csub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>stantial contribution\u201d to the ESA\u2019s goals. As the district court explained, Center\u2019s action \u201cestablish[ed] the application of section 7(d) of the ESA to private ITP applications as well as clarification that section 7(d) was triggered by informal consultation.\u201d <em>Envtl. Prot. Info. Ctr., Inc. v. Pac. Lumber Co., </em>229 F.Supp.2d 993, 1002 (N.D.Cal.2002); <em>see also </em>Memorandum from Jamie Rappaport Clark, Director, to Fish and Wildlife Service regional managers (Dec. 11, 2000), <em>available at </em>http://endangered.fws.gov/hcp/7 (D).html (describing the district court\u2019s holding as a significant extension of section 7(d)). The action \u201clikewise facilitated the implementation of the ESA\u201d by preventing Pacific from \u201cmaking an irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources pending issuance of the [Services\u2019 incidental take permit]\u201d and thereby \u201cpreserving] the full panoply of reasonable and prudent alternatives being considered by the Services in the preparation of their biological opinion.\u201d <em>Envtl. Prot. Info. Ctr., Inc., </em>229 F.Supp.2d at 1002. Center\u2019s action thus satisfies both <em>Carson-Truckee\u2019s </em>\u201csubstantial contribution\u201d standard and Buckhannon\u2019s \u201cjudicial imprimatur\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Pacific contends that we should not treat Center as a prevailing party because the district court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees was \u201cprofoundly unfair and ... blatantly inconsistent with the proper procedures for disposition of a motion for preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>See Alioto v. Williams, </em>450 U.S. 1012, 1013-14, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., and White, J., dissenting) (arguing that a party should not be considered \u201cprevailing\u201d when mootness deprives their adversary of an opportunity to appeal). This was no abuse of discretion based upon profound unfairness or improper procedures in the district court\u2019s September 3, 1998, preliminary injunction. Pacific was free to file an immediate interlocutory appeal, but it chose instead to forego interlocutory relief, renew its opposition to the preliminary injunction in the district court, and pursue administrative relief rendering Center\u2019s civil action moot. In short, Pacific made a strategic decision to forego appellate review, and it must live with that decision\u2019s consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Finally, Pacific challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of the fee award. In Pacific\u2019s estimation, Center \u201cachieved nothing of substance\u201d after the September 3, 1998, preliminary injunction, and the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys fees for services performed after that date. The district court\u2019s fee award to Center was generous, to be sure, but it was not an abuse of discretion. As we held in <em>Watson, </em>\u201cit was within the district court\u2019s discretion to award all fees, rather than only those incurred up to the date of the preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>300 F.3d at 1097. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding fees for all services performed between the issuance of its September 3, 1998, preliminary injunction, and its March 15, 1999, Order to Show Cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
