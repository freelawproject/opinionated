We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Singh\u2019s testimony was both internally inconsistent and inconsistent with his application. For example, Singh did not describe a police detention in his application between 1984 and 1990, but testified he was questioned and detained by police between fifty to sixty times during that period. Singh also testified that he was questioned and detained after 1990, and later testified that he was on the run after 1990 and was not detained. Because these inconsistencies, including an additional inconsistency regarding his first arrest, go to the heart of his asylum claim, substantial evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ports the denial of asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Accordingly, it follows that Singh did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under CAT. <em>See id </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b302-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
