To the extent Kapoor seeks to challenge the Board\u2019s December 18, 2002, order dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s decision, we note Kapoor did not file a timely petition for review from that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">This Court reviews the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). Such motions are especially disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719. We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen on the basis it was not shown that the new evidence could not have been submitted in the proceedings before the immigration judge. <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 234 (4th Cir.1998). We further note the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. Kapoor failed to effectively establish the level of past persecution necessary to be eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum even if there is no reasonable likelihood of present abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
