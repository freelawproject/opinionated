We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 923 (9th Cir. 2003), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Delgadillo-Torres contends that he was denied a full and fair hearing because the IJ did not adequately inform him of his options for relief from removal. The record shows, however, that Delgadillo-Torres was fairly apprised of the nature of the proceedings and avenues of relief available to aliens facing removal. In any event, he has not demonstrated prejudice. <em>Cf. Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (finding due process violation where petitioner was prejudiced by IJ\u2019s conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Because Delgadillo-Torres does not challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense rendered him ineligible for relief from removal, he has waived the issue. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (concluding that petitioner waived an issue by failing to address it in the opening brief),</p>\n<p id=\"ApL\">Wg dQ noj. consider Delgadillo-Torres\u2019 contention that his conviction was par-d(med becauge he Med to exhaust this issue before ^ BIA. <em>See Barron </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"Alt\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b255-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
