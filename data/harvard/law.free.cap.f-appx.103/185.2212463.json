R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Karnail Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissal of his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have partial jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Singh failed to file his asylum application within one year of arrival. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">. [2] For purposes of withholding of removal, the BIA\u2019s reasoning entitles Singh to \u201ca presumption that a \u2018clear probability of persecution\u2019 exists were he to return to India.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ilchert, </em>69 F.3d 375, 381 (9th Cir.1995). The BIA stated that \u201cthe record contains evidence demonstrating that country conditions in India have changed,\u201d but did not provide an individualized analysis of \u201chow any change in conditions in [India] would serve to rebut [Singh\u2019s] particular fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1017 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The BIA\u2019s alternative holding that Singh could relocate within India is, however, supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Singh, </em>69 F.3d at 378 (\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard.\u201d). The government has \u201cestablished] by a preponderance of the evidence that under all the circumstances it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(3)(ii). Singh testified that, after he was persecuted, he lived undisturbed with relatives for six months in a location half an hour away from his home. Singh presented no evidence \u201cestablishing] that it is unreasonable to expect him to relocate.\u201d <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1070 (9th Cir.2003). The presumption that Singh will again be persecuted is therefore rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Singh is also not entitled to CAT relief because he did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to India. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
