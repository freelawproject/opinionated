We find that Calloway\u2019s action is properly construed as a petition for mandamus relief. <em>See Johnson v. Reilly, </em>349 F.3d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Heath v. United States Parole Commission, </em>788 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1986). The Board of Parole filed a detain-er with the Maryland Division of Correction. There is, however, \u201cno constitutional duty to provide [a parolee] an adversary parole hearing until he is taken into custody as a parole violator by execution of [a] warrant.\u201d <em>Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 89, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976); <em>Larson v. McKenzie, </em>554 F.2d 131, 132-33 (4th Cir.1977); <em>Gaddy v. Michael, </em>519 F.2d 669, 677 (4th Cir.1975). We affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Calloway relief, as Calloway has not yet been taken into custody as a parole violator. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
