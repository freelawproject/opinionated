The district court subsequently revoked her probation and sentenced her to serve 18 months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Belcher argues on appeal that the district court reversibly erred in sentencing her to serve 18 months in prison. She contends that the district court neglected to consider proper sentencing factors and based her sentence on improper factors. She further contends that her sentence is unreasonable and that it should be considered an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Because Belcher failed to object to her sentence, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. McCullough, </em>46 F.3d 400, 401 (5th Cir.1995). Belcher has not shown error, plain or otherwise, in connection with her sentence. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
