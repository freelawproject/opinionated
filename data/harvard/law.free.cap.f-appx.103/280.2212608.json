We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Salazar-Cerrano\u2019s motion to reconsider because the motion challenged only the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Salazar-Cerrano failed to meet the requisite hardship standard. <em>See Sarmadi v. INS, </em>121 F.3d 1319, 1322 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201c[WJhere Congress explicitly withdraws our jurisdiction to review a final order of deportation, our authority to review motions to reconsider or to reopen deportation proceedings is thereby likewise withdrawn.\u201d); <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary hardship determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Contrary to Salazar-Cerrano\u2019s contention, the BIA was not required to file an answering brief to Salazar-Cerrano\u2019s motion to reconsider filed with the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(f) (indicating that briefs to the BIA <em>may </em>be filed by both parties) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Salazar-Cerrano\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">The Clerk shall change the docket to reflect that Attorney General John Ashcroft is the proper respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b315-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
