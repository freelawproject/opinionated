Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1); <em>United States v. Breit, 754 </em>F.2d 526, 528 (4th Cir.1985) (applying ten-day appeal period to Rule 35 motion). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on November 10, 2003. Under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), the earliest date we may consider Braxton filed his notice of appeal is December 14, 2003. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period provided in Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4), the district court ordered Braxton to show why his late filing should be excused. After reviewing Braxton\u2019s response, the district court concluded that Braxton failed to demonstrate excusable neglect or good cause and we find no abuse of that discretion. <em>Breit, 754 </em>F.2d at 528 (providing standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\">Because Braxton failed to timely file an appeal or obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
