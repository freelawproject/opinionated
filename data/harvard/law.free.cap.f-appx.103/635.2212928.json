They argue that evidence was improperly admitted at trial, that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions, and that Phan should have been sentenced as a minor participant. We reverse the convictions on Counts 1 and 2, affirm the convictions on Count 3, and remand for resentencing on the remaining count.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The district court properly admitted evidence of Nguyen\u2019s and Phan\u2019s familial relationship with Thanh Phuong Nguyen, whose driver\u2019s license address matched that indicated on the package of drugs delivered to Phan and opened by Nguyen. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>103 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir.1996) (evidentiary rulings reviewed for abuse of discretion.) The fact was relevant to the question of whether Phan and Nguyen knew they were receiving a package containing drugs based on the coded words and numbers on the package\u2019s address label. The evidence was\u2019prejudicial only in the sense that it made Phan\u2019s and Nguyen\u2019s participation in the crime more likely. The probative value of the evidence was not \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Fed R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">There was sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence to support Phan\u2019s and Nguyen\u2019s convictions on Count 3. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). In addition to evidence from which the jury could conclude that the numbers on the package were a code used to signal that drugs were inside, there also was evidence showing that: 1) Nguyen and Phan were related to each other and to the sender of the package; 2) Phan engaged in furtive driving and conduct immediately after retrieving the package; 3) Phan and the person who sent the package likely used Americanized assumed names; 4) cylinders formerly containing the methamphetamine were found in Nguyen\u2019s bathtub and toilet when agents entered Nguyen\u2019s apartment; 5) \u201cclue spray\u201d was found on Nguyen\u2019s hands; and, 6) drug paraphernalia and large amounts of money were found in Nguyen\u2019s apartment. From this, a fact finder could reasonably conclude that Nguyen and Phan knowingly attempted to possess with intent to distribute the more than 50 grams of methamphetamine that agents found inside the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">As the government concedes, reversal is required on Counts 1 and 2. The transit of drugs through international airspace en route from California to Guam does not constitute \u201cimportation\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). <em>United States v. Cabaccang, </em>332 F.3d 622, 635 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc). At trial, no evidence was presented that the package was delivered any way other than by non-stop flight from California to Guam. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Government failed to prove that Nguyen and Phan conspired or aided and abetted in the importation of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The district court correctly found that Phan was not entitled to an offense level adjustment for being a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Benitez, </em>34 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9th Cir.1994) (a ruling that a defendant is not entitled to a \u00a7 3B1.2 role adjustment is reviewed for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We reverse Appellants\u2019 convictions on Counts 1 and 2, affirm their convictions on Counts 3, and remand for resentencing on the remaining count.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
