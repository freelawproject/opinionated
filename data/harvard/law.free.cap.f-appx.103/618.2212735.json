In his complaint, Sundae alleged that he applied for and was denied the position of mining engineer within the Bureau of Land Management, a subdivision of the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>of the Interior, on the basis of his race, color, national origin, age, and physical handicap. He asserted causes of action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the Rehabilitation Act of 1978, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The district court, acting upon the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge, granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendant. It concluded that even assuming Sundae made a <em>prima facie </em>case on each of his discrimination claims, the Defendant proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for his non-selection for employment, and that Sundae failed to demonstrate that they were pretextual. Having carefully reviewed the record and the applicable legal authorities, we find no error in the district court\u2019s disposition of this matter. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-38\">. The Honorable Michael J.
