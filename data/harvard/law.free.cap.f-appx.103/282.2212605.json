Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review an adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The IJ had a \u201clegitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility,\u201d and offered \u201cspecific, cogent reasonfs] for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). For example, the IJ expressed doubt regarding Sant\u2019s credibility after receiving results of an investigation regarding the authenticity of one of Sant\u2019s supporting documents and revealing a significant contradiction with Sant\u2019s testimony that went to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (upholding adverse credibility determination where date of alleged rape differed from date of doctor\u2019s letter submitted in support of claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The record does not compel the conclusion that Sant\u2019s testimony was credible. Necessarily, Sant cannot show that he was eligible for withholding of deportation because the standard of proof required to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation is higher than for establishing eligibility for asylum. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">To the extent that Sant contends he is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture, we lack jurisdiction to address it because Singh failed to exhaust this issue. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897, 900-01 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Sant\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b317-18\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
