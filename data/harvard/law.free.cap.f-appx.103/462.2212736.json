After the decedent\u2019s death, his family demanded coverage under automobile insurance policies issued to two of his sons by appellee Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(\u201cPrudential\u201d). Prudential paid the full coverage amount under one son\u2019s policy but denied coverage under the other, filing the instant action in order to secure a declaratory judgment that no benefits were due under that policy. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Prudential on the grounds that the decedent was not a resident relative in the household of the son under whose policy Prudential had denied coverage. The decedent\u2019s estate and his surviving relatives, Toni Elias (\u201cToni\u201d), Charbel Elias, Aziz Elias (\u201cAziz\u201d), Pierre Elias (\u201cPierre\u201d), and Adibe Elias (collectively, \u201cappellants\u201d), now appeal the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Prudential.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, we will affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The factual background of this action was thoroughly discussed by the District Court, and need only briefly be recited here. Prudential issued separate automobile insurance policies to two members of the Elias family. The first policy, issued to Aziz Elias, provided coverage to the named insured, his or her resident spouse, and any \u201cresident relative,\u201d if any of the foregoing were hit by an underinsured motor vehicle while a pedestrian. The policy defined \u201cresident relative\u201d as \u201csomeone who lives in [the named insured\u2019s] household and is related to [the named insured] by blood, marriage, adoption or is a ward or foster child.\u201d The policy listed Aziz\u2019s address as 153 West Green Street, Allentown, Pennsylvania (the \u201cAllentown address\u201d). The second policy, issued to Toni Elias, contained language identical to the one issued to Aziz, providing underinsured motorist coverage to Toni (as the named insured), his resident spouse, and a \u201cresident relative,\u201d and adopting the same definition of \u201cresident relative.\u201d The policy listed Toni\u2019s address as 210 South Sixth Street, Whitehall, Pennsylvania (the \u201cWhitehall address\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The decedent resided at the Allentown address, as did his sons Aziz and Pierre. At no time did either the decedent or Pierre reside at the Whitehall address. In November of 2000, Toni added Pierre to his policy as a licensed operator resident in the household. Pierre was not actually a resident in Toni\u2019s household, and the terms of Toni\u2019s policy in fact prohibited the addition of nonresident family members as licensed operators. Appellants maintain that they are entitled to coverage under Toni\u2019s policy because the insurance agent erred by incorrectly listing Pierre\u2019s residence as the Whitehall address when Pierre was added to the policy. Implicit in this argument is the contention that, because Pierre was listed on the policy and the decedent resided in the same household as Pierre, the decedent was entitled to coverage under Toni\u2019s policy. As the District Court correctly determined, however, the plain language of the policy establishes that underinsured motorist coverage only extends to resident relatives of the named insured. Although Pierre, Toni, and Jenan Elias (Toni\u2019s wife) are listed as licensed operators under the policy, only Toni is listed as the named insured. Therefore, under no circumstances would the decedent have been entitled to coverage under the policy merely by virtue of his relationship with Pierre. <em>See Peerless Dyeing Inc. v. Industrial Risk Insurers, </em>392 Pa.Super. 434, 573 A.2d 541, 543 (1990) (\u201cThe law of Pennsylvania requires that an insurance policy be construed in accordance with its plain, common, and ordinary meaning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Also unavailing is appellants\u2019 contention that negligence by the insurance agent in adding Pierre to Toni\u2019s policy entitles the decedent to coverage. The District Court determined that this argument was not properly before it because appellants had not raised it in their answer to Prudential\u2019s complaint. Because appellants have not challenged the District Court\u2019s ruling in this regard, they have not properly preserved their argument for resolution on the merits. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. Proc. 28(5); <em>Brenner v. Local 5H United Brotherhood of Carpenters, </em>927 F.2d 1283, 1298 (3d Cir.1991). Even were we to reach the merits, the undisputed evidence establishes that Pierre Elias never intended to purchase a separate insurance policy under which members of his own household would be covered, but rather sought to add himself to his brother Toni\u2019s policy as a member of Toni\u2019s household in order to save money on insurance premiums. Any negligence by the insurance agent in listing the Whitehall address as Pierre\u2019s residence is not material to the issue of coverage for the decedent under Toni\u2019s policy. The District Court\u2019s order will be affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-5\">.
