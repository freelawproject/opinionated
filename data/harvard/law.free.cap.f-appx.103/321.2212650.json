We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. As this is a streamlined case, we review the decision of the IJ. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995), and we grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s decision. Semerjyan\u2019s testimony was not materially inconsistent and the IJ\u2019s alternative explanations for why Semerjyan no longer owned his business were nothing but speculation and conjecture. \u201cSpeculation and conjecture cannot form the basis for an adverse credibility finding, which must instead be based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Shah v. INS., </em>220 F.3d 1062,1071 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 603-04 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b355-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
