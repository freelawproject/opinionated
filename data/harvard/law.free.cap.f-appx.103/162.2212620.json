We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence, see <em>Abovian v. INS, </em>219 F.3d 972, 977-78 (9th Cir.2000), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, based on the perceived inconsistency that petitioner testified he ended his studies at an Iranian university in February 1999, and yet testified that he participated in student demonstrations and a boycott of classes in July 1999, is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. This finding fails to account for evidence in the hearing transcript showing a general confusion regarding conversion of dates in the Iranian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, as well as petitioner\u2019s specific testimony that he thought he left the university in February 1999, but he was \u201ca little confused\u201d about that date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>See Zahedi v. INS, 222 </em>F.3d 1157, 1166-67 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that minor inconsistencies in dates attributable to language problems have no bearing on credibility). Moreover, minor inconsistencies relating to dates cannot serve as the sole basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that discrepancies in dates \u201cwhich reveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear of his safety\u201d cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Although petitioner was not required to corroborate his testimony, <em>see Abovian, </em>219 F.3d at 978, the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to provide documents corroborating his student status after 1997 is not supported by the record, because the BIA failed to address the Iranian court \u201cVerdict\u201d showing that petitioner was charged with \u201cparticipation in student demonstrations of 7/9/99,\u201d <em>see Zahedi, 222 </em>F.3d at 1163-64 (finding Iranian court documents showing petitioner was accused of a crime relating to his political activities \u201cindependently make out the objective component of [his] asylum claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Neither the BIA nor the IJ addressed whether petitioner\u2019s testimony, if credible, would be sufficient to establish eligibility for the relief he requests. We therefore remand to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this memorandum. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b197-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
