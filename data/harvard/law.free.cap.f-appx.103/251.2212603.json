Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(42)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Ortiz-Raygoza testified that his father was severely beaten by Judicial Police in 1983 for transporting a number of individuals to a PAN political rally. Ortiz-Raygoza claimed that his father eventually died from these injuries, and that his mother lodged a formal complaint against the police, which was somewhat successful because several officers were forced to relocate. Years later, however, the officers allegedly returned to the town and harassed Ortiz-Raygoza\u2019s family regarding the complaint. Ortiz-Raygoza testified that he was severely beaten on one occasion, requiring several stitches to his head, and leading to his decision to leave the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">The IJ concluded that, based on inconsistencies in Ortiz-Raygoza\u2019s case, he had not carried his burden of proof. The principal inconsistency was between OrtizRaygoza\u2019s father\u2019s death certificate (listing pancreatic cancer as the cause of death) and Ortiz-Raygoza\u2019s testimony (stating that his father died after being beaten by the police for his political views). The IJ found that this and other inconsistencies \u201ceast[ ] doubt on what exactly happened to the respondent in the 1980\u2019s or at least who did what to whom and why,\u201d and therefore concluded that Ortiz had not proved himself eligible for asylum. Because the record does not compel a contrary conclusion, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>INS v.
