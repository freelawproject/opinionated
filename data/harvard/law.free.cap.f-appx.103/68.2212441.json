Lewis\u2019s discrimination claims were submitted to the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the record that existed after a jury trial in which the jury failed to reach a verdict on the merits of his case. The district court concluded that Lewis\u2019s termination was based on a legitimate business reason and entered judgment in favor of Roberts. The district court also found that Lewis failed to establish that he was disabled and that Lewis\u2019s termination was not based on his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-21\">Lewis claims that the district court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous and urges this court to overturn the district court\u2019s dismissal of his discrimination claims. Having carefully reviewed the record, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s disposition of this matter. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-18\">. The Honorable Richard G.
