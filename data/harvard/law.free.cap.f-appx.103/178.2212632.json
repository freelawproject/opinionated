We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Hernandez contends that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reconsider because the IJ relied impermissibly on a generalized country report to find changed conditions. Contrary to Hernandez\u2019s contention, however, the IJ found that he could relocate safely to another part of Guatemala based on Hernandez\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Hernandez\u2019s reliance on <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12,123 S.Ct. 353,154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002), does not support his contention that the BIA erred by streamlining his case. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii); <em>Falcon Carriche v.
