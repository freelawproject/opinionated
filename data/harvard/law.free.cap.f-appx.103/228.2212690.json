Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 853 (9th Cir.2003). We have jurisdiction to review the denial of Luquin\u2019s application for adjustment of status as a SAW because Luquin brings this challenge in the context of a final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3)(A). We review the LAU\u2019s determination for abuse of discretion and limit our review to the administrative record established at the time of the LAU\u2019s review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3)(B). We hold that the LAU abused its discretion in denying Luquin\u2019s SAW application by relying on extra-record evidence in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The LAU denied Luquin\u2019s application for adjustment of status as a SAW because it concluded that Luquin \u201cfailed to credibly establish the performance of at least 90 man-days of qualifying agricultural employment during the twelve-month statutory period ending May 1, 1986.\u201d The LAU based this decision on information purportedly discovered during the course of its attempt to verify Luquin\u2019s application. However, the administrative record contains neither documentation of the interview nor the affidavit relied on by the LAU.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The LAU\u2019s consideration of evidence outside the administrative record violates the statutory requirement that its review \u201cshall be based solely upon the administrative record established at the time of the determination on the application and upon such additional or newly discovered evidence as may not have been available at the time of the determination.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(2)(B). Thus, the LAU abused its discretion in basing its denial of Lu-quin\u2019s application on evidence outside the administrative record. <em>See Ramon-Sepulveda v. INS, </em>743 F.2d 1307, 1310 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cIt is a well-known maxim that agencies must comply with their own regulations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Once the extra-record adverse evidence is excised from the LAU\u2019s decision, the LAU\u2019s evaluation of Luquin\u2019s credibility is without support. Although the government argues that other evidence supports the LAU\u2019s decision, we cannot affirm an agency on grounds upon which it did not rely. <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 658 n. 16 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194,196 (1947)). Crediting the reliability of his corroborating documents, Luquin demonstrated his qualifying employment \u201cas a matter of just and reasonable inference.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(b)(3)(B)(iii). Because the LAU did not offer grounds for its decision separate from the extra-record evidence, the Attorney General did not \u201cnegate[ ] the reasonableness of the inference\u201d that Luquin met the statutory requirements for legalization. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Luquin is entitled to adjustment of status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Because Luquin is entitled to legal temporary status as a SAW, the petition with respect to the Legalization Appeals Unit\u2019s decision is GRANTED. The order of removal is VACATED. The petition for review of the Bureau of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of cancellation of removal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">.
