We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s decision that petitioner did not establish eligibility for asylum, <em>Cardenas v. INS, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>294 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir.2002), and for an abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 523 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s asylum application because Singh failed to demonstrate that his mistreatment by the Indian police was motivated, at least in part, by an enumerated ground. <em>Cf. Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Because Singh failed to qualify for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to remand because Singh did not make a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 966 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Singh\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b253-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
