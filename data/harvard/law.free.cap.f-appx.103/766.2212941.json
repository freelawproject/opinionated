The record reveals, however, that the Board upheld the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum relief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the ground that Amba failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her application within one year of the date of her arrival in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000). We lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Castellano-Chaeon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185-86 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir. 2003); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir. 2002); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Amba\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">While we do not have jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s denial of Amba\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of her request for withholding of removal, which is not subject to the one-year time limitation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [s]he faces a clear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430,104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Amba has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Accordingly, we deny Amba\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
