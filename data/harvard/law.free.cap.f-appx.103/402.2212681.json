Eight months later, Jalloh applied for asylum or, in the alternative, withholding of removal, on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the petition and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. The IJ relied heavily on the determination that, as a result of having submitted fraudulent identity documents, Jalloh was not a credible witness. The BIA, although it reversed the adverse credibility finding, nevertheless adopted the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Jalloh failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">On appeal, Jalloh alleges that the evidence presented below \u2014 particularly in light of the restoration of credibility \u2014 compels a conclusion that he was eligible for asylum or, in the alternative, that he is entitled to withholding of removal. The proceedings below, however, leave us without an adequate basis to decide whether petitioner\u2019s evidence merits denying or granting any form of relief because the BIA did not fully consider the effect of the restoration of credibility on the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim and also assigned him an incorrect burden of proof. We therefore vacate the BIA\u2019s order and remand for further analysis of petitioner\u2019s application in light of his restored credibility and under the proper evidentiary standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum is predicated on the brutal murders of his family and the destruction of the family home, allegedly by a rebellious faction of the Sierra Leonean military.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The backdrop for this tragedy is the calamitous history of Sierra Leone, plagued by civil strife since 1991 and beset by abject poverty for decades prior. After several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>years of military rule, a civilian government was elected in March 1996. This did not end the struggle for power, however, and two formerly warring factions \u2014 ousted military members known as the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and an independent rebel group known as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) \u2014 cooperated in an effort to destabilize the elected regime. The terrorizing of civilians, aimed at discouraging participation in and support for the government, figured prominently in AFRC and RUF tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Throughout the years of violence, civilians were literally and figuratively caught in the crossfire and, as a result, established militia defense forces to protect themselves. Jalloh\u2019s father was a village elder and, although not a member, offered support to one such group known as the Kamajors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to offering protection, the Kamajors advocated for a democratically elected government and, after the election in 1996, lent their support to the elected civilian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On December 2, 1996, when Jalloh was 22 years of age and a student at the government secondary school in the town of Kenema, the school day was interrupted by the sound of gunshots.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fleeing the building with other students, Jalloh headed towards his home in hope of finding safety. Unfortunately, upon reaching his neighborhood, he discovered that his house had been set on fire and that his father, mother, and younger sister had been shot dead. Jalloh found three other bodies, burned beyond recognition, in the ruins of the home and concluded that these were likely three of his four remaining siblings. Jalloh took cover in the home of a neighbor, Mr. Williams, who said he \u2014 Williams\u2014had seen renegade soldiers leaving the Jalloh home. A second man, also sheltering in Williams\u2019 house but unfamiliar to Jalloh, said that the house of another family that supported the Kamajors had also been burned. Jalloh thus concluded that his family had been targeted by insurgent forces as a result of his father\u2019s support for the Kamajors.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Fearing that he would suffer a similar fate, he fled to Sierra Leone\u2019s Waterloo Displacement Camp. After remaining there approximately five months, he came into contact with a former business partner of his father\u2019s, Abdul Traore. Traore offered to let Jalloh live with him in Guinea, and Jalloh agreed, thinking it safer than the refugee camp. While in Guinea, however, Jalloh also visited a second camp, the Moola Refugee Camp, apparently in order to secure various identification documents pertaining to his alleged refugee status. In September 1998, Traore and Jalloh traveled to the United States. At Traore\u2019s suggestion, Jalloh falsely procured a Guinean passport using his own photograph but the biographical information of Traore\u2019s deceased son. With this passport, Jalloh was admitted to the United States on a non-immigrant visa. Traore and Jalloh quickly lost contact, and Jalloh ended up in Boston with a friend who knew his family in Sierra Leone. In April 1999, Jalloh submitted an application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>II. <em>Applicable Law and Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In support of his application for asylum, Jalloh was required to demonstrate that he was a refugee as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, namely, that he was unable or unwilling to return to Sierra Leone because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(42)(A). The regulations place this burden squarely on the asylum applicant. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13 (2003). An applicant will be deemed <em>to </em>have met this burden if he establishes a well-founded fear of persecution that is both genuine \u2014 a subjective inquiry \u2014 and reasonable \u2014 an objective standard requiring that the applicant demonstrate that there is \u201ca reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(B). <em>See Ravindran v. INS, </em>976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir.1992) (requiring asylum applicant to show a reasonable fear of persecution \u201cby credible, direct, and specific evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We have characterized the appropriate inquiry as \u201cwhether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant\u2019s circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground,\u201d <em>Aguilar-Solis v. INS, </em>168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999). An alien need not provide evidence of being singled out, however, if he or she can establish 1) \u201ca pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality\u201d of the persecution of similarly situated persons and 2) \u201chis or her own inclusion in, and identification with, such group of persons.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A). <em>See also Knezevic v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1206, 1213 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Kotasz v. INS, </em>31 F.3d 847, 852 (9th Cir.1994)) (asylum applicants not required to demonstrate that they would be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution because \u201c \u2018persecution of an entire group can render proof of individual targeting entirely superfluous\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Significantly, an asylum applicant\u2019s testimony alone \u2014 if deemed credible \u2014 could sustain this burden of proof. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13; <em>Gailius v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.1998). Furthermore, an asylum applicant may establish the persecutor\u2019s motive through circumstantial evidence. <em>Guzman v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003); <em>Ramirez Rivas v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 864, 869 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cEvidence of the motive of a persecutor is hard to come by.... Circumstantial evidence, of course, is evidence, not \u2018no evidence,\u2019 as the Service asserts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The IJ denied Jalloh\u2019s petition on two grounds: first, that he had not established that he was a refugee because he could not prove Sierra Leonean citizenship; second, that Jalloh did not establish \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution because he was not credible.\u201d Undergirding each of the two grounds was an adverse credibility determination stemming from Jalloh\u2019s submission of a fraudulent Sierra Leone identification card as part of his petition for asylum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jalloh claimed that at the time he submitted the card, he reasonably believed it to be valid. At the hearing before the IJ, Jalloh explained that his father had originally secured an identification card for him, but that this card was lost. Before his family\u2019s death, Jalloh became concerned about the increasing violence around Kenema and wanted to se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>cure a replacement card in case he was forced to flee. This necessitated a trip to Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s cap\u00edtol. Because ambushes of travelers were frequent, Jalloh paid someone to take the trip for him, and thus acquired his second card through this intermediary. He testified that he had no reason to believe that the second card was fraudulent because it looked like all other identity cards he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The IJ, however, was not convinced, and, relying on <em>Matter of O-D, </em>21 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 1079, 1083, 1998 WL 24904 (BIA 1998), noted that submission of at least one counterfeit identification document \u201cgenerally discredits [petitioner\u2019s] testimony regarding asylum eligibility and specifically discredits his identity claim.\u201d The IJ not only discounted Jalloh\u2019s testimony, but also accorded very little weight to expert testimony that supported his claim of citizenship, namely, that Jalloh was fluent in languages native to Sierra Leone and was familiar with the culture generally and people specifically in a manner to be expected of a native.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The alternative ground for denying asylum \u2014 that Jalloh did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution because he did not demonstrate a causal connection between his family\u2019s political opinion and the feared persecution \u2014 also relied in part on the adverse credibility finding. In evaluating Jalloh\u2019s claim that insurgent forces were aware of his father\u2019s support of the Kamajors and thus targeted the family on account of political affiliation, the IJ again discounted Jalloh\u2019s testimony because he was not a credible witness and \u201ctherefore, his testimony as to what actually occurred is questionable at best.\u201d The court instead adopted the government\u2019s argument that Jalloh\u2019s family simply fell victim to the indiscriminate violence sweeping through the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The BIA, on the other hand, accepted Jalloh\u2019s explanation of the lost identification card and thus credited Jalloh\u2019s claim of citizenship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The BIA noted more generally that \u201c[t]he submission of the fraudulent document does not taint the respondent\u2019s veracity and credibility under <em>Matter of O-D ... </em>because the respondent testified that he did not know the document was fraudulent.\u201d By virtue of its citation to <em>Matter of O-D, </em>it appears that the BIA may have intended the credibility reversal to affect not just the claim of citizenship, but \u201coverall credibility\u201d as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, in reviewing the IJ\u2019s alternative ground for dismissal, the BIA did not address Jalloh\u2019s evidence \u2014 or the IJ\u2019s treatment of that evidence^ \u2014 in light of Jalloh\u2019s restored credibility. On the key issue of whether the family\u2019s murders had been on account of political opinion, the BIA offered a cursory review of the evidence as interpreted by the IJ and then concluded that Jalloh\u2019s claim of causation was simply \u201cspeculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>Guzman, </em>327 F.3d at 15. Under this deferential standard, we will uphold the BIA if the decision is \u201csupported by reasonable, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>stantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481, </em>112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We will not reverse unless we determine that the record compels the conclusion that Jalloh is eligible for asylum. <em>Aguilar-Solis, </em>168 F.3d at 565. We may remand, however, if the BIA\u2019s opinion fails to state \u201cwith sufficient particularity and clarity the reasons for denial of asylum.\u201d <em>Gailius, </em>147 F.3d at 46 (citing <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 343 (9th Cir.1994) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">At the outset, we note that when the BIA required Jalloh to prove a well-founded fear of persecution by showing that it was \u201cmore likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to Sierra Leone,\u201d the BIA assigned Jalloh the wrong burden of proof.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The \u201cmore likely than not\u201d burden applies to withholding of removal, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)(ii), not asylum, which requires a lesser showing that the \u201cfear of persecution upon return is reasonable,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(B) (emphasis added). <em>Compare INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 449, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (describing as \u201cinexorable\u201d the conclusion that \u201cto show a \u2018well-founded fear of persecution,\u2019 an alien need not prove that it is more likely than not that he or she will be persecuted in his or her home country\u201d), <em>with INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984) (requiring that an applicant for withholding of removal demonstrate \u201cthat it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds,\u201d but specifically leaving open the required showing for an asylum applicant). This legal error adds to the difficulty of reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision. The Board erroneously failed to consider whether Jalloh\u2019s evidence supports a reasonable fear of persecution sufficient to sustain an application for asylum, even if it does not demonstrate that Jalloh\u2019s likelihood of facing persecution is \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d <em>See Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, </em>373 F.3d 9, 23 (1st Cir.2004) (cautioning that the \u201cINS cannot impose an evidentiary burden on the applicant that is not provided by and appears to be inconsistent with the statute or regulation\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Moreover, despite its restoration of credibility to Jalloh, the BIA gave short shrift to his considerable evidence that he faced a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Jalloh presented probative evidence that suggested a political connection between the violence suffered by his family and his father\u2019s political views. His own testimony described how a known member of the Kamajors would visit the family home\u2014 located in a section of the town controlled by the renegade soldiers \u2014 approximately twice each month to arrange for supplies of rice-paid for by Jalloh\u2019s father \u2014 to be picked up at various local stores. Jalloh explained that his father was a member of the village elders and that as a leader in the community, his political opinions \u2014 including his support of free elections and the Kamajors \u2014 would have been known.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Jalloh also testified to having been told that on the day his home was destroyed, the home of another family, known to have supported the Kamajors, was also burned. Such evidence of selectivity further buttresses Jalloh\u2019s claim that his family was targeted on account of political opinion. <em>See Popova v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 1251, 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.2001) (fact that, in an apartment complex, only petitioner\u2019s apartment was burned supported claim that petitioner was targeted on account of religious affiliation and political opinion); <em>cf. Pieterson v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 38, 42-43 (1st Cir.2004) (justifying denial of petitioner\u2019s claim in part on the fact that the evidence \u201csuggested that no particular group of persons was being singled out; the looting and burning of houses and shops did <em>not </em>target persons of particular ethnicities or political beliefs\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Documentary evidence in the form of news reports and country profiles from the United States Department of State and organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch further substantiates Jalloh\u2019s claim that supporters of the Kamajors were targeted for persecution. Although the reports attest to the generalized violence characteristic of Sierra Leone\u2019s civil war and aftermath, there is also clear mention of attacks on Kamajors and purported collaborators in Kenema, the same city in which Jalloh\u2019s family lived. Significantly, the reported abuses were not confined solely to suspected members of the Kamajors, but also extended to citizens accused of simply supporting the group. Finally, Professor Rosalind Shaw, accepted by the IJ as an expert on the conditions of Sierra Leone, testified that both Jalloh\u2019s account of the killings and the targeted abuse of Kamajor supporters are consistent with her understanding of the pervasive situation in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In addition, Jalloh provided evidence pertaining to the likelihood of his being identified and targeted for persecution should he return to Sierra Leone. He testified that he knew at least twenty young men from school and from playing soccer who joined the soldiers, and he explained that these men would not only be able to identify him, but would also be aware of his family\u2019s political affiliation. Jalloh\u2019s own testimony was corroborated by that of Professor Shaw, who offered her expert opinion that should Jalloh return to Sierra Leone, he was \u201cmore than likely\u201d to be identified and persecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The BIA acknowledged that the record contained evidence that \u201csoldiers targeted Kamajors and supporters of Kamajors, and that the respondent\u2019s father was a supporter of the Kamajors,\u201d but then dismissed Jalloh\u2019s claim that his family had been killed on account of political opinion as \u201cspeculation.\u201d This cursory discounting of Jalloh\u2019s proffered testimony is \u2014 absent further explanation \u2014 inconsistent both with the BIA\u2019s determination that Jalloh was a credible witness and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13, which allows an applicant to prove motivation on his or her own testimony alone, absent other evidence to the contrary. <em>See Shoafera v. INS, </em>228 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>1070, 1075 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cA bald assertion that [petitioner\u2019s] credible testimony was \u2018speculation\u2019 is insufficient. Some evidence or support for that conclusion must be offered.\u201d). Although we have clarified that a reviewing court need not accept the uncontradicted testimony of an asylum applicant as true if it is \u201cinternally inconsistent or belied by the prevailing circumstances,\u201d <em>Aguilar-Solis, </em>168 F.3d at 570, the BIA has given us no indication that either of those qualifying characteristics is present here. The only analysis offered by the BIA was that \u201cthere is no evidence that the respondent\u2019s father was ever threatened or harmed on account of his political beliefs ... or that other members of his family had been threatened or harmed.\u201d This, however, is a conclusory characterization of the record which, as we have noted, is too opaque to serve as the basis for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Jalloh has offered evidence \u2014 his own testimony, international and governmental agency reports, and expert opinion \u2014 that his family was killed on account of his father\u2019s political affiliation with the Kamajors and that, furthermore, should he return to Sierra Leone, he may suffer a similar fate. Because the BIA reversed the IJ with respect to Jalloh\u2019s credibility, we need a more detailed explanation of why this evidence is insufficient. <em>Gailius, </em>147 F.3d at 47 (explaining that remand is appropriate in asylum context when \u201ca reviewing court cannot sustain the agency\u2019s decision because it has failed to offer legally sufficient reasons for its decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The combined effect of the credibility reversal and the assignment of the wrong burden of proof has left us without a sufficient basis to affirm the BIA, and we therefore vacate the order of the BIA and remand to determine whether the credible testimony offered by Jalloh establishes past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution on account of political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-13\">. The petitioner's burden for demonstrating eligibility for asylum is lower than the burden for withholding of removal. <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>Albathani </em>v. <em>INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir.2003) (observing that \"[b]ecause the \u2018more likely than not\u2019 standard for withholding deportation is more stringent than that for asylum, a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, <em>a fortiori, </em>to satisfy the former\u201d). We therefore focus our inquiry on whether the evidence presented by Jalloh meets the lower threshold for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\">. An elected civilian government was in power at the time Jalloh\u2019s family was killed, but the regime was unstable. In May 1997 \u2014 five months after petitioner\u2019s family members were killed \u2014 a military coup succeeded in overthrowing the government. Civilian leadership was not re-established until February 1998, and even then fighting continued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\">. Although the IJ cast doubt on the veracity of the story in its entirety, the BIA accepted Jalloh\u2019s account of the killings while finding insufficient evidence that the perpetrators were politically motivated. We therefore recite the course of events as recounted by Jalloh in his brief and his testimony before the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\">. Jalloh does not contest the testimony of a forensic analyst who concluded that the card was \"concocted.\u201d On this basis, the IJ concluded that Jalloh\u2019s claim of Sierra Leonean citizenship was not credible, and thus he could not establish a foundation for refugee status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">. As a further result of the restoration of credibility, the BIA reversed the IJ's finding that Jalloh had filed a frivolous application for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. Indeed, in <em>Matter of O-D, </em>not only had false documents been presented, but, as the BIA stated, \"[I]n the absence of an explanation regarding such presentation, [the presentation] creates serious doubts regarding the respondent\u2019s overall credibility.\u201d <em>Matter of O</em>.D, 21 I &amp; N Dec. at 1083.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\">. Jalloh did not raise this issue on appeal, and the government did not acknowledge the misstep, but it is settled in this circuit that an appellate court has discretion, in exceptional cases, to relieve a party of forfeiture. <em>See United States v. La Guardia, </em>902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.1990). The BIA's error of law deviates from clear precedent of both the Supreme Court and this circuit and, therefore, should not escape our attention, particularly in a case where further proceedings will be necessary on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">. The confusion is further apparent in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Jalloh \"failed to prove entitlement to asylum.\u201d As the Supreme Court explained in <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 441, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987), asylum is discretionary relief and thus an applicant who demonstrates a well-founded fear of persecution is simply deemed \"eligible\u201d for asylum. An applicant who meets the higher standard for withholding of removal, however, is \"entitled\u201d to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\">. Jalloh\u2019s claim is actually based on his fear that the renegade soldiers and insurgents would impute his father\u2019s political support of the Kamajors to Jalloh himself, and thus target him for persecution. Such imputed political opinion \u2014 even if incorrectly attributed to the asylum applicant. \u2014 can satisfy the \"on account of\" requirement under the Act\u2019s definition of a refugee. <em>Morales v.
