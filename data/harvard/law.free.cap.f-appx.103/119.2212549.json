The IJ found Petitioner deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (now codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)), and as an alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct under INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii) (now codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)). The IJ also found Petitioner ineligible for relief under \u00a7 209(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c), or withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-18\">Because the deportation proceedings against Petitioner were pending before April 1, 1997, and the final agency order of deportation was entered after October 30, 1996, the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply to this case. <em>See, e.g., Kalaio v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). Section 309(c)(4)(G) of the IIRIRA provides, in part, that \u201cthere shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section ... 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) ... of the Immigration and Nationality Act ... or any offense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) of such Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">Section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the INA provides that an alien \u201cconvicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d Petitioner was convicted of receiving stolen property, for which he was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment, and petty theft with priors, for which he was also sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(G), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>fense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Because Petitioner was convicted of receiving stolen property, an aggravated felony, he is deportable under INA \u00a7 241 (a)(2)(A)(iii),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we lack jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review. <em>See Maganar-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 607 (9th Cir.1999). As a result, we need not address Petitioner\u2019s argument that his conviction for petty theft with priors is not an aggravated felony under <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir.2002), or his other claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b154-20\"> The Honorable Donald P. Lay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-17\">. We note that Petitioner's conviction for receipt of stolen property was entered in 1994, before the IIRIRA amended the definition of \"aggravated felony\u201d to eliminate the requirement that the term of imprisonment be at least five years. IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994 ed.). However, the IIRIRA provided that the new definition of crimes constituting aggravated felonies applied \"regardless of whether the conviction was entered before, on, or after the date of enactment\u201d of the new definition. IIRIRA \u00a7 321(b); <em>see United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
