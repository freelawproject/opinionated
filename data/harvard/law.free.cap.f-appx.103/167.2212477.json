We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination, <em>see Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum, including any adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-26\">Although credible testimony may satisfy the asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof, if the IJ \u201cdoes not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application.\u201d <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Cir.2000). Because the IJ offered specific and cogent reasons for questioning Sandhu\u2019s credibility during the hearing and in her decision, and because Sandhu was unable to provide any corroboration for testimony that the IJ found implausible and inconsistent, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that she had not established eligibility for asylum. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-53 (9th Cir.1999) (finding inconsistency, implausibility and lack of specificity in testimony may support an adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Because Sandhu failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b201-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
