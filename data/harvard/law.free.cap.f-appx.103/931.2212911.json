Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 915, 917-19 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review). We agree with the BIA that Herrera failed to show past persecution based on political opinion, <em>see Al Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 743 (8th Cir.2004) (mere presence of some physical harm does not require finding of past persecution), or a well-founded fear of future persecution, <em>see Melecio-Saquil v. Ashcroft, </em>337 F.3d 983, 987 (8th Cir.2003) (record supported IJ\u2019s finding that asylum applicant who claimed he had been beaten by guerrillas in mid-1980\u2019s lacked well-founded fear of future persecution due to \u201cdramatic changes in Guatemala after the 1996 peace accords\u201d); <em>Perinpanathan v. INS, </em>310 F.3d 594, 599 n. 1 (8th Cir.2002) (State Department reports are persuasive authority for determining whether asylum-seeker has well-founded fear of future persecution). Because we agree with the IJ\u2019s decision as to asylum, we also uphold the IJ\u2019s decision as to withholding of removal. <em>See Francois v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 926, 932-33 (8th Cir.2002) (standard for withholding of removal is more onerous than asylum standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Finally, Herrera\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s summary-affirmance procedure is unavailing because she received a full hearing before an IJ, a detailed and reasoned opinion from the IJ, an opportunity to present arguments to the BIA, and a decision from a BIA member. <em>See Loulou v. </em>Ashcroftt 354 F.3d 706, 708-09 (8th Cir. 2003), <em>amended by </em>No. 02-3004, slip op. (8th Cir. Apr. 28, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
