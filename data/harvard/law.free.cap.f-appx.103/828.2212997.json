Welch is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Welch has asserted that a new \u201cpoints system\u201d for determining custodial classification has resulted in a negative change in his own classification, in violation of his rights under the Due Process, Ex Post Facto, and Double Jeopardy Clauses. The district court properly concluded that a due-process claim was barred by <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Although the court did not explicitly address Welch\u2019s allegations under an <em>ex post facto </em>or double-jeopardy framework, he has failed to state claims under those constitutional clauses as well. Welch has cited no decisional authority, and we are aware of <em>none, </em>which holds that a mere change in custodial status either amounts to an \u201cincrease\u201d in the \u201cmeasure of punishment\u201d for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes, <em>see, e.g., Gamer v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 249-50, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000), or qualifies as a second \u201cpunishment\u201d for double-jeopardy purposes. <em>See Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 98-99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997); <em>United States v. Galan, </em>82 F.3d 639, 640 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Welch has failed to show that his complaint presented non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Welch\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). Welch is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
