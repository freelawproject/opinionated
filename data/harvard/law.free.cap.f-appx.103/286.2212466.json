We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence because Raahul submitted a false baptism certificate which contradicted his testimony that he was never baptized. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000). This inconsistency goes to the heart of Raahul\u2019s asylum claim because his alleged persecution was based on his conversion from Hinduism to Christianity. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">Because Raahul did not testify credibly, he did not establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Raahul is not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture because his claim is based on the same statements the IJ determined were not credible. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">We deny the motion to withdraw and order the Clerk to serve a copy of this memorandum disposition on Raahul at 942 Cooper Avenue, Apt. 1, Yuba City, CA 95991.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
