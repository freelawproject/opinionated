We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination, <em>see Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum, including any adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Even if Singh\u2019s testimony were deemed credible, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Singh\u2019s fear of future persecution is not well-founded because Singh did not cany his burden of adducing \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record, of facts that would support a reasonable fear of persecution\u201d at the hands of the Indian police. <em>Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 413 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We also deny Singh\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion to reopen to seek relief under the Convention Against Torture. The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Singh\u2019s motion because he failed to make a prima facie showing that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(2)(4), 208.18(b)(2); <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 965-66 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b194-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
