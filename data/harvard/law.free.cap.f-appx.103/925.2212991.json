Patterson, </em>128 F.3d 1259, 1260-61 (8th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (right of allocution applies to supervised-release-revocation hearing). Gaines testified at the hearing before sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>at which time he made his views known regarding the alleged violations, the progress he had made on supervision, and his desire to be continued on supervised release without modification. <em>See United States v. Kaniss, </em>150 F.3d 967, 969 (8th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Iversen, </em>90 F.3d 1340, 1345-46 (8th Cir.1996) (defendant was effectively granted allocution, even though court did not ask her if she had anything to add regarding sentencing, where she testified on her own behalf such that her views regarding sentencing were known and it was clear that she knew she had right to speak on any subject prior to sentencing and availed herself of that right).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-17\">.
