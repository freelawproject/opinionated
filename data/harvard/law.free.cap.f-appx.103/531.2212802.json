Martinez, Texas prisoner # 889868, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). He argues that he has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in not being classified as a gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>member. He also argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his complaint without holding a <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing or allowing him to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Absent extraordinary circumstances, a prisoner does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his classification or in remaining free from administrative segregation. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 485, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999). Thus, Martinez\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Doe v. Rains County Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>66 F.3d 1402,1406 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">A district court is not required to hold a <em>Spears </em>hearing in every case. <em>See Beck v. Lynaugh, </em>842 F.2d 759, 761 (5th Cir.1988). Martinez has shown no error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny his motion for a <em>Spears </em>hearing. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) directs the district court to review, \u201cas soon as practicable after docketing,\u201d a prisoner\u2019s complaint against a governmental officer. The statute contains no requirement for allowing the plaintiff to conduct discovery prior to dismissal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Martinez\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Martinez\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Martinez\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Martinez is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
