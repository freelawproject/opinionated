DeBardeleben seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing as successive his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that DeBardeleben has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. No active judge of this court has voted to grant hearing en banc and we therefore deny DeBardeleben\u2019s petition for initial hearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-18\"> By order filed April 6, 2004, this appeal was placed in abeyance for <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>No. 03-6891. In view of our recent decision in <em>Reid. v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363 (4th Cir.2004), we no longer find it necessary to hold this, case in abeyance for <em>Jones.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
