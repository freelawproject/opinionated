We dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s original decision because Petitioners did not timely appeal the BIA\u2019s first decision to this Court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Sheviakov v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001) (30-day rule is mandatory and jurisdictional); <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996) (motion to reopen does not toll period). In addition, we lack jurisdiction to review the decision because it is based in part on a determination that Petitioners failed to demonstrate \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 889-90 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because such a denial is a judgment regarding the granting of the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9; <em>cf. Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 520, 525-27 (9th Cir.2004) (finding jurisdiction to review denial of motion to reopen where there was never a ruling on the discretionary relief sought by alien).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">We do not consider Arreguin\u2019s eligibility, if any, for relief under the settlement agreement in <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc. v. Ridge, </em>Civ S-86-1343-LKK (E.D.Cal.), or <em>Newman v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services, </em>Civ.
