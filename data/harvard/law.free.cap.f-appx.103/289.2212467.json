Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review an adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Alr-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 887-88 (9th Cir. 2001) . The IJ articulated specific and cogent reasons for his disbeliefs. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 2002) . Specifically, the IJ noted implausibilities in Rahman\u2019s testimony, <em>see Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-53 (9th Cir.1999) (finding inconsistency, implausibility and lack of specificity in testimony may support an adverse credibility determination), inconsistencies in dates, <em>see Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (finding support in the record for an adverse credibility determination when petitioner\u2019s testimony regarding one event of past persecution had differing dates of occurrence), and inconsistencies between Rahman\u2019s declaration and his testimony, <em>see Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043 (9th Cir. 2001) (acknowledging substantial evidence supporting an adverse credibility finding when inconsistencies relate to heart of asylum claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Because Rahman failed to meet the standard to qualify for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897, 900-01 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Rah-man\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b323-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
