Although the IJ did not specifically mention the grand theft vehicle conviction in his oral decision, he did hold that Kanzburg was removable on the basis of his conviction for an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in the IJ\u2019s decision negated his earlier determination regarding Kanzburg\u2019s grand theft vehicle conviction, and the proceedings as a whole notified Kanzburg that the conviction prompted his removal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">Because Kanzburg\u2019s removal order was based on his conviction for an aggravated felony, we lack jurisdiction to review that order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, we also lack jurisdiction to review Kanzburg\u2019s motion to reopen his proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AB1\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">.

The IJ made the determination during a preliminary hearing in September 1998. Because the IJ determined at that hearing that Kanzburg was ineligible for asylum due to the grand theft vehicle conviction, Kanzburg\u2019s final hearing in January 1999, during which the IJ rendered his oral decision, only touched on the merits of Kanzburg's withholding of removal claim. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s determination in September 1998 changed the course of the proceedings and cannot be disregarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b261-20\">.
