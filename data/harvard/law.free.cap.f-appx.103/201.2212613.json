We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1117 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>124 S.Ct. 50,124 S.Ct. 50, 157 L.Ed.2d 23 (2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-27\">The district court properly dismissed as untimely Shannon\u2019s claim concerning unlawful withholding of his magazines because he filed his action more than two years after the claim accrued. <em>See Fink v. Shedler, </em>192 F.3d 911, 914 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that federal courts apply the forum state\u2019s personal injury statute of limitations for section 1983 claims); <em>Perez v. Seevers, </em>869 F.2d 425, 426 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam) (stating that Nevada\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury claims is two years) <em>(citing </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 11.190(4)(e)). Moreover, the district court correctly determined that the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>timing violations doctrine was inapplicable because defendants\u2019 subsequent withholding of magazines was merely the continuing effect of their initial decision. <em>See Knox v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 1009, 1013 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that the \u201cmere continuing <em>impact </em>from past violations is not actionable\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The district court properly dismissed the remainder of the action because Shannon failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Shannon\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because Shannon did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015,1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Shannon\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b235-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
