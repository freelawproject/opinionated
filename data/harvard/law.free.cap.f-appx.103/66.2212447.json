Greene, II, Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, Little Rock, AR, James Blair Pierce, Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, Fayetteville, AR, Juan Carlos Aguilera-Alvarado, White Deer, PA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b101-6\">Before MURPHY, FAGG, and SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b101-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Juan Carlos Aguilera-Alvarado pleaded guilty to illegal reentry after deportation following an aggravated-felony conviction, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 77 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, AguileraAlvarado\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">After careful review, we find the issues counsel raises unavailing. By pleading guilty unconditionally, Aguilera-Alvarado waived any suppression issue, <em>cf. United States v. Arrellano, </em>213 F.3d 427, 430 (8th Cir.2000) (defendant waived right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress where he did not enter conditional guilty plea reserving right to appeal denial of motion); the prosecutor\u2019s recital of the date of the offense as being one day earlier than that stated in the indictment did not constructively amend the indictment, <em>cf. United States v. Harris, </em>344 F.3d 803, 804-05 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (where defendant\u2019s admitted possession of firearm on October 9 was \u201creasonably near\u201d October 16 date alleged in indictment, conduct was within scope of indictment and there was no constructive amendment), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1463, 158 L.Ed.2d 119 (2004); and counsel fails to point to anything in the record that would call into question the district court\u2019s finding that Aguilera-Alvarado was competent and made the plea voluntarily and knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Further, a 16-level offense-level enhancement was properly applied based on Aguilera-Alvarado\u2019s prior California conviction for robbery, <em>see United States v. Valladares, </em>304 F.3d 1300, 1301-03 (8th Cir.2002), and did not violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>see United States v. Rayar-Ramirez, </em>244 F.3d 976, 977 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 898, 122 S.Ct. 223, 151 L.Ed.2d 160 (2001). We also find that the district court did not commit error in imposing a $1,000 fine, an amount significantly less than the calculated range. Last, we decline to consider a constitutional challenge to the PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21 \u00a7 401, 117 Stat. 650, 657 (2003), amending 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Liberty State Bank v. Minn. Life &amp; Health Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>149 F.3d 832, 834 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">We also have carefully reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">.
