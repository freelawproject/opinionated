We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Zhang also moves for a stay of his voluntary departure period. We construe Zhang\u2019s timely-filed motion to stay removal to include a request to stay voluntary departure, <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2004), and grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">I. <em>Petition for Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Zhang contends that: (1) the IJ erred in finding that he had not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation; (2) the IJ erred in requiring corroborating evidence to support his application; and (3) the BIA erred in \u201cstreamlining\u201d his case pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e)(4)\u00ae (2002) (renumbered at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)\u00ae (2003)). Because we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and decline to review the merits of the BIA\u2019s streamlining decision, we deny Zhang\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\n<em>A. Zhang\u2019s Asylum Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Zhang failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence. According to Zhang\u2019s testimony, he was arrested and detained by the Chinese police for two weeks in 1989, following his participation in a political demonstration. During his detention, he was handcuffed for a period of twenty-four hours and forced to sleep on the floor. On one occasion, he was beaten by an officer for fifteen to twenty minutes, but sustained no major injuries as a result. Following his release from detention, he was expelled from school and struggled to find work, but continued to live in China for a period of three years without further incident. Given these facts, a reasonable fact finder could have concluded that the \u201ccumulative effect of all the incidents\u201d of past mistreatment alleged by Zhang was not so extreme to rise to the level persecution. <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that persecution is \u201can extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Further, the IJ\u2019s determination that Zhang failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution was reasonable. To obtain a reversal of such a determination, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483 \u2014 84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The sum of the evidence presented by Zhang falls short of this standard. As noted above, Zhang remained in China for three years after his release from prison, during which time he suffered no ill treatment at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>hands of the Chinese authorities. In addition, the IJ found that Zhang\u2019s political activities were limited in scope and that Zhang likely left China for financial, rather than political, reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Zhang disputes the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to proffer corroborating documentary evidence. However, even assuming that Zhang\u2019s claims were adequately corroborated, they fail to rise to the level of past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Therefore, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s denial of Zhang\u2019s application for asylum was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>B. Zhang\u2019s Request for Withholding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The record also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Zhang\u2019s request for withholding of deportation. Zhang\u2019s failure to establish a well-founded fear of persecution precludes a finding of a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution necessary to qualify for withholding of deportation. <em>Ghaly v. INS, 58 </em>F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cfailure to satisfy the lesser standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum necessarily results in a failure to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of deportation as well\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\n<em>C. The BIA\u2019s \u201cStreamlining\u201d Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Regarding Zhang\u2019s remaining contention, that the BIA\u2019s decision to \u201cstreamline\u201d his case was in error, we find that an independent assessment of the streamlining decision is \u201cunnecessary and duplicative\u201d in this case, because we have jurisdiction to review the merits of the IJ\u2019s underlying decision. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 855 (9th Cir.2003). We accordingly decline to review the merits of the BIA\u2019s streamlining decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">II. <em>Motion for Stay of Voluntary Departure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">In addition to denying Zhang\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of deportation, the IJ granted Zhang voluntary departure. On December 5, 2002, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision granting voluntary departure and allowed Zhang thirty days from the date of its Order to voluntarily depart. On December 19, 2002, Zhang filed a timely motion to stay removal, which triggered a temporary stay pursuant to General Order 6.4(c). The government subsequently filed a statement of non-opposition to Zhang\u2019s motion to stay removal, and we automatically extended the temporary stay of removal until the disposition of Zhang\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">On December 18, 2003, Zhang filed a motion for stay of the voluntary departure period. We construe Zhang\u2019s motion to stay removal, which was timely filed before the thirty-day voluntary departure period had expired, to include a motion to stay voluntary departure. <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore grant Zhang\u2019s motion to stay voluntary departure <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to December 19, 2002, the date that Zhang filed his motion to stay removal and we issued an automatic stay of removal under General Order 6.4(c). On that date, fourteen days of Zhang\u2019s voluntary departure period had elapsed. Zhang shall accordingly have sixteen days \u201cafter the issuance of [this Court\u2019s] mandate to depart voluntarily.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is DENIED and the motion for stay of voluntary departure is GRANTED <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to December 19, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b122-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
