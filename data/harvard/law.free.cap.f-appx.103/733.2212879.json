The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the three issues raised by Blankenship on appeal: (1) whether the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence relating to statements by Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>witness, Kevin Cooke; (2) whether counsel was ineffective for not disclosing a conflict of interest; and (3) whether the district court erred in refusing to sever the trial of Blankenship and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">This Court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief based on a state court record. <em>Bell v. Ozmint, </em>332 F.3d 229, 233 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1155, 157 L.Ed.2d 1049 (2004). Once a certificate of appealability has issued, habeas corpus relief may be granted under \u00a7 2254 only if a state court\u2019s decision on the merits of a claim for post-conviction relief \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (discussing \u00a7 2254(d)(1)); <em>Wilson v. Ozmint, </em>352 F.3d 847, 855 (4th Cir.2003), <em>amended on other grounds by </em>357 F.3d 461 (4th Cir.2004), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2879, 159 L.Ed.2d 783 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">We have independently reviewed the record in light of Blankenship\u2019s claims and conclude that the district court did not err in denying habeas relief. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. While we grant Blankenship\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief, we deny his motion to appoint counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
