The BIA found, and Gutierrez does not dispute, that the asylum application was not timely filed and that Gutierrez had \u201cfailed to prove that extraordinary circumstances caused the failure to meet the 1-year deadline.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>(D). This court does not have jurisdiction to review these determinations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Fesshaye v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-60393, 2003 WL 23021863 (5th Cir. Dec.24, 2003) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Asylum and withholding of removal are distinct remedies. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997). To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien must \u201cshow a \u2018clear probability\u2019 that he or she will be persecuted if deported.\u201d <em>Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">Gutierrez contends that he has shown that he will be persecuted if he is removed to Guatemala because he was compelled previously to aid a guerilla group. He fears retribution by people in his home town and by the guerillas. We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings \u201cto determine if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. We defer to the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the [BIA\u2019s] conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and that it be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">Because this is a forced-conscription case, Gutierrez had to show that there is a clear probability that he will be persecuted because of his political beliefs if he is removed to Guatemala. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The persecution must be \u201con account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Apart from Gutierrez\u2019s statements that he had resisted conscription by the guerillas because he did not want to be a \u201ccommunist assassin\u201d and that the army was the \u201cgood side,\u201d there is no evidence showing that Gutierrez had a political opinion, much less that he was or will be perseeut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>ed because of a political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 483,112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The facts in this case are similar to those in <em>Elias-Zacharias, </em>which was an asylum case. <em>See id. </em>at 478-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666-67 (5th Cir.2002) (the burden of persuasion is less stringent in an asylum case). In <em>Elias-Zacharias, </em>the Court held that the alien had not carried his burden of persuasion by showing that he adopted a neutral position with regard to the guerilla conflict in Guatemala. 502 U.S. at 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812. Because the evidence in the instant case does not compel a contrary conclusion, we uphold the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
