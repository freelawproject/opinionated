Arlen Beam, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b274-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">Defendant Robert Lee Thomas entered a conditional plea to being a Felon in Possession of a Firearm (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2)). He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, claiming that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">Under the clearly erroneous standard, we give \u201cspecial deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations when ruling on a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>137 F.3d 1094, 1110 (9th Cir.1998). Following an evidentiary hearing on Thomas\u2019 Motion to Suppress, the district court found that two of the three arresting officers credibly testified that Thomas was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights \u2014 the third officer did not remember one way or the other \u2014 and that the two defense witnesses were insufficiently credible to rebut the officers\u2019 testimony. Under the deferential standard accorded the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, we find that the district court did not err when it found that Thomas was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">Thomas also argues that, even if he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive them. We decline to address this issue. Thomas\u2019 motion to suppress certified to the district court that \u201cthe only issue before [it was] whether Thomas was apprized of his constitutional right not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>incriminate himself.\u201d Likewise, Thomas\u2019 written objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation failed to challenge the voluntariness of his <em>Miranda </em>waiver. Since the issue was not raised before either the magistrate judge or district judge, we decline to address it for the first time on appeal. \u201cIssues not presented to the district court cannot generally be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>52 F.3d 789, 791 (9th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Restrepo-Rua, </em>815 F.2d 1327, 1329 (9th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (\u201cJust as a failure to file a timely motion to suppress evidence constitutes a waiver, <em>so too does a failure to raise a particular ground in support of a motion to suppress. </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Moreover, even if we were to examine the voluntariness of Thomas\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>waiver, we would find that the district court\u2019s denial of Thomas\u2019 motion to suppress was proper. The uncontradicted testimony of the arresting and interrogating officer established that Thomas\u2019 waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Thomas was not coerced, nor was he incapacitated in such a way that would require a finding that he was not capable of making a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garibay, </em>143 F.3d 534, 536, 538 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b274-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. Thomas mistakenly argues that, if this Court finds that he failed to preserve the <em>Miranda </em>waiver issue, the issue is still reviewable for plain error. While this court reviews forfeited rights for plain error, waived rights are not reviewed. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir. 1997) (en banc). The failure to raise a particular ground in support of a motion to suppress is a waivable right. <em>Restrepo-Rua, </em>815 F.2d at 1329.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
