Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). In his complaint, Erwin asserted that various state and federal employees engaged in a racially motivated conspiracy that resulted in his state conviction and death sentence for the kidnaping and murder of Patrick Brooks (which has since been overturned) and federal convictions for various drug, weapon, and criminal enterprise convictions arising from the same activity. The district court concluded that Erwin\u2019s challenges to his state conviction were untimely and that his challenges to the federal conviction were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-21\">Erwin asserts that because he is an indigent prisoner, the district court erred in denying him leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) in the district court and on appeal. The district court granted Erwin IFP status in both instances. Although the court assessed an initial partial filing fee in both cases, such actions are authorized by statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-22\">Erwin asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for appointment of counsel. He has not shown extraordinary circumstances warranting such an appointment. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Erwin contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without serving the defendants and without allowing him an opportunity to amend his complaint. The district court was authorized to dismiss the complaint \u201cat any time\u201d if it determined that Erwin had failed to state a claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Moreover, Erwin has not established that his factual allegations could have been remedied through amendment, so the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the case without providing Erwin an opportunity to amend. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Erwin has not established that his federal convictions have been overturned or invalidated or that his challenges to those convictions would necessarily call into question the validity of his federal convictions. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 484-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Likewise, Erwin has not established that his challenges to his overturned state conviction were not barred by the applicable two-year limitations period. <em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (West 2004). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Erwin\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Erwin\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS Erwin\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of his appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous constitute two \u201cstrikes\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). If Erwin obtains three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Erwin has moved for appointment of counsel on appeal. Because he has not shown extraordinary circumstances warranting such an appointment, the motion is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer, </em>691 F.2d at 212. Erwin\u2019s motion for immediate release pending his appeal is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b888-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
