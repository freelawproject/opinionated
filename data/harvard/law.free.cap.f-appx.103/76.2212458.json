Holloway appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>action as barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>Dist. of Columbia Ct. of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). After <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see Charehenko v. City of Stillwater, </em>47 F.3d 981, 982-83 (8th Cir. 1995), we agree with the district court that it lacked jurisdiction, because Holloway\u2019s federal complaint raised constitutional challenges already decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court, albeit in a non-section 1983 action. <em>See Bechtold v. City of Rosemount, </em>104 F.3d 1062, 1065 (8th Cir.1997) (litigant cannot circumvent <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>by recasting lawsuit as \u00a7 1983 action). Holloway\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were also barred, because any grant of relief would require the district court to make conclusions directly contrary to the decision of the state supreme court. <em>See Lemonds v. St. Louis County, </em>222 F.3d 488, 492 (8th Cir.2000) <em>(Rooker-Feldman </em>bars indirect attempts to undermine state-court judgments); <em>Keene Corp. v. Cass, </em>908 F.2d 293, 297 (8th Cir.1990) <em>(Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to claims for declaratory and injunctive relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">.
