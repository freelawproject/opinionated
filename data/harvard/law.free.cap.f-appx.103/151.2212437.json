We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for an abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>cretion. <em>Watkins v. INS, </em>63 F.3d 844, 847 (9th Cir.1995). We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">McDulley contends that the BIA did not consider evidence that was contained in his motion to reopen indicating that his attorney timely filed a change of address form, EOIR-27, with the BIA. The BIA denied McDulley\u2019s motion to reopen after finding that there was no change of address form contained in the record. The decision of the BIA does not indicate that it considered the change of address form submitted with McDulley\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>at 848M:9 (holding that the BIA must consider all relevant evidence submitted with a motion to reopen). Therefore, we remand for the BIA to consider the form that was tendered by McDulley.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b185-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b186-6\">LEAVY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVu\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">I respectfully dissent. I would deny the petition because there is no evidence in the record that the change of address form contained in McDulley\u2019s motion to reopen was ever delivered to the BIA or the Department of Homeland Security before March 4, 2002, the date the BIA mailed notice of its decision to McDulley\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
