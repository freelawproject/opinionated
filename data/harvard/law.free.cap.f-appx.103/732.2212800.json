Dawson asserts the district court erred when it ruled his arrest was valid and denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>incident to the arrest. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its determination of a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\"><em>\u201cIf the </em>police have a valid arrest warrant for one person and they reasonably and in good faith arrest another, the Supreme Court has ruled that the arrest of the \u2018wrong person\u2019 is proper.\u201d <em>United States v. McEachern, </em>675 F.2d 618, 621 (4th Cir. 1982) (citing <em>Hill v. California, </em>401 U.S. 797, 802-04, 91 S.Ct. 1106, 28 L.Ed.2d 484 (1971)). When the legality of arrest is established, officers are entitled to conduct a search of the arrestee and inspect objects found on his person without a warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 622. Our review of the record convinces us that officers acted reasonably and in good faith when they arrested Dawson believing he was someone for whom they had a valid arrest warrant. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it denied Dawson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence found in the search of his person incident to arrest. We therefore affirm Dawson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
