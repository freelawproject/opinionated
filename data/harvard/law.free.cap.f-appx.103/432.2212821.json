At the hearing before the IJ, Shen testified that he fled China because of political persecution resulting from his participation in the 1989 student democracy movement, and that, if he were returned to China, he would face further persecution for his activities in 1989 and would also be persecuted under China\u2019s family-planning policy because he has fathered two children. The IJ found Shen to be not credible, citing Shen\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, inconsistencies and implausibilities in his testimony, and the lack of any corroborating documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">We defer to the IJ\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-07 (2d Cir.2003). Where a petitioner challenges the sufficiency of factual findings underlying an IJ\u2019s determination that the petitioner has failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, \u201cwe will reverse the immigration court\u2019s ruling only if \u2018no reasonable fact-finder could have faded to find ... past persecution or fear of future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). Furthermore, \u201cwe give \u2018particular deference to the credibility de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>terminations of the IJ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275 (quoting <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Upon review of the record, we hold that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Shen was not credible. The IJ identified several inconsistencies among Shen\u2019s testimony at the hearing, his testimony at an earlier asylum hearing, and his amended asylum application. These inconsistencies pertain to where Shen was born, whether he communicated with his wife after leaving China, the date and circumstances of a pro-democracy speech he gave, the date of his arrest, and the length of his detention. Observing Shen\u2019s demeanor and these inconsistencies, the IJ concluded that Shen \u201cmakes up his events as he goes along.\u201d Additionally, Shen had no documentation in support of any of the central facts of his account. In light of Shen\u2019s lack of credibility and the absence of corroboration of his claims, we hold that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that Shen failed to establish either past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution, as required to obtain asylum or withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">For the same reasons, the IJ correctly concluded that Shen has not \u201cestablish[ed] that it is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see generally Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 133-34 (2d Cir.2003). Shen is therefore not eligible for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"># <em>* </em>* <em>t'fi </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and found each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED and the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
