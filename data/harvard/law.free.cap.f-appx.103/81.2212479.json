We affirm Ambriz-Gonzalez\u2019s conviction, reverse his sentence, and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Ambriz-Gonzalez argues that the district court committed two errors by failing to suppress his incriminating statement. First, he alleges that his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was invalid because the Border Patrol provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings a mere three hours after a set of inconsistent administrative warnings and did not furnish a clarification. <em>See United States v. San Juan-Cruz, </em>314 F.3d 384, 387-89 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 471-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Second, Ambriz-Gonzalez argues that the district court improperly limited cross-examination and denied his right to confront a prosecution witness when it restricted defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the efficacy of a Border Patrol agent\u2019s translation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings from English into Spanish. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. amend. VI; <em>United States v. James, </em>139 F.3d 709, 713 (9th Cir.1998) (defining a three-part test to determine whether the exclusion of evidence violates a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Assuming without deciding that these two arguments have merit and the decisions constituted error, we conclude that the alleged errors were harmless. <em>See Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999). The government\u2019s case against Ambriz-Gonzalez was established by the information in the INS \u201cA\u201d File. The information in this file satisfied all of the elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Thus, any evidence improperly admitted was cumulative and the alleged errors were not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Ambriz-Gonzalez also contends that by scheduling trial more than 70 days after the filing of the indictment, the district court violated the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1), and the district court\u2019s own plan for implementing the Act. The record shows that on December 2, 2002, when the court proposed setting the trial for February 25, 2003, and a pretrial hearing for February 20, 2003, defense counsel agreed to the trial date and to hear the motions five days before trial. By assenting to the trial date and to leaving the motions pending, Ambriz-Gonzalez, in effect, agreed that the pending motions would create excludable time. <em>See United States v. Sutter, </em>340 F.3d 1022, 1033 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[Wjhere a defendant stipulates to facts underlying a district court\u2019s conclusion that time is excludable, the defendant cannot later challenge that finding.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 1687, 158 L.Ed.2d 379 (2004). Therefore, the exclusion from the speedy trial clock of the period during which pretrial motions were pending was proper under \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F). <em>See United States v. Hardeman, </em>206 F.3d 1320, 1322 (9th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (requiring \u201csome identifiable pending motion apparent from a review of the district court docket\u201d in order for \u201cthe automatic exclusion provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) to apply\u201d); <em>United States v. Aviles-Alvarez, </em>868 F.2d 1108,1111-12 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">Also, Ambriz-Gonzalez argues that the district court erred by denying him a one-point downward adjustment in his offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>level for his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). The government concedes this issue, and therefore, we reverse Ambriz-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing with one-point reduction in his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
