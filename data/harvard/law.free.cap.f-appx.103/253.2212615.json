We review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidence, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003), and we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Singh\u2019s confusion over the date that a family photograph, in which Singh himself was not pictured, was taken, led the IJ to conclude that Singh\u2019s father was still alive in India at a time after Singh testified that his father had been \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the police. This inference is not supported by the record. Because conjecture cannot substitute for substantial evidence, it cannot support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 912 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Additionally, Singh initially testified that his birth certificate, which he provided, was the same one he had seen when in India. When it was pointed out that the registration date was after Singh was already in the United States, he explained that his mother must have lost the original and sent a copy. This is a minor discrepancy that does not go to the heart of Singh\u2019s asylum claim, and thus, cannot support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir.2003). Similarly, the IJ\u2019s disbelief that Singh\u2019s mother could have gone to the same police station that had \u201cdisappeared\u201d Singh\u2019s father and was looking for Singh, to obtain a copy of his birth certificate, is improper speculation. <em>See Lopez-Reyes, </em>79 F.3d at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Finally, the IJ pointed to minor inconsistencies in Singh\u2019s testimony regarding specific dates; these also cannot support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Accordingly, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh\u2019s account lacked credibility and remand for further proceedings. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b288-14\">BYBEE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">I respectfully dissent. Under the substantial evidence standard, we must reverse only if no reasonable factfinder could have reached the decision the IJ reached on the record in this case. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). A reasonable factfinder could have disbelieved Singh\u2019s testimony, as the IJ did here. In particular, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that Singh\u2019s inconsistent testimony concerning the family photos Singh submitted raised doubts about his credibility. Based on the inconsistencies, a reasonable factfinder could question whether Singh\u2019s father was in fact alive after the date Singh claimed his father disappeared. This discrepancy would have gone to the heart of Singh\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>asylum claim because it calls into question whether Singh had a legitimate basis to fear persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">I would deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
