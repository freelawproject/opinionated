Under a ten-year lease between Kennedy Mall (landlord) and the Brown Group (tenant), the Brown Group had two opportunities to cancel the lease prior to its natural expiration date so long as it met several conditions enumerated in the lease. An additional provision in the lease said that if Brown Group opted to cancel the lease, it had to make a termination rent payment to Kennedy Mall \u201cconcurrently with\u201d its notice to cancel the lease. <em>Id. </em>At issue is whether this additional provision amounts to a condition precedent to cancelling the lease, which was not fully satisfied at the time of cancellation, or a separate payment provision, which is fully enforceable but which is not required to cancel the lease. The district court determined that full payment of the additional money was not a condition precedent to cancellation of the lease. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">On April 7, 1995, Kennedy Mall and the Brown Group entered into a ten-year retail lease, which contained the following termination provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-17\">\n<em>5Jf. Tenant\u2019s Cancellation Privilege</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ang\">Tenant is granted the right and privilege to cancel and terminate this Lease at the end of the third lease year (Tenant\u2019s \u201cFirst Cancellation Privilege\u201d) and at the end of the sixth lease year (Tenant\u2019s \u201cSecond Cancellation Privilege\u201d) by giving a written registered mail notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>its intention to do so after said third lease year or after said sixth lease year (as the case may be), provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">(a) Tenant is not in default of any of the terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease at that time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">(b) With respect to Tenant\u2019s First Cancellation Privilege, Tenant\u2019s gross sales, as defined in Clause 5 of this Lease, are less than $795,000.00 in each of the first three lease years, to be evidenced by a certification of a certified public accountant and Tenant\u2019s treasurer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-7\">(c) With respect to Tenant\u2019s Second Cancellation Privilege, Tenant\u2019s gross sales, as defined in Clause 5 of this Lease, are less than $927,500.00 in each of the fourth, fifth and sixth lease years, to be evidenced by a certification of a certified public accountant and Tenant\u2019s treasurer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-8\">(d) Tenant has continuously operated in the premises throughout the term of this Lease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-9\">(e) Tenant provides said written registered mail notice to Landlord within ninety (90) days after said third lease year or said sixth lease year, as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-10\">Provided Tenant has complied with subsections (a) through (e) above, this Lease shall be cancelled and terminated effective ninety (90) days after the written registered mail notice required in subsection (e) above is received by landlord. Tenant agrees that in the event it elects to cancel and terminate this Lease pursuant to this Clause 54, Tenant shall remit to Landlord, concurrently with its submission of the written registered mail notice referenced above, an amount equal to one hundred eighty (180) days Minimum Rent and Additional Rent otherwise payable under this Lease for the ensuing one hundred eighty (180) day period after the date of Tenant\u2019s written registered mail notice (in addition to the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent reserved in this Lease from the date of Tenant\u2019s notice through the cancellation date).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">JA 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">After the sixth year of the agreement, the Brown Group sought to terminate the lease. On September 21, 2001, it sent a letter to Kennedy Mall indicating that it was exercising its cancellation option under Clause 54 of the lease and enclosed a check for $25,673.00 \u201cas payment for the termination penalty set forth in [Clause 54].\u201d JA 19. As it turns out, the payment amount equaled the Minimum Rent for 180 days but did not include the 180 days of Additional Rent also due under Clause 54 or the \u201cMinimum Rent and Additional Rent reserved in [the] Lease from the date of Tenant\u2019s notice through the cancellation date.\u201d JA 137. The Brown Group acknowledges that it inadvertently failed to include the 180 days\u2019 Additional Rent in the payment submitted with its notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">On November 15, 2001, almost two months later, Kennedy Mall sent a letter to the Brown Group saying that the cancellation letter failed to terminate the lease because the $25,673.00 payment did not include all necessary payments \u2014 including the 180 days\u2019 Additional Rent and 90 days\u2019 Additional Rent and Minimum Rent \u2014 and explaining that the lease would remain in effect until the natural expiration date of June 30, 2005. Soon after receiving the letter, the Brown Group sent a $19,289.20 check to Kennedy Mall as payment for the 180 days\u2019 Additional Rent along with a letter dated November 30, 2001, which explained that the September 21, 2001 letter terminated the lease and which apologized</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>for the error in not submitting the full payment with the termination notice. In addition, the Brown Group continued to make monthly payments as ordinarily due under the lease which represented the \u201cMinimum Rent and Additional Rent reserved in [the] Lease\u201d from notice through cancellation. The last of these payments was sent on December 3, 2001. In other words, by December 3, 2001, Brown Group had paid for the 270 days of Additional and Minimum Rent required by Clause 54, and Kennedy Mall had accepted and deposited all of these payments. Because the Brown Group did not make the payments concurrently with its termination notice, however, Kennedy Mall notified Brown Group that it would treat the payments as future rents due under the lease, not as a cancellation payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">On November 29, 2001, Kennedy Mall filed a declaratory-judgment action in state court seeking a declaration that the Brown Group failed properly to terminate the lease. The Brown Group removed the complaint to federal court based on the diversity of the parties, after which each party moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Brown Group, holding that it permissibly and properly terminated the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment anew and accordingly apply the same summary-judgment standard that a district court applies. <em>See Duane Mgmt. Co. v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>29 F.3d 245, 248 (6th Cir.1994); Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. No factual disagreements cloud this dispute, and the parties agree that Ohio contract law governs it.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Under Ohio law, \u201c[t]he intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co., </em>31 Ohio St.3d 130, 509 N.E.2d 411, 413 (1987). \u201c[W]here the terms [of a] contract are clear and unambiguous,\u201d a court must respect the contract\u2019s language and \u201ccannot in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., </em>53 Ohio St.2d 241, 374 N.E.2d 146,150 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The language of this contractual provision leaves little room for interpretation. By its terms, Clause 54 says that the tenant may terminate the lease if it satisfies five enumerated conditions. \u201cTenant is granted the right and privilege,\u201d the lease says, \u201cto cancel and terminate this Lease ... provided\u201d it meets the requirements listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of the lease. JA 137. All agree that the Brown Group met each of these conditions at the time it sent the termination notice to Kennedy Mall. Immediately after these five paragraphs, the lease reiterates the consequences of satisfying them: \u201cProvided Tenant has complied with subsections (a) through (e) above, this Lease shall be cancelled and terminated ninety (90) days after the written registration mail notice required in subsection (e) above is received by Landlord.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the lease does not contain any other explicit termination preconditions and because the Brown Group satisfied the five preconditions that do exist, it permissibly terminated the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">It is not that simple, Kennedy Mall responds, in view of the next sentence of Clause 54: \u201cTenant agrees that in the event it elects to cancel and terminate this Lease pursuant to this Clause 54, Tenant shall remit to Landlord, <em>concurrently with </em>its submission of the written registered mail notice referenced above, an amount\u201d of rent money expressly described in the agreement. <em>Id. </em>.(emphasis added). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>knowledging that full payment is \u201cnot listed with the earlier conditions,\u201d Kennedy Mall argues that \u201cfull payment remained a condition\u201d of termination and that the Brown Group\u2019s failure to satisfy this requirement precluded early termination. Kennedy Mall Br. at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">This argument contains several flaws. First, the agreement explicitly lists five preconditions of early termination and just as explicitly does not make the payment obligation one of them. Second, the provision upon which Kennedy Mall relies appears <em>after </em>the following unqualified and mandatory language: \u201cProvided Tenant has complied with the subsections of (a) through (e) above, this Lease shall be can-celled and terminated.\u201d JA 137. Only then does the agreement refer to the payment obligations of early termination. While the agreement understandably demands that the tenant make these early-rent payments \u201cconcurrently with\u201d the termination notice, it does not make the payment obligation a precondition of a successful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In suggesting that the payment obligation must be treated as a termination precondition in order to make it effective, Kennedy Mall sets up a false dichotomy. That the payment provision is not a part of the termination requirements does not make it unenforceable or for that matter ineffective; it merely means that the enforcement of this provision (through injunctive or money-damages relief) stands apart from whether the five requirements of termination have been satisfied. In other words, had the Brown Group failed to make this payment (which, to repeat, did not happen here because the company promptly made the payment upon learning of its mistake), Kennedy Mall could have enforced this contract requirement \u2014 like any other contract requirement in the agreement \u2014 in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Nor can Kennedy Mall tenably argue that the failure to make the payment \u201cconcurrently with\u201d the termination notice establishes that one of the cancellation preconditions was not met \u2014 namely, that \u201cTenant is not in default of any of the terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease <em>at that time.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The \u201cat that time\u201d language refers to the time when the tenant sends the notice, not the time after the notice had been sent. As Kennedy Mall acknowledges, the Brown Group was not otherwise in default at the time it sent the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Kennedy Mall\u2019s reliance on <em>Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 376, 613 N.E.2d 183 (1993) does not alter this conclusion. In that case, parents entered into contracts with the school stating that they would pay for all books, tuition and supplies for the academic year. <em>Id. </em>at 185. Each contract contained a clause that released the parents from the agreement provided they cancelled their child\u2019s enrollment in writing before August 1 of the approaching school year. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Carney mailed a letter notifying the school of his decision to withdraw his son postmarked August 7. <em>Id. </em>at 186. The court held that because he did not comply with the August 1 deadline, he did not effectively cancel the contract and was liable for full tuition for the academic year. <em>Id. </em>at 187. Yet that clause, unlike the clause in this case, said that \u201c[ejnrollment ... may be cancelled in writing, without penalty ... prior to August 1. If enrollment is cancelled after August 1, parents ... are obligated to pay the full tuition, books and supplies charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185. In honoring the language of that clause, the Ohio Supreme Court in no way held or even suggested that courts should not honor the language of different clauses. Had Brown Group provided a cancellation notice after the 90-day window, we might well have a sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>tion akin to <em>Lake Ridge Academy. </em>. But that did not happen here, and there as a result any analogy between the two cases ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the opinion of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
