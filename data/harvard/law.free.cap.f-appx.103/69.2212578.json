Larson, </em>327 F.3d 762, 767 (8th Cir.2003), we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants. First, even if defendants knew inmates could be injured from using wood thicker than 1 inch in the drill press, this knowledge was insufficient to find defendants were deliberately indifferent to a serious issue of workplace safety. <em>See Stephens v. Johnson, </em>83 F.3d 198, 201 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Warren v. Missouri, </em>995 F.2d 130, 131 (8th Cir.1993). Second, even if Busch had to walk up many stairs before receiving medical attention, he admitted that he suffered no adverse consequences from this journey, and there is no evidence that his condition worsened because of the delay. <em>See Sherrer v. Stephens, </em>50 F.3d 496, 497 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (no liability for delay in medical treatment unless defendant ignored acute or escalating situation, or unless delay adversely affected prognosis). Third, the retaliation claim failed because evidence in the record shows that Busch lost his furniture factory job, some visitation privileges, and his housing assignment after he was found guilty of a conduct violation. <em>See Moore v. Plaster, </em>266 F.3d 928, 931 (8th Cir.2001) (prisoner\u2019s claim of retaliatory discipline fails if conduct violation is supported by some evidence that inmate actually committed rule violation), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1037, 122 S.Ct. 1797, 152 L.Ed.2d 655 (2002). We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s other rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\">. The Honorable Scott O.
