The parties consented to adjudication by a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Harris noticed an appeal from two orders issued by the magistrate judge: (1) an order refusing to reconsider a previous order denying leave to file an amended complaint, and (2) an order denying class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>The parties dispute whether this court enjoys jurisdiction. As a court of limited jurisdiction, this court has authority to hear appeals only from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, interlocutory decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, nonfinal judgments certified as final under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), or some other nonfinal order or judgment to which an exception applies. <em>See Briargrove Shopping Center Joint Venture v. Pilgrim Enter., Inc., </em>170 F.3d 536, 538 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The orders appealed from are not final decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, <em>see Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); <em>Click v. Abilene Nat. Bank, </em>822 F.2d 544, 545 (5th Cir.1987), and we can discern no basis for appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
