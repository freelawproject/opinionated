Yasin, and Osman M. Yasin petition for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) decision to deny their application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and their claim for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The Yasins argue that they are entitled to asylum and withholding of removal because they will be subjected to persecution and torture based on Mohammad Yasin\u2019s political beliefs if they are returned to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that the Yasins\u2019 asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). The Yasins\u2019 petition for review is thus DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>MISSED as to the claims concerning asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">We will uphold the factual finding that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms without opinion and essentially adopts the I J\u2019s decision, we review the I J\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">To be eligible for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution upon return. <em>Id. </em>at 306. To be eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT, an alien must demonstrate a likelihood of torture upon return. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002). The I J\u2019s decision that the Yasins had failed to demonstrate clear probability of persecution or a likelihood of torture upon their return to Pakistan is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Yasins\u2019 petition for review is DENIED as to their claims for withholding of removal under both the INA and the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The Yasins argue further that their case did not meet the BIA\u2019s requirements for issuance of an affirmance without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). Because the decision of the IJ was correct and does not raise any substantial factual or legal questions on app\u00e9al, the decision met the criteria for a summary affirmance pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
