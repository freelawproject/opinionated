She argues that the administrative judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u2019s\u201d) decision is not supported by substantial evidence and that the ALJ did not use the proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The ALJ found the Kishaun had severe impairments consisting of \u201camniotic band syndrome with absence of the tips of the right thumb, digits two, three and four of the right hand, and the right great toe; borderline to low average intellectual functioning, and receptive and expressive language disorder.\u201d The ALJ determined, however, that Kishaun was not disabled under the Social Security Act. The ALJ evaluated Kishaun\u2019s claim in accordance with the process set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a). The ALJ evaluated the effect of Kishaun\u2019s impairment, or combination of impairments, in each of six domains of function set forth in \u00a7 416.926a (b)(l)(i)(iv). In assessing the credibility of Kishaun\u2019s mother, Kiauna Penson, the ALJ failed to provide \u201cspecific reasons for the finding on credibility, supported by the evidence in the case record\u201d nor was the credibility determination \u201csufficiently specific to make clear to the individual and to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the individual\u2019s statements and the reasons for that weight\u201d as required by SSR 96-7p. 1996 WL 374186, *2 (S.S.A). For our review we must be given the reasons for this credibility finding and the significance of that finding on the disability resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">This case is REMANDED to the Appeals Council.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
