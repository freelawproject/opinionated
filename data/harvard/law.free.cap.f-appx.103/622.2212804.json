Revelles challenges the constitutionality of a blood draw conducted by Defendant Judy Graves, an employee of Defendant American Forensic Nurses (\u201cAFN\u201d). Graves drew Revelles\u2019s blood at the San Bernardino County jail shortly after Revelles had been arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. Revelles contends that Graves is not licensed to conduct blood draws under California law and that Graves\u2019s blood draw was an unreasonable search or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">Revelles filed a class action complaint in district court alleging violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and unfair business practices and battery under California law. In a series of orders, the district court dismissed with prejudice Revelles\u2019s claims against AFN\u2019s insurer, Chicago Insurance Company (\u201cCIC\u201d); denied class certification; granted summary judgment to the remaining defendants on Revelles\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim; and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>velles\u2019s remaining state law claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The district court dismissed with prejudice Revelles\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against CIC in the second amended complaint, and dismissed with prejudice Revelles\u2019s battery and California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claims against CIC in the third amended complaint. We review these dismissals de novo, and we may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Ves tar Dev. II, LLC v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>249 F.3d 958, 960 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Even if true, the allegations in Revelles\u2019s second amended complaint could not establish a sufficient causal nexus between CIC and Revelles\u2019s alleged constitutional injury. The requisite causal connection for a \u00a7 1983 claim may be established \u201cby some kind of direct personal participation in the deprivation\u201d or by conduct that \u201cset[s] in motion a series of acts by others which the actor knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Duffy, </em>588 F.2d 740, 743-744 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>see also Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 854 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting this language from Johnson). Because Revelles does not contend that CIC participated directly in Graves\u2019s blood draw, he must allege that CIC \u201cset[] in motion\u201d a series of events that led to the blood draw and that the deprivation of Revelles\u2019s constitutional violation was \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d to the insurance company. <em>Gini v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>40 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir.1994). Revelles\u2019s complaint includes neither of these allegations. At most, Revelles\u2019s complaint may be read to allege that CIC should have known that some of AFN\u2019s employees were not properly licensed, but this alleged violation of state law is not by itself a constitutional injury. <em>See Ove v. Gwinn, </em>264 F.3d 817, 825 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Revelles\u2019s battery claim against CIC also fails for lack of an adequately alleged causal link. California defines battery as a \u201cwillful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.\u201d CaLPenal Code \u00a7 242. In his third amended complaint, Revelles did not allege either that CIC used force against him or that CIC caused Graves to use force. Respondeat superior liability is available if there is a \u201ccausal nexus\u201d between an intentional tort and the defendant employee\u2019s work, <em>Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, </em>12 Cal.4th 291, 48 Cal. Rptr.2d 510, 907 P.2d 358, 361 (1995), and Revelles alleged in a conclusory fashion that Graves acted as CIC\u2019s employee. However, Revelles\u2019s contention that CIC employed Graves is inconsistent with his description of CIC as AFN\u2019s insurer, and Revelles\u2019s conclusory allegation of an employment relationship is insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss. <em>Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, </em>266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining that conclusory legal allegations and unwarranted inferences cannot defeat a motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Revelles contends that CIC\u2019s decision to provide insurance coverage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>AFN and AFN employees was an unfair business practice in light of California Insurance Code \u00a7 253. Section 253 provides that \u201cno insurer shall issue or amend contracts of insurance in [California] to provide coverage for the payment of any damages awarded to a person because of Section 1029.8 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d Section 1029.8(a) provides for treble, penalty damages when \u201c[a]ny unlicensed person ... causes injury or damage to another person as a result of providing goods or performing services for which a license is required\u201d under various provisions of California law. Section 1029.8 does not create its own cause of action. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1029.8(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Revelles contends that Graves provided services for which a license is required and that CIC\u2019s insurance contracts with Graves and AFN violate Insurance Code \u00a7 253 because they include coverage for the punitive damages to which Revelles may be entitled under Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 1029.8. We agree with the district court that these allegations fail to state an unfair business practices claim. Cal. Bus. &amp; ProfCode \u00a7 17200. CIC\u2019s decision to insure AFN and its employees is not itself an unfair business practice,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to the extent AFN\u2019s policy could be read to cover \u00a7 1029.8 damages, the California courts would likely hold any attempt by CIC to provide coverage for such damages to be ineffective as a matter of law. California courts have read a similar provision in Insurance Code \u00a7 553, which precludes insurance coverage for willful torts, as creating an automatic exclusion that is read into every insurance contract. <em>See Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Sheft, </em>989 F.2d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cCalifornia courts have consistently held that section 533 of the Insurance Code is a part of every insurance contract and is equivalent to an exclusionary clause in the contract itself.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Revelles argues that even if CIC\u2019s insurance policies cannot, as a matter of law, be read to cover \u00a7 1029.8 damages, CIC unfairly and fraudulently suggested otherwise by issuing the policies, and CIC\u2019s policies were a but-for cause of his injury because AFN would not have won the San Bernardino blood testing contract without proofs of insurance. The difficulty with this argument is that \u00a7 253 did not and could not preclude CIC from issuing insurance policies to AFN and its employees. As explained above, \u00a7 253 prohibits coverage for the additional damages provided for in \u00a7 1029.8; CIC may still provide other coverage to AFN and its employees. Thus, AFN\u2019s ability to secure and prove insurance coverage, and to win the County contract, did not turn on the purported availability of coverage for \u00a7 1029.8 damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Revelles contends that Graves\u2019s blood draw was an unreasonable search under the standards set out in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). The district court granted summary judgment on this \u00a7 1983 claim in favor of Graves; Fay Battiste Otto, AFN\u2019s principal shareholder; and the County of San Bernardino. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, and we may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Simo v. Union of Needletrades, Indus. &amp; Textile Employees, </em>322 F.3d 602, 609-10 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 224, 157 L.Ed.2d 134 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In <em>Schmerber, </em>the Supreme Court held that taking a blood sample for alcohol testing is a Fourth Amendment \u201csearch\u201d but that a warrant is not required for blood alcohol tests when: (1) the arresting police officer has probable cause to suspect the person arrested of drunk driving; (2) the officer reasonably believes he is \u201cconfronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threaten[s] the destruction of evidence;\u201d and (3) the procedures used to extract the arrested person\u2019s blood are \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 768, 770, 771, 86 S.Ct. 1826 (internal quotation marks omitted). Revelles does not contend that the blood draw in this case failed to comply with requirements one and two; his argument is directed only to <em>Schmerber\u2019s </em>reasonableness requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In <em>Schmerber </em>and <em>Winston v. Lee, </em>470 U.S. 753, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 84 L.Ed.2d 662 (1985), the Supreme Court considered the following factors relevant to the reasonableness inquiry: (1) \u201cthe extent of intrusion upon the individual\u2019s dignitary interests in personal privacy and bodily integrity!],]\u201d <em>Winston, </em>470 U.S. at 761, 105 S.Ct. 1611; (2) the risk of harm to the person tested, <em>id.; </em>and (3) the manner in which the medical procedure is performed and whether it is performed by trained medical personnel. <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 771, 86 S.Ct. 1826; <em>see also Ove, </em>264 F.3d at 824. We have described <em>Schmerber\u2019s </em>reasonableness standard as requiring that a blood draw not be \u201cconducted in an unnecessarily cruel, painful, or dangerous manner,\u201d <em>Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, </em>885 F.2d 1439, 1447 n. 7 (9th Cir.1989), and that it \u201cbe taken by trained medical personnel in accordance with accepted practices.\u201d <em>United States v. Chapel, </em>55 F.3d 1416, 1418 (9th Cir.1995) (en banc) (quoting the original panel opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">The extent of the intrusion on Revelles\u2019s dignitary interests was minimal in this case, as blood tests are \u201ca commonplace in these days of periodic physical examination!].]\u201d <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 771, 86 S.Ct. 1826; <em>see also Winston, </em>470 U.S. at 762, 105 S.Ct. 1611. Although Revelles testified that he takes anti-coagulant medications, which make it more difficult for him to stop bleeding after blood draws, Revelles chose a blood test rather than a breath or urine test. The Supreme Court considered the plaintiffs choice relevant in <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 771, 86 S.Ct. 1826 (\u201cPetitioner is not one of the few who on grounds of fear, concern for health, or religious scruple might prefer some other means of testing, such as the \u2018Breathalyzer\u2019 test petitioner refused.\u201d) (citation omitted). Graves was trained to conduct blood draws, had worked at a medical clinic where her responsibilities included blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>draws, and had conducted many successful blood draws before Revelles\u2019s blood test. Although Revelles\u2019s blood was drawn at the San Bernardino jail, Graves applied an antiseptic, and she testified that her practice is to be \u201cextremely cautious\u201d regarding sanitation, to sanitize her hands and to wear latex gloves. Neither Revelles nor the defendants submitted expert testimony regarding standard medical procedure for blood draws, but Graves testified that she follows a standard procedure she learned in school. Revelles testified that while Graves\u2019s was not the best blood draw he has had, it was also not the worst. This testimony indicates that Graves\u2019s draw fell within the range of Revelles\u2019s past experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Given these facts, we agree with the district court that Graves\u2019s blood draw satisfied <em>Schmerber\u2019s </em>reasonableness requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Revelles failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that could preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Revelles\u2019s remaining state law claims, <em>see Ove, </em>264 F.3d at 826, and because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal and summary judgment orders, we do not reach the issue of class certification. <em>See Carlson v. United AcademicsAAUP/AFT/APEA AFL-CIO, </em>265 F.3d 778, 787 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">For the <em>foregoing </em>reasons, the orders of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">. In its order denying class certification, the district court also dismissed with prejudice (1) Revelles's \u00a7 1983 claim against District Attorney Dennis Stout and Deputy District Attorney Dan Lough, and (2) Revelles\u2019s unfair business practices claim against the County. Revelles has waived any challenge to these rulings by failing to mention them in his opening brief. <em>See Stivers v. Pierce, </em>71 F.3d 732, 740 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-13\">. Section 17200 defines actionable unfair competition to include \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">. For example, Insurance Code \u00a7 253 and Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 1029.8 do not appear to prevent CIC from paying actual damages, as opposed to the additional treble damages provided for in \u00a7 1029.8. CIC may also contract to defend AFN employees from unlicensed services claims, even if CIC cannot indemnify AFN employees for \u00a7 1029.8 treble damages. <em>See Downey Venture v. LMI Ins. Co., </em>66 Cal.App.4th 478, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 142, 160 (1998) (insurance company required to defend insured against malicious prosecution charge even though insurer could not indemnify insured for resulting damages).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\">. Revelles could perhaps make a better case for this claim if he could allege that the award of the County\u2019s blood testing contract truly turned on CIC's allegedly misleading insurance polices-if, for example, the County had specifically required companies competing for the blood testing contract to obtain insurance coverage for \u00a7 1029.8 damages and if CIC had drafted the only contract that explicitly purported to cover those damages, thereby making AFN the contract winner. Revelles does not allege these facts, however, and they depend on the unreasonable assumption that the County made its choice among contrae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>tors on the basis of a proof of insurance coverage for \u00a7 1029.8 damages that is ineffective as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. Revelles\u2019s evidentiary challenge to Graves\u2019s testimony is without merit. Certified transcripts of judicial proceedings may properly be considered on summary judgment, <em>see United States v. O\u2019Connell, </em>890 F.2d 563, 567 (1st Cir.1989), and the district court did not accept Graves as an \"expert\u201d whose testimony would be subject to <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Revelles\u2019s Rule 56(f) argument also fails. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). Defendants did not \"rush\u201d into court with their summary judgment motion; they filed it on the last possible day allowed by the district court\u2019s scheduling order. To the extent the declaration filed by Revelles's attorney could be construed as a Rule 56(f) request, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying it. \u201cThe failure to conduct discovery diligently is grounds for the denial of a Rule 56(f) motion,\u201d <em>Pfingston v. Ronan Eng\u2019g Co., </em>284 F.3d 999, 1005 (9th Cir.2002), and Revelles did not provide any sufficient explanation for his delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
