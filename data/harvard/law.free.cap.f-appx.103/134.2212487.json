We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">Lucina\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-50 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">Lucina\u2019s challenge to the decision on the merits fails because, even assuming she was a credible witness, the IJ\u2019s determination that she failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that petitioner must show more than the existence of a generalized or random possibility of persecution in his native country and that claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ated family members continue to live in the country without incident); <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936-37 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that record did not compel the conclusion that threats constituted past persecution where the petitioner, a former intelligence officer, received death threats after testifying in court against subversives).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">By fading to qualify for asylum, Lucina necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245,1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure period will being to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b169-24\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
