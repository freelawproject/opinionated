We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Chang is ineligible for asylum because she failed to apply within one year of arriving in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Hakeem, v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, we have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under section 1231(b)(3) and under CAT. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999), and we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The IJ observed that Chang\u2019s answers to questions were frequently non-responsive and her demeanor in responding on cross-examination indicated that she was reciting from a script she had memorized. We give \u201cspecial deference\u201d to a credibility determination based on demeanor. <em>Id. </em>at 1151. We find no reason to discount the IJ\u2019s reliance on Chang\u2019s demeanor and conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Chang\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance without opinion violates due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b251-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
