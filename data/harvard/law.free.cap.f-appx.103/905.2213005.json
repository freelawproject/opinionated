The district court reversed the denial of supplemental security benefits, and the Commissioner appealed to this court. (No. 03-5158). Subsequently, the district court awarded the plaintiff attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), and the Commissioner brought the instant appeal from that order. This court has now reversed the award of benefits. <em>Webb v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>368 F.3d 629 (6th Cir.2004). In light of that decision, the Commissioner moves for summary reversal of the award of attorney fees. The plaintiff has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>Attorney fees may be awarded under the EAJA to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in an action against the United States \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). In view of this court\u2019s reversal of the district court and affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits, the plaintiff can not be considered a prevailing party. Further, the Commissioner\u2019s argument was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Therefore, the Commissioner\u2019s motion is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to the plaintiff hereby is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
