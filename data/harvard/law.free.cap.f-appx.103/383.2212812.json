Patrick appeals from the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirming a May 6, 1999 Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d) decision that determined that a March 1986 BVA decision denying her claim for dependency and indemnity compensation (\u201cDIC\u201d) benefits did not contain clear and unmistakable error. <em>Patrick v. Principi, </em>No. 99-916, 2002 WL 31770858 (Vet.App. Aug. 13, 2002). The court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 was rebutted. Accordingly, we <em>vacate </em>and <em>remand </em>for further consideration under the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-27\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-28\">Mrs. Patrick filed her DIC claim in February 1985, following the death of her vet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>eran-husband, James Curt\u00eds Patrick. Mr. Patrick served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1958 through May 1959. No preexisting abnormalities or diseases were noted during Mr. Patrick\u2019s medical examination upon entry into service. He was, however, diagnosed with \u201c[rjheumatic heart disease\u201d and \u201cmild congestive failure\u201d as a result of subsequent in-service medical examinations, and was discharged on May 1, 1959 with a notation of a physical disability that existed prior to service.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">From the time he was discharged from the service until shortly before his death in January 1985, Mr. Patrick unsuccessfully pursued a claim for service connection for rheumatic heart disease at the VA regional office (\u201cRO\u201d). An April 1985 RO decision and a March 1986 BVA decision on Mrs. Patrick\u2019s DIC claim likewise denied service connection for the cause of Mr. Patrick\u2019s death. According to the 1986 BVA decision, \u201cdata obtained for clinical purposes during service unequivocally established the preservice existence of the rheumatic heart disease\u201d and \u201cexamination of the clinical evidence in its entirety fails to demonstrate that the veteran\u2019s antecedent rheumatic heart disease worsened during\u201d his service. <em>In re Patrick, </em>No. 86-01 557, slip op. at 8 (Bd.Vet.App. Mar. 14, 1998). In May 1999, the BVA held that the March 1986 BVA decision did not contain clear and unmistakable error because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">there was ample evidence of record ... justifying the [BVA\u2019s] conclusion that the veteran\u2019s rheumatic heart disease did, in fact, preexist his active service. Moreover, ... there was more than adequate evidence showing that the veteran\u2019s preexisting heart disorder underwent no permanent increase in severity during his period of active service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>In re Patrick, </em>No. 97-33 006A, slip op. at 11 (Bd.Vet.App. May 6,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed. It noted that \u201cthe 1999 Board thoroughly considered the medical evidence of record and reasonably concluded that there was \u2018ample evidence\u2019 justifying the 1986 Board decision that the evidence \u2018unequivocally\u2019 rebutted the presumption of soundness.\u201d <em>Patrick, </em>No. 99-916, slip op. at 12. It further stated that \u201c[t]he presumption of aggravation applies only when the preservice disability increased in severity during service,\u201d and upheld as \u201cwell-supported by the record\u201d the 1999 BVA determination \u201cthat the 1986 Board correctly found no in-service increase in the severity of Mr. Patrick\u2019s disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Mrs. Patrick timely appealed, arguing that section 1111 requires clear and unmistakable evidence both that an injury or disease pre-existed service <em>and </em>that any such injury or disease was not aggravated by service. Accordingly, she contends, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 interpretation (as requiring only the former) was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Our jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292 to review decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims extends to the legal issue presented in this appeal. <em>See Szemraj v. Principi, </em>357 F.3d 1370, 1374-75 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc)). We review legal determinations of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims without deference. <em>Meeks v. West, </em>216 F.3d 1363,1366 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">This court recently examined the language and legislative history of section 1111, and concluded that where no preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, \u201cthe government must show clear and unmistakable evidence of both a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>preexisting condition and a lack of in-service aggravation to overcome the presumption of soundness for wartime service under\u201d that section. <em>Wagner v. Principi, </em>370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed.Cir.2004). However, we rejected the argument, advanced both by the appellant in <em>Wagner </em>and by Mrs. Patrick, that section 1111 in effect creates a presumption of aggravation. <em>Id. </em>at 1093-94. Thus, we held that \u201c[t]he government may show a lack of aggravation\u201d \u2014 and deny service-connection compensation \u2014 \u201cby establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any \u2018increase in disability [was] due to the natural progress of the\u2019 preexisting condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1096 (quoting 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153). .</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Mrs. Patrick does not challenge the determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that the 1999 BVA correctly found no clear and unmistakable error in the 1986 BVA finding that the government had demonstrated that Mr. Patrick\u2019s condition preexisted his service by clear and unmistakable evidence. To rebut the section 1111 presumption of soundness, however, the government must also show, by clear and unmistakable evidence, \u201cthat the preexisting disability was not aggravated during service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1097. Consequently, we remand for further consideration of Mrs. Patrick\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
