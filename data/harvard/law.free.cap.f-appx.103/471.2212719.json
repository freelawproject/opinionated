He argues that the district court\u2019s jury instructions were erroneous, and that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face or as applied to him. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Charles Stubbs and two others were charged with various crimes in connection with an October 7, 1999 bank robbery. The charges included: conspiracy, bank robbery, armed bank robbery, carrying and using a firearm during a crime of violence, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Stubbs was originally convicted of all charges, but we thereafter vacated his convictions and remanded for a new trial. <em>See United States v. Stubbs, </em>281 F.3d 109 (3d Cir.2002). On remand, Stubbs was once again convicted of all charges, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">He now challenges only his conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), as charged in Count V. In order to prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove (1) that Stubbs has a prior felony conviction for a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, (2) that he possessed a firearm, and (3) that the firearm had traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stubbs claims that the jury instruction was erroneous, and that the evidence was insufficient to establish the required nexus to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The government sought to establish the interstate commerce element through uncontested testimony that the guns in question were manufactured in Connecticut and California. The court charged the jury, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Members of the jury, I\u2019m sure that you understand, in arriving at your decision on the charges of felon in possession, you are permitted to use all the evidence and all the instructions that you have previously received, in addition to the following instruction which specifically applies to the crime of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon to be established, the government must prove all the elements beyond a reasonable doubt. That the defendant was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">That the defendant thereafter possessed a firearm; and that said firearm was possessed in or affecting interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">Stubbs first argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), because the government only proved the guns were manufactured outside of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stubbs contends that out-of-state manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ture before he possessed the guns in Pennsylvania is insufficient to establish the interstate commerce element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We review the \u201csufficiency of the evidence ... in a light most favorable to the Government following a jury verdict in its favor.\u201d <em>See United States v. Gambone, </em>314 F.3d 163, 169-70 (3d Cir.2003)(citing <em>United States v. Antico, </em>275 F.3d 245, 260 (3d Cir.2001) and <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)). \u201cWe must sustain the verdict if there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to uphold the jury\u2019s decision ... We do not weigh evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses in making this determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Beckett, </em>208 F.3d 140,151 (3d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Although Stubbs attempts to claim that out-of-state manufacture does not establish travel in interstate commerce, it is now well established that \u201cproof that the possessed firearm had previously traveled in interstate commerce [is] sufficient to satisfy the ... [ ] \u2018in commerce or affecting commerce\u2019 [ ] nexus requirement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gateward, </em>84 F.3d 670, 671 (3d Cir.1996) (citing <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Stubbs relies primarily upon <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3rd Cir.2001) for his argument to the contrary. There, we applied the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Scarborough </em>in holding \u201cproof ... that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce, at some point in the past, [is] sufficient to satisfy the interstate element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205. Stubbs claims that <em>Singletary </em>therefore requires direct or \u201cspecific testimonial evidence of, or stipulation to, the gun\u2019s post-manufacture travel through interstate commerce.\u201d (Brief at 30). However, this precise requirement exists nowhere in <em>Singletary. </em>It is uncontested that the two guns Stubbs possessed were manufactured in Connecticut and California and that Stubbs possessed them here in Pennsylvania. The district court correctly noted that they got here somehow and they could not have done so without traveling in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">Here, as in <em>Singletary, </em>the guns in question were manufactured outside of Pennsylvania. Therefore, the jury could conclude that the guns traveled in interstate commerce to get here. Indeed, the jury could conclude nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">Stubbs next argues that the jury instruction pertaining to \u00a7 922(g) was erroneous because the trial judge failed to define \u201cinterstate commerce.\u201d Stubbs reasons that the meaning of \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d is not commonly understood by lay persons. However, Stubbs did not object to the charge at trial, and we therefore review the instruction for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In order to prevail under a plain error analysis there has to be an \u201cerror,\u201d that is \u201cplain\u201d and \u201caffects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732. An error is plain when it is \u201cobvious\u201d or \u201cclear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734. To \u201caffect[] substantial rights\u201d the error must have \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Stubbs must demonstrate that any such error was prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 735. If Stubbs can satisfy his burden and establish plain error we have authority to correct it, \u201cbut [we are] not required to do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Even if we assume that the trial court erred by not defining \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d it is clear that the error was not prejudicial and therefore did not affect the outcome of this case. It is fair to assume that most people understand what is meant by \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d and it is impossible for us to conclude that defining that term for the jury would have altered the outcome given the place of manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Therefore, Stubbs can not establish plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">C. Constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Stubbs\u2019 final argument is a challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1). However, we have already rejected that claim in <em>Singletary, </em>268 F.3d at 205, and will not now revisit that ruling. <em>See, </em>3d Cir. I.O.P. 9.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-16\">. The relevant language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is: '</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">(g) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AB0\">(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</p>\n<p id=\"Aus\">to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ASW\">. There are two guns at issue in this case, They were manufactured in California and Connecticut. Stubbs argues that this only proves the place of manufacturer and not that they traveled in interstate commerce as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\">. They clearly did not undergo some kind of quantum state fluctuation and then materialize out of the ethers here in Pennsylvania without traversing the space between Pennsylvania and the states of manufacture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
