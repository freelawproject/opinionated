On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-24\">At sentencing, over Vann\u2019s objection, the district court added 3 levels to Vann\u2019s offense level for being a manager or supervisor of criminal activity involving 5 or more participants. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Vann\u2019s total offense level of 18 resulted in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 57-71 months. After granting the government\u2019s substantial-assistance downward-departure motion, the district court sentenced Vann to 36 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution. On appeal Vann argues that the district court erroneously applied the aggravating-role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-25\">We conclude that the issue is unreviewable, however, because Vann\u2019s departure sentence is below the applicable Guidelines range, with or without the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>64 F.3d 439, 441 (8th Cir.1995) (challenge to enhancement unreviewable where defendant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ceived sentence below applicable Guidelines range with or without enhancement); <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>26 F.3d 863, 864 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (challenge to enhancement unreviewable where sentence was downward departure from Guidelines range that would have resulted if defendant had prevailed); <em>United States v. Dutcher, </em>8 F.3d 11, 12-13 (8th Cir.1993) (extent of downward departure unreviewable regardless of district court\u2019s reasons for refraining from departing further; rejecting argument that allegedly erroneous Guidelines \u201cstarting point\u201d caused court to depart insufficiently).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-16\">. The Honorable Joseph F. Bataillon, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
