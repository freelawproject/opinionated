To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Fisseha fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-24\">We deny the petition for review. We also deny Fisseha\u2019s motion for a stay of voluntary departure nunc pro tunc. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 193, 2004 WL 1277041, at *10 (4th Cir. June 10, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
