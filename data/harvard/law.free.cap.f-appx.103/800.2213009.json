Long, Texas prisoner # 1001354, has filed a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b). By moving for IFP, Long is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-27\">Long does not address the district court\u2019s reason for dismissing his claims against C. Tony Wright, namely that Wright is not a state actor. He also presents no nonfrivolous issue for appeal with respect to his claim against Judge John Jackson. \u201c[LJitigants may not obtain review of state court actions by filing complaints about those actions in lower federal courts cast in the form of civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>suits.\u201d <em>Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 691 (5th Cir.1986). Moreover, the relief Long sought was in the nature of mandamus relief. Federal courts have no power to direct state judicial officials in the performance of their functions. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275,1276 (5th Cir.1973). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues. Long\u2019s motion for IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of Long\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Long that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
