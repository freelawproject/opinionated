Jones appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motions for change of venue and for reconsideration of its previous order dismissing Jones\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint for failure to state a claim. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the requested change of venue and reconsideration. <em>See Jones v. Lassiter, </em>No. CA-02-897-5-F (E.D.N.C. filed Aug. 6, 2003 &amp; entered Aug. 11, 2003). To the extent that Jones seeks to appeal the court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action, his notice of appeal is untimely. The court\u2019s order dismissing Jones\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was entered on its docket on June 26, 2003. Jones\u2019s notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on August 18, 2003, which was beyond the thirty-day appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Therefore, to the extent that Jones seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action, we dismiss his appeal as untimely. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
