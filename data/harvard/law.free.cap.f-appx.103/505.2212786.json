McCrae appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying as untimely his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We previously granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether remand is appropriate to determine when a duly diligent person would have discovered that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal after being asked to do so<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 116(4) (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall ... run from the latest of ... the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d). The Government has responded, and McCrae has replied. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 22(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-24\">Because the district court did not consider the timeliness of McCrae\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 H 6(4) and because the record does not disclose when McCrae could have discovered with due diligence that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the court to determine whether the \u00a7 2255 motion is timely under \u00a7 2255 H 6(4). We express no opinion on the outcome of this determination. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-25\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-21\"> We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the portion of the appeal in which McCrae challenged the district court's finding that his \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely under \u00a7 2255 116(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
