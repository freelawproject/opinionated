R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b221-23\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-24\">Harpreet Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissal of his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, grant the petition for review, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-25\">By contending that no adverse credibility determination was made, Singh\u2019s brief misstates the content of the BIA and IJ decisions. While this error bespeaks troubling neglect of the record by counsel, we retain discretion to review the issue of credibility \u201cbecause the government briefed it, and thus suffers no prejudice from Singh\u2019s failure to properly raise the issue.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152, 1157 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004). Reviewing the grounds supporting the adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, <em>see Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>658 (9th Cir.2003), we conclude that this standard is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We require specific explanations of why-adverse credibility grounds are significant. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir.2000). The IJ, whose findings the BIA adopted, did not adequately explain why Singh\u2019s trip to Thailand \u201cundercuts\u201d his credibility, particularly given Singh\u2019s plausible explanation. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 620 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Second, the IJ\u2019s reliance on the omission of treatment details in a corroborating letter by Singh\u2019s doctor was impermissible. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cAs the doctor\u2019s letter is not inconsistent with Singh\u2019s testimony, it cannot serve as the basis for the ... adverse credibility determination.\u201d). Similarly, the gurudwara letter\u2019s failure to mention Singh\u2019s first arrest is an inadequate basis for impugning his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Third, there is no inconsistency between Singh\u2019s father\u2019s affidavit, stating that the police \u201cdisposed of [Singh\u2019s uncle\u2019s] body,\u201d and Singh\u2019s testimony that his aunt found the body. <em>See id. </em>The omission of this detail from Singh\u2019s declaration is also \u201cinsufficient to uphold an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160,1167 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Fourth, the IJ\u2019s conjecture concerning what the police did with the uncle\u2019s body and whether Singh\u2019s parents would have been interrogated cannot constitute substantial evidence. <em>See Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 912 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Fifth, the IJ\u2019s disbelief of Singh\u2019s recounting of his first arrest does not support the credibility finding because Singh\u2019s explanation of why only some AISSF members were arrested is plausible. <em>See Chen, </em>362 F.3d at 620. Moreover, the IJ\u2019s reference to \u201cnormal police procedure\u201d is speculative, <em>see Lopez-Reyes, </em>79 F.3d at 912, and his attachment of significance to Singh\u2019s \u201cfirst indication] that he didn\u2019t know what had happened to the other three ... arrested with him\u201d appears to be based on a misapprehension of testimony that cannot detract from Singh\u2019s credibility. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 600 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Sixth, while we permit \u201cthe use of a country report to discredit a general assertion made by an applicant regarding the context in which his alleged persecution took place,\u201d the refuted assertion must go to the heart of a petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2001). Here, the IJ\u2019s reference to generalizations about Sikhs\u2019 standing in India is not sufficiently tailored to Singh\u2019s claim to uphold an adverse credibility finding against him. <em>See Shah, </em>220 F.3d at 1069 (proscribing reliance on \u201cdescriptions about the circumstances people like the applicant have faced, or will face, in their countries of origin\u201d for purposes of individualized adverse credibility determinations).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Finally, the IJ\u2019s requirement that Singh\u2019s uncle\u2019s death be corroborated was erroneous in the \u201cabsence of substantial evidence showing that such documentation was \u2018easily available.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1070 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s alternative conclusion that if Singh\u2019s testimony were credible it would have been sufficient to establish past persecution on account of imputed political opinion. We therefore remand this matter for further proceedings to determine whether, accepting Singh\u2019s testimony as credible and his establishment of past political persecution, he is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See He, </em>328 F.3d at 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b221-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
