We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">Singh contends that the IJ erred in its adverse credibility finding because his testimony was consistent and credible. Significant discrepancies in Singh\u2019s testimony that go to the heart of his asylum claim support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). Singh\u2019s failure to submit readily available corroborative evidence to buttress his testimony also bolsters the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-22\">By faffing to qualify for asylum, Singh necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez Santos v. INS, 332 </em>F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">Singh contends that the streamlining regulations violate due process and circumvent judicial review. This contention is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b333-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
