In reaching this result, the administrative law judge (ALJ) who had considered appellant\u2019s application relied upon the report of a consultative clinical psychologist, Dr. Francis Warman; the ALJ read the report as stating that appellant did not meet the criteria for a somatoform disorder. The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-23\">On appeal, we held that the ALJ\u2019s step 2 determination was not supported by substantial evidence because nothing in the record contradicted the diagnosis of a severe somatoform disorder. <em>Ramos v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Barnhart, </em>No. 02-1687, 2003 WL 1411959 (1st Cir. March 21, 2003) (per curiam). In particular, we pointed out that the ALJ had <em>misread </em>Dr. Warman\u2019s report. That is, Dr. Warman had opined that appellant did not meet all of the criteria for a <em>\u201csomatization\u201d </em>disorder, which is one <em>kind </em>of somatoform disorder. We therefore remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Appellant then filed an application for attorney\u2019s fees in the district court under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). This section provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party ... fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action ... brought by or against the United States ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d The district court decided that the government\u2019s position had been \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and denied appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision regarding substantial justification for abuse of discretion. <em>See Schock v. United States, </em>254 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2001). It is the government\u2019s burden to demonstrate that its position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d both during the agency proceedings and in the litigation following the action (or inaction) of the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Based on the following, we find that the denial of EAJA fees here was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">As the district court points out, appellant failed to clarify the definitions of somatoform and somatization disorders until the appeal of that court\u2019s decision affirming the denial of benefits. Indeed, until the prior appeal, appellant himself had used the terms \u201csomatoform\u201d and \u201csomatization\u201d interchangeably. Appellant also did not raise, until the prior appeal, the fact that the ALJ had misread Dr. War-man\u2019s report. Under these circumstances, we think that appellant\u2019s delay in raising crucial issues is relevant to the question whether the government\u2019s position was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Appellant\u2019s omissions contributed to the confusion about the nature of the various diagnoses he had received. Further, it was <em>appellant\u2019s </em>burden, at step 2, to demonstrate that his somatoform disorder was severe. Given this, it would be difficult to conclude that the government was unreasonable in failing to respond to arguments appellant never had raised. We therefore agree with the district court that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
