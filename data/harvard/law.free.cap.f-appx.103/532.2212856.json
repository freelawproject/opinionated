The district court dismissed Foster\u2019s complaint with prejudice as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Foster argues on appeal that the district court failed to conduct a <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181-82 (5th Cir.1985), hearing prior to its dismissal. Because Foster cannot show his complaint to be meritorious, the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint without further factual development. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992); <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9-10 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">Foster has failed to challenge the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal. Rather, he argues the merits of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, specifically, that the deprivation of his property violated his due process and various First Amendment rights and constituted cruel and unusual punishment and that the disciplinary proceeding was arbitrary. Foster also renews his argument that the prison denied him access to the grievance system by refusing to file two grievance complaints because he had attached inappropriate or excessive attachments. Foster cannot state a cognizable constitutional violation on this ground. <em>See Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1248-49 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Hernandez v. Estelle, </em>788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1986). Because Foster has failed to address the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal, he has effectively waived the only appealable issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">Foster\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">With the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous, Foster now has at least three strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996).
