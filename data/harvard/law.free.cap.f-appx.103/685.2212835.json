Sirois contends that this sentence, which exceeds the recommended range provided by the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cSentencing Guidelines\u201d), is plainly unreasonable and should be invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-22\">Defendant was sentenced by the district court as a second-time offender for violating the terms of his supervised release, by associating with a convicted felon. Although the Sentencing Guidelines recommend a sentencing range of 5 \u2014 11 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court, considering all the relevant factors, imposed a 12-month sentence, which is within the statutory maximum. It is well-established that a sentence exceeding the guidelines range is permitted as long as it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Wirth, </em>250 F.3d 165, 169 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1996). Under all the circumstances of this case, this sentence is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Pelensky, </em>129 F.3d 63, 69-71 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-23\">We have considered all of Defendant\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
