The IJ concluded that Singh was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal because he failed to meet his burden of credibly demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ, citing Singh\u2019s implausible testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding his arrest, his lack of knowledge of the Sikh religion, and a lack of documentary evidence regarding his kidney transplant and the dates of his arrival in the United States. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2), and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">We review the BIA\u2019s finding that Singh\u2019s testimony was not credible under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 595 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding. Singh was unable to answer simple questions regarding the basic tenets of his religion. He could not identify Sikh holy days, and when asked to name the gurus of the Sikh religion he was only able to name two of the ten. Singh\u2019s lack of knowledge of the Sikh religion was a \u201cspecific, cogent reason\u201d for disbelieving his testimony, <em>see Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002), and it went to the heart of his claim because it undermined his contention that he was persecuted on account of his religious beliefs. <em>See id. </em>The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b276-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-19\">.
