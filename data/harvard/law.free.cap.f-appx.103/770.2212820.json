The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>dently reviewed the record and conclude that Michau has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b804-17\"> Although the district court construed Michau\u2019s post-judgment motion as being filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), the motion was filed more than ten days after entry of the judgment denying his habeas corpus petition. Thus, the motion should have been construed as one under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 2 (4th Cir.1992) (distinguishing between Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) motions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
