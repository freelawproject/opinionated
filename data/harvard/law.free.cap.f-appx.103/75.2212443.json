In her complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>McDermott alleged that she was denied the rights secured to her by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by virtue of the Defendants\u2019 actions in connection with her arrest and subsequent prosecution on charges of obstructing a search and assault of an officer. She asserted a cause of action under \u00a7 1983, as well as various pendent state law claims. Having carefully reviewed the record and the applicable legal authorities, we find no error in the district court\u2019s disposition of this matter. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-26\">.
