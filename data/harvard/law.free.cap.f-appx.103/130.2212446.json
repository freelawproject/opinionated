We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>836 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003), as well as a determination that a petitioner is ineligible for relief under CAT, <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition <em>for </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. Singh\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the reason for his July 21,1995 arrest, and the focus of the subsequent police interrogation. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding based on demeanor. <em>See id. at </em>1151 (giving \u201cspecial deference\u201d to a credibility determination that is based on demeanor). Singh has not shown that the documentary evidence presented compelled a contrary conclusion in order to overcome the credibility determination. <em>See Malhi </em>336 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility <em>for </em>asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Singh\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance, without opinion, is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Because Singh failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to India, the IJ\u2019s properly denied Singh\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279,1284 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
