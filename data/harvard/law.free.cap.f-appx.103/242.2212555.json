We dismiss the petition for review in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal in Suhady\u2019s case under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); however, we lack jurisdiction over Suhady\u2019s asylum claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) deprives us of jurisdiction to review both an IJ\u2019s decision to pretermit an asylum petition on account of its not being filed within the one-year limitations period, as well as an IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that the time period was not tolled due to \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we dismiss Suhady\u2019s petition for review of the decision pretermitting his application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Where the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ without opinion, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e)(4) (now 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(7)), we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 855 (9th Cir.2003). We review denials of withholding of removal for substantial evidence. <em>Bellout v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 975, 977-78 (9th Cir.2004). We review claims of due process violations during removal proceedings de novo; thus, we will reverse the BIA decision if the proceeding was \u201cso fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Platero-Cortez v. INS, </em>804 F.2d 1127,1132 (9th Cir.1986)). The alien, however, must show prejudice\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the asserted violation. <em>See Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">Suhady was not denied due process on account of the IJ\u2019s decision not to recuse herself after pretermitting his asylum application but before hearing testimony regarding his remaining claims for relief. Suhady specifically relied on his asylum declaration and on evidence of the May 1998 riots in Indonesia to support his claim that \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d excused the untimely filing of his asylum application; as Suhady also asserted that the \u201criots evidence\u201d supported his claim for asylum itself, the IJ could not have given meaningful consideration to his claim of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d without at the same time opining on evidence adduced in support of his asylum application. The IJ concluded in her Memorandum Decision only that the riots did not \u201cmaterially affect [Suhady\u2019s] eligibility for asylum;\u201d she did not conclude that Suhady was ineligible for asylum as such, that he did not suffer persecution, or that he failed to demonstrate either a fear of future persecution or a likelihood thereof. As Suhady then received a full hearing on the merits of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>claim, wherein both he and his sister testified, he was not \u201cprevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>See Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The IJ\u2019s denial of Snhady\u2019s application for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. While Suhady did present evidence that the Chinese Christian minority in Indonesia is a \u201cdisfavored\u201d group subject to widespread discrimination, he did not establish that there exists a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution in the country, such that he could be eligible for withholding of removal without any showing of individualized harm. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(B); <em>see also Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1035 (9th Cir. 1999). Suhady\u2019s membership in a disfavored group notwithstanding, the evidence that he was harassed by groups of Muslim boys as a child, combined with the evidence that his church received a bomb threat after he had left for the United States, was insufficient to establish that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would suffer persecution upon return to Indonesia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2); <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
