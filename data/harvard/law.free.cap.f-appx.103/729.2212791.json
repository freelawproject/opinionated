Smith seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing as untimely his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). We dismiss the appeal in part for lack of jurisdiction because his notice of appeal filed January 6, 2004, was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Parties are accorded thirty days, after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr. </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket sheet on November 20, 2002. The notice of appeal was filed on January 6, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As Smith failed to file a timely notice of appeal or obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction with respect to this notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">Our review of the record, however, disclosed an earlier document entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d that the district court mistakenly construed as a motion to reconsider. That notice of appeal was filed on December 2, 2002, and is thus timely as to the November 20, 2002, order. We thus address that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Smith has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on Smith\u2019s appeal materials is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
