She challenges both the grounds of removal and the reasonableness of that action as a penalty for her misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Department removed Hillman for loafing, insubordination, and unauthorized absences. Initial Decision at 1. At the Board, Hillman \u201cstipulated prior to hearing that she had engaged in the conduct as specified in each of the agency\u2019s charges leading to her discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She contended that \u201cthe agency\u2019s hostile work environment rendered her physically and/or mentally unable to perform the duties of her position and caused the demonstrated conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. She also contended that the penalty of removal from her position was \u201ctoo severe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">After a hearing, the Board\u2019s administrative judge, in an initial decision which became final when the Board declined to review it, upheld the removal. The Board held that the Department\u2019s action was justified by Hillman\u2019s substantial misconduct. The Board found that the charge of loafing was supported by three separate incidents in which she was idle or engaged in personal tasks while on duty. <em>Id. </em>The Board also found that she was insubordinate when she disobeyed explicit directions not to read personal material while on duty and that she was absent without authorization during parts of four consecutive days in April 2002. <em>Id. </em>at 3. It further found that Hillman had not established that the agency had created a hostile work environment or that her misconduct resulted from her physical or mental illness. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Finally, the Board upheld the penalty of removal because it \u201csupports the efficiency of the service and was reasonable. Consequently, the agency\u2019s penalty of removal will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">A. The only finding related to her misconduct that Hillman challenges covers one of the four incidents of unauthorized absence; she contends that she properly submitted a leave slip that was denied without justification. We need not decide that issue, however, since the Board\u2019s findings that Hillman also was absent without leave on three other occasions, <em>id. </em>at 3, which she does not challenge, are sufficient to sustain the Board\u2019s determination that the agency proved the charge of unauthorized absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">B. Hillman apparently argues that her misconduct should be excused because it was occasioned by mental distress caused by a hostile work environment. At the hearing, Hillman offered only her own testimony to support these allegations; she alleged that coworkers had stopped communicating with her and that her supervisors watched her closely and prevented her from lunching in the offices of certain coworkers. As the Board properly concluded, this evidence fell far short of establishing that the agency created a hostile work environment. (In her brief, Hill-man also refers to reprimands she received for watching television at her workstation and for lunching in the offices of coworkers despite a warning not to do so, and to her supervisor\u2019s denial of her requested leave. Since she did not rely on those allegations before the Board, they are not properly before us.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Hillman further alleges that her mental health problems, which the hostile work environment further exacerbated, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the actual cause of her misconduct. As the Board noted, it was Hillman\u2019s burden to establish the affirmative defense of disability discrimination by preponderant evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. At the hearing, Hillman stated that she was not alleging disability discrimination; the Board determined that Hillman had \u201ceffectively withdrawn\u201d that defense. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In her brief to this court, Hillman attempts to revive this argument. Even if we were to reach this contention despite Hillman\u2019s waiver, she could not prevail on it. She alleges in her brief that she made it \u201cperfectly clear to someone ... in her office that she was under psychiatry [sic] care\u201d before her misconduct occurred. Pet. Br. at 3. The \u201csomeone\u201d was Mima Maletesta, Hillman\u2019s coworker. The relevant statute, however, provides that \u201cuntil the employer is made aware of the disability, the duty to accommodate does not arise.\u201d <em>Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms v. Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, 95 F.3d 1102, 1107 (Fed. </em>Cir.1996) (addressing the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cDisabilities Act\u201d)); <em>see also id. </em>at 1106 (noting that under the Disabilities Act, failing to accommodate an employee with a known disability is tantamount to discrimination); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a) (2000) (permitting employees to raise the defense of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act before the Board); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(g) (importing the substantive standards of the Disabilities Act to evaluate complaints under the Rehabilitation Act). Because Hillman never disclosed her mental health problems to a supervisor, <em>see </em>Initial Decision at 4-5, her discrimination claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Finally, Hillman contends that the penalty of discharge was excessive in light of her transgressions. An agency has broad discretion in selecting the penalty, and our review of the penalty is limited to determining whether the agency abused its discretion. <em>Mazares v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>302 F.3d 1382, 1386 (Fed.Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 960, 123 S.Ct. 1748, 155 L.Ed.2d 511 (2003). The Board found that the agency fully evaluated the relevant factors. It noted that Hillman had been disciplined three times in the prior five months and concluded that the penalty was reasonable. Initial Decision at 6-8. We have no basis to disturb that conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
