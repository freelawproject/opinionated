We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review a denial of asylum and withholding of removal for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Ambachew\u2019s inconsistent testimony about whether or not he ceased all political activities after his second arrest by the Ethiopian police went to the heart of his asylum and withholding claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Ambachew waived all contentions pertaining to the denial of his motion to reopen because he failed to challenge the BIA\u2019s denial in his petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cIssues raised in a brief that are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Because a copy of the administrative record has already been filed, Ambachew\u2019s \u201cMotion for Leave to File Excerpt of Record in Two Volumes\u201d is denied as moot. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>cf. Gomez-Vigil v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.1993) (denying a motion to consider evidence outside the administrative record).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b352-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
