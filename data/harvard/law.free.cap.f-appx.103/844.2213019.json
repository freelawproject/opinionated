INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 395-98, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Consequently, we have jurisdiction to review only the issue whether the BIA abused its discretion in that regard. <em>See Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 F.2d 1136,1141 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Calderon has not briefed the propriety of the BIA\u2019s ruling that her second request to reopen the immigration proceedings was an impermissible multiple motion, and, therefore, its review is waived. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). With respect to Calderon\u2019s request to the BIA for reconsideration of its summary affirmance of the denial of her motion to reopen, she has failed to show that the BIA made an error of either fact or law on the record before it. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(l)(2003); <em>Osuchukwu, </em>744 F.2d at 1143. Consequently, the denial of the request for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
