The district court sentenced Carter to 7 months in prison, followed by a 28-day residential substance-abuse-treatment program, and then 24 months additional supervised release. For the first time on appeal, Carter argues the district court was not authorized to impose the additional supervised release because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) was enacted after he committed the offenses underlying his original convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tion. We conclude the district court did not commit plain error in ordering supervised release because while section 3583(h) does not apply retroactively to Carter\u2019s case, at the time of his offense 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) authorized the court to impose the challenged sentence. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 702, 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). We thus affirm the judgment of the district court, and we also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-36\"> The Honorable Robert T.
