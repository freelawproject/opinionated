See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b753-26\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b753-27\">Solomon Gebremeskel, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-28\">In his petition for review, Gebremeskel challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. </em>478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Gebremeskel fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Gebremeskel\u2019s request for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Gebremeskel fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We also find that Gebremeskel fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). We find that Gebremeskel fails to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
