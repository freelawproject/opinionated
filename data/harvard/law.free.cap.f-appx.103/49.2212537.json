Baxter appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse entry of judgment and denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion after a bench trial in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">We conclude that the district court properly rejected Baxter\u2019s conditions-of-confinement claims. <em>See Estate of Davis v. Delo, </em>115 F.3d 1388, 1393-94 (8th Cir. 1997) (standard of review). The district court was presented with testimony that (1) Baxter was detained in an 8' by 10' cell, but had 24-hour access to a larger day room; (2) Baxter was allowed outside for doctor visits, haircuts, and court appearances; (3) FCJ did not allow visitors inside the cell blocks because there were not enough officers; (4) Baxter\u2019s attorney, who had visited FCJ, had not seen roaches or mice, or perceived unsanitary smells from within the facility; (5) FCJ sprayed regularly for bugs, and had broken toilets repaired within two to three days; and (6) Baxter was never denied access to cleaning supplies. <em>See Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 539-40, 546, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (if particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to governmental objective, such as maintaining order, it does not, without more, amount to punishment implicating Due Process Clause); <em>Smith v. Copeland, </em>87 F.3d 265, 268-69 (8th Cir.1996) (finding no violation where pretrial detainee was subjected to overflowed toilet in his cell for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>4 days; analysis of confinement conditions must be based on totality of circumstances and, to prevail, inmate must show officers were deliberately indifferent to risk of harm posed by conditions); <em>cf. Wishon v. Gammon, </em>978 F.2d 446, 448-49 (8th Cir. 1992) (limiting inmate\u2019s out-of-cell recreation time to 45 minutes per week was not unconstitutional where prison records showed inmate had not used all available recreation time, had opportunity to exercise in his cell, and had other opportunities to be out of his cell); <em>Green v. Ferrell, </em>801 F.2d 765, 771-72 (5th Cir.1986) (inmates had sufficient recreational opportunities because they were detained in 63 square feet cell and had access to larger day room for 5 hours each day).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Baxter failed to establish that unsanitary jail conditions caused the lung infection from which he suffered while detained. Baxter\u2019s physician testified that he treated Baxter for a similar lung condition before he was detained, and that he could not attribute the cause of Baxter\u2019s infection while in jail to insalubrious conditions at the jail. We also conclude the district court properly rejected Baxter\u2019s medical-care claim, based on the lack of evidence that defendants denied or delayed Baxter access to medical care or intentionally interfered with his doctor\u2019s prescribed treatment. As to the delay in taking Baxter to the hospital on one particular evening, we note the \u201cnight shift lady\u201d involved in that incident is not a defendant. <em>See Estate of Rosenberg v. Crandall, </em>56 F.3d 35, 37 (8th Cir.1995) (in actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \u201c[defendants are liable for their personal acts only\u201d). Baxter\u2019s court-access claim was also properly rejected given the undisputed testimony of Baxter\u2019s attorney that he was never denied access to Baxter. <em>See Quami v. Minnehaha County Jail, </em>821 F.2d 522, 523 (8th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (detainee was afforded meaningful access to courts because he had regular access to his attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Baxter\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Innovative Home Health Care, Inc. v. P.T.-O.T. Assocs. of the Black Hills, </em>141 F.3d 1284, 1286 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review). Baxter\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\">. The Honorable Henry L. Jones, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
