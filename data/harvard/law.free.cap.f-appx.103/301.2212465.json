Because the transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir. 1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-21\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Rojas\u2019s subjective fear of future persecution is not well-founded because he can safely relocate within Peru. <em>Cf. Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, Rojas\u2019s subjective fear is unreasonable in light of changed country conditions. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 1000-01 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Rojas failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation. <em>See AlHarbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">Rojas\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlining decision denied him due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir. 2003). We need not consider separately whether the BIA erred by streamlining Rojas\u2019s case because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Rojas\u2019s application for relief. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that the merits determination and decision to streamline collapse into one another).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">We have considered Rojas\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-24\">Rojas\u2019s renewed motion to remand this case to the BIA is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-25\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Rojas\u2019s period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of voluntary departure will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b335-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
