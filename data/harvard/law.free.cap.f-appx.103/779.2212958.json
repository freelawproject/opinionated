For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Araia asserts that she established her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Araia fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Araia seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Additionally, we uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of Araia\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for \u2022withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Araia fails to show she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
