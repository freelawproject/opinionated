Before sentencing, the government alerted Mason and the district court to the existence of what it contended were three prior felony drug convictions, triggering mandatory life imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Specifically, in 1984 Mason had been convicted in Illinois of two counts of unlawful delivery of marijuana, <em>see </em>720 ILCS 550/5, for which he served two years of probation. The marijuana convictions were then discharged under a first-offender provision of Illinois\u2019 Cannabis Control Act, <em>see </em>720 ILCS 550/10, which provides that a discharge and dismissal after a sentence of probation \u201cis not a conviction for purposes of disqualification or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 550/10(g). Mason also had one felony conviction for possessing methamphetamine chemicals. <em>See </em>720 ILCS 570/401. Based on these convictions, the district court sentenced Mason to life imprisonment followed (if necessary) by 10 years of supervised release, and imposed a $100 special assessment. Mason appeals, but his appointed counsel moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that Mason\u2019s appeal is frivolous. Counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, so we limit our review to the potential issue identified in the brief. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam). We have also reviewed Mason\u2019s response filed under Circuit Rule 51(b), but it does not propose any additional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">As counsel notes, in his plea agreement Mason waived his right to appeal his conviction or sentence (if within the statutory limits) on any ground save one: he reserved only the right to argue on appeal that his prior Illinois convictions could not be used to enhance his sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Accordingly, counsel identifies one potential argument that Mason could make: because Mason\u2019s two felony marijuana convictions were ultimately discharged, they are not prior \u201cconvictions\u201d that may be used to enhance Mason\u2019s sentence. But this argument would be frivolous because we have previously held that federal rather than state law defines what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>constitutes a conviction for purposes of the indistinguishable (for Mason\u2019s purposes) enhancement under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). <em>See United States v. Gomez, </em>24 F.3d 924, 930 (7th Cir.1994). Thus, the fact that Illinois may have discharged Mason\u2019s felony marijuana convictions is irrelevant to whether they operate as \u201cprior felony drug offenses\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Graham, </em>315 F.3d 777, 783 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Gomez, </em>24 F.3d at 930; <em>see also Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 115, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983) (\u201c[E]xpunction [under state law] does not alter the legality of the previous conviction and does not signify that the defendant was innocent of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal. We also DENY Mason\u2019s motion \u201cfor the request of court records and trial transcripts\u201d without prejudice to renewal in the district court. Mason explains that he wants the record to prepare a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. As such, the motion should be directed to the district court, where the record will be returned shortly. We remind Mason, however, that in his plea agreement he expressly waived his right to file a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
