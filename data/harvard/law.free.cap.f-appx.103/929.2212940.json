Wittwer appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of her application for disability insurance benefits following a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) and the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of her request for review. We have reviewed the record <em>de novo </em>and find that the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>See Harris v. Barnhart, </em>356 F.3d 926, 928 (8th Cir.2004). The ALJ did not err in failing to discuss or consider Wittwer\u2019s obesity because she did not allege obesity as an impairment and was not obese during the relevant period. Furthermore, the ALJ properly analyzed Wittwer\u2019s chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, carefully considered all the medical evidence in the record regarding Wittwer\u2019s residual functional capacity, and did not err in finding that her subjective complaints were not entirely credible. We find Wittwer\u2019s other claims of error to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-23\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-19\">. The Honorable H. David Young, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
