He argues that at least one of the court\u2019s grounds for departure was clearly erroneous, and that in any event, the district court failed to set forth why his record is significantly more serious than that of others in Criminal History Category VI. <em>See United States v. Carrillo-Alvarez, </em>3 F.3d 316, 323 \u2014 25 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Ranger-Crouchet first asserts that there is no basis in the record to suggest that, \u201c[djespite the serious nature of the assaults, all of them were pled down to a misdemeanor level not fully taking into account the seriousness of the offenses.\u201d We must \u201caccept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The district court\u2019s \u201cpled down\u201d finding was apparently drawn from an almost-verbatim statement in the probation department\u2019s Sentencing Recommendation justification. However, other than this lone, unsupported conclusion, the record reveals no evidence indicating that Ranger-Crouchet ever pled any felony assault charges down to a misdemeanor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> much less that he pled \u201call of them\u201d down.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Indeed, the Presentence Report itself suggests the contrary, listing several misdemeanor assault \u201cCharge[sj\u201d against Ranger-Crouchet. This supports his contention, both on appeal and before the district court, that state prosecutors evaluated each of these crimes and decided to charge them as misdemeanors in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">A factual finding is necessarily clearly erroneous when the record does not support it. <em>In re Rifino, </em>245 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir.2001). As a result, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Ranger-Crouchet pled down all of his assault convictions cannot stand. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">We decline to consider any further challenges to the district court\u2019s sentence. Rather, in light of this factual error, \u201ca remand is appropriate\u201d because we simply cannot conclude, \u201con the record as a whole, that the ... error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). In other words, it is best left to the district court to revisit its upward departure without reference to the \u201cpled down\u201d finding, and determine whether a departure continues to be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\">. We note that on a single occasion, state prosecutors appear to have dismissed two misdemeanor assault charges when RangerCrouchet pled guilty to a third assault charge, reckless endangerment, resisting arrest, and driving with a suspended license.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
