We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Flores contends that the BIA\u2019s affirmance without opinion of the IJ\u2019s decision fails to comport with the requirements of due process. This contention is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Flores\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b139-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
