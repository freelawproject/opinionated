We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Because the numerous inconsistencies in Singh\u2019s testimony relate to the circumstances of his persecution in India, they go to the heart of his asylum claim, and substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of that claim. <em>See id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir.2001). Singh also failed to establish eligibility for relief under CAT because he did not show that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured if returned to India. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b357-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
