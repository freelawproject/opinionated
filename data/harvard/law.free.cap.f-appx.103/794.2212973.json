We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Additionally, we conclude Bula Bula\u2019s claims that the Board\u2019s new streamlining regulations, pursuant to which his appeal was decided by a single Board member, were impermissibly retroactive, inconsistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act, and in violation of his rights under the Due Process Clause are foreclosed by <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004), in which we concluded to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
