For the following reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>district court and GRANT summary judgment in favor of Guzzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">I. Guzzo is a Medicare beneficiary who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999. His physicians prescribed cryosurgical ablation (\u201ccryosurgery\u201d), which was performed successfully on March 30, 1999. The question before us is whether Guzzo was legally entitled to Medicare reimbursement for his cryosurgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II. The Medicare statute authorizes coverage for numerous medical treatments and health services. See, <em>e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395d. 1395k-m. However, an exclusion from coverage is carved out \u201cfor items and services ... not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In 1997, the Secretary issued National Coverage Decision 35-96 (\u201cNCD 35-96\u201d), which prohibited reimbursement for cryosurgery, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">Cryosurgery of the prostate gland ... destroys prostate tissue by applying extremely cold temperatures in order to reduce the size of the prostate gland. The evidence is not yet sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure. Therefore, cryosurgery of the prostate cannot be considered reasonable and necessary under [the Medicare statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">In subsequent years, evidence of cryosurgery\u2019s safety and effectiveness accumulated, and the Medicare administration recognized the error of NCD 35-96. Accordingly, on February 1, 1999 \u2014 approximately two months before Guzzo underwent his surgery \u2014 the Department of Health and Human Services issued a \u201cDecision Memorandum\u201d approving cryosurgery for clinically localized prostate cancer. The Decision Memorandum stated that: \u201cCryosurgery is safe, effective, as well as medically necessary and appropriate in certain patent populations____ It has demonstrated effectiveness through an absolute analysis as well as through a comparative analysis.\u201d The memorandum makes clear that its purpose is to \u201c[approve coverage of cryosurgery] as a primary treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer.\u201d The memorandum also states that NCD 35-96 \u201cwill be modified to reflect this change in policy,\u201d meaning that the NCD\u2019s prohibition of coverage for cryosurgery is lifted by force of the Decision Memorandum, and the NCD itself would be amended to reflect that.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Guzzo contends that he is entitled to reimbursement for the cryosurgery because the Decision Memorandum, issued two months before his surgery, deemed the procedure \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d for the treatment of prostate cancer. The Secretary counters that the Decisional Memorandum did not make coverage effective as of February 1,1999, because the Memorandum stated that various administrative steps \u2014 most of them relating to billing and claims processing \u2014 would have to be complete before coverage for cryosurgery would be effective. (A short time later, the Secretary announced that cryosurgery coverage would be effective beginning July 1, 1999). As such, the Secretary argues, NCD 35-96 prohibiting cryosurgery coverage was still in effect at the time of Guzzo\u2019s surgery in March 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">In short, Guzzo underwent cryosurgery approximately two months after the Secretary deemed the procedure \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d in a Decision Memorandum, but approximately three months before the date specified by the Secretary when an administrative infrastructure would be ready to issue reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The statute at issue in this case, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(l)(A) makes clear that the legal question before us is one of entitlement, and that entitlement to reimbursement is triggered when the Government announces that a medical procedure is \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d Here, that event occurred on February 1, 1999, when the Secretary issued a Decisional Memorandum deeming cryosurgery \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for the treatment of prostate cancer. The language and very title of the memorandum leave no doubt that the memorandum is the Government\u2019s pronouncement that cryosurgery is \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d Although the memorandum indicates that an administrative infrastructure designed to handle cryosurgery claims and billing still had to be established, the \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d determination was effective as of February 1, 1999. Accordingly, we hold that because the Secretary had declared cryosurgery \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for the treatment of prostate cancer two months before Guzzo\u2019s surgery, Guzzo is entitled to reimbursement. The Secretary might have been entitled to delay reimbursement until the administrative claims-processing system was in place, but the Secretary\u2019s denial of Guzzo\u2019s claim altogether contravened the Medicare statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We add that we are not unmindful of the Department\u2019s interest in ensuring the efficient processing of claims once a new procedure is approved. But the Department appears to have changed its practices in response to the instant case. At oral argument, the Government stated that it no longer titles these memoranda \u201cdecisional,\u201d but rather, refers to them-as \u201canalytical\u201d documents. Moreover, whereas the February 1 Decisional Memorandum has the language and force of an enacting document, the Department\u2019s new memoranda make clear that any such pronouncements about changes in the status of a procedure are merely statements of intent, thereby allowing the Department to choose a date on which a formal pronouncement is made about the procedure\u2019s reasonableness or necessity, and to synchronize that with the inauguration of an administrative scheme to process claims that would then flow from the procedure\u2019s new, covered status. [2] III. Guzzo also requests attorney\u2019s fees for having to litigate the Secretary\u2019s wrongful denial of benefits. As the Secretary points out, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), Plaintiff is only entitled to fees and costs if the Court would find that the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified. The Secretary\u2019s position is substantially justified if it is \u201cjustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d Jan<em>kovick v. Bowen, </em>868 F.2d 867, 869 (6th Cir.1989)(quoting <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)). \u201c[A] position can be justified even though it is not correct ... it can be substantially (i.e., for the most part) justified if a reasonable person could think it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Sullivan, </em>950 F.2d 492, 497 (7th Cir.l991)(quoting <em>Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 566 n. 2,108 S.Ct. 2541).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The Secretary argues that his decision to deny Guzzo benefits was substantially justified based his reliance on NCD 35-96. The Secretary quotes <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 617, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984), \u201c[t]he Secretary\u2019s decision as to whether a particular medical service is \u2018reasonable and necessary\u2019 and the means by which she implements her decision, whether by promulgating a generally applicable rule or by allowing individual adjudication, are clearly discretionary decisions.\u201d Plaintiff counters that the Secretary\u2019s position was not substantially justified, because the Secretary denied payment for coverage that the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>himself acknowledges \u2014 by virtue of the February 1, 1999 Decisional Memorandum \u2014 was reasonable and necessary. Plaintiff argues that the Secretary knows that he is not entitled to create his own exceptions to mandated coverage, based on administrative convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Court finds in this instance that the Secretary\u2019s position was not substantially justified, and that Guzzo is therefore entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The Secretary relied on an NCD that he had already announced was no longer correct. The Secretary\u2019s announcement, that predated Guzzo\u2019s surgery, clearly indicates that such surgery was reasonable and necessary. To deny coverage for a service that is designated reasonable on the basis of an outdated rule is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">IV. For the reasons set forth above, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and award Guzzo reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, to be determined by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b641-7\">COOK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AeL\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">I would affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s opinion. The majority reaches its well-intentioned conclusion in this case without reconciling its departure from the national coverage decision (NCD) that mandated denial of Guzzo\u2019s claim, with the governing statutory and regulatory framework of the Medicare Act. The majority\u2019s opinion instead accords force of law to a \u201cDecision Memorandum\u201d that forecasted a likely change in the controlling NCD, though Guzzo\u2019s ineligibility was fixed by the NCD in effect at the time of his surgery.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
