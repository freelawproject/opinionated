We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Petitioners contend that they would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if returned to Mexico, but do not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that \u201cnone of them has a qualifying relative for whom they can establish ... [such] hardship.\u201d Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), Petitioners are therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Petitioners also challenge, on constitutional grounds, the exclusion of Mexicans from the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act. This contention is foreclosed by <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 517 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Petitioners\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
