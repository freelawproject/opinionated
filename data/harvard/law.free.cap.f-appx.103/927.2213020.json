Having carefully reviewed the record, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Sesterheim\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that he did not show extraordinary circumstances relating to his delay in seeking asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ngure v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 975, 988-89 (8th Cir.2004). We agree with the IJ that Sesterheim was not entitled to withholding of removal, because he failed to demonstrate a clear probability that he would be persecuted based on one of the enumerated grounds if removed to Germany. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 744 (8th Cir.2004) (for withholding of removal, alien must present evidence that it is more likely than not he would be persecuted if returned to country of removal). We also uphold the IJ\u2019s separate denial of CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2004) (under CAT, applicant has burden to show it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to proposed country of return).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Accordingly, we deny Sesterheim\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
