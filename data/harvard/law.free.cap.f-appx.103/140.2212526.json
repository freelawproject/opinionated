Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-26\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Perez\u2019s contentions regarding the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of the underlying order of deportation, as well as the IJ\u2019s denial of her request to continue her suspension of deportation hearing, because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We review BIA\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Perez\u2019s motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel, because Perez failed to show how counsel\u2019s performance, even if deficient, prejudiced her. <em>See id. </em>at 899-900 (\u201cPrejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We do not consider Perez\u2019s eligibility, if any, for relief under the settlement agreement in <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc. v. Ridge, </em>Civ S-86-1343-LKK (E.D.Cal.), or <em>Newman v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services, </em>Civ.
