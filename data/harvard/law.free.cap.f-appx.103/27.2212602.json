As it happened, one of those numbers belonged to an actual person \u2014 -a toddler named Jacob Bowman. Because of this coincidence, Cisse received a two-level upward adjustment for identity theft under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) (2002). He now argues that this adjustment should not have been applied to him because the number was not actually stolen and only by chance corresponded to a real person. This is a question concerning the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, which we review <em>de novo. United States v. King, </em>338 F.3d 794, 799 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">The facts are not disputed. Cisse and his accomplice, Mohammed Fadiga, laundered more than $200,000 worth of counterfeit checks by transferring the money through various bank accounts, some of which had been opened using pseudonyms and fake social security numbers. Fadiga had opened one such account in 2001 at National City Bank in Indianapolis using the name \u201cOsman Sesay\u201d and a social security number that differed by only one digit from Cisse\u2019s own social security number (or, more precisely, from a number Cisse had obtained in 1999 under the alias \u201cAssalaam Cisse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">Cisse ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Before sentencing, it was learned that the social security number that was used to open the account for \u201cOsman Sesay\u201d actually belonged to Jacob Bowman, a child born in Indianapolis in 1999. There was no evidence that Fadiga or Cisse knew of this child, that they obtained the number from any document relating to him, or that they even knew the number belonged to an actual person.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the use of Bowman\u2019s number (attributable to Cisse under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) as reasonably foreseeable relevant conduct) triggered an enhancement for identity theft under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i), which mandates a two-level increase for offenses involving \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\u201d A cross-reference defines \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>identify a specific individual,\u201d such as a \u201csocial security number\u201d or a \u201cunique electronic identification number.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). The court reasoned that Bowman\u2019s social security number was a means of identification used without authorization to obtain another means of identification \u2014 a bank account with a unique identification number \u2014 and so applied the two-level adjustment to Cisse.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Cisse now challenges that conclusion. He concedes that using someone else\u2019s social security number to open a bank account is covered by \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i), as suggested by application note 7(C)(ii)(I) (enhancement applies when \u201c[a] defendant obtains an individual\u2019s name and social security number from a source ... and obtains a bank loan in that individual\u2019s name\u201d). He argues, however, that his situation is distinguishable from this example, because neither he nor Fadiga \u201cobtained\u201d Jacob Bowman\u2019s social security number from any source, nor did they open the bank account in Bowman\u2019s name. He also notes that the Guidelines specify that the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d must \u201cbe of an actual <em>(i.e. </em>not fictitious) individual,\u201d \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) cmt. n. 7(A), and \u201cOsman Sesay\u201d was a fictitious individual. He thus insists that to apply the identity theft enhancement in this case would be contrary to the Guidelines\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Section 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) was added to the Guidelines in November 2000, and we have found only one published case discussing its application. In <em>United States v. Williams, 355 </em>F.3d 893 (6th Cir.2003), the defendants applied for bank loans under their own names, but with false social security numbers, employment histories, and salary information they had purchased from providers of false identifying information. The social security numbers belonged to actual individuals, but the opinion does not indicate how the sellers obtained those numbers. The defendants in that case argued that \u00a7 2B1.1 (b) (9) (C) (i) did not apply to them because although they used other people\u2019s social security numbers to apply for the loans, they also used their own names, and therefore did not steal anybody\u2019s identity. The Sixth Circuit rejected that argument, noting that \u201cthe definition of \u2018means of identification\u2019 ... does not require that a name and social security number be used together,\u201d and that the enhancement applies whether such a name or number is \u201cused, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>355 F.3d at 900 (emphasis, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">This case is similar, except that here the social security number was clearly not obtained from the actual individual to whom it was assigned. Cisse argues that the difference is crucial. In each of the examples in the application notes, the defendant obtains the identifying information \u201cfrom a source,\u201d such as \u201ca piece of mail taken from the individual\u2019s mailbox\u201d or \u201ca driver\u2019s license in a stolen wallet.\u201d \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) cmt. n. 7(C)(ii). Information invented out of whole cloth, in contrast, qualifies as fictitious, and thus does not trigger the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at n. 7(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">We nevertheless conclude that the enhancement was properly applied in this case. A made-up social security number is different than a made-up name, because the number alone is sufficient to identify the associated individual uniquely and unambiguously. <em>See Bowen v. Roy, </em>476 U.S. 693, 710, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986) (observing that \u201cSocial Security numbers are unique numerical identifiers\u201d). A fictitious name, in contrast, even if it happens to be held by a real person, will not be uniquely associated with that person, and its use will therefore be less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>likely to cause the sort of harm anticipated by the identity-theft enhancement (particularly \u201charm to a victim\u2019s reputation\u201d and \u201cinconvenience,\u201d U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 596, \u201cReason for Amendment\u201d 119). Furthermore, although Cisse argues that in this case \u201cthere was no harm to the reputation or credit rating of the victim,\u201d he does not suggest that such harm is necessarily prevented by the use of an entirely different name (\u201cOsman Sesay\u201d) in conjunction with the victim\u2019s number. <em>Cf. DiGianni v. Stern\u2019s, </em>26 F.3d 346, 347 (2d Cir.1994). (describing damage to victim\u2019s credit rating caused by the unauthorized use of her social security number with different names and addresses).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">It is not unforeseeable or even unlikely that a made-up social security number will turn out to belong to a real person. And the use of such a number fits comfortably within a straightforward reading of the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(l). We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
