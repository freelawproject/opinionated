Agaton also appeals the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to remand/reopen his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-21\">To qualify for relief under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H), (waiver of misrepresentation that rendered the alien inadmissible or subject to removal), Agaton had to establish that he was statutorily eligible <em>and </em>that he merited relief in the exercise of discretion. The IJ found that Agaton was statutorily eligible for relief because he had a qualifying relative. However, after balancing the favorable and adverse factors in Agaton\u2019s case, the IJ denied Agaton\u2019s request for a waiver of his misrepresentation that he was single.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ\u2019s denial of the requested waiver resulted solely from the exercise of her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-22\">Pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we do not have jurisdiction to review any \u201cdecision or action of the Attorney General the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>for which is specified under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1378] to be in the discretion of the Attorney General, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title [relating to asylum].\u201d <em>Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, </em>345 F.3d 683, 688-89 (9th Cir.2003) (citations omitted) (alteration in the original). The statute at issue here, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H), expressly states that the decision whether to grant a waiver is a discretionary one. Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Agaton also contends that the BIA\u2019s streamlined decision, as well as the criteria outlined in the streamlining regulations, violated his due process rights. Agaton\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848-49 (9th Cir.2003), which held that streamlining does not violate an alien\u2019s due process rights, and concluded that we lack jurisdiction to review the specific decision to streamline a case if the claim is based on an alleged error that we lack jurisdiction to review in the first instance. Here, as in <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on an alleged error regarding a discretionary determination. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision in the first instance, <em>and </em>lack jurisdiction to review the decision to streamline Agaton\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Finally, although Agaton contends that the subsequent annulment of his marriage satisfied the requirements for a motion to reopen, <em>Hendrix v. U.S. INS, </em>583 F.2d 1102 (9th Cir.1978) (per curiam), forecloses his claim for relief. In <em>Hendrix, </em>we held that \u201cwe are not obliged to give retroactive effect to annulments so as to cure a violation of law respecting entry into the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1103. In other words, \u201c[u]nless unusual circumstances dictate that in the interest of justice retroactive effect should be given an annulment ... it is the marital status at the time of entry that should serve as the basis for one alien\u2019s preferment over others under the quota system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). No such circumstances are present here. Moreover, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Agaton was, in fact, married at the time of entry, and thus removable as charged. Consequently, the Petition for Review is</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-23\">. As a married son of a United States citizen, Agaton was ineligible for the preferential family-based visa previously requested by Agaton\u2019s father.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
