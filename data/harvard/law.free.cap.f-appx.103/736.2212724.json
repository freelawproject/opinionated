Wallace, Jr., appeals his guilty-plea conviction to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">On appeal, Wallace asserts that the district court erred by applying a two-level firearm enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2001). The Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in offense level for drug offenses \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), comment, (n.3). The district court\u2019s enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). After careful review of the record, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement. <em>Id.; United States v. Kimberlin, </em>18 F.3d 1156, 1160 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Mena-Robles, </em>4 F.3d 1026, 1036 (1st Cir. 1993). Moreover, we reject Wallace\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines created an unconstitutional presumption that possession of a firearm is reasonably foreseeable in every drug trafficking case. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">Accordingly, we affirm Wallace\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
