The district court sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Anderson\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating Anderson\u2019s beliefs that the police acted illegally in stopping his vehicle and searching it, and that he had a right to carry a gun because he was planning to get his criminal record expunged and get the gun registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-21\">These points provide no basis for reversal. A police officer testified at trial that she observed the vehicle Anderson was driving run a stop sign, the passenger was arrested based on an outstanding probation violation, and the gun was found in a search of the vehicle pursuant to that arrest. <em>See United States v. Searcy, </em>181 F.3d 975, 979 (8th Cir.1999) (search of passenger compartment of vehicle following arrest of occupant is reasonable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Fourth Amendment); <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>148 F.3d 897, 904 (8th Cir.) (traffic violations provide probable cause for police to stop vehicle), <em>cert. denied, 525 </em>U.S. 899, 119 S.Ct. 228, 142 L.Ed.2d 188 (1998). Given the undisputed evidence of a prior felony conviction, knowing possession of a firearm, and interstate nexus, <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>266 F.3d 804, 813 (8th Cir.2001) (elements of felon-in-possession offense), there is no merit to Anderson\u2019s contention that he had a right to carry a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Having reviewed the 'record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
