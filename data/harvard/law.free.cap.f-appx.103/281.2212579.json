We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Kaur\u2019s testimony and declarations contained implausibilities and inconsistencies. Kaur claimed she feared returning to India because she identified police officers involved in a killing, but Kaur did not witness the killing or have sufficient information to identify the officers, and gave inconsistent information regarding the number of officers she identified. Because these discrepancies went to the heart of the asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Accordingly, it follows that Kaur did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
