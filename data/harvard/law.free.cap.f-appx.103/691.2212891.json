Petitioner claims that the prosecution violated the strictures of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to obtain from the Department of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d) a photograph of a co-defendant that could have undermined the identification of Petitioner as the perpetrator of the offense conduct. For substantially the reasons provided by the district court, we cannot conclude that the state court decision finding no <em>Brady </em>violation was contrary to, or unreasonably applied, <em>Brady </em>and its Supreme Court progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">Because we also find Petitioner\u2019s other claims to be without merit, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
