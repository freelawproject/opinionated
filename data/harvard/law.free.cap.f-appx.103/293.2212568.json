We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Petitioners contend that no asylum or cancellation of removal case could ever properly be streamlined by the BIA under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) because such cases invariably involve a \u201cnovel fact situation.\u201d We reject this contention because not every fact based case is \u201cnovel in the eyes of the law.\u201d <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 852 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations violate due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 849-52 (holding that the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure does not violate an alien\u2019s due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioners\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
