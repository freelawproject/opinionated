Our review is therefore limited to the \u201cnew material presented with respect to the motion to dissolve\u201d and, consequently, we do not consider \u201cthe propriety of the underlying order.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Weston, </em>233 F.3d 1166, 1169-70 (9th Cir.2000). \u2018We review the denial of a motion to dissolve an injunction for abuse of discretion, which we find if there was clear error in factual findings or erroneous application of law.\u201d <em>See Federal Trade Comm\u2019n. v. Enforma Natural Products, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1204,1212-13 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Appellants sought dissolution based on evidence that collective bargaining between nurses and employers had broken down and that several employers had filed Amendment of Certification petitions (so-called \u201cAC petitions\u201d) with the NLRB, and that the NLRB declined to proceed in the face of the injunction. Because we determine that the injunction does not in any way infringe on the jurisdiction of the NLRB to determine representational issues, we decline to set the district court\u2019s refusal aside. We note that the district court, in denying the motion to dissolve the injunction, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">The instant preliminary injunction is intended to maintain the status quo of the contractual relationship between HNA and CBO, and <em>does not prevent the NLRB from determining which party is the proper collective bargaining agent. </em>In fact, in order not to infringe on the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction, the Court must <em>refrain </em>from dissolving the preliminary injunction; for the Court to dissolve the preliminary injunction and allow HNA to disestablish CBO and replace it with its own collective bargaining unit may implicate representational matters properly within the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">(second emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We see no impediment to the Board proceeding. As the district court stated, the preliminary injunction \u201cdoes not prevent the NLRB from determining which party is the proper collective bargaining agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to dissolve the injunction and is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
