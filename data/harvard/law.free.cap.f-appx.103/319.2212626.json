Zakoyan and Anahit Margaryan, natives and citizens of Armenia, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) summary affirmance of an immigration judge\u2019s denial of their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>do not have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case because Zakoyan\u2019s petition was untimely filed. We therefore dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The BIA\u2019s final order of removal was issued on September 23, 2002. Zakoyan\u2019s petition for review was filed on January 9, 2003, one hundred and eight days later. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he petition for review must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d Zakoyan\u2019s petition therefore should have been received no later than October 23, 2002. Because the requirement of a timely petition for review is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and cannot be tolled,\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003), we lack jurisdiction to review this untimely petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We deny Petitioner\u2019s January 9, 2003 motion for stay of removal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b353-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
