The jury, by a vote of 11 to 1, recommended that Woolf be sentenced to death. The circuit court followed the jury\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Woolf to death. Woolf appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">The evidence at trial tended to demonstrate the following. On February 15, 2008, Woolf went to Resultz Corp. in Mobile with his wife Angel, their two-year-old son Ayden, and Woolfs mother, Lynn Tul-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>los. Woolf and Angel had what witnesses described as a turbulent relationship, and, because Woolf had begun to doubt that he was Ayden\u2019s biological father, Woolf and Angel went to Resultz Corp., \u201ca biomedical testing laboratory\u201d that performed drug screenings and \u201cDNA collections and testing,\u201d for a paternity test to determine whether Woolf was Ayden\u2019s biological father. Woolf seemed stressed about the results of the test and said \u201cthat other people were saying [Ayden] [might] not be his.\u201d. After completing the test, Woolf asked an employee of Resultz Corp. to pray for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">After he received the results, Woolf returned to Resultz Corp. with Ayden on March 3, 2008. Woolf told a Resultz Corp. employee that he needed to have the results of the test \u201cexplained] to him because he was a little confused about [them].\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The employee explained the results to Woolf who said \u201che was just worried about\u201d what other people were saying regarding Ayden\u2019s paternity. As Woolf left Resultz Corp., he asked the owner whether she believed in God and asked her to pray for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Shortly after midnight on the morning of March 5, 2008, Woolf called the Mobile County emergency 911 number and reported that he had killed his family and needed to go to jail. Paramedics with the Mobile Fire Department and officers with the Mobile Police Department were dispatched to Woolfs mobile home.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">At 1:05 a.m., Jonathan Parker and Coye Lucky, paramedics with the Mobile Fire Department, were parked in a rescue truck at a Circle K store located at the corner of Schillingers Road and Moffett Road waiting to be told when they could safely enter Woolfs mobile home. Woolf, after parking his car in front of the rescue truck at the Circle K, got out of his car and approached the rescue truck. Parker got out of the truck and walked toward Woolf, who said, \u201cYou need to call the cops.\u201d When Parker asked him if he had shot his family, Woolf \u201csaid that [his] son came into the room and said pow-pow and then [he] heard two gunshots, [he] blacked out and [he] left.\u201d Woolf started to leave, but the paramedics told him not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Officer Shannon Payne of the Mobile Police Department, who was responding to the call to Woolfs mobile home, stopped at the Circle K when she saw the paramedics. As Officer Payne got out of her patrol car, Woolf approached her with \u201chis hands ... facing out ... with his palms facing almost as if they were going to be in a handcuffed position.\u201d Woolf said, \u201cI poisoned my wife and put me in handcuffs.\u201d As Officer Payne was placing Woolf inside her patrol car he said, \u201cI heard two noises pow-pow, then I blacked out.\u201d (R. 1373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">Corporal \u25a0 Brian Reeher of the Mobile Police Department arrived at the Circle K, and he and Officer Payne transferred Woolf to Cpl. Reeher\u2019s patrol car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u25a0 As Cpl. Reeher placed Woolf in his patrol car, Woolf said, \u201cMy wife poisoned me.\u201d Cpl. Reeher also heard Woolf say that Woolfs \u201cwife made me do it.\u201d Officer Payne later checked on Woolf who said, \u201cI may have actually done it.\u201d Officer Payne asked Woolf what he may have actually done, and he said, \u201cI might have gotten a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Angela Prine, an investigator with the Mobile Police Department, arrived at the Circle K store and got in the backseat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Cpl. Reeher\u2019s patrol car with Woolf. Prine read Woolf his Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights and briefly interviewed him to get personal information about Angel and Ayden.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Mobile police officers went to Woolfs mobile home, where they found the bodies of Angel and Ayden; both Angel and Ay-den had been shot. The officers also, located a \u201csock print impression that was in blood\u201d and several bloody shoe impressions. On the living-room floor officers found a .38 caliber revolver that held two spent casings and one cartridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Officers transported Woolf to the Mobile Police Department headquarters' and placed him in an interview room. Officer Payne checked on Woolf, who was alternating between pacing and lying on the floor. Woolf said, \u201cPm a fucking dumb ass.\u201d He also said, \u201cShoot me, just shoot me.\u201d (R. 1415.) When Officer Payne asked why he should shoot him, Woolf said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m guilty.\u201d (R. 1415.) Investigator Prine arrived at police headquarters and again advised Woolf of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Woolf did not sign the waiver-of-rights form, but he did speak with Prine and Cpl. Jeremy March.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Following his conversation with Prine and Cpl. March, Woolf was placed under arrest. As he got undressed to change into a white jail jumpsuit, Woolf pulled off \u00e1 sock that appeared bloody, \u201ckind of wadded it and touched it to his mouth and kissed it and said, \u2018oh, my baby.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">' An autopsy revealed that the cause of Angel\u2019s death was a \u201cgunshot wound to the face.\u201d The autopsy performed on Ayden revealed that he also \u201cdied as a result of a gunshot wound to the face.\u201d (R. 1717.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Woolf called several witnesses to' testify during the guilt phase of the trial. Two friends testified about seeing Woolf, Angel, and Ayden interact with each other. ~ A lieutenant with the Mobile Police Department testified that he saw no evidence indicating that Angel and Ayden received any medical assistance on the night of the shooting. Woolf called Lucky, who testified about the events that occurred in the Circle K parking lot and stated that neither he nor Parker entered the mobile home that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Woolf called three Mobile police officers, two of whom told the jury about the actions law-enforcement personnel had taken as they approached, entered, and searched Woolfs mobile home on .the morning of March 5, 2008, The third officer testified about securing Woolfs car at the Circle K store and assisting in a search of that car.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">Three of Woolfs neighbors testified on his behalf. One neighbor .testified about her interaction with the officers on the morning of March 5, 2008, and stated that after the officers left the trailer park she noticed that skirting had been removed from around the base of her trailer. Another neighbor testified that Woolf, Angel, and Ayden \u201cseemed like a really happy family.\u201d The last neighbor testified about her interactions with the Woolf family.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">Woolf testified in his own behalf. He told the jury that he \u201cknew Ayden was [his but he] just wanted the paper [with the DNA test results].\u201d Woolf further said that he did not understand the DNA results and decided' to go back to Resultz Corp. to have the results explained to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">Woolf also testified that he and a- friend went riding around on March 4, 2008. When he returned home, he said, Angel confronted him about him having been away from home; He left again, this time by himself. While riding around, Woolf said, he smoked marijuana, \u201ctook two Dar-vocets and drank five or six beers.\u201d When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>he returned home, he took the gun inside the mobile home with him. Angel confronted him and grabbed his arm. Woolf said he pulled away from Angel and shot the gun behind him to scare her. Angel \u201cscreamed and said, \u2018You shot Ayden.\u2019\u201d (R. 1902.) After Woolf saw that Ayden had been shot, he shot Angel. Woolf called emergency 911 and left the mobile home, stopping when he saw the emergency responders at the Circle K store.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Woolf presented a psychologist who testified about his evaluation of Woolf and Woolfs interactions with law enforcement after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The circuit court charged the jury, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts of the indictment. At the conclusion of the penalty phase of the trial, the jury recommended the death sentence by an 11-1 vote. Following the sentencing hearing, the circuit court sentenced Woolf to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Because Woolf has been sentenced to death, we apply the standard of review set out in Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P., which requires that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201c[i]n all cases in which the death penalty has been imposed, the Court of Criminal Appeals shall notice any plain error or defect in the proceedings under review, whether or not brought to the attention of the trial court, and take appropriate appellate action by reason thereof, whenever such error has or probably has adversely affected the substantial right of the appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The Alabama Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">\u201c1 \u201cTo rise to the level of plain error, the claimed error must not only seriously affect a defendant\u2019s \u2018substantial rights,\u2019 but it must also have an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d\u2019 <em>Ex parte Bryant, </em>951 So.2d 724, 727 (Ala.2002) (quoting <em>Hyde v.

The circuit court conducted a hearing before granting the motion in part and denying it in part. The circuit court granted the motion regarding statements made by Woolf during the interview conducted in the police interrogation room after Woolf had indicated that he wanted an attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThis Court reviews de novo a circuit court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress evidence when the facts are not in dispute. <em>See State v.

Amend. V. In <em>Miranda [v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966)], the United States Supreme Court held that the right against self-incrimination \u2018is fully applicable during a period of custodial interrogation.\u2019 384 U.S. at 460. The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>further held that \u2018the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege....\u2019 384 U.S. at 469. Before a custodial interrogation, a suspect must be informed of these rights, now commonly referred to as <em>Miranda </em>rights. 384 U.S. at 444 (\u2018Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u2019). The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>recognized that \u2018the defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided that the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-13\"><em>Ward v. State, </em>105 So.3d 449, 452-53 (Ala.Crim.App.2012) (quoting <em>Thompson v.

State, </em>726 So.2d 738, 742 (Ala.Crim.App.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">With these principles in mind, we address Woolfs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">Woolf first challenges the statements he made to Mobile Fire Department paramedic Jonathan Parker at the Circle K store. When Parker saw Woolf get out of his car, Parker got out of his rescue truck and walked up to him. Woolf said, \u201cYou need to call the cops.\u201d (R. 1354.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Parker asked Woolf if he had just shot his family, and Woolf said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (R, 1355.) When Parker asked for clarification, Woolf told him that Ayden had come \u201cinto the room and said pow-pow and then [Woolf] heard two gunshots, ... blacked out and .., left.\u201d (R. 1355.) When Woolf said that he had to leave, Parker said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t; you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d (R. 1355.) Woolf argues that he was detained when Parker told Woolf that he did not need to leave the Circle K.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The record demonstrates, however, that Woolf was not in custody when he spoke with Parker. Two Mobile Fire Department vehicles were at the Circle K that morning; one was a fire engine and the other was a rescue unit. Woolfs first statement to Parker, that he \u201cneeded to call the cops,\u201d indicates that Woolf knew he was not speaking with a law-enforcement officer. (R. 1354.) Additionally, Woolf attempted to leave the scene after he had made the statements he argues should have been suppressed. The totality of the circumstances would not have caused a reasonable person in Woolfs position to believe that he was not free to leave; indeed, Woolfs attempted departure at that time indicates that even Woolf did not believe that he was being detained. Accordingly, because he was not in custody at the time Woolf spoke with Parker, the admission of the statements he made to him did not violate <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Woolf next asserts that the circuit court erroneously admitted the statements he made to law enforcement on March 5, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">While still in the Circle K parking lot, Woolf made statements directly to, or in the presence of, law-enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">When Shannon Payne, a patrol officer with the Mobile Police Department, stopped at the Circle K store, Woolf walked up to her with \u201chis hands ... facing out ... with his palms facing almost as if they were going to be in a handcuffed position.\u201d (R. 1372.) Woolf said, \u201cI poisoned my wife and put me in handcuffs.\u201d (R. 1372.) As Officer Payne was placing Woolf inside -her patrol car he said, \u201cI heard two noises pow-pow, then I blacked out.\u201d (R. 1373.) Neither of those statements was in response to any questions asked of Woolf.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">After Cpl. Brian Reeher of the Mobile Police Department arrived at the Circle K, Woolf was placed in Cpl. Reeher\u2019s patrol car. As Cpl. Reeher was placing Woolf in his patrol car, Woolf said, \u201cMy wife poisoned me.\u201d (R. 1413.) While Woolf was in the patrol car, Cpl. Reeher heard Woolf say that Woolfs \u201cwife made [him] do it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (R. 1414.) Officer Payne later opened the door to check on Woolf, and Woolf stated, \u201cI may have actually done it.\u201d (R, 1375.) In response, Officer Payne asked what Woolf may have actually done, and Woolf said, \u201cI might have gotten a gun.\u201d (R. 1375.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">\u201c\u2018\u201c\u2018\u201cIf the defendant spontaneously volunteers information, either before or after being given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, those statements need not be suppressed.\u201d <em>United States v.

Reeher were voluntary statements not made in response to custodial interrogation, and their admission was not error. Likewise, Woolfs reply to Officer Payne\u2019s question regarding what he might have done was not admitted in error; law-enforcement officers may, without offending <em>Miranda, </em>ask a question to clarify a statement made by a suspect. <em>See, e.g., Andersen v.

State\u2019s Exhibit 40, the recording of the interview Investigator Prine conducted of Woolf in the patrol car, demonstrates that Woolf implicitly but voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before speaking with Investigator Prine.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">'2.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Woolf also challenges the admission of statements he made while at the Mobile Police Department headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Officers from the Mobile Police Department transported Woolf from the Circle K store to police headquarters and, once there, placed him in an interrogation room. Officer Payne checked on Woolf, who was alternatively pacing and lying on the floor. Woolf said, \u201cI\u2019m a fucking dumb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ass.\u201d (R. 1376.) He also said, \u201cshoot me, just shoot me.\u201d (R. 1415.) When Officer Payne asked why, Woolf said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m guilty.\u201d (R. 1415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The admission of the first two statements Woolf made to Officer Payne was not erroneous because they were voluntary statements not made in response to custodial interrogation. <em>See Brown v. State, </em>982 So.2d 565, 601-02 (Ala.Crim.App.2006). Officer Payne\u2019s question seeking to clarify why Woolf told Officer Payne to shoot him did not offend <em>Miranda, </em>and Woolfs response was properly admitted. <em>See, e.g., Andersen v. Thieret, </em>903 F.2d 526, 532 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Investigator Prine arrived at police headquarters and, with Cpl. Jeremy March present, spoke with Woolf. At the beginning of that conversation, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cMARCH: Come over here for me, she\u2019s going to sit right here and talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cWOOLF: I don\u2019t want to try and breathe on y\u2019all man cause I\u2019m coughing up some brown phlegm and stuff.

Please do whatever y\u2019all got to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">(C. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">After Investigator Prine read Woolf his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-25\">\u201cPRINE: We\u2019re going over the next part with you, ok. It says, it\u2019s your Waiver Part: \u2018I do not want a lawyer at this time. I understand and know what I am doing. No promises or threats have been made to me and no pressure or force of any kind has been used against me. I hereby voluntarily and intentionally waive my rights and am willing to make a statement and answer questions.\u2019 You want to tell us what happened earlier? You want to talk to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-26\">WOOLF: I mean I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-27\">\u201cMARCH: It might make you feel better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-28\">\u201cWOOLF: How, how did you see it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-29\">\u201cMARCH: It might help you to get it out of your system.

I can\u2019t even think right now, sir. I don\u2019t know, I went, I guess I\u2019m guilty. I want a lawyer. I don\u2019t know what to say. Ohhhhh.

Uhhhh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">(C. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">After offering Woolf something else to drink, Cpl. March and Investigator Prine left Woolf alone in the interrogation room. During this time, Woolf said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5h\">\u201cI mean I just got to lay down just, that\u2019s all I want to do. Ohhhhh. Ohhhh. I can\u2019t even think now Ayden, oh Ayden. Uhhhh. Ohhhhh, ohhhhh. It keeps going through my head but I don\u2019t want to dream either. I want to see my son. (Crying sounds). Ahhhhh, ahhhhh.

I want to cry, I want to cry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">(C. 332 (as transcribed).)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">Investigator Prine returned with water, spoke with Woolf about his tattoos, and looked at his shoes before leaving. again. While alone this time, Woolf called out for some tissue. Cpl. March brought the tissue and left. Woolf then made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-21\">\u201cOhhhh. Oh man.

The circuit court did not commit error by admitting them at trial. By stating that he would tell Investigator Prine what had happened and then answering her questions, Woolf again implicitly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The recording of that conversation (State\u2019s Exhibit 43) demonstrates that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The admission of evidence regarding this conversation was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Woolf contends that all the statements he made that night should have been suppressed because, he says, he was intoxicated and suffering from \u201cmultiple mental disorders and pronounced emotional distress.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 85.) He also asserts that the interrogations were coercive because of his exhaustion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">\u201c \u2018[A]lleged fatigue is only a factor to be considered by the jury in determining whether it finds a statement to be involuntary. In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>674 So.2d 1318, 1326-28 (Ala.Cr.App.1993), aff'd in pertinent part, reversed in part, 674 So.2d 1365 (Ala.1994), on return to remand, 674 So.2d 1370 (Ala.Cr.App.1995), the appellant claimed that his statement was involuntary because \u201che had not slept since the previous night, and the officers continued to interrogate him, despite what he describes as his state of sleep deprivation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1327. In <em>Jackson, </em>this Court stated that the record did indicate that there was testimony from investigating officers that the appellant appeared \u201csleepy or fatigued,\u201d and the appellant had stated, during his questioning, that he was tired; however, there was no indication that the appellant ever requested that the questioning cease because of his condition. At the close of the appellant\u2019s statement in <em>Jackson, </em>the record indicated that the officers asked if they had \u201churt him in any way,\u201d and the appellant responded, \u201c Tes, y\u2019aJl not letting me go to sleep, man. I\u2019m tired, man. I was up all <em>f-nightId., </em>at 1327. In holding that this condition of sleepiness or fatigue constituted but one factor to be considered by the jury, this Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">\u201c \u2018This claim is also to be considered by the jury in determining the credibility and weight to accord the statement under the totality of the circumstances. This court has found that where a defendant alleged that his statement was involuntary because, among other reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>he was deprived of food and drink and \u201cwas in poor condition physically due to lack of sleep- and the consumption of alcohol and drugs,\u201d this court found that upon a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary. <em>Callahan v. State, </em>557 So.2d 1292, 1298-99 (Ala.Cr.App.), affirmed, 557 So.2d 1311 (Ala.1989). Furthermore, the Alabama Supreme Court refused to accept as a \u201ccoercive factor\u201d the fact that a juvenile defendant was not questioned until a late hour. <em>Ex parte Smith, </em>611 So.2d 1023 (Ala. 1992).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Doster v. State, </em>72 So.3d 50, 78 (Ala.Crim.App.2010) (quoting <em>Grayson v. State, </em>824 So.2d 804, 832-33 (Ala.Crim.App.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Woolfs contention that he was intoxicated when he made inculpatory statements to. firemedics and law-enforcement personnel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Officer Payne testified that she smelled no alcohol on Woolf. She specifically stated that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t have arrested him at that point without further investigation for public intoxication].\u201d (R. 89.) Officer Payne also testified that she smelled no marijuana on Woolf and \u201cdidn\u2019t believe that he was drunk or on any drugs\u201d at the time of her interaction with him. (R. 1410.) Cpl. R\u00e9eher similarly testified that he did not recall that Woolf \u201cappeared] to be under the influence or anything.\u201d (R. 1413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Although Woolf directs our attention to his trial testimony that he had been \u201c[s]moking weed\u201d and that he \u201ctook two Darvocets and drank five or six beers\u201d while riding around in Baldwin County before returning home on March 4, 2008, the evidence was not clear regarding the time he allegedly consumed these substances or what, if any, affect they still had on him during his interaction with law enforcement on March 5, 2008. (R. 1893.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining, based on the totality of the circumstances, that Woolf was not intoxicated when he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his waivers were voluntary. <em>See, e.g., Rogers v. State, </em>365 So.2d 322, 334 (Ala.Crim.App.1978) (\u201cWhere, ample evidence, even though conflicting, exists from which the trial judge could conclude that the appellant was not intoxicated to the extent of mania, the admission of a confession for a jury\u2019s consideration is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d),</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Woolf also asserts that he was unable to voluntarily make statements and waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights because, he says, he was suffering from emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">\u201c \u2018Mere emotionalism and confusion do not dictate a finding of mental incompetency or insanity\u2019 so as to render a statement inadmissible.\u201d <em>Callahan v. State, </em>557 So.2d 1292, 1300 (Ala.Crim.App. 1989) (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Alabama, </em>666 F.2d 478, 483 (11th Cir.1982)). \u201cAn accused\u2019s mental and emotional state is but one factor to be considered when reviewing the totality of the circumstances surrounding an extrajudicial statement.\u201d <em>Minor v. State, </em>914 So.2d 372, 390 (Ala,Crim. App.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">Cpl, Reeher testified that he believed Woolf \u201cappeared emotionally distraught. And I\u2019m not saying in a highly agitated way. I\u2019m saying in a sense he was \u2014 it seemed more like he was upset due to the circumstances.\u201d (R. 101.) Officer Payne stated that Woolf acted \u201cjust very odd that evening.\u201d (R. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Although Woolf may have been emotionally distraught after having just shot his wife and child, that fact does not require a finding that his waivers and statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>were involuntary. Under the totality of the circumstances, the admission of the statements was proper..</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally, Woolf argues that because of his exhaustion, the interrogations were coercive. However, \u201cwhether a defendant was physically exhausted when he gave his statement is merely one factor to be considered by the jury in determining the credibility and weight to afford the statement.\u201d <em>Waldrop v. State, </em>859 So.2d 1138, 1158-59 (Ala.Crim.App.2000) (citing <em>Burgess v. State, </em>723 So.2d 742 (Ala.Crim. App.1997)). Although alleged fatigue is one factor to be considered by a jury when determining the voluntariness of a statement, the totality of the circumstances demonstrate that Woolfs statements and waivers were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Woolf asserts that he \u201cwas denied his right to a fair and impartial jury when a qualified prospective juror was improperly excused based on his views on the death penalty even though he stated he could follow the law.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 104.) Woolf refers to Juror no. 23, who indicated that he did not believe that he should decide whether someone received the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In his questionnaire, Juror no. 23 checked a box indicating that even though he \u201c[did] not believe that the death penalty should ever be assessed, as long as the law provides for this punishment, [he] could assess it in the appropriate circumstances\u201d; he also responded to another question by writing that \u201c[he] shouldn\u2019t be the one to decide if someone lives or dies.\u201d During individual voir dire of Juror no. 23, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, [Juror no. 23], I guess just to cut to the chase right here. We\u2019re going to be asking for death. I am. And they\u2019re going to be asking for life without parole. And you\u2019ve indicated in your questionnaire that you don\u2019t think you should be the one who decides that; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: You said in [the juror questionnaire, question] number 83, it could serve a purpose but you don\u2019t think we should decide that for someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-15\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And that\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to get at here is what you really think and feel and, of course, it\u2019s very serious. So even though the \u2014 and some people are opposed to it. Even though that\u2019s the law in Alabama it\u2019s\u2014 you\u2019ve got some people who just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. And if that\u2019s the way people feel then they shouldn\u2019t sit on a case where that\u2019s what\u2019s being asked for. It wouldn\u2019t be fair for the State obviously. So there\u2019s no shame in that. There\u2019s no harm in that. And even if the Judge were to tell you if you find the Defendant guilty you\u2019ve got to weigh the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, would you still feel like you could not do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-17\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: I do not feel like I could do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-18\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: That your vote would be life without?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-19\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-20\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: You would not do death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-21\">\u201c[Juror No. 23]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-22\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: No matter if the Judge told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-23\">\u201c[Juror No. 23]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-24\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: [Defense counsel 1]? [Defense counsel 2]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL 2]: [Juror no. 23], [the prosecutor\u2019s apparently moved straight to guilt. We\u2019re not going to ask you \u2014 we\u2019re going to ask you to return a verdict of not guilty first. There\u2019s a trial before the State gets to try to kill Mr. Woolf. Could you listen to all the evidence in that trial and fairly and impartially balance that evidence and reach a decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL 2]: One of the charges, or actually both the charges against Mr. Woolf, right now are capital murder. And if you find Mr. Woolf guilty at the end of all the evidence of one or both of those charges, we would move to another phase where we would put on evidence, it\u2019s called mitigation evidence. The State would put on evidence, aggravation evidence. Could you listen to both sides at that phase and have the death penalty as an option and the reason I ask you that on your questionnaire you believed that the \u2014 that you could assess the death penalty in appropriate circumstances and one of those circumstances is murder. Do you think you could do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: I don\u2019t feel I could impose the death penalty. But, I mean, I could obviously listen to everything and decide guilty or innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL 2]: And if the State meets the burden that the Judge outlines for you would you consider death as an option? And there\u2019s \u2014 at no point in the law is anybody going to tell you you\u2019ve got to vote to kill Mr. Woolf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL 2]: All you have to do is look at the evidence and keep that open as an option. Is there evidence that you could hear that might make you \u2014 that would make you keep that as an option?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">\u201c[JUROR No. 23]: It\u2019s hard to say because I don\u2019t know the evidence. It\u2019s kind of something that might put you over the edge, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL 2]: And it\u2019s tough doing all this in a vacuum I know.

Specifically, in her questionnaire, Juror no. 6 stated that she was not in favor of the death penalty, that she did not believe that she should kill anyone, and that she thought the death penalty served no legitimate purpose in society. The State, in describing its reasons for striking Juror no. 6, pointed out to the circuit judge that Juror no. 6 was one who had \u201cping-ponged\u201d in describing her views on the death penalty and that \u201cshe was, if you recall, ... [a] very timid, shy woman who was screaming T don\u2019t believe in the death penalty\u2019 but said some little something that she couldn\u2019t get excused for cause at the very end of that.\u201d (R. 1260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">According to the State, Juror no. 55</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">\u201cwas also one of those who was against the death penalty but at the end came around and said she could do it. But she was not very firm in that. In her questionnaire where it says are you in favor of the death penalty, she checked both yes and no. Says, they should be punished for their crime but there\u2019s got to be another way. Something I can\u2019t read, at putting people to death just to kill them too. So in other words, she did not think that that was the best way to handle situations like that. That was question 82. She was one of those back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">(R. 1263-64.) Juror no, 55 was questioned extensively during individual voir dire, including the following relevant exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Now, as you know this is a case in which if the Defendant is found guilty I will be asking you to vote for death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-15\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: The law in Alabama allows that. Some people don\u2019t believe in it. That\u2019s about as simple as you can put it. Regardless of the law they don\u2019t believe in it.

There\u2019s no point in me being there. So if you haven\u2019t thought about it up until now, I would like for you to think about it now and don\u2019t be embarrassed and don\u2019t be if the answer is you can\u2019t that\u2019s f\u00edne.

What you\u2019re saying is your answer is your answer. And you\u2019re talking about there\u2019s got to be another way or should be another way, that\u2019s the kind of thing legislators do, they make the laws. Your option, if you\u2019re on the jury, is to choose one of two ways. It\u2019s all you\u2019ve, either death or life without parole. You can\u2019t \u2014 me, you, we can\u2019t be thinking up other ways because the legislature made the law. Are you saying if you were on the jury and it went to the guilt phase went to the sentencing phase, that you would only or could only choose life without parole and not death? Or could you look at both of those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-23\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: I would have to look at both of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-24\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s just opposite of what you just said. So I don\u2019t want us to try to trick you into anything. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>We\u2019ll slow down a little bit. You\u2019re in the jury first. The jury first decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. And so we go through that phase. And in order for me to get to the second question we\u2019ve got to assume the defendant is found guilty. Then we go to the second phase. That\u2019s the sentencing phase and that\u2019s kind of a mini-trial trial in which aggravating and mitigating factors are presented. And after \u2014 that\u2019s the stuff that looks bad and looks good. I\u2019m going to instruct you what the law is on all of that. It takes a good amount of time. There is only two options you have, either death or life in the penitentiary. Now, if you\u2019re on that jury could you listen to the facts and the law and choose one of those, depending on what you feel under the law is appropriate, or would you just lean to life in the penitentiary automatically because of you\u2019re feelings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: No, I wouldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You could give them both equal weight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: I would have to listen to the case both to see how was it done and was it done deliberately or was it done accidentally. If it was done deliberately I would say death. If it\u2019s done accidentally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know you don\u2019t know what the law is. But you could listen to the law and the facts and everything I tell you, and then after that both options would be open and you would decide at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: I would decide at that time, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Can I follow up a little?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, please, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m just curious as to why just about two minutes ago you said death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: I\u2019m sorry. But I have to listen to both sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Of course you do. But \u2014 Look. I know it sounds complicated and it\u2019s not complicated. It\u2019s not complicated at all. It\u2019s just when it comes down to it and you\u2019re in the -jury box and I\u2019m saying, I want you to vote death, weighing everything, you know whether you could do death or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: Yes, I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Why did you just \u2014 I\u2019m just curious as to why a little bit ago you said you could not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">\u201c[JUROR No. 55]: I think, if I\u2019m not mistaken, I would have to weigh it out.

Because some people say no. You shouldn\u2019t kill another person. It\u2019s killing that person.

We\u2019re talking, I guess, theoretically here. You\u2019ll hear the facts. You\u2019ll hear the law. If it points toward death you could do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201c[JUROR No. 63]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Are you going to look at him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201c[JUROR No. 63]: I mean, if I \u2014 If I believe, you know, that he\u2019s truly guilty and the crime is that punishable enough where I believe that that\u2019s the best option, then I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. We just want to be absolutely sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201c[JUROR No. 63]: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">(R. 1113-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">We do not agree with Woolfs assertion that the State\u2019s proffered reason for striking Jurors no. 6 and no. 55 was pretextual. The responses of Jurors no. 6 and no. 55 were substantially different than those of Jurors no. 11 and no. 63. In their responses, Jurors no. 11 and no. 63 did not appear to have the emotional opposition to the death penalty that Juror no. 6 initially expressed by, as the State described to the circuit judge without comment from Woolfs counsel, \u201cscreaming [that she didn\u2019t] believe in the death penalty.\u201d Additionally, neither Juror no. 11 nor Juror no. 63 expressed the wide range of inconsistent responses regarding the death penalty that Juror no. 55 did. Accordingly, Woolf has not demonstrated clear error in the circuit court\u2019s denial of the <em>Batson </em>motion as to Jurors no. 6 and no. 55. <em>See, e.g., Parker, </em>565 F.3d at 1271 (\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s failure to strike similarly situated jurors is not pretextual, however, \u2018where there are relevant differences between the struck jurors and the comparator jurors.\u2019 <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 1004 (11th Cir.2001).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">\n<em>Juror No. 66</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">In giving its reasons for striking Juror no. 66, the State proffered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: [Juror no.] 66. She is the lady whose son \u2014 she\u2019s a black female. Her son had been arrested for domestic violence three times. Was that the one, [second prosecutor], that was against her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">\u201c[SECOND PROSECUTOR]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-20\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Was against her and she had had to have him committed and on medication and I was thinking since this is a domestic violence situation and I\u2019m sure the defense is probably going to put on some evidence about medication for the defendant and so on that that would probably be just a little too close to home for her to be totally objective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">Woolf contends that Juror no. 2, a white male who served on Woolfs jury, was similarly situated to Juror no. 66. Specifically, Woolf cites Juror no. 2\u2019s disclosure that his wife had \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d and was taking medication for that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>We disagree with Woolfs assertion that Juror no. 2 was similarly situated to Juror no. 66. Juror no. 2 stated that his wife had responded well to her medication and had not had \u201cany episodes in a long time.\u201d (R. 650.) More significantly, Juror no. 2 did not have a history of incidents of domestic violence allegedly committed against him. Therefore, the circuit court did not clearly err in denying Woolfs <em>Bat-son </em>challenge as to Juror no. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>Juror No. 76</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In giving its reasons for striking Juror no. 76, the State proffered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: ... She \u2014 couple of things on her. She has a husband who was charged with I forget what he was charged with exactly, but he was found not guilty. Do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201c[SECOND PROSECUTOR]: Assaulted somebody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Right. He was a police officer. He assaulted somebody. He was found not guilty. She also works for Bishop State Community College and our office indicted a lot of people at Bishop State Community College. In fact, she gave testimony in a civil matter on Bishop State Community College fraud issues. She testified about one of the defendants that we had indicted criminally meeting with, \u2018students,\u2019 who our position was really weren\u2019t students, after hours. That would be students that we believed were actually phony enrollments to get money. She said that she is the one who actually created and took the ID photo for what we believe was a phony student named Pearlie May French. I don\u2019t know if you remember from \u2014 or if this even got to come out. But Pearlie May French was the one-legged grandmother who was signed up for softball and so we found her testimony under oath not to be very credible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">(R. 1268-69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Woolf contends that the State\u2019s failure \u201c \u2018to engage [Juror no. 76] in any meaningful voir dire\u2019 \u201d regarding any of the matters identified above \u201c \u2018is evidence that the explanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination.\u2019\u201d (Woolf's brief, p. 50 (quoting <em>Ex parte Bird, </em>594 So.2d at 683).) We disagree under the circumstances of this case. Here, at least one of the two prosecutors had encountered Juror no. 76 before, had heard testimony regarding her employment, and did not find her to be credible. No evidence before us indicates that the prosecutor was incorrect in these statements, and even if there were such evidence, that would not necessarily demonstrate clear error. Accordingly, the circuit court did not clearly err in denying the <em>Batson </em>challenge as to Juror no. 76. <em>See Stephens v. State, </em>580 So.2d 11, 20 (Ala.Crim.App.1990) (\u201c[T]he fact that a prosecutor distrusts a juror or finds his responses not to be credible has also been held to be a sufficiently race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge.\u201d); <em>see also Parker, </em>565 F.3d at 1271 (\u201cNeither a prosecutor\u2019s mistaken belief about a juror nor failure to ask a voir dire question provides \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence of pretext.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">\n<em>Juror No. \u215b0</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The State offered the following explanation for its strike of Juror no. 40, a black female:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">\u201cShe said that the only situation in which she could vote for the death penalty would be if there was sexual molestation involved. And she also had a situation where I believe I just have the words falsely accused. She had been falsely accused of taking money from work and how bad it made her feel. And like I said, and that she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>require sexual molestation which in this case we do not have. And she said without that she could not impose death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">(R. 1262-63.) Juror no. 40 was clear that, without \u201cknow[ing] the facts,\u201d she was not sure she could impose the death penalty in any case other than one involving \u201csexual molestation\u201d of a child, a fact not present in Woolfs case. (R. 867.) This was a sufficiently race-neutral reason for the State to strike Juror no. 40, and the trial court did not clearly err in denying the <em>Batson </em>challenge as to the State\u2019s strike of Juror no. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>Juror No. 69</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The State proffered the following regarding its strike of Juror no. 69, a black female:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: [Juror no.] 69. Oh, this is the lady who started out \u2014 she was one of the most extreme, I guess, examples of being so adamantly opposed to the death penalty and then in the end ended up saying something that would keep her on the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is 69?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor. She, in her questionnaire, said, question 82, are you in favor of the death penalty? No. Religious belief. God is the only one that should take a life. Under the question 84 she checked the box, I could never assess death penalty regardless of the facts and the circumstances. Question 86, the death penalty should never be assessed as a punishment for any crime and she checked that. And she was one of the ones \u2014 So she did that in her questionnaire. Then during the general voir dire she was one of the ones who raised her hand and said, I\u2019m not in favor of death. I couldn\u2019t do it. And then when I asked her the questions in individual voir dire, again, could not do death. Then the ping pong match started and she equivocated shall we say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">(R. 1266.) The \u201cping pong match\u201d the prosecutor referred to is the individual voir dire, consisting of nine pages of transcript, in which Juror no. 69 ultimately backtracked from her questionnaire responses \u2014 which she attempted to distinguish as \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d \u2014 and stated that she could follow the law if the judge instructed her to do so. (R. 1164-63.) Woolf argues that Juror no. 69 was similarly situated to white Jurors no. 11 and no. 63. We disagree. Juror no. 69\u2019s initial statements of opposition to the death penalty were clear and were based on religious reasons, and in her individual voir dire she was much more equivocal than was Juror no. 11 or Juror no. 63. Accordingly, the trial court did not clearly err as to its denial of the <em>Batson </em>challenge regarding Juror no. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\n<em>Juror No. 70</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Regarding Juror no. 70, a black male, the State offered the following reason for its strike:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201c[Juror no.] 70 is the gentleman who is \u2014 he\u2019s an atheist as he said in his questionnaire. He has one of his best friends charged with capital murder and awaiting trial for capital murder and when I asked him the question, would that make you sympathetic toward the defendant he said, yes, that it would. In addition to that he also had a cousin who was charged with murder. He also said in his questionnaire that he said the gist \u25a0 of it was if somebody showed remorse for what they did then that would make him more inclined to life without parole. And in this particular situation I guess some of [Woolfs] actions afterward could be interpreted as either remorse for the fact that he was now in trouble or I suppose somebody could interpret it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>as remorse for the fact that he did it but whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">(R. 1267-68.) Woolf notes that the circuit court \u201cacknowledged! ] [that Juror no. 70\u215b] religious belief alone (or lack thereof) is not a race-neutral reason for a peremptory strike,\u201d and- Woolf argues that \u201cthe mere fact that someone may be sympathetic is not necessarily a race-neutral reason for a peremptory strike.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 55.) Woolf does not address, however, the third reason identified by the State: that one of Juror no. 70\u2019s \u201cbest friends [was] charged with capital murder\u201d and \u201che also had a cousin who was charged with murder.\u201d Woolf has not shown that the circuit court clearly erred in denying the <em>Batson </em>challenge as to Juror no. -70. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. State, </em>43 So.3d 7, 12 (Ala.Crim.App.2009) (citing <em>Thomas v. State, </em>611 So.2d 416 (Ala.Crim.App.1992), for the proposition that \u201cprevious criminal charges, prosecutions, or convictions of potential jurors or their relatives are a race-neutral reason for striking them\u201d); <em>see also Whatley, </em>146 So.3d at 455 (previous criminal charges, prosecutions, or convictions of prospective juror or family member are valid race-neutral reasons for a peremptory strike).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Juror No. 78</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Regarding Juror no. 78, a black female, the State proffered the following explanation for its strike:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cNumber 78 is the lady who had the closed-head injury who said that she could not remember things very well, that she would have to get her children \u2014 that she\u2019d be talking to her children and she would have done something one day and she couldn\u2019t remember. And first she said, you know, I just don\u2019t think I could do this and be fair. - She also said in terms of the death penalty, first she said, well, I would \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do it unless I saw it or unless it was on video or something- of that nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">(R. 1262.) During individual voir dire, in addition to discussing her head injury and memory problems, Juror no. 78, as noted by the State, initially stated that she would have to see a crime on \u201csomething like a video\u201d before she could vote to impose the death penalty. (R. 1216.) Additional questioning produced the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, you said earlier you couldn\u2019t go death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u201c[JUROR No. 78]: No. I said only if I had concrete evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">' \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And you said, like \u2014 You first started out saying like if you saw it..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">\u201c[JUROR No. 78]: Yeah, if I saw someone kill someone automatically\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And then you said like if I had a video of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">\u201c[JUROR No. 78]: \u2014 it\u2019s death, yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-17\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, you\u2019re not going to have any of that, -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-18\">\u201c[JUROR No. 78]: Okay. That would be kind of a conflict with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-19\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: A conflict with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-20\">\u201c[JUROR No. 78]: Uh-huh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-21\">(R. 1221-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-22\">The State had previously moved to strike Juror no. 78 for cause; the following exchange occurred regarding that motion, which the circuit court denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-23\">- \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, we challenge\u2019 her for cause. She was in the hospital three and a half months and had a closed-head injury. She said that in her-questionnaire. She doesn\u2019t seem to be just making this up. And while maybe she could take a little something down I think she was being just about as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>honest as she could be to say that she thought she would have some trouble remembering sometimes and she gave you an example she couldn\u2019t \u2014 her daughter \u2014 I think she said her daughter or her son would say well, mama, \u2014 But it goes beyond just the kind of loss of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhHa\">\u201cTHE COURT: Her questionnaire has some like maybe she started writing something and just stopped. I think your religion she put B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And she said, you know, T was in a car wreck in 2007. It was life or death. My members is still not right.\u2019 Well, I guess, her \u2014 I thought when she said that she might have meant like her fingers or toes or but I think she meant her memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: She said remembers and I think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyTH\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: In there she said \u2018my members is still not right.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I think that may have been shorthand for remembers. But in any event. Judge, I think when you instruct the jury at the end of the case you\u2019re going to say everybody\u2019s going to sit back there and you\u2019re going to talk about the case and everybody use your collective memory and she obviously\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, she isn\u2019t going to have a collective memory is the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: And obviously, she\u2019s \u2014 She told me she can weigh the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know what everybody is saying. It\u2019s just \u2014 We\u2019re all on thin ice here. As you all know she doesn\u2019t want to get off here. We\u2019re basically saying she doesn\u2019t have the qualifications as a juror to read, speak and understand and follow instructions given to her in the English language or we\u2019re saying she\u2019s incapable by reason of physical and mental ability to render satisfactory jury service. And she says she is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I thought she said she wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: She said she thought she could. I\u2019m going to deny your challenge for cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">(R. 1226-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">On appeal, the State points out that although Juror no. 78 would have been able to take notes as a juror, she also stated she was \u201cnot sure\u201d about her ability to remember short-term details. Specifically, the State cites the following exchange from the individual voir dire of Juror no. 78:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-15\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: So in all honesty given the fact that you physically cannot do that, do you think you\u2019ll be able to really remember enough because of your short-term memory loss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-16\">\u201c[JUROR No. 78]: I\u2019m really not sure. I don\u2019t think I will be able to remember, not everything. As I said as time go it would come back. But see, you may need something to happen right then and I probably say I can\u2019t remember because I can\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">(R. 1223.) Given Juror no. 78\u2019s apparent memory problems and her equivocation on the appropriateness of the death penalty as punishment, we cannot say the circuit court clearly erred in denying the <em>Batson </em>challenge as to Juror no. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-18\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-19\">Woolf argues that the circuit court erred in admitting certain crime-scene photographs that, he contends, were \u201cgruesome\u201d and that the \u201ccumulative nature\u201d of the photographs \u201cmerely increased the prejudiced he suffered.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 103.) He asserts that at his trial \u201cthere was no dispute that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>victims had been shot by Mr. Woolf, and that the gunshot wounds sustained by both victims was the cause of each victim\u2019s death.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The record demonstrates that, before trial, Woolf filed a motion in limine to exclude the introduction of the photographs based on, he said, \u201cgruesomeness and depravity.\u201d (R. 157.) The State indicated that, although it had around 200 photographs, it would \u201climit [them] greatly.\u201d (R. 157.) The circuit court took the motion under submission, but, as the 13 individual photographs at issue were offered into evidence, Woolf raised objections that the circuit court overruled. \u201cA trial court has wide discretion in determining whether to exclude or to admit evidence, and the trial court\u2019s determination on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed in the absence of an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Woodward v. State, </em>123 So.3d 989, 1014 (Ala.Crim.App.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201c \u2018Photographic evidence is admissible in a criminal prosecution if it tends to prove or disprove some disputed or material issue, to illustrate some relevant fact or evidence, or to corroborate or dispute other evidence in the case. Photographs that tend to shed light on, to strengthen, or to illustrate other testimony presented may be admitted into evidence. <em>Chunn v. State, </em>339 So.2d 1100, 1102 (Ala.Cr.App.1976). To be admissible, the photographic material must be a true and accurate representation of the subject that it purports to represent. <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>450 So.2d 181, 184 (Ala.Cr.App.1984). The admission of such evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>291 Ala. 67, 277 So.2d 882, 883 (1973); <em>Donahoo v. State, </em>505 So.2d 1067, 1071 (Ala.Cr.App.1986) (videotape evidence). Photographs illustrating crime scenes have been admitted into evidence, as have photographs of victims and their wounds. E.g., <em>Hill v. State, </em>516 So.2d 876 (Ala.Cr.App.1987). Furthermore, photographs that show the external wounds of a deceased victim are admissible even though the evidence is gruesome and cumulative and relates to undisputed matters. E.g., <em>Burton v. State, </em>521 So.2d 91 (Ala.Cr.App.1987). Finally, photographic evidence, if relevant, is admissible even if it has a tendency to inflame the minds of the jurors. <em>Hutto v. State, </em>465 So.2d 1211, 1212 (Ala.Cr.App.1984).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\"><em>Thompson v. State, </em>153 So.3d 84, 130 (Ala.Crim.App.2012) (quoting <em>Ex parte Siebert, </em>555 So.2d 780, 783-84 (Ala.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">In the instant case, although Woolf did not dispute that he had shot Angel and Ayden and that the gunshot wounds caused their deaths, the State was still required to prove those elements at trial. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">Woolf contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case Woolf moved for a judgment of acquittal; he renewed this motion at the close of all the evidence. The circuit court denied each motion. As he similarly argued before the circuit court in support of his motions, Woolf specifically asserts that the \u201cState failed to offer evidence that Mr. Woolf intended to kill his family at the time of the shootings, as required to sustain a conviction for capital murder.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 100.) Because Woolf attacks the sufficiency of the evidence only on the basis that the State failed to prove intent, we address only that element of his convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201c\u2018\u201cIn determining the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, a reviewing court must accept as true all evidence introduced by the State, accord the State all legitimate inferences therefrom, and consider all evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Ballenger v.

Additionally, when Woolf called emergency 911 after the shootings, he told the operator who answered that he had just killed his family and that he needed to go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Further, the testimony regarding Woolfs second trip to Resultz Corp. would also have allowed the jury to infer Woolfs intent in shooting Angel and Ayden. Woolf now argues that the \u201cState\u2019s argument [that Woolf began forming the intent to kill Angel and Ayden when he returned to Resultz to obtain an explanation of the results of the DNA testing] was both coun-terfactual and legally flawed, because the results of the paternity test showed that Mr. Woolf was Ayden\u2019s biological father.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 100.) Woolfs argument, however, misses the import of the testimony regarding his second trip to Resultz Corp. While at Resultz Corp. on that occasion, Woolf said that he wanted to have the DNA-testing results \u201cexplained] to him because he was a little confused about [them]\u201d and that he was \u201cvery confused about the results.\u201d (R. 1603.) Jacqueline Dukes, an employee of Resultz Corp., also testified \u201c[t]hat for whatever reason people were questioning the paternity of the child.\u201d (R. 1605.) Therefore, despite the results establishing that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>99.9999 percent probability that Woolf was Ayden\u2019s biological father, Woolf was confused about the results and what people had been saying regarding Ayden\u2019s paternity. Among other bases on which the jury could have inferred an intent to kill, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Woolfs confusion about the paternity results led him to form an intent to kill Angel and Ayden.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Woolf asserts that portions of the prosecutor\u2019s guilt-phase closing argument were calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u2018When evaluating prosecutorial arguments, we keep in mind the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe relevant question is whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019\u201d <em>Darden v.

He was diagnosed as bipolar at one point in time although he\u2019d only seen him be depressed but you can get a bipolar diagnosis if you\u2019ve had one manic episode in the past. And whatever medicine he took he chose to quit taking because it interfered with his sexual functioning. Bipolar, substance abuse, learning disability, antisocial borderline, borderline. I said, now, isn\u2019t that something that you find a lot among criminal defendants, among criminals? And he kind of wanted to wiggle a little bit on that but Dr. Bennett finally said, well, yes. You do see that diagnosis more among criminals than you do among the general population. And why is that? It\u2019s a perfect stew. It\u2019s a perfect recipe of a personality disorder, not a mental disorder, not a mental disease, a personality. That is a trait of a person\u2019s personality.

He shows signs of a tendency to act out.

None of this makes any sense whatsoever. You might say, well, this one thing looks odd or this one thing looks odd.

As the State summarized in its brief, \u201c[t]he problem the court faced was how to present lesser- included offenses without creating the possibility of a verdict that was illegal or offended principles of double jeopardy.\u201d (State\u2019s brief, pp. 20-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Woolf asserts that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s jury instructions on Count II omitted any reference to lesser-included offenses, neglecting even'the lesser-included offenses of reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 24.) The record demonstrates, however, that the circuit court did instruct-the jury on lesser-included offenses regarding Ayden and presented those options on one of the two verdict forms used by the circuit court. The -first form consisted of two pages \u2014 which were stapled together \u2014 and related to count I of the indictment. (R. 2175.) The first page of that form gave the jury the option of finding Woolf guilty as charged in the first count of the indictment, That page also gave the jury the options of finding Woolf (1) guilty of the murder of Angel; (2) guilty of the reckless manslaughter of Angel; (3) guilty, of the heat-of-passion. manslaughter of \u00c1ngel; or (4) not.guilty as to count I. (C. 88.) The second page of the first form gave the jury the options of finding Woolf (1) guilty of the reckless manslaughter of Ayden; (2) guilty of the criminally negligent homicide of Ayden; or (3) not guilty. (C. 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">The verdict form for count II, which was separate from the two-page verdict form related to count I, gave the jury .the option of finding Woolf guilty or not guilty of the capital murder of Ayden.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">In its instructions to the jury, the circuit court went into great detail explaining the verdict form for count I to the jury\u00a1 \u2022 .As a part of that explanation, the circuit court specifically instructed the jury regarding the use of the two forms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">\u201cThis is count one. Just to make it a \u25a0 little clearer, count one, is the two-page form. If your verdict is, for example, we, the jury, find the Defendant Michael Bragg Woolf, guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment, you would put an \u2018x\u2019 before that we. And ... the foreperson would date it and sign it. That would conclude count one. And then you would go to the second page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>not the second page, the second form. That\u2019s all you would do. You wouldn\u2019t go to the second page or anything. Let me explain it a little bit. Count one again, is the intentional murder of two or more people pursuant to a common scheme. It encompasses the intentional murder of two people. So you don\u2019t have to consider, well, what about Ay-den, what about Angel? It says we have found him guilty of intentional murder of two or more persons. But you say, you know, judge, the lesser included, let\u2019s go down there and look. All right. Let\u2019s say you look at the lesser included. We, the jury, find the Defendant Michael Bragg Woolf, guilty of the lesser included offense of murder as to the death of Angel Woolf. Let me throw this out at you. Let\u2019s say, the State under those instructions, the State hasn\u2019t met its burden. We\u2019re going to find murder as to the death of Angel Woolf. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s your verdict. Well, there\u2019s an issue there because what does that leave us to do with Ay-den Woolf? Well,' let me tell you. You\u2019re back really in the same boat. If you find intentional murder as to Angel Woolf, you\u2019ve got to do something with Ayden Woolf. All right. If you find, however, that Ayden Woolfs death was not intentional murder, let me just throw this out. I\u2019m just giving you an example. If you find you think that it was intentional murder of intentional murder of Angel but you think it was manslaughter as to Ayden, that then would not be .the intentional murder of two or more people pursuant to a common scheme because you\u2019ve already said Ayden you think it was manslaughter. So what you do is go to page two. Let\u2019s flip that. Then that is the lesser includ-eds as it applies to Ayden. Reckless manslaughter is the first one, criminally negligent homicide is the second one and not guilty is the third. Those are your options.. All right. Let me get to one that\u2019s going to kind of throw you. If under the instructions I have given you on count, one you find the Defendant intentionally murdered Ayden Woolf who is a child less than fourteen but find the Defendant is guilty of one of the lesser included offenses regarding the death Angel Woolf, you should mark the front page of the verdict form as to one of the lesser includeds regarding Angel and consider nothing on the second page of that form but rather proceed to the single verdict form which is the verdict form for count two, .,. The reason we did it this way, there\u2019s a possibility of what we call inconsistent verdicts. If you found that you think the State proved that the Defendant intentionally murdered Ayden Woolf but you don\u2019t think they proved that he intentionally murdered Angel, then by law they haven\u2019t proved count one of the indictment, the intentional murder of two or more people pursuant to a single course or act, because you found you don\u2019t think that Angel was intentionally murdered. What you do then is you find if he\u2019s guilty of a lesser included offense or not guilty you would mark the first page. We, the jury, find the Defendant, Michael Bragg Woolf, guilty of the lesser included offense of murder involving the . death of Angel Woolf or, we, the jury, find the Defendant, Michael Bragg Woolf, guilty of the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter as to the death of Angel Woolf or, we, the jury, find the Defendant, Michael Bragg Woolf, guilty of the lesser included offense of heat of passion manslaughter as to the death of Angel Woolf or, we, the jury, find the Defendant not guilty. But if you found that the problem is you\u2019ve already said you thought, under that line of thinking, that he intentionally mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>dered Ayden. Well, the intentional murder of a child less than 14 is capital. So count two is what? Count two, capital murder, murder of a victim less than fourteen years of age. That\u2019s why this gets a little convoluted. I\u2019m not telling you which ones to pick. But what I\u2019m trying to instruct you on is that if you pick some it automatically precludes you from picking others and I think the way we\u2019ve got it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">(R. 2216-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The jury, therefore, had the option of using the second page of the verdict form for count I to find Woolf guilty of the lesser-included offenses of reckless manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide regarding the death of Ayden and using the single-page verdict form for count II to find Woolf guilty or not guilty of the capital murder of Ayden. If the jury rejected the lesser-included offenses listed on the verdict form for count I and found Woolf guilty of intentionally killing Angel and Ayden, Woolf would by default have been guilty of count II because Ayden was younger than 14 years of age \u2014 a fact not contested by Woolfs defense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(15), Ala.Code 1975. Thus, contrary to Woolfs contention on appeal, the use of these forms did not prevent the jury from considering whether Woolf lacked the intent to kill Ayden.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In charging the jury on count I, the circuit court correctly stated that \u201c[a] defendant commits an intentional murder of two or more persons, if ... he intends to kill each of those persons.\u201d (R. 2189-90.) The trial court further instructed the jury that in order to find Woolf guilty as to count I, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Woolf had intentionally caused the deaths of both Angel and Ayden. The circuit court explained reckless manslaughter and told the jury that \u201c[tjhis lesser included offense applie[d] to both Angel Woolf and Ayden Woolf.\u201d (R. 2196.) The trial court also instructed the jury on criminally negligent homicide, informing them that \u201c[tjhis applies just to Ayden.\u201d (R. 2201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In sum, as to Ayden\u2019s death, the circuit court\u2019s instructions gave the jury the options of finding Woolf guilty of capital murder, guilty of the lesser-included offenses of reckless manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or not guilty. Thus, the circuit court\u2019s instructions were not inconsistent with <em>Beck v. Alabama, supra, </em>and, because the circuit court correctly instructed the jury on the lesser-included offenses, Woolf was not prejudiced.

Woolfs argument on appeal is that he was entitled to a heat-of-passion-manslaughter charge based on evidence that, <em>before </em>he shot either Ayden or Angel, he and Angel argued and she grabbed his arm. Woolf testified that he shot Ayden when, while he was arguing with Angel and after she grabbed his arm, \u201c[he] shot the gun towards \u2014 behind me and towards the floor to scare her.\u201d (R. 1902.) When asked why he then shot \u201cAngel at that point,\u201d Woolf testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (R. 1902.) During cross-examination Woolf was asked about whether his reaction to seeing Ay-den after he had been shot was \u201cto turn around and shoot [his] wife\u201d and Woolf replied, \u201cYeah, she was screaming at me.\u201d (R. 1943.) Defense counsel, on re-direct, asked Woolf whether \u201cthe shooting of Angel [was done] in [the] heat of passion\u201d and he replied, \u2018Yeah.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (R. 1959.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Woolfs position is untenable and inconsistent with controlling caselaw. Although <em>Rogers, supra, </em>recognizes that a heat-of-passion-manslaughter charge is appropriate when an accused has <em>witnessed </em>an assault on a family member, we know of no authority that establishes that a defendant is entitled to such a charge when <em>the defendant </em>is the actor who <em>committed </em>the assault \u2014 indeed, such a principle would violate the definition of provocation, which includes \u201ctreatment by another\u201d as discussed in <em>McDowell, supra. </em>We likewise know of no authority that suggests that a father who, in response to a mother\u2019s grabbing of his arm during a heated argument, shoots his own child \u2014 accidently or otherwise \u2014 may then claim that his immediate shooting' of the mother presents a situation constituting adequate legal provocation in which a heat-of-passion-manslaughter charge would be warranted. As this Court stated in <em>Biggs v. State, </em>441 So.2d 989 (Ala. Crim.App.1983): \u201cTo constitute adequate legal provocation, it must be of a nature calculated to influence the passions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of the ordinary, reasonable man.\u201d 441 So.2d at 992. <em>See also McDowell, </em>740 So.2d at 468 (\u201c\u2018Provocation has been defined as that treatment by another which arouses anger or passion, which produces in the minds of persons ordinarily constituted the highest degree of exasperation, rage, anger, sudden resentment, or terror. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>129 Wis. 146, 108 N.W. 65 (1906).\u2019 <em>Nelson v. State, </em>511 So.2d 225, 240 (Ala.Crim.App.1986)....\u201d (additional citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Because there was no evidence of a recognized legal provocation before the shooting of Angel, no factual basis justified giving an instruction on heat-of-passion manslaughter as to Angel. Consequently, the circuit court\u2019s error, if any, was in giving a heat-of-passion-manslaughter charge at all as to Angel \u2014 not in failing to give an instruction regarding the State\u2019s burden of disproving the absence of heat-of-passion. Woolf is due no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Woolf argues that the circuit court erred when it instructed the jury that intent could be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon while not instructing them that the jury had to consider all the circumstances of the shooting. Woolf specifically argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions \u201ccreated an unlawful presumption of specific intent to kill based solely on the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 90.) Woolf did not object to the instruction of which he complains; therefore, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See </em>Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The circuit court provided the following instruction during the guilt phase of Woolfs trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201cA person acts intentionally when it is his purpose to cause the death of another person. The intent to kill must be real and specific. Intent can be formed in an instant. It need not be preplanned or premeditated. There is no requirement in the law that the intent to kill be formed well in advance of committing a crime. The requisite intent may be formed immediately before a crime is committed. Intent can be inferred by the use of a firearm or other type of deadly weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">(R. 2190-91.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">\u201cIt is well settled that an instruction that the jury <em>may infer </em>intent from the surrounding circumstances, like the instruction here, is permissible and proper. See, e.g., <em>Ex parte Burgess, </em>827 So.2d 193, 199 (Ala.2000) (\u2018An instruction that \u201cintent to commit murder may be <em>presumed, </em>from the defendant\u2019s act of using a deadly weapon,\u201d would unconstitutionally shift to the defendant the burden of proving lack of specific intent.... The correct instruction on this particular point would be that intent to kill may be <em>inferred </em>from the defendant\u2019s act of using a deadly weapon.\u2019); and <em>McNabb v.

Because Woolf raised no objection to the supplemental jury charge, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See </em>Rule 45A, Ala.

Y\u2019all be seated. One thing I\u2019m going to ask you. I\u2019ve got your verdict form from you. I\u2019ve got the verdict entered on the\u2014 involving count one. And you should have a verdict on count two because of the verdict you have on count one.

We just felt like, you know, and it may have been just been a miscommunication on us. We thought if we had the verdict on count one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I don\u2019t want you to say too much but the verdict you entered on count two would allow you to enter a verdict \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. The verdict you entered on count one would allow you to enter a verdict on count two. It wouldn\u2019t result in inconsistent verdicts. So let me give that back to all. And just for the record, that would be [jury foreman\u2019s name] who\u2019s talking; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\u201cJUROR [jury foreman\u2019s name]: Yes, sir.

State, </em>416 So.2d 760, 762 (Ala.Crim.App.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">As discussed in Part VII of this opinion, the circuit court used two verdict forms. The first verdict form, which dealt with count I, consisted of two pages and allowed the jury to find Woolf guilty of capital murder, guilty of three lesser-included offenses regarding Angel, guilty of two lesser-included offenses regarding Ayden, or not guilty. The second form consisted of one page and gave the jury the opportunity to find Woolf guilty or not guilty of count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">The record demonstrates that the trial court went to great lengths to accurately explain the use of the forms to the jury. In so doing, it informed the jury that, if it found Woolf guilty of count I, it should indicate so on the first page of the count I form and move on to the second form. The circuit court also informed the jury that if it found Woolf guilty of the intentional murder of Ayden but of a lesser-included offense involving Angel, it should appropriately mark the first form and move to the second form.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">After being informed the jury had reached a verdict, the circuit court announced that, because of the \u201cpossibility of an inconsistent verdict,\u201d \u201cthis [would be] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>one of the times [it would] first get the verdict form and look at it and give it back to the foreperson to read.\u201d (R. 2249.) The above-quoted exchange between the circuit court and jury demonstrates that the jury misunderstood the court\u2019s instructions. The circuit court then merely instructed the jury that its verdict \u201con count one would <em>allow </em>[it] to enter a verdict on count two.\u201d (R. 2250) (emphasis added.) Considered in context, the circuit court did not coerce a verdict on the second count; rather, it cleared up a misunderstanding the jury had regarding its instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\n<em>Penalty-Phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUSM\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Woolf contends that <em>Ring v.

Specifically, while acknowledging the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ex parte Waldrop, </em>859 So.2d 1181 (Ala.2002), Woolf: (1) \u201cdisagrees with <em>Waldrop\u2019s </em>holding that the Sixth Amendment does not require a jury to unanimously conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances because the weighing process is a \u2018moral\u2019 judgment rather than a determination requiring a quantum of proof\u2019; (2) argues that <em>\u201cWaldrop </em>imper-missibly eases the State\u2019s burden of proving that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment by holding that the jury need not be unaware that its culpability phase finding alone may authorize the trial judge to impose the death penalty in certain cases\u201d; and (3) argues that <em>Waldrop </em>\u201cundermines the reliability of the capital sentencing process and unfairly skews sentencing toward the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d (Woolfs brief, pp. 106-08.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In <em>Waldrop, </em>the Alabama Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anf-dedup-0\"><em>\u201cRing </em>and <em>Apprendi [v.

Alabama law requires the existence of only one aggravating circumstance in order for a defendant to be sentenced to death. Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-5-45(f). The jury in this case found the existence of that one aggravating circumstance: that the murders were committed while Waldrop was engaged in the commission of a robbery. At that point, Waldrop became \u2018exposed\u2019 to, or eligible for, the death penalty. The trial court\u2019s subsequent determination that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel is a factor that has application only in weighing the mitigating circumstances and the aggravating circumstances, a process that we held earlier is not an \u2018element\u2019 of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\"><em>Waldrop, </em>859 So.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Although Woolf may disagree with <em>Wal-drop, </em>\u201c\u2018[t]his Court has no authority to overrule Alabama Supreme Court precedent.\u2019\u201d <em>Lane v.

The circuit court listed each of the mitigating circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 13A-5-51, Ala. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Code 1975, and specifically found that none of those mitigating circumstances existed. (C. 79-81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The circuit court then noted that Woolf had \u201cclaimed either during trial or during the sentencing] hearing a number of non-statutory mitigating circumstances,\u201d and proceeded to address those circumstances, (C. 81.) The circuit court noted that it had considered Woolfs history of alcohol and drug abuse and that it had considered testimony regarding Woolfs asserted learning disabilities, \u201ca borderline personality disorder and [that Woolf] possibly is bi-polar,\u201d as well as Woolfs having an intelligence quotient of 74. (C. 81.) The circuit court, acknowledging the sentencing hearing testimony of Woolfs mother, also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXAr\">\u201cAt the sentencing hearing on February 4, 2011, [Woolfs] mother Mrs. Lynn Tullos pleaded for her son\u2019s life. From evidence presented during the trial it is apparent that Mrs. Tullos did everything she could for her son in order to make him a productive member of society. [Woolfs] actions rest solely on him and no one else. Blame and guilt cannot and should not be heaped upon [Woolfs] mother, his upbringing, or a learning disability. As human beings with free wills we are all responsible for our own acts and we must be held, accountable for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">(C. 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Although the circuit court stated that it considered each of the above, the circuit court did not specifically state whether it found any of that evidence to be a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance. <em>See Spencer v.

Moreover, although the circuit court\u2019s order briefly references Woolfs \u201cupbringing;\u201d this reference does not indicate whether the circuit court found the evidence of Woolf s family background to be a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance and if so, whether it considered that evidence wheri it weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the jury\u2019s recommendation in its determination that death was the appropriate sentence in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A41\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cAs this Court stated in <em>Roberts v.

State, </em>220 So.3d 338, 388 (Ala.Crim.App.2014); <em>see </em>\u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(10), Ala.Code 1975 (making capital the killing of two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct), and \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(15), Ala.Code 1975 (making capital the killing of a victim less than 14 years of age). This Court, however, remanded \u201cthis case for the circuit court to amend its sentencing order to clarify its findings regarding the nonstatu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tory mitigating circumstances\u201d and to \u201creweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and resentence Woolf.\u201d <em>Woolf, </em>220 So.3d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On remand, the circuit court held a re-sentencing hearing on May 15, 2014, at which it read, in open court, its amended sentencing order sentencing Woolf to death. On return to remand, this Court noticed a discrepancy between the written amended sentencing order of May 15, 2014, and the reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing at which the circuit court read its amended sentencing order. Specifically, the written amended sentencing order states: \u201c1. [Woolf] was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the capital offenses. Therefore, [\u00a7] 13A-5-49(l), Code of Alabama (1975) does <em>not </em>apply and is <em>not </em>considered.\u201d (Record on Return to Remand, C. 133 (emphasis added).) At the hearing, however, the circuit court stated: \u201c1. [Woolf] was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the capital offenses. Therefore, the Alabama Code Section 13A-5-49(l) <em>does </em>exist and <em>is </em>being considered.\u201d (Record on Return to Remand, R. 18 (emphasis added).) Accordingly, on March 19, 2015, we remanded the case by order for the circuit court to clarify this discrepancy. <em>See </em>Rule 10(g), Ala. R.App. P.; Rule 29, Ala. R.Crim. P.; <em>see also Sims v. State, </em>741 So.2d 1117 (Ala.Crim.App.1999). On return to second remand, the circuit court has submitted a \u201cclarification of amended sentencing order\u201d in which it amended paragraph 1 of the amended sentencing order to read: \u201c1. [Woolf] was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the capital offenses. Therefore, the Alabama Code Section 13A-5-49(l) does exist and is being considered.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Record on Return to Second Remand, C. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">In its amended sentencing order as clarified, the circuit court found that the State proved the existence of two aggravating circumstances: (1) That Woolf was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the murders and (2) that Woolf intentionally caused the death of two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13A-6-47(d), 13A-5-49(1), and 13A-5-49(9), Ala.Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">As to the statutory mitigating circumstances, the circuit court found none to exist. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-47(d) and 13A-5-51, Ala.Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">As to the evidence regarding nonstatuto-ry mitigating circumstances, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201c[Woolf] has claimed that he has abused alcohol and drugs throughout his \u25a0life.

The Court finds that this non-statutory mitigating circumstance <em>does exist.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cAdditionally, the defense offers Dr. Bennett\u2019s opinion that [Woolf] has a low I.Q. of 74; However, in the end Dr. Bennett testified that [Woolf] did not meet the legal standard for not guilty by ' reason of mental disease or defect. The Court has had [Woolf]- evaluated by Doug McKeown, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, who has reported that [Woolf] is functioning in the normal intelligence range and is competent to. stand trial. The Court is also of that opinion. The Court has considered this and taken that opinion.and Dr. Bennett\u2019s opinion into account. Taking both expert opinions into account the Court finds that this non-statutory mitigating circumstance <em>does not exist.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u201c[Woolfs] mother, Mrs. Lynn Tullos, testified at the hearing on February 4, 2011.

She told of her efforts to get him proper help in school-for some undiagnosed learning disability and all the obstacles she faced trying to get him help bec\u00e1use she felt something was wrong with him. Additionally, the emotional coldness, of [Woolfs] father, his lack of empathy, lack of emotions and, in general, partially dysfunctional family background partially 'contributed to [Woolfs] own unstable relationships. The Court finds that this non-statutory mitigating circumstance <em>does exist.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">(Record on Return to Remand, C. 136-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The circuit court also noted that it gave \u201cdue consideration and weight\u201d to the jury\u2019s 11-1 vote recommending a death sentence. (C. 137.) The circuit court thereafter reweighed the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances and, as noted, again sentenced Woolf to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">This Court granted Woolfs motion for leave to file a .brief on return to remand to address the circuit court\u2019s amended sentencing order; both Woolf and the State submitted briefs addressing the amended sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">In his brief on return to remand, Woolf identifies three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">Woolf argues first that \u201cthe trial court failed to consider the mitigating circumstance that Mr. Woolf has a low IQ.\u201d (Woolfs brief, p. 9.)

In its sentencing order, the trial court addressed each statutory mitigating circumstance listed in \u00a7 13A-5-51, Ala.Code 1975, and it determined that none of those circumstances existed under the evidence presented. <em>Although the trial court did not list and make findings as to the existence or nonexistence of each nonstatutory mitigating circumstance offered by Clark, as noted above, such a listing is not required, and the trial court\u2019s not making such findings indicates only that the trial court found the offered evidence not to be mitigating, not that the trial court did not consider this evidence. </em>Clearly, the trial court considered Clark\u2019s proffered evidence of mitigation but concluded that the evidence did not rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance. The trial court\u2019s findings in this regard are supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u2018\u201c\u201cBecause it is clear from a review of the entire record that the trial court understood its duty to consider all the mitigating evidence presented by Clark, that the trial court did in fact consider all such evidence, <em>and that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence, </em>we find no error, plain or otherwise, in the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the statutory and nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u201c \u2018896 So.2d at 652-53 (emphasis added).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\"><em>\u201cEx parte Lems, </em>24 So.3d at 545.

Thus, in determining that no nonstatutory mitigating circumstances existed other than the jury\u2019s recommendation of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the trial court clearly considered all the evidence presented by Stanley. Stanley has not demonstrated that he is entitled to relief on this claim. <em>See Lems, supra; Spencer, supra; Clark, supra\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><em>Stanley, </em>143 So.3d at 327-30 (opinion on remand from the Alabama Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, the circuit court did not prevent Woolf from presenting evidence regarding his purported ability to adapt well to prison life. The circuit court\u2019s order, although it does not specifically list that evidence, indicates that the circuit court considered all the evidence Woolf offered in the penalty phase, Woolf is not entitled to relief on this claim. <em>Stanley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Woolf next challenges certain statements in the amended sentencing order that Woolf had \u201cfree will.\u201d In relevant part, the amended sentencing order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201cThe Court ordered, received and reviewed a written presentence report. On February 4, 2011, in open Court, the State and [Woolf] were offered the right to present arguments concerning the pre-sentence report which each did as well as witnesses and other evidence concerning [Woolfs] sentence. The State and [Woolf] each presented argument concerning the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and as to the appropriate sentence. At the sentencing hearing on February 4, 2011, [Woolfs] mother, Mrs. Lynn Tullos pleaded for her son\u2019s life. From evidence presented during the trial, it is apparent that Mrs. Tullos did everything she could for her son in order to make him a productive member of society. [Woolfs] actions rest solely on him and no one else. Blame and guilt cannot and should not be heaped upon [Woolfs] mother, his upbringing, or a learning disability. As human beings with free wills, we are all responsible for our own acts and we must be held accountable for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">\u201cDuring the sentence hearing ..., Michael Woolf spoke. While he admitted to having killed Angel and Ayden, he claimed that it was not intentional. Put another way, he has not lived up to his responsibility as a human being, as a husband, and above all as a father. He has refused to take legal and moral responsibility for his actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">\u201cIn order that the Court might fully consider the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing the Court recessed the February 4, 2011, sentencing hearing and continued it until February 17, 2011. The Court has considered all the evidence presented at trial, in the pre-sentence report and at the sentencing hearing....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">(Record on Return to Remand, C. 128-29.) Following these statements, the amended sentencing order then recounts the facts of the case and provides a detailed examination of the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Woolf contends that the statements regarding \u201cfree will\u201d in the above-quoted portion of the amended sentencing order demonstrate that the circuit court did not \u201cconsider fully\u201d the evidence offered in mitigation. He argues further that those statements indicate that the circuit court \u201cdenied [Woolf] the individualized sentencing the law demands.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">As the State points out, Woolfs counsel mentioned these statements after the circuit court read its sentencing order at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>hearing on May 15, 2014; specifically, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR WOOLF]: Judge, I just \u2014 We\u2019d like to state for the record our objection to this Court\u2019s failure to take appropriate notice of a couple of categories of mitigation.... including Mr. Woolfs family background and his diminished intellectual capacity....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well I may not have said it clear enough. But I did take into account his intellectual background. We had testimony from his expert that gave him a 74 IQ, and kind of went into pretty detail on that. And you\u2019re saying failed to recognize it. I got you. It was contravening testimony. But I did listen to it. I just did not accept it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAbMy\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry.

I may not have put it as clearly but I spent some time looking at that so hold on just a second. And a lot of that came in through Mrs. Tullos because I really did feel very sorry for her when she explained in detail what she had gone through trying to do these various things for her son. And where things fell off the wagon, who knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR WOOLF]: I believe Your Honor referenced his free will at one point. It\u2019s our contention that free will would not be \u2014 undercut his mitigation in any sense. Disregarding this Court\u2019s personal philosophy\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: That wasn\u2019t in the mitigation part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">\u201cI actually found that Mrs. Tullos in her description of the learning disabilities and the problems he faced in school and just in general and that something was wrong with him, that that was a non-statutory mitigating circumstance that I considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">\u201cSo I may not have expressed it well enough for you but-I did consider that. You\u2019re saying it one way and I\u2019m saying it a different way. But I have a clear recollection of the woman testifying and I found that that existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">(Record on Return to Remand, R. 26-29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">In view of the totality of the circuit court\u2019s amended sentencing order and the penalty-phase proceedings, Woolfs claim challenging the circuit court\u2019s statements about \u201cfree will\u201d and human responsibility and accountability is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">Because we were remanding this case, this Court previously pretermitted a plain-error review of Woolfs sentencing proceedings as well as a review pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-53, Ala.Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">The record does not indicate that Woolfs sentence of death was imposed as the result of the influence of passion, prejudice, or an other arbitrary factor. \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(1), Ala.Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">Additionally, the record supports the circuit court\u2019s findings concerning the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances, and the circuit court correctly found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The circuit court\u2019s amended sentencing order shows that it did not improperly weigh the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>and that it correctly sentenced Woolf to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">After independently weighing the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances, this Court concludes that Woolfs sentence of death is appropriate. \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(2), Ala.Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Further, considering both the crime and the defendant, Woolfs death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate, to the penalties imposed in similar cases. \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(3), Ala.Code 1975. <em>See, e.g., Luong v. State, </em>199 So.3d 173 (Ala. Crim.App.2015) (murder of four children all under the age of 14 years); <em>Gobble v. State, </em>104 So.3d 920 (Ala.Crim.App.2010) (murder of six-month old son); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>40 So.3d 753 (Ala.Crim.App.2009) (murder of six-month old son); <em>Blackmon v. State, </em>7 So.3d 397 (Ala.Crim.App.2005) (murder of two-year-old daughter); <em>Yeomans v. State, </em>898 So.2d 878 (Ala.Crim.App.2004) (murder of wife and her parents).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Finally, we have reviewed Woolfs sentencing proceedings pursuant to Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P., and have searched the entire proceedings for any plain error or defect that has or probably has adversely affected any of Woolfs substantial rights. We have found no such plain error or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Accordingly, Woolfs sentence of death is due to be, and is hereby, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">AFFIRMED AS TO SENTENCING.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-10\">WINDOM, P.J., and WELCH, KELLUM, and BURKE, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Note from the' reporter of decisions: On March 19, 2015, the Court of Criminal Appeals remanded this case by order for clarification of the sentencing order submitted by the trial court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\">. Judge Joseph Johnston presided over Woolf\u2019s trial and sentencing and entered the amended sentencing order on the first remand.

Wood entered an order continuing the matter until April 13, 2015. On April 13, 2015, Judge Wood conducted a hearing at which Woolf, Woolf's counsel, and counsel for the State were present. According to a discussion between Judge Wood and the attorneys present at that hearing, Judge Johnston had either retired or was in the process of retiring at the time of the hearing. (Record on Return to Second Remand, R. 12.) Judge Wood admitted into evidence an affidavit dated April 9, 2015, from Judge Johnston in which Judge Johnston stated that the written amended sentencing order included a clerical error. Judge Johnston\u2019s affidavit states that \"the amended sentencing order should read as follows: '1. [Woolf] was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the capital offenses. Therefore, Alabama Code Section 13A-5-49(l) does exist and is being considered.\u201d (Record on Return to Second Remand, C. 25.) Further, Judge Jphnston stated in his affidavit that he \"did, in fact, find that [Woolf] was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the capital offenses.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
