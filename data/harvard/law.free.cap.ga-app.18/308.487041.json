The plaintiff in error insists that under the charter of the city the ordinances of the City of Savannah are cognizable as State statutes. This court is bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the State, and in the ease of <em>Mayor &amp;c. of Savannah </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>142 <em>Ga. </em>414 (83 S. E. 109), in which counsel for both the plaintiff and the defendant cited an ordinance of the City of Savannah as throwing light on the question at'issue; it was held: \u201cThis court can not take judicial cognizance of the existence of the ordinances of a municipality, on demurrer, where such ordinances are not pleaded or set out.\u201d Therefore the ordinances should have been before the reviewing court in order that the court might intelligently pass upon the case. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>City of Atlanta, </em>125 <em>Ga. </em>697 (54 S.
