J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">The action was brought against the defendant, as publisher of the World, to recover .damages for libel. The plaintiff recovered a verdict of $1,060, and the defendant appeals from the judgment entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The plaintiff, who is a lawyer, made a complaint before Police Justice Hogan, and procured the arrest of one Griebel for sending through the mails a very vulgar and scurrilous message on a postal card addressed to him at his residence. This card was annexed to, and formed part of, the criminal complaint, and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">\u201cYou sucker, why don\u2019t you come and see me? You are afraid of me. You and your hitch woman dare not do it. Jail is a good place for you and your woman, you sucker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">The defendant, in an article purporting to report the proceedings In the police court, used these words:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">\u201cThe warrant charged Griebel with libel, based on a postal card he wrote to Miss -, accusing Willmann of being a scoundrel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">The article did not contain a copy of the postal card, which the defendant might legally have published, as a part of the criminal proceedings in the police court. At the close of all the evidence the court denied a motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">The court, in charging the jury, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">\u201cIn so far as the article, however, contains a defamatory characterization of the plaintiff outside of that judicial proceeding, the defendant cannot claim exemption, but is put to its proof, either to justify the publication, or to show facts in mitigation of the plaintiff\u2019s damage. Under the circumstances of this case, I instruct you that the use of the word \u2018scoundrel\u2019 in that article is libelous. While a card was written by Griebel, no such word as \u2018scoundrel,\u2019 or synonymous word, appeared on it, or on any postal card introduced in evidence; and to that extent, therefore, the article was not a just and true report of the proceedings, and hence you must accept it as libelous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">The court refused to charge the following requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">\u201cThat, if you find the article is substantially a true report of public and \u25a0official proceedings, you- must find a verdict for the defendant; there being no \u25a0evidence in the case that the defendant was actuated: by express malice in .publishing the article complained of. If you find that the effect of the words set forth-in the postal card complained of by Willmann was to charge him with being a scoundrel, and if you find that this postal card was the basis of the proceedings instituted by Willmann, then you must find a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">The defendant excepted to both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">Upon the complaint, the limitation in the charge, and the refusal to charge, it is evident that the theory of the complaint and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>trial was that the libel consisted only of the statement that the postal card charged the plaintiff with being a scoundrel. Section 1907 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an action, civil or criminal, cannot be maintained against the proprietor of a newspaper for the publication therein of a fair and true report of any judicial proceeding, without proof of actual malice in making the report; but section 1908 provides that this does not apply to any matter added by a person concerned in the publication, or in the-report of a thing said or done at the time and place of the proceedings, which was not a part thereof. There is no question that it is the province and duty of the court, where an article is free from ambiguity, to charge whether or not it is libelous. Townsh. Sland. &amp; L., \u00a7 286; Woodruff v. Bradstreet Co., 116 N. Y. 217, 22 N. E. 354, 5 L. R. A. 555. In Hunt an Bennett, 19 N. Y. 173, the court,, referring to English authorities, said (page 1-77):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cI cannot concur, however, in the idea they seem to establish, \u2014 that the judge may or may not, as he pleases, charge a jury as to whether a publication is libelous, especially if it be free from ambiguity. The rule is so-well settled that it has become a maxim, that \u2018it is the office of a judge to instinct the jury in points of law.\u2019 That office he should perform whenever a. legal proposition arises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Such a condition seems to have arisen in the case at bar. It was-a question of construction, \u2014 whether the language of the postal card could be interpreted as \u201caccusing the plaintiff of being a scoundrel.\u201d It is true that the word \u201cscoundrel\u201d was not used on the card, but the language thereon stated facts which were tantamount to an accusation that the plaintiff was a scoundrel. In this view, it was error for the court to refuse to dismiss the complaint, and to charge, as he did, that, because the word \"scoundrel\u201d did not appear on the postal card, its use was not a true report of the proceedings. Even if this view be incorrect, it was error for the court to refuse to charge the quoted requests of, the defendant, and thus submit to the jury the questions whether the article was substantially a true report, and whether the effect of the words of the postal card was to charge the plaintiff with being a scoundrel. Ho, whether we consider the cited charge of the court or its refusals to charge, there was error for which the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the-event. All concur, except BARTLETT, J., who takes no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
