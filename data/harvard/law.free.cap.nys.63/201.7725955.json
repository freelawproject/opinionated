Exhibit A is a mere authorization containing a statement of an agreement as to a payment if a loan should be obtained, and suggests a cover under which more might be sought than the statute permitted. There is no merit in the point that, through an amendment made after the agreement, the limit of compensation fixed by the statute was removed. The law in force at the time of the agreement governs the rights of the parties. Isola v. Weber, 147 N. Y. 329, 41 N. E. 704; Walker v. Walker, 155 N. Y. 77, 49 N.
