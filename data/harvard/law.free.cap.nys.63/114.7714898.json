On or about the 1st day of December, 1898, he presented his bill to the board of town auditors of the town of Hempstead for the rental of a certain building which has been used for town purposes. . This bill was rejected by the board, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>on the 22d day of December, 1898, the board completed its audit, and filed its certificate and abstracts with the supervisor of the town, and adjourned sine die. On the 19th day of April, 1899, the relator petitioned this court to cause to issue the writ of certiorari which is now before us for review. The rule is well established in this state that, to secure a review of the action of a board of town auditors by certiorari, the writ must be obtained while yet the board retains jurisdiction of the proceedings (People v. Board of Town Auditors, 74 Hun, 83, 86, 26 N. Y. Supp. 122); and as the writ in question was served upon the board after the certificate and abstracts had been delivered to the supervisor, and the board had adjourned sine die, we are of opinion that the writ is ineffectual and fruitless (Osterhoudt v. Rigney, 98 N. Y. 222, 230; People v. Auditors of Town of Hannibal, 65 Hun, 414, 418, 20 N. Y. Supp. 165; People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Queens Co., 82 N. Y. 275). If the contract with the town is valid, the relator is entitled to have it allowed. People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs, 56 Hun, 459,10 N. Y. Supp. 88. If there has been no adjudication by the town board upon the merits, the relator will be entitled to present the bill for audit to the incoming town board (Osterhoudt v. Rigney, 98 N. Y. 234; People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Rockland Co., 31 App. Div. 557, 52 N. Y. Supp. 89); or the relator may maintain an action thereon to enforce liability created by the contract (section 182, Town Law; chapter 569, Laws 1890). For reasons already stated, this proceeding cannot be maintained. The writ should therefore be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Writ of certiorari dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
