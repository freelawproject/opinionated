The defendant Schmidt signed the same on the 18th day of that month, agreeing to take $10,-000 of such stock. He was named as one of the directors of the- corporation, and on the organization of the board was elected its president; retaining the position until the alleged assignment of his interest in the corporation on the 18th day of May following. Contemporaneously with his execution of the certificate of incorporation said construction company, by said Schmidt, as its president, and also by its secretary, entered into a written agreement with said Schmidt whereby, in consideration of \u201cten thousand dollars, par value, of stock\u201d of said company, to be delivered to said Schmidt \u201cwhen the stock of said company is ready to be issued and delivered,\u201d he agreed to advance from time to tim\u00e9 money required in the conduct of its business, upon the order of the board of directors, up to the sum of $10,000. The sums so advanced \u201cshall be repaid in cash\u201d to said Schmidt \u201cimmediately upon the receipt and payment of such contracts for which such sums have been advanced.\u201d \" The defendant Schmidt contributed some money to the corporation, and indorsed its promissory notes, at the request of the directors. The exact amount of the said notes and of the said cash does not appear, but it aggregated nearly $10,000, all of which, however, were paid by the company. No stock book was ever kept by the corporation, and no certificates of stock were in fact ever issued to Schmidt, or to any of the incorporators of the company. On the 18th day of May, 1898, said Schmidt, by an assignment in writing, transferred to one Laing his interest in said concurrent contract providing for an issuance of the stock to him, and Laing assumed the burden of said agreement imposed upon Schmidt. The latter also authorized Laing to \u201cdischarge said contract without any further consent or agreement therefor by said William H. Schmidt,\u201d and Schmidt also released the company from any demands existing or subsequently accruing which might inure to him. Two days later said Laing transferred the interest thus acquired to the corporation, upon like condition, \u2014that he was to be released from all liability under its said agreement with Schmidt. This assignment was formally \u201caccepted\u201d -by resolution of the company, and.the Schmidt agreement rescinded. At the time of the assignment by Schmidt the company was insolvent, \u2014 a fact known to him. On the 14th day of September, 1898, the plaintiffs recovered a judgment against the defendant corporation for $305.17 damages. The basis of this was goods sold to it by them, \u2014 about one-half thereof being for machinery delivered prior to the alleged assignment by Schmidt, and the residue several months thereafter.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b660-5\">Argued before ADAMS, P.

The contention is that the defendant Schmidt is a debtor of the company to the amount of stock for which he agreed to pay $10,000, and that indebtedness is an asset of the corporation, and chargeable with the payment of its debts. It was not necessary that certificates of stock be issued to Schmidt, to constitute him a shareholder of the corporation. His subscription created that relation. Mor. Priv. Corp. par. 56; Kohlmetz v. Calkins, 16 App. Div. 518, 44 N. Y. Supp. 1031. He accepted the directorship and presidency, acted in these capacities, and assumed duties' in recognition of his connection with the company as stockholder by virtue of his subscription agreement, and he cannot now disclaim the existence of that connection. Wheeler v. Millar, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>N. Y. 353; Powers v. Knapp, 71 Hun, 371, 25 N. Y. Supp. 19. Article 3 in which the section o\u00ed the Code mentioned is found, provides a method for dissolution of a corporation, and also to enforce by action \u201cthe individual liability of the officers or members of a corporation.\u201d Section 1790 in this article permits the creditor to make the officers and members of said corporation parties, if they \u201care made liable by law, in any event or contingency, for the payment of his debt; * * \"\"\" and their liability may be declared and enforced by the judgment in the action.\u201d Sections 1792 and 1793 provide for the ascertainment of each defendant\u2019s liability, \u201cand for a distribution of the property of the corporation\u201d among its creditors; and, by section 1794, if the property of the corporation is inadequate to meet its obligations, the judgment \u201cmust adjudge that each stockholder pay into the board the amount due and remaining unpaid on the shares of stock held by him, or so much thereof as is necessary to satisfy the debts of the corporation.\u201d It will be observed that while the theory of this scheme is primarily the sequestration of the property proper of the corporation, at the instance of a creditor, yet, to prevent resort to another action, a stockholder may be included as a party. His liability need not depend upon the fact of his personal liability by virtue of his membership in the corporation, but, if it exists \u201cin any event or contingency,\u201d he may be brought in and made to respond. The claim in this action is that the defendant Schmidt owed the corporation the amount of his stock subscription, and that liability is sought to be enforced as a debt due the company, and hence amenable to its creditors. The enforcement of that indebtedness is within the letter and spirit of this article, and, as the suit is in equity, the rights of all the parties can very properly be adjusted in one action. As was said in Stoddard v. Lum, 159 N. Y. 265, at page 273, and 53 N. E. 1108, at page 1109:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">\u201cSubscribers to the stock of a corporation incur a debt which can be enforced by any common-law or equity remedy. The capital stock of a corporation is a fund set apart for the payment of its debts. It is a substitute for the personal liability which subsists in private co-partnerships. The creditors have a lien upon it in equity. Unpaid stock is as much a part of this pledge, and as much a part of the assets of the company, as the cash which has been paid in upon it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">It is urged on behalf of the defendant that he never was liable for the payment of this stock; that the agreement which accompanied his subscription must be read in connection therewith. That is probably true as to the parties to it, but not as to the creditors of the corporation. His-subscription was an absolute agreement to become a shareholder to the extent of $10,000. The certificate provided for a corporation within the business corporation law, and section 5 requires payment of one-half of the capital stock of such a corporation within one year from its incorporation; and by the Stock Corporation Law, \u00a7 41, each subscriber shall pay 10 per cent, of his subscription in cash. A secret agreement by which the shareholders can evade these mandatory statutes is against public policy, and will not be upheld against creditors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Yonkers Gazette Co. v. Jones, 30 App. Div. 316, 51 N. Y. Supp. 973; Armstrong v. Danahy, 75 Hun, 405, 27 N. Y. Supp. 60; Railroad Co. v. Eastman, 34 N. H. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Cook on Stocks &amp; Stockholders says at paragraph 137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cNeither party is permitted to prove a different contract from that expressed in the written instrument. Under the rule, not even a separate, written, contemporaneous contract is admissible to change the subscription contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">See, also, Id. \u00a7 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The defendant accepted offices and did acts permissible only by a stockholder. If his secret agreement were to be operative, he could receive the honors consequent upon his apparent ownership of one-half of the capital stock of this moneyless corporation, but hoist the agreement to prevent a creditor enforcing any demand against him. Had dividends been declared, his ownership o\u00ed capital stock would not have been questioned by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">It is urged with much plausibility that, even if Schmidt be a stockholder, the remedy adopted by the plaintiff is not the proper one, but his action should have been under section 54 of the stock corporation law; that plaintiff has no better standing than the corporation itself, and, as all the stockholders fathered the private agreement, no action would lie at its instance against Schmidt to recover his stock subscription. As I have already sought to show, the purpose of the statute is more extended than might be inferred from section 1784 of the Code, taken by itself. Beyond the sequestration of the property of the corporation in its custody, the relief reaches out for whatever liability can be acquired. Nor is this restricted to what technically belongs to the corporate entity, but liability \u201cfor the payment of the debt\u201d of the creditor is one of the tests for malting a stockholder a party. It is asserted that an action under section 54 of the stock corporation law would have enabled defendant to assail the verity of the judgment. Section 55 of that law makes the recovery of a judgment and the issuance of an execution necessary preliminaries to an action against the stockholder, \u201cand the amount due on such execution shall be the amount recoverable, with costs against the stockholder.\u201d If the judgment is incorrect in amount or collusively obtained, whether the action be pursuant to the Code provisions or to the stock corporation law, an opportunity may be given to test its validity. The plan outlined-in the Code does not in terms make the judgment conclusive against?a stockholder. If such be the fact, however, then, as in the other case, it may be incumbent upon him to apply to reopen the judgment and defend. However, that question does not seem to be-specifically raised in this case. All* the facts appear upon which the defendants\u2019 liability can be established in either case, and the-discussion of what remedy should have been resorted to is somewhat academic, as the relief granted in this suit, in connection with the stipulation, protects the rights of all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">We come now to a question of considerable difficulty in this somewhat intricate case. On the 11th day of May the defendant Schmidt assigned and transferred all his interest arising under his agreement, and that was ratified by the directors of the corporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>One-half of the judgment debt was incurred subsequent to this transfer, and it is strenuously contended that the assignment ended the liability of this defendant. Section 48 of the stock corporation law provides that every transfer of the stock in a corporation \u201cin contemplation of its insolvency\u201d shall be void. It has been held, however, that a transfer in good faith, and even where the stock had not been fully paid up, is valid against future creditors. Sinclair v. Fuller, 158 N. Y. 607, 53 N. E. 510; Land Co. v. Raymond, 158 N. Y. 576, 53 N. E. 507; Close v. Brady, 4 Misc. Rep. 474, 24 N. Y. Supp. 567, affirmed in 144 N. Y. 648, 39 N. E. 493. There is, however, another obstacle preventing defendant from being released. The stock corporation law requires every stock corporation to keep a stock book, and section 29 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">\u201cNo transfer of stock shall he valid as against the corporation, its stockholders and creditors, for any purpose, except to render the transferee liable for the debts of the corporation according to the provisions of this chapter, until it shall have been entered in such book as required by this section, by an entry from and to whom transferred. Such latter book shall be presumptive evidence of the facts therein so stated in favor of the plaintiff, in any action or proceeding against such corporation or any of its officers, directors or stockholders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The authorities have given full effect to this provision. Johnson v. Underhill, 52 N. Y. 203; Shellington v. Howland, 53 N. Y. 371; Powers v. Knapp, 71 Hun, 371-377, 25 N. Y. Supp. 19; Thomp. Corp. \u00a7 3284.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The following is from Shellington v. Howland, 53 N. Y. 371, at page 376:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201cAn entry upon the books of registry of stockholders is required for the protection of the company and its creditors, and each may hold the stockholders to- their liability as such until they have devested themselves of the title to their shares by a completed transfer as prescribed by law. No secret transfer will avail to release the stockholder from his obligations, or deprive the creditors of the corporation of the right to look to him as the responsible party liable for the debts of the corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Ho stock was ever issued to the defendant Schmidt, and no stock book was ever kept, and these facts are urged to relieve him from this rule. He was responsible very largely for these conditions. He owned one-half the stock, and was both director and president. The issuing of the stock certificates and the keeping of the stock books in compliance with the corporation law rested with him. He cannot while in control violate the explicit mandates of the statute, and then assert this violation in exoneration of himself from liability. The case differs from Bank v. Colwell, 132 N. Y. 250, 30 N. Y. Supp. 644, as there the defendant was not responsible for the failure to procure the transfer book, and the record in fact was made long before the debt in question was incurred. The whole facts surrounding this transaction tend to cast an imputation upon the good faith of the defendant Schmidt. He subscribed for a large block of this stock, and was vigilant in the management of the company\u2019s affairs. He sought by a secret agreement to obtain the stock substantially as a gratuity. Under his management there were no books from which creditors could obtain any light as to the ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the capital stock. The only information available to them was the certificate of incorporation, which indicated that Schmidt was the bona fide owner of one-half of its capital: and this continued to be the sole source of information accessible to those dealing with the company, even after the agreement between Schmidt and Laing. In a few months the corporation became insolvent. The defendant then assigned his stock to another stockholder, and two days later this transferee dumped it on the corporation. The conclusion seems clear that Laing was a man of straw, to act as Schmidt\u2019s medium to get his stock foisted onto- the company. In his agreement with Laing he released the corporation from any demands accruing to him against it, thus foreshadowing the assignment of Laing to the company. That Schmidt was liable for the outstanding debts is plain, and, in view of the unsavory flavor of the transfer, I. am satisfied that he failed to terminate his relations with the corporation. \u00a1Neither the collateral agreement nor the written transfer to Laing refers to the subscription contract. Within the strict letter of these papers, we might say that neither includes the stock accruing to Schmidt by virtue of his contract to take and pay for $10,000, par value, of capital stock of this company. I am satisfied, however, that the intention of the parties was to embrace in each agreement the stock contract, and have so assumed in considering the case. The defendant Schmidt did not in his answer attack the judgment. He did not seek to have it reopened, and his liability limited to that portion incurred prior to his attempted transfer; and it is doubtful if he is now in a position to claim that he was relieved by his assignment, in any event. There is no defense of defect of parties, and no claim now that the other stockholders should be brought in. The stipulation of the defendant Schmidt, and the payment by him to a third party, debar him from maintaining that undue advantage may be given to the plaintiff over other creditors of the corporation, and the judgment aims to guard their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
