The provision of section 1373 of the Greater New York charter that the clerks and assistant clerks \u201cshall be appointed by the justice elected or appointed from said district, as hereinbefore provided, and shall hold office for the term of six years from the date of appointment,\u201d does not require any narrow or technical construction; nor is it necessary to hold that they were appointed by the legislature. The legislature has no constitutional right to appoint these officers, and all that it has attempted to do is to change the title of the office to which the justices had heretofore been elected, and to continue them in office for the terms for which they had been elected by the people. The provision of the charter quoted above did not intend to confer the appointing power merely upon those who were chosen to office by virtue of the provisions of the Greater New York charter, but upon the justices who were \u201celected or appointed from said district, as hereinbefore provided,\u201d and it was \u201chereinbefore provided\u201d that the \u201cjustices of the peace in the First, Second, and Third districts of the city of Brooklyn, in office on the first day' of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, shall continue for the remainder of the terms for which they were elected or appointed.\u201d Section 1352. Those officers were elected or appointed at the time the charter went into operation, and the only effect of the charter is to change the name of the office, and to regulate the duties, as it might have done with the justices of the peace. The holdover justices had all of the rights which belonged to those who were elected or appointed under the provisions of the charter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and, without passing upon the question of ethics involved, there is no doubt of the legal right of Justice Schnitzspan to make an appointment upon the happening of a vacancy at any time during his term of office, nor is there any doubt that the term of office of the appointee is for six years from the date of his appointment. The learned justice at special term has so fully covered the points involved that we do not consider it necessary to further discuss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
