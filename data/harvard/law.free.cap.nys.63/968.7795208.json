Schroeder has acquired property, and is now the owner of thousands of shares of stock in the Standard Gold Production Company, of Boulder county, Colorado, worth more than the sum of one thousand dollars.\u201d A second order for the examination of a judgment debtor will not be granted, except upon proof that he has since acquired property; and the allegation in the affidavit that the deponent verily believes the defendant has acquired property is insufficient. He should have stated the grounds for that belief, and, having failed to do so, the affidavit is defective, and the motion to dismiss the proceeding should have been granted. Pierce v.
