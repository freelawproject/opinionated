Prior to March 1, 1893, the defendant and one William J. Howden were engaged in business as co-partners. The plaintiff bought out the interest of the defendant in said co-partnership, and continued the business with Howden, the firm name being Howden &amp; Petty. Plaintiff\u2019s agreement to purchase defendant\u2019s interest in the firm was-embodied in a written instrument, which involved an express guaranty as to the cost price of the stock of goods on hand, and what is claimed to be a guaranty as to the amount of the liabilities of the firm. It is for the breach of these guaranties that the action is brought. We think that, although the agreement did not contain the word \u201cwarrant\u201d or \u201cguaranty\u201d with reference to the debts, it was in fact, as to these debts, a guaranty that they did not exceed the sum stated in the agreement. No particular' phraseology is necessary to constitute a warranty, if it be an assertion upon which the vendee relies, and which is designed to be a positive assertion, and not the expression of an opinion. Canning Co. v. Metzger, 118 N. Y. 265, 23 N. E. 372. The other exceptions taken by appellant present no question requiring the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
