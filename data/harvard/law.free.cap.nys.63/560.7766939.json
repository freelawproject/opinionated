This statement is alleged to be untrue, for the reason that there were certain other buildings, therein specified, which were alleged to have been at that time exclusively occupied as dwellings. The petition further alleges the compliance with the statutory requirements and the payment of the tax by the respondent, and that, in reliance upon said statement, liquor-tax certificate No. 10,583 was on or about the 12th day of November, 1898, issued to the respondent; \u201cand subsequently, by reason of the said verified statement, and in reliance, as aforesaid, a certain other liquor-tax certificate (No. 6,969) was on or about the 1st day of May, 1899, issued by the said special deputy commissioner of excise to\u201d the respondent. On the return day of the order an order of reference was made, and respondent filed an answer pursuant to said order, in which the allegation that the liquor-tax certificate sought to be \u2022 revoked was granted by reason of and in reliance upon the said statement was denied, and, further, that the respondent had obtained and filed with the special deputy commissioner of excise the properly executed and acknowledged consent of more than two-thirds of the buildings alleged to be used exclusively as dwellings, the nearest entrance to which is within 200 feet of No. 9 Richardson street. From the evidence taken before the referee, it clearly appears that the respondent did make a false statement of a material fact in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>original application; that at the time of making the declaration required by subdivision 8 of section 17 of the liquor-tax law, as amended by section 10 of chapter 812 of the Laws of 1897, there were several buildings, the nearest entrances of which were within 200 feet, measured in a straight line, of the nearest entrance to the premises occupied by the respondent. It also appeared that in the declaration of the respondent, made upon the occasion of his application for the liquor-tax certificate which is now sought to be canceled, he relied upon and specifically referred to his original declaration as the foundation for his right to' the certificate now under consideration. Subdivision 8, referred to above, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cWhenever the consent required by this section shall have been obtained and filed as herein provided, unless the same be given for a limited term, no further or other consent for trafficking in liquor on such premises shall be required -so long as such premises Shall be continuously occupied for such traffic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">When, on the occasion of the second application, the respondent was asked questions bearing upon those points, he relied upon the previous application. It is admitted that no consents were filed as required by law until after the present proceeding was instituted; and on the 1st day of May, 1899, the respondent, in making the statement necessary to procure the certificate now under consideration, answered the questions submitted upon the blanks provided by the excise department as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">Sixteenth question: \u201cHow many buildings occupied exclusively as dwellings are there, the nearest entrance to which is within two hundred feet, measured in a straight line, of the nearest entrance to the premises where the traffic in liquors is intended to be carried on?\u201d Answer: \u201cRenewal not required by law.\u201d In the original statement he had answered, \u201cNone.\u201d Eighteenth question: \u201cHas the applicant attached hereto the consents required by section 17 of said law?\u201d Answer: \u201cNot required by law.\u201d In the original application he had answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Nineteenth question (a): \u201cIf the applicant relies upon consents given heretofore, in what month and year, and upon whose application statement, were such consents filed?\u201d Answer: \u201cApplication statement of applicant filed November 1, 1898.\u201d Question (b): \u201cDo such consents given heretofore, together with those filed herewith, cover and relate to two-thirds of the above buildings?\u201d No answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWt\">With this state of facts before us, we are unable to concur in the conclusion reached by the learned court below, that \u201cthe false application could not have been used to get the existing. license. <em>No </em>part of the law to that effect is pointed out.\u201d Either the respondent had no right to the certificate, by reason of his failure to show that the premises were not within the limits fixed by law, of buildings occupied exclusively as dwellings, or that he had the required consents, or else the original application was made use of in the procurement of the certificate. In either event the respondent was not entitled to the privileges secured by the liquor-tax certificate. It is plain that the respondent was proceeding under the provisions of the last clause of subdivision 8 of section 17 of the liquor-tax law, as amended in 1897, and that the special deputy commissioner of excise understood that \u201cno further or other consent for trafficking in liquor on such premises\u201d was required. The statement under which the present certificate was granted related back to the orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>inal declaration, and is merely a reassertion of the false statement of a material fact. It is an effort on the part of the respondent to gain rights under an original misrepresentation of material facts, and it should not receive the sanction of this court. In re Johnson, 18 Misc. Rep. 498, 42 N. Y. Supp. 1074, does not present a parallel case. There the respondent had in good faith procured the consents required by law, except that by an error in calculation he had only one-lialf, instead of two-thirds, of the owners of the buildings, and the error was corrected as soon as the matter was brought to his attention. The court, in the exercise of an equitable discretion, declined to revoke the license. In the case at bar there is an entire lack of evidence of good faith on the part of the respondent, who must have known the facts, and who made no effort to conform to the law until after the present proceeding was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the liquor-tax certificate should be revoked and canceled, and the appellant should be awarded costs in the several stages of the proceedings. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
