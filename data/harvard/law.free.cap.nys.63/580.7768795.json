The terms of the statute are explicit. The action must be brought by the administrator or \u25a0executor (Oode Oiv. Proc. \u00a7 1902), and a release by the person appointed administrator, executed prior to his appointment, constitutes no defense to the cause of action. Stuber v. McEntree, 142 N. Y. 200, 36 N. E. 878. The damages are exclusively \u201cfor the benefit of the decedent\u2019s husband or wife, and next of kin; and, when they are collected, they must be distributed by the plaintiff, as if they were unbequeathed assets, left in his hands.\u201d Oode Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1903. The term \u201cnext of kin,\u201d as used in these sections, \u201cincludes all those entitled, under the provisions of law relating to the distribution of personal property, to share in the unbequeathed assets of a decedent.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1870-1905. The cause of action allowed is purely statutory, and did not exist at common law, and we must look to the statute exclusively for direction as to distribution of the sum recovered. I fully recognize the apparent inconsistency between the provisions of section 1904, that the damages awarded shall be \u201ca fair and just compensation for the pecuniary injuries resulting from the decedent\u2019s death, to the person or persons, for whose benefit the action is brought,\u201d and the direction of section 1903 that the damages collected, after the deduction of commissions, \u201cmust be distributed * * * as if they were unbequeathed assets\u201d; -but the latter direction is explicit, and, to my mind, susceptible of only one <em>t </em>construction. Let an order be\" presented on two days\u2019 notice in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b604-18\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
