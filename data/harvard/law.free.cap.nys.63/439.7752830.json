It is difficult to ascertain from the complaint itself, or from the brief of the respondent, upon this appeal, precisely what the cause of action is claimed by the respondent to be. At one time lie seems to claim that it is an action against the executor to recover a judgment upon plaintiff\u2019s claim. At another he seems to claim that the action is, under section 1837 et seq., Code Civ. Proc., against next of kin, legatees, heirs, and devisees. We may as well conclude that the action is brought, as the prayer for relief indicates, to have the plaintiff\u2019s claim declared to be a lien upon the surplus moneys, and to have the moneys awarded to the plaintiff thereon. It does not seem to us that the complaint is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to \u2022such relief in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">1. It is provided by section 2798 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in effect, that such surplus moneys, if they result from a sale of the real estate within four years after the issue of letters testamentary, must, after payment of all liens thereon existing at the time of the death, be paid into the surrogate\u2019s court, pursuant to section 2537; and by section 2537 it is provided that payment into the surrogate\u2019s court is made by paying to the county treasurer, to the credit of the estate. The complaint does-not show whether the sale from which this surplus arose took place within the four years or not. It does not state when the sale took place. And, more than this, the complaint does not show whether the surplus was paid into the supreme court or the surrogate\u2019s court. The allegation is that it was paid into the county treasury, and it would be in the treasurer\u2019s hands, whether paid into one court or the other. If the surplus is in the surrogate\u2019s court, or is entitled to be paid into that court, as provided by section 2798, of the Code of Civil Procedure, then the same can only be disposed of by the surrogate under proceedings prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, and this action to establish a lien thereon and to recover the same cannot be maintained. In this respect the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">2. The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under section 1837 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. It does not state what disposition, if any, the will made of the real estate, whether the executor or any of the defendants were given any interest therein, or whether the defendants were any of them next of kin, legatees, heirs, or devisees of the testator. Nor does the complaint show that the action was brought against all the heirs or devisees of the testator, as section 1846 requires the action to be brought. The complaint is not good, \u2014 -is entirely insufficient, \u2014 and defendants should not be compelled to answer and go to trial upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>such a pleading. If the plaintiff has a cause of action, he should set it out in his complaint, so that the defendants may understand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The judgment overruling the demurrer, appealed from, \u2019should he reversed, with costs of appeal, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, and with the usual leave to plead over upon payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
