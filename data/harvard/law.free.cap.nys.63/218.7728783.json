In his letter of the 1st of July, the defendant wrote the plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">\u201cIn all fairness to me', I suggest some allowance should he made me for the inconvenience myself and family will be put to by reason of the necessary repairs. I therefore suggest you allow me rent free from the time the repairs \u2022commence until the work is completely finished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">To this the plaintiff replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">\u201cI think that your request is a fair one, and will allow you to deduct the rent pro rata for the time that the work is going on which disturbs you materially. You can deduct the above allowance from the August rent.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">We are of the opinion that the landlord promised to allow the tenant to deduct for the time that the work on the premises was going \u25a0on. The evidence shows that it began on the 19th of July, and was not finished until the 28th of September, and that, in view of the agreement between the landlord and tenant above referred to, the tenant was entitled to a pro rata deduction for the time above specified. The landlord brought his proceeding to dispossess the defendant for the nonpayment of the rent for the whole of the month of September. It may be that the landlord was under no obligation to make any allowance to the defendant, but a claim for an allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>was made by the defendant, and was acquiesced in by the plaintiff, and the letters of July 1st and July 6th were, in effect, the settlement of a contest between plaintiff and defendant, and therefore the agreement of the plaintiff to allow a deduction was not without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the justice before whom the case was tried declined to allow defendant to show, among other things, that the work was not finished until the 19th of October, and gave the defendant an exception to this ruling. We are of the opinion that this also was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Judgment and order reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
