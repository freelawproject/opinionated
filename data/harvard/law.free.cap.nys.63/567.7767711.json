During the trial the trial justice said to the witness Johnston, while he was still on the witness stand, in the presence of the jury: \u201cI think you are the most unmitigated little scamp I ever saw, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>it will be lucky for you if you keep out ,of state\u2019s prison;\u201d to which plaintiff took an exception. Again, in his charge to the jury, the trial justice said: \u201cBut this Johnston, as I said during his examination, in my opinion is a most, unmitigated little scamp. * * * If you think he is to be believed, * * * you may. If you think he is to be believed, why then believe him. * * * Now, I have told you my opinion of Johnston, but if you think Johnston has been corroborated by credible witnesses, then it is possible that even such a degraded little wretch as Johnston might tell the truth.\u201d To these remarks plaintiff's counsel asked the court to charge \u201cthat the observation made by your honor to the witness Johnston was improper, and would tend to prejudice the jury.\u201d The court declined so to charge, and plaintiff took an exception. The court then said: \u201cI do charge that it is extremely proper for me to say exactly what I did say. I also toll you, gentlemen of the jury, that you may have a different opinion on that subject, and it is your opinion that is to decide this case.\u201d Plaintiff excepted to this statement. Plaintiff also took an exception to the court\u2019s statement on that point, as repeated in his charge to the jury.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b592-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
