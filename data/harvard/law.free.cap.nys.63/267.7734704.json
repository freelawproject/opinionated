But as the agency was entirely disproved, and it was shown that Sroka was in possession of the premises under a contract of sale, and did the acts complained of upon his own responsibility and under his own right, there is no cause of action shown, as against the defendant, Levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
