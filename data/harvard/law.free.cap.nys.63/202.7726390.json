Fritz (decided Feb. 23, 1900) 62 N. Y. Supp. 775, and it was held that that act did not apply. That decision is controlling, and it follows that the complaint was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
