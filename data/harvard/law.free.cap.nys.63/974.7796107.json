Proc.), inasmuch as the appeal from the final judgment herein has been dismissed, the appeal from the intermediate order falls, and the motion to dismiss that appeal must therefore be granted, with $10 costs. The disposition thus far made of the appeal taken by the defendant herein now leaves for our consideration the appeal from the order of July 29, 1899. Upon a former hearing of the appeal it was held that the judgment was excessive, it being for a greater sum than the complaint justified; and, to that extent, we agree with the decision then made. The respondent now insists that the denial of the motion to set aside the inquest was a bar to the motion to vacate the judgment, but we do not agree with him in this contention. The two motions were aimed at different relief. The inquest was properly ordered, and the motion to set it aside properly denied. The defendant was not entitled to that relief, but when the judgment was entered, and it then appeared that the recovery was for more than the cause of action set forth in the complaint permitted, then the defendant was entitled to have the judgment so entered modified, and the recovery therein limited to the amount justified by the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">The order appealed from will be reversed, and the motion to vacate the judgment granted, without cos(s, unless within 10 days the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the judgment so that the plaintiff shall recover $153 principal, with interest thereon from January 1, 1897, together with the costs of the action, and a 5 per cent, extra allowance upon the amount of principal and interest, in which event the order of July 29, 1899, will be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
