This question was fairly submitted to the-jury through an impartial charge, and, as there was a conflict of' evidence upon it, and no preponderance, as matter of law, the verdict cannot be disturbed. There was no error in the admission of evidence, and Mr. Townsend was sufficiently connected with the matter. The record excites a fear that the jury came to a wrong-conclusion, but this will not suffice for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
