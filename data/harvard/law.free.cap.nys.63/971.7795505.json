This, of course, could not uphold such a determination. Baulec v. Railroad Co., 59 N. Y. 366. If any danger existed in the occupation of the injured person, he knew of it, and assumed the risk that was apparent. The testimony shows that he, best of all, was acquainted with the exact condition of his surroundings, and, if the conditions were as plaintiff contends, was certainly careless in his operations.

E. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">McCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
