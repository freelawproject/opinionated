The demurrer was overruled, and from the judgment thereafter entered this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">We are of the opinion that the demurrer was properly overruled. The jurisdiction of a court of equity to entertain an action to apportion the amount of a charge upon real estate between different owners is well settled. Such actions have heretofore been entertained by our courts for the apportionment of water rates. Graham v. Dunigan, 2 Bosw. 516; Linden v. Graham, 34 Barb. 316. It is, however, suggested by counsel for the appellant that a court of equity will not exercise the power which it possesses in this respect until the whole charge has been satisfied by an actual payment by the plaintiff, or his land has been taken in satisfaction of the charge; but we have been unable to find any authority to support this contention, and are unable to discover any principle to sustain it. All of the authorities seem to agree that the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tian Will be exercised where incumbrances are required to be paid, as well as where they have actually been paid, by some o\u00ed the parties in interest. Thus, in Willard, Eq. Jur. (Potter\u2019s Ed.) p. 133, it is said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\u201cAn important and beneficial exercise of equity power is found in cases of apportionment and contribution, when incumbrances, taxes, fines, and other charges on real estate are required to be paid off, or are actually paid off, by some of the parties in interest. In most cases of this sort there is no remedy at law from the extreme uncertainty of ascertaining the relative proportions which different persons having interests of different nature, quality, and duration in the subject-matter ought to pay. And, even when there is a direct remedy at law, it is inconvenient and imperfect, because it involves a multiplicity of suits, and opens\" the whole matter anew for contestation in every successive litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Substantially the same statement is made in Story, Eq. Jur. \u00a7 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In Graham v. Dunigan, supra, it is true that payment of the charge had there actually been made by the plaintiff before the action was commenced; but neither in that case nor in Linden v. Graham, supra, was the decision based upon that ground. No good or valid reason can be suggested for making the actual payment of the charge prior to the commencement of the action a condition precedent to its maintenance. Indeed, it is not difficult to see that such a rule might work great injustice in some cases, \u2014 for instance, where the owner of a very small portion of the land might be compelled to make a very large payment. The exercise of equitable jurisdiction does not depend upen actual payment. It is sufficient that there is a charge which attaches to all the land, and in which all the parties are interested, proportionate to- their respective holdings; and, when this appears, then any of the parties interested may maintain an action for a fair, just, and equitable apportionment among them. The plaintiff, by alleging the facts set out in the complaint, has brought himself within this rule. He alleges that there is a charge upon several parcels of land, which belong to different owners ; that this charge is unapportioned among them; that it cannot be apportioned in an action at law; and that there is no statutory authority by which that result can be reached by the municipal authorities. The amount which each of the owners ought to pay being undetermined, and there being no authority at law for the apportionment of the same, a court of equity will settle and determine that fact among the respective owners, when a suit is brought for that purpose by any one of the parties interested. It\u201emay well be that all of the relief which the plaintiff asks will not be granted. The sale of all of the property to pay two years\u2019 water rates may be unnecessary, and it may not be necessary to appoint a receiver; but, conceding both of those facts, it nevertheless appears from the facts alleged in the complaint that a proper case has been made out for apportionment of the charge for the water consumed upon the premises, and that alone prevents the complaint being dismissed upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. A complaint is not demurrable if the facts stated show that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>is entitled to any relief, either legal or equitable, upon the ground that the party has not demanded the precise relief to which he appears to be entitled. Wetmore v. Porter, 92 N. Y. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We are also of the opinion that the receiver of the hotel is not a necessary party. It is true that the complaint alleged that the water was furnished to the occupants and proprietor of the hotel, and that bills were rendered to them; but it is also true that it is alleged that the same were furnished with the knowledge and consent of the owners of the land, and, if there was no such allegation in the complaint, it does not necessarily follow that the lessee or the tenants would be liable for the water furnished. On the contrary, it has been decided that the occupants of real property in the city of Hew York are not personally liable to pay for water taken through meters upon the premises, in the absence of an express covenant to that effect in the lease. Moffat v. Henderson, 50 N. Y. Super. Ct. 211; Henderson v. Arbuckle, 54 N. Y. Super. Ct. 141. Here there is no allegation in the complaint to the effect that fhe lessee or occupants agreed to pay or were liable for the water furnished. Ho allegations are made from which that fact can fairly be inferred, and therefore it must be presumed that no such liability exists. There is, therefore, no reason for joining the receiver as a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Hor is the city a necessary party. Ho claim is made against the city by the plaintiff, and, if it were a party, it is clear that its rights could not be impaired by any determination that might be made in the action. It has a lien upon all of the lots for the entire charge, and any decree that might be made, or judgment rendered, in the action, could not add to or take from its right to enforce the charge against all or any part of the land. The action is brought, as already indicated, to settle and determine, among the respective owners, the proportionate amount of the charge which each should pay. The presence of the city as a party is not necessary for a complete determination of that question. A plaintiff cannot be compelled to bring in another party defendant, unless, as provided in section 452 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201ca complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties.\u201d It has been held that \u201ca complete determination of the controversy\u201d means where there are persons not parties whose rights must be ascertained and settled before the rights of the parties to the suit can be determined. Chapman v. Forbes, 123 N. Y. 538, 26 N. E. 3. Here the plaintiff and the defendants are the owners. of different lots of land, all of which are liable to pay to the city a certain specified charge. Action is brought to apportion that charge among the different owners, and they are the only persons who have any interest in the subject-matter of the litigation. The case is analogous to an action for the partition of the equity of redemption of land covered by a mortgage, in which case the mortgagee is not a necessary party.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">It follows that the demurrer was properly overruled, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs, with leave to the demurring defendant to withdraw the demurrer and interpose an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>answer within 20 days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">BABRETT and RUMSEY, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b776-6\">VAN BRUNT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABR\">I dissent. I cannot see how this action can be maintained. The prevailing opinion fails to give us any hint as to what particular judgment can be entered in this action, or how any one portion of the land upon which this water tax is a lien is to be relieved from the tax without the payment of the whole of the tax, or how payment is to be enforced in this action against any of the co-owners. It seems to me clear that the only remedy for the plaintiff is to pay the tax, and recover from the other owners their proportionate shares, if he wants to relieve his property from the lien of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">PATTERSON, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
