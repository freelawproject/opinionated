This allegation was denied by the-defendant. There was no evidence to show that defendant employed plaintiff, except such as is to be found in the cross-examinatian of the plaintiff himself. On his cross-examination he was asked whether the defendant employed him between the 25th of October and the 28th of October to furnish goods, wares, and merchandise, and perform certain services, and he answered that he did, on the 28th. If he was employed by the defendant on the 28th to render-the services that the evidence shows he did render, the defendant should pay. It is true that such employment was denied by the-defendant, but this presented an issue of fact to be determined by the trial justice, and with his determination we will not interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"A3pv\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
