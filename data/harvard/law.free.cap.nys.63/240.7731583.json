The retention of the bill of particulars by the defendant was an admission on her part that the plaintiff had complied with the order requiring the service of a further bill of particulars, and we believe the bill of particulars so served contained all the information that it was possible for the plaintiff to furnish.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">The order appealed should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
