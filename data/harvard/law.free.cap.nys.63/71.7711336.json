The appellant files an answering affidavit, in which he alleges that the position of assistant foreman, occupied by the relator, was unnecessary and was abolished for reasons of economy; that since the relator\u2019s dismissal no one has been appointed to fill the position; that no other position had been created that would require similar duties; and that there was no other position in the department which Croft was fitted to fill. As the motion was made for a peremptory writ, the opposing affidavit must be taken as true, and the question of the right of the relator to that writ must be considered upon that supposition. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2070; People v. City of Brooklyn, 149 N. Y. 215, 43 N. E. 554. If it is true, then, as alleged in the appellant\u2019s affidavit, that there was no other position in the department of highways similar to the one which was abolished, and which Croft was fitted to fill, he has no right to the mandamus (In re Breckenridge, 160 N. Y. 103, 54 N. E. 670), and for that reason it was error to grant the writ. But it was also error to grant it because the relator was guilty of loches in making his application. He was removed from his office on the 30th of June, 1898. He made no claim to be reinstated or to be transferred until the 26th of January, 1899; and he made no motion for this writ until the 21st of March, 1899, when \"he obtained an order to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>cause, returnable on the 28th of that month. This delay, unless satisfactorily explained, is fatal. People v. Collis, 6 App. Div. 467, 39 N. Y. Supp. 698. The relator offers an explanation which he claims brings his case within that of In re McDonald, 34 App. Div. 512, 54 N. Y. Supp. 525; but it is quite clear that the lame excuse which he offers is not sufficient, within that case. The mere fact that he had been informed that the law was unsettled, and that he understood that some applications were pending, undetermined, was not of itself sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">For each of these reasons, therefore, the order was erroneous, and must be reversed, with costs and disbursements, and the writ denied, with $10 costs. All concur, except INGRAHAM, J., who concurs on first ground.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
