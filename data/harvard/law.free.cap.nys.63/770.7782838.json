She positively denies having committed any of the acts of adultery with which she is charged. She claims, and her claim has some support, that she left the plaintiff by reason of his gross brutality, and there is much in the presentation of her side of the case to justify us in forbearing to determine now that she is so conclusively proven guilty as to deprive her of support pending suit, and of money necessary to pay counsel for her defense. The case is not like Stearns v. Stearns (Sup.) 53 N. Y. Supp. 348, in which the undisputed and unexplained facts showed that the denial of a charge of adultery was absolutely false.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">Under the circumstances of this case, however, we think the allowance both for counsel fee and alimony was too large, and the order appealed from should be modified by reducing the alimony to $15 a week, and the counsel fee to $150; and, as modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
