The trial took place after plaintiff\u2019s term of employment had expired, and at the time of the trial he was entitled to recover, if the jury believed his evidence, the amount he did recover. The statement of defendant\u2019s counsel that the action was begun on the 3d of January, 1899, was not evidence of that fact, and is not in accordance with the statement under rule 41; and in view of the fact that the only issue presented to the jury related to the defendant\u2019s right to discharge plaintiff, under a certain alleged custom, he should not be allowed to raise the point presented by the exception. If that point had been presented on the trial, the pleadings could have been amended so as to conform to the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
