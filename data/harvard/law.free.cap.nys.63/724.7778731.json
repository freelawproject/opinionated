The only condition prescribed by the statute for obtaining such preference is that the party desiring it shall serve with his notice of trial a notice that an application will be made to the court for the preference, and that an application can only be made when the case shall have been noticed for trial, and at the term at which it is so noticed. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 793. No other condition is required. The loches which will defeat the motion is only that by which the opposing party has been injured. No such loches appears here. It is quite true that, the issues in this action having been joined in September, it might have been put on the November, December, and January term calendars. But there is no reason to believe that it could have been tried at any of those terms, and it is impossible to see what injury was done to the defendant by delaying putting the case on the calendar until there was a possibility of trying it. The case is within the rules laid down in Bailey v. Miles, 46 App. Div. 607, 61 N. Y. Supp. 977; Levy v. Hanneman, 47 App. Div. 32, 62 N. Y. Supp. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">The order refusing to grant the preference must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the case sent back to the court below, with directions to grant the preference.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
