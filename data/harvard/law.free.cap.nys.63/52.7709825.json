In view of the treatment accorded by the county court to these chattel mortgages apparent in the computation, we think the county court should have granted a new trial on the affidavits presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Order denying the motion is reversed, and a new trial is granted, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
