S. Flag\u201d or \u201cSweet Kernel\u201d and \u201cPride of Rome\u201d by the adoption and use by them of trade-marks or labels known as \u201cOur Flag\u201d and \u201cPride of the Home,\u201d and were perpetually enjoined from using said trade-marks. It was also adjudged that the plaintiff is entitled to an accounting by the defendants of their profits and gains resulting from said infringement, and a referee was appointed to take such accounting, and to ascertain and assess the damages sustained by the plaintiff on account thereof. The action was begun on the 16th day of February, 1897, and the only issue raised by the pleadings is, do certain trade-marks or labels adopted and used by the defendants infringe upon certain trade-marks or labels owned and used by the plaintiff? It is conceded that the two trade-marks or labels designated in the judgment as \u201cF. S. Flag\u201d or \u201cSweet Kernel\u201d and \u201cPride of Rome\u201d were owned and used by the plaintiff prior to and at the time of the commencement of the action, and that the two trade-marks or labels designated as \u201cOur Flag\u201d and \u201cPride of the Home\u201d had been adopted and were used by the defendants to mark and distinguish their goods sold and offered for sale to the public. The important question, therefore, to be determined upon this appeal is, do the two trade-marks or labels adopted and used by the defendants, and known as \u201cOur Flag!\u2019 , and \u201cPride of the Home,\u201d infringe upon the two trade-marks or labels owned and used by the plaintiff, known as \u201cF.

Lloyd Jones, Bert Olney, and James P. Olney owned substantially all the capital stock of and jointly controlled four corporations organized for the purpose of packing vegetables of various kinds, and other products, in tin cans of dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ferent sizes, and selling the same to the public, viz. the Ft. Stanwix Canning Company (this plaintiff), which had its plant and place of business at Eome, E. Y.; the William McKinley Canning Company (the defendant company), its plant and place of business being located at Lenox, Madison county, E. Y.; the Fredonia Canning Company, carrying on its business at Fredonia, E. Y.; and the Eome Canning Company, which owned a canning plant at Borne, E. Y., but which had not been engaged in business since the fall of 1893, prior to the commencement of this action; and in fact said last-named corporation,' its business and property, had been absorbed by the plaintiff company early in 1894, and from that time until 1897 it had no active existence. On said 24th day of January, 1896, the defendant Jones and the Olnevs determined to separate their business interests, and to discontinue their joint ownership and control of the properties of the four corporations above named, and to that end they.made or caused to be made and entered into three contracts, \u2014 one between Bert Olney and the defendant Jones; one between the plaintiff company, the defendant company, and the Fredonia Company; and the other between the plaintiff company and the defendant Jones. It may be said, generally, that by said agreements the defendant Jones became the owner of the McKinley, Fredonia, and Eome Companies, the Olneys transferring to him all their capital stock in said corporations, and relinquishing all their right, title, and interest in and to their property, respectively, with the exception of certain trade-marks or labels; and Bert Olney, for himself, covenanted and agreed to procure to be conveyed to Jones the property and plant of the Eome Canning Company, also excepting and reserving its trade-marks or labels. In and by said agreements the defendant Jones transferred all the capital stock of the plaintiff company owned by him to Bert Olney, and Jones and the other three corporations transferred and surrendered to the plaintiff any and all right, title, or interest which they or either of them had in or to its plant or property. By the contracts entered into between the parties the trade-marks or labels which were owned by and which each of the companies parties to said agreement were entitled to use were designated and described with particularity; and in the agreement above referred to entered into between the McKinley, Ft. Stanwix, and Fredonia Companies it is provided \u201cthat the \u2018Sweet Kernel\u2019 and \u2018Pride of Eome\u2019 (with others) belong to the Ft. Stanwix Canning Company.\u201d In the agreement between the defendant Jones and Bert Olney, by which Olney agrees to procure a conveyance to Jones of the real estate and plant of the Eome Canning Company, is the following: \u201cBut not including any of the present brands and labels of the Eome Canning Co., which are to be reserved as the property of the Ft. Stanwix Canning Co.\u201d It is further provided in the same agreement as follows: \u201cEach of the parties hereto agrees that he will well and truly keep and observe the terms and provisions of a concurrent agreement executed by the Fredonia, William McKinley, and Ft. Stanwix Canning Companies as regards the different labels belonging to each of the companies, and also as to the provision that each of said companies will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>interfere with the others in the use and enjoyment of said labels.\u201d It appears that the plaintiff invented or originated the trade-mark or label known as the \u201cF. S. Flag\u201d or \u201cSweet Kernel\u201d in 1891, and that it had used the same substantially in its present form since that time. The trade-mark or label known as \u201cPride of Rome\u201d was invented or originated by the Rome Canning Company about the year 1890, was used by that company until the early part of 1894, and until it went out of business, and was absorbed by the plaintiff company. Since that time it has been used continuously by the plaintiff. Upon the execution of the agreements above referred to, the defendant Jones became the president and manager of the William McKinley Canning Company; was the principal owner of its capital stock, and controlled and dictated its policy. Its business was carried on at Lenox, Madison county, N. Y., and its plant was located there. The labels \u201cOur Flag\u201d and \u201cPride of the Home\u201d were used upon the goods put up by the William McKinley Canning Company at Lenox, N. Y., and on. the label \u201cPride of the Home\u201d was printed \u201cPacked by the Rome Canning Co. at Rome, N. Y.\u201d although concededly none of the goods on which said labels were used prior to the commencement of this action were packed at Rome, N. Y. During the time Jones and the OIneys were jointly interested in the several corporations above named Jones was the principal salesman; was well acquainted with the different brands of goods put up by each of the companies, including the plaintiff; was acquainted with the use of the labels in question, and their value as aids in the sale of goods; had sold and billed plaintiff\u2019s goods with such labels upon them as the \u201cFlag\u201d goods, and knew the plaintiff\u2019s customers for such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\">In view of the facts disclosed by the evidence in this case, we think it unnecessary to determine whether or not the words \u201cF. S. Flag\u201d and \u201cPride of Rome,\u201d and the devices and symbols used in connection therewith, and constituting the plaintiff\u2019s two labels, were adopted and used in such manner as to entitle it to be protected in their exclusive use; or whether such words, devices, and symbols are properly the subject of copyright, or strictly entitled to protection solely as trade-marks, for the reason that the defendants are estopped from urging those matters as a defense to plaintiff\u2019s claim, because by contract, for a good consideration, they agreed that the labels belong to the plaintiff; that it is entitled to their exclusive use, and that they will not use them, \u2014 will not infringe upon or interfere with their use by the plaintiff; and that, as between the parties to the contract, it need only be determined whether or not the terms of the contract have been violated. The inquiry is thus limited to ascertaining whether or not the labels adopted and used by the defendants are so similar to the labels owned and used by the plaintiff \u201cas to deceive a purchaser of ordinary caution, or if they be calculated to deceive the careless or unwary, and thus injure the proprietors of the trade-mark.\u201d If so, then the plaintiff is entitled to the relief decreed by the judgment appealed from. Colman v. Crump, 70 N. Y. 573; Taendsticksfabriks Akticbolagat Vulcan v. Myers, 139 N. Y. 364, 34 N. E. 904. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cF. S. Flag\u201d label, so called, is about 10 inches long and 4 inches wide, or o\u00ed such size as to entirely cover the outer surface, except the ends, of a can shaped like a cylinder. The background of the label is chiefly yellow. On the left end is a picture of a flag, showing a smooth surface, and occupying a space about 3 by 1-f- inches. The stripes are bright red, the spaces between clear white. White stars on a light blue ground occupy the upper left-hand comer. It is attached to a gilt staff standing perpendicular. Directly over the flag, in large, raised gilt letters are the words, \u201cF. S. Flag,\u201d and under it the words, in gilt letters, \u201cSweet Kernel Brand.\u201d In the center of the label, within a gilt rim about 1-f-inches in diameter, surrounded by narrow white and blue bands, are the words, \u201cPacked at Rome, Oneida Co., N. Y.\u201d On the right end, on a blue ground, is a picture of an ear of com, peas, beans, or other vegetable contained in the can on which the label is used. Directly over the picture, and over a gilt scroll, in gilt letters with red edges, are the words, \u201cFort Stanwix Canning Co.\u201d Under this, in small black letters, are the words \u201cFinest Quality,\u201d and under the picture is the name, in gilt letters, of the vegetable, with some word or words added denoting quality. The defendants\u2019 \u201cFlag\u201d label, so called, is the same size and shape as plaintiff\u2019s. The background is blue. At the left end is the picture of a flag of about the same size as the flag upon plaintiff\u2019s label, but it hangs in folds, is attached to a staff standing at an angle, at the end of which there are two cords with tassels. Above, and a little to the right of, the flag are the words in large, raised gilt letters, \u201cOur Flag.\u201d Under those words are the words, in black letters, \u201cFancy Quality.\u201d Under the flag, in a gilt scroll, are the words, in white letters with black edges, \u201cJ. Lloyd Jones Canning Co.,\u201d and under the scroll, in red letters, \u201cLenox, Madison Co., N. Y.\u201d In the center of the label, in a gilt ring about <em>11\u00bf </em>inches in diameter, is an eagle\u2019s head. On the right end, in a gilt scroll, is a picture of the vegetable contained in the can upon which the label is used, substantially the same as on plaintiff\u2019s label. Over the picture are the words, in large, raised gilt letters, \u201cOur Flag,\u201d and under the picture the name of the vegetable, in red letters, and some word or words added to denote quality. The plaintiff\u2019s label called \u201cPride of Rome\u201d is the same size as the other, and has a white or light background. On the left end, in large, white, fancy letters with blue edges, upon a red ground, within a gilt scroll, are the words, \u201cOlney Bros.,\u201d and below these, in blue letters, the words, \u201cPacked at Rome, Oneida Co., N. Y.\u201d In the center of the label there is a picture of a Roman helmet, shield, and other devices in red and gilt; under it, in small black letters, the words, \u201cFinest Quality.\u201d On the right end, above a gilt scroll, is a picture of the vegetable contained in the can upon which the label is used. Above the picture, in large red letters with gilt edges, are the words, \u201cPride of Rome.\u201d Under the picture is the name of the vegetable contained in the can, in black letters, and other words added to denote quality. The label used by the defendants called \u201cPride of the Home,\u201d and which it is claimed infringes the plaintiff\u2019s label last described, is exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the same size, and has the same colored background. Upon the left end it has substantially the same picture of a vegetable as is upon the right end of plaintiff\u2019s label \u201cPride of Rome,\u201d but, as the labels are to be used upon circular cans, this distinction would not be observed. Over the picture of the vegetable, in red letters with gilt edges, are the words, \u201cPride of the Home.\u201d Under the picture is the name of the vegetable and other words to denote quality, in black letters, and under it, in red letters, the words, \u201cRome Canning Co.\u201d In the center of the label is a picture of a Roman soldier in armor, and to the right of the figure, in small black letters, the words, \u201cFancy Quality.\u201d At the right end of the label, within a gilt wreath printed upon a yellow ground, in red and black letters,, are the words, \u201cPacked by the Rome Canning Co. at Rome., Oneida Co., N. Y.\u201d Under the wreath are a shield and other devices shown upon plaintiff\u2019s label.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">If the above description conveys any idea of the appearance or chief characteristics of the four labels which it is intended to describe, it will be observed that there are many marked differences between the labels of the plaintiff and those used by the defendants which are claimed to be an infringement, and such as would readily enable a careful, or even casual, observer, if attention were called to the fact, to distinguish one set of labels from the other. It is equally apparent, however, that in some of their features they are very similar, and that some of the distinguishing or more prominent characteristics are common to each set of labels, respectively. Take the \u201cF. S. Flag\u201d and \u201cOur Flag\u201d labels. They are naturally spoken of as the \u201cFlag\u201d labels. \u201cFlag\u201d is the distinguishing word in the name. The letters \u201cF. S.\u201d in one case and \u201cOur\u201d in the other are merely incidental, and in common practice would not be used. A person desiring to purchase goods marked with either label would be very likely only to remember the word \u201cFlag,\u201d even if the fact of the existence of the other letters had not entirely escaped his attention. It is true that upon the plaintiff\u2019s label are the additional words, \u201cSweet Kernel Brand,\u201d but the distinguishing word is \u201cFlag.\u201d So the prominent emblem, especially when used in connection with the name, is the flag. That emphasizes the fact that the goods offered for sale are the \u201cFlag\u201d brand. The picture of the flag used by the defendants differs in form and in many respects from the emblem used by the plaintiff; but, again, they are only differences in detail. Its place upon the label is the same. In size it. is substantially the same. The names above it occupy relatively the same position. The fact that in one case the stripes of the flag are light red and in the other dark red, that the stars on one are white\u2019and on the other gilt, that the staff of one is perpendicular and of the other at an angle, are all matters of detail, and such as would not attract the attention of a customer, and would not be remembered if noticed. - The feature of each label which appeals to the eye is the flag. The letters or the arrangement of the words upon the two \u201cFlag\u201d labels are not by any means identical, and marked differences may readily be discovered when attention is called to it, and still the similarity in those respects is close enough so that a person of ordinary caution \u2014 at least the \u201ccareless and un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>wary\u201d \u2014 may be deceived. As matter of fact, the arrangement of the printed matter, the form and color of the letters used, are such as to give the two labels the same general appearance, independent of the name and independent of the flag, its most prominent device. In the two labels \u201cPride of Rome\u201d and \u201cPride of the Home,\u201d so far as the name is concerned, \u201cPride\u201d is the prominent word. The goods offered for sale are the \u201cPride\u201d canned goods. The words added \u201cof Rome\u201d in one case and \u201cof the Home\u201d in the other are merely incidental. The goods would become known and would be dealt in as the \u201cPride\u201d goods. If the words \u201cof the Home,\u201d \u201cof the Farm,\u201d \u201cof the Garden,\u201d or \u201cof the Fireside\u201d may be added to the word \u201cPride\u201d to designate canned goods manufactured or stated on the label to be manufactured at Rome, N. Y., the use of the word \u201cPride\u201d is of no value to the plaintiff. The distinguishing emblem upon the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cPride\u201d label is the picture of the Roman armor. In the defendants\u2019 \u201cPride\u201d label the armor is placed upon a figure. It occupies the same place on each label. There is little similarity between the two, and alone would not be important, but, when the coloring in the two labels is observed, the arrangement of the printed matter noted, the form and coloring of the letters, the similarity in the sound of the name, the fact that upon the defendants\u2019 label it is stated that the goods are packed at Rome, N. Y., when in fact they are not, it is all suggestive of an attempt to appropriate the plaintiff\u2019s label, so far as possible, without incurring liability therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We think the authorities fully sustain the conclusion reached by the learned trial court, and that the use of the names \u201cOur Flag\u201d and \u201cPride of the Home\u201d by the defendants was, alone, such an infringement as will support the judgment. In the case of Hier v. Abrahams, 82 N. Y. 519, the plaintiff, who resided in and was engaged in the cigar business in the city of Syracuse, N. Y., called a certain brand of cigars manufactured by him \u201cPride,\u201d placed them upon the market, and established a large trade in them. The defendant, another cigar dealer in Syracuse, manufactured a different brand of cigars, called them \u201cThe Pride of Syracuse,\u201d and placed them upon the market for sale. The court held the name \u201cThe Pride of Syracuse\u201d was an infringement upon the name \u201cPride,\u201d and a judgment restraining the defendant from using such name was sustained. In Newman v. Alvord, 51 N. Y. 189, the plaintiff manufactured cement, and sold it under the label \u201cNewman\u2019s Akron Cement Co., Manufactured at Akron, N. Y.\u201d The defendant manufactured cement in Onondaga Co., N. Y., and attempted to sell it under the label \u201cAlvord\u2019s Onondaga Akron Cement and Water Lime, Manufactured at Syracuse, N. Y.\u201d It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to be protected in the use of the word \u201cAkron\u201d as a trademark, and the judgment restraining the defendant from using that name was sustained. In Charles S. Higgins Co. v. Higgins Soap Co., 144 N. Y. 462, 39 N. E. 490, 27 L. R. A. 42, \u2018Walter Higgins Turkish Laundry Soap\u201d was held to be an infringement upon \u201cCharles Higgins German Laundry Soap.\u201d Congress &amp; Empire Spring Co. v. High Rock Congress Spring Co., 45 N. Y. 291; Crawford v. Laus, 29 Misc. Rep. 248, 60 N. Y. Supp. 387; Tuerk Hydraulic Power Co. v. Tuerk, 92 Hun, 65, 36 N. Y. Supp. 384. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>To determine whether or not a particular trade-mark infringes on another is often attended with difficulty, where the conclusion reached depends entirely upon the fact whether there is such a similarity between the two as will tend to mislead or deceive the public, and especially if such fact must be found simply from an inspection or observation of the two. Ho rule decisive of every case can be evolved from the authorities. The general rule is stated in Colman v. Crump, 70 N. Y. 573, supra, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\">\u201cIt is not necessary that the symbol or device complained of should be a fac simile of the genuine trade-mark, or so close an imitation as to be distinguished only by an expert, or upon critical examination by one familiar with the original. If the resemblance is such as to deceive a purchaser of ordinary caution, or if it be calculated to deceive the careless and unwary, and thus to injure the sale of the goods of the proprietors of the trade-mark, it is a violation of his property rights therein, and he may maintain an action to restrain such, violation, and to recover damages therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">This rule has been approved in many of the adjudicated cases, and, so far as we have been able to discover, criticised in none. But the rule only states the question presented in each case, and in no manner decides it. Of course, in many cases the dissimilarity between the genuine and the alleged infringing trade-mark is so marked that it can be readily determined that no infringement exists, and in other cases the similarity is so great that the infringement is palpable; but in a case where the marks of similarity or dissimilarity are so evenly balanced that from mere inspection of the trade-mark a different conclusion might be reached by different persons as to whether or not the case falls within the rule above quoted, \u201cwhether the resemblance is such as to deceive a purchaser of ordinary caution, or if it be calculated to&gt; deceive the careless and unwary,\u201d it would seem clear that all the circumstances attending the adoption and use of the trade-mark should be considered, \u2014 the situation of the parties, the intent with which the alleged infringing trade-mark was adopted, the manner in which it was used, and the actual effect its use had, so far as can be ascertained, \u2014 to aid the court in reaching a proper conclusion. It was said in the Higgins Case, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cWhether the court will interfere in a particular case must depend upon circumstances, \u2014 the identity or similarity of the names, the identity of the business of the respective corporations, how far the name is a true description of the kind and quality of the articles manufactured or the business carried on, the extent of the confusion which may be created or apprehended, and other circumstances which might justly influence the judgment of the judge granting or withholding the remedy. Whether, upon equitable principles, the remedy should have been awarded in this case upon the facts proved and found, is the question in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In the case at bar the defendant company\u2019s plant is located in a county adjoining the county where the plaintiff is located. The defendant Jones is practically the owner of another plant in the same city 'where the plaintiff is doing business. The business of the plaintiff and defendant company is identical. The goods of each are in competition. The goods packed by the defendant company at its place of business at Lenox, N. Y., were labeled and sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>as having been packed in the city of Borne, where the plaintiff is located. There is evidence tending to show that the defendant J ones was advised, before ,his labels were printed, that they were so close a resemblance to the plaintiff\u2019s brands as to constitute an infringement; that certain dealers on that account would not trade with him if he adopted them; and that, notwithstanding, he adopted them, and for the purpose of securing by such means a part of plaintiff\u2019s trade; and one witness (James P. Olney) testified that he was deceived by defendants\u2019 labels, and was led to suppose by them that the defendants\u2019 goods were those of the plaintiff. It also_ appears that at least one purchaser designated the goods which he desired to purchase from the defendants as the \u201cFlag\u201d brand, and that they were billed to him as such. Considering the similarity in the two sets of labels, in connection with all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the conclusion is reached that the labels of the defendants were calculated to deceive the nublic, and were an infringement upon the plaintiff\u2019s labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We think the court did not commit error in refusing to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint upon the defendants\u2019 motion, made upon the ground that the Fredonia Canning Company was not made a party defendant. No such question is raised by the pleadings, and it is nowhere suggested that the Fredonia Canning Company was guilty of wrongdoing. It could in no way be affected by or interested in the litigation. Its rights under the contracts in question were not involved. In fact, no question is raised as to the true meaning of any of the provisions of said contracts. It follows that the motion for a new trial should be denied, and the interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\u25a0Motion for new trial denied, and interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.
