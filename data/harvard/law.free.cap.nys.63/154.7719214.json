This showing sustains the judgment. The versions of the witnesses presented by defendant are so in conflict that it seems just to accept the plaintiff's version of the accident. The appellant contends that it is entitled to a new trial or reversal because of the- admission of evidence as to the compensation of a coke driver. In this he is wrong, even if the evidence was improperly received. The effect of this evidence, if injurious at all, was but slight. The loss of time was but a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
