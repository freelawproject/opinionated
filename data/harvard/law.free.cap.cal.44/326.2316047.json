As we said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>43 Cal. 177, these do not constitute a statement which we are at liberty to examine, nor form part of the record here for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Bor can we consider the points, or any of them, relied upon by the counsel for the prisoner, in the able argument with which we have been favored, for these do not appear in the record, except in the bill of exceptions, so called, which, not having been signed by the Judge, we are compelled also to disregard. (Crim. Prac. Act, Sec. 435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
