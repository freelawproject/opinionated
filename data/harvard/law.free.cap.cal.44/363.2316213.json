Within the boundaries of the tract claimed by the plaintiffs was a small piece of land called the \u201c Garden Tract,\u201d which Jacob Harmon took possession of in-1847, and inclosed and cultivated. Harmon died in November, 1850, and his administrators remained in possession up to August, 1852, when his widow, Elenora, who had intermarried with one Michael Foley, along with Foley, leased the \u201cGarden Tract\u201d to Michael Commerford for the term of three years and four months, or until January 16th, 1856. In December,- 1853, Commerford sold his lease to Brannan, Larkin, and others, and in September, 1854, surrendered to them possession of the \u201cGarden Tract,\u201d hut continued to oversee it for them ten months longer. On the 27th of June, 1853, Michael Foley and his wife Elenora, conveyed to Brannan, Larkin, and others the one hundred and sixty acres sued for. Within its boundaries was a tract of forty-eight acres particularly described in the deed aside from the general description. It is this deed the Court speaks of in its opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">The plaintiffs on the trial dismissed the action as to all the defendants occupying land outside the \u201cGarden Tract\u201d and the forty-eight acres, and the Court granted a nonsuit as to all the defendants who occupied land in the forty-eight acres outside the \u201cGarden Tract.\u201d The plaintiffs recovered judgment for the \u201cGarden Tract,\u201d and appealed from the judgment in favor of the defendants, and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.'</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>W.

As to the remainder of the tract, there was no evidence tending to prove that they or their grantors had the <em>actual </em>possession, or were entitled to the possession at any time prior to the 1st day of January, 1855, nor on that day, and from thence until the 20th day of June, 1855; and, in the absence of such evidence, it is clear that they did not show themselves entitled to the benefit of the Van \u00a1Ness Ordinance. Except the \u201cGarden Tract,\u201d no portion of the foriy-eight acres was either cultivated or surrounded with a substantial in closure; and the occasional, trivial, and apparently casual acts of dominion exercised over it by Foley and his wife, or Commerford, were wholly insufficient to establish an actual possession. There was, however, evidence to the effect that in the year 1860 certain portions of the forty-eight-acre tract, north of the \u201cGarden Tract,\u201d were inclosed with a substantial fence by Perley and his associates, Brannan, Larkin, and others. But there was no evidence tending to show that the plaintiffs had succeeded to any rights acquired by Perley and his associates, founded on the inclosure. On the contrary, the only evidence of title in the plaintiffs consists in an admission at the trial \u201cthat whatever right, title, and interest passed to Samuel Brannan and his associates by the deed put in evidence, was, at the commencement of this suit, vested in plaintiffs.\u201d The deed referred to is a deed from Foley and wife to Brannan, Weller, Larkin, and Yale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>made in June, 1853, for the forty-eight acres. But, as Foley and wife, so far as appears from this record, never had either title or the actual possession, or the right to the possession, of any portion of the land, except the \u201cGarden Tract,\u201d their deed to Brannan and others conveyed neither title or right of possession to the remainder. As we have already seen, it was only the rights which were supposed to have passed by this deed which were vested in the plaintiffs, and as no rights passed, except, in respect to the \u201c Garden Tract,\u201d the plaintiffs established no right to the possession of the remainder. If they have in any manner succeeded to such rights as were acquired by Perley and his associates, by means of the inclosure erected in 1860, the record fails to show it. The nonsuit was therefore properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Chief Justice, having been of counsel in the Court below, did not sit in this cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
