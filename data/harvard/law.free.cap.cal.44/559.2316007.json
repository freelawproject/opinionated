In that year he executed three deeds\u2014 one to Bryant &amp; Irvine, one to O\u2019Connor (the defendant\u2019s grantor), and one to Wainright (the plaintiff\u2019s grantor). The purchasers entered upon their respective tracts, and agreed to measure off with a tape-line, their respective lots, put up temporary fences, and that when the true lines should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ascertained, each should have his land according to the true lines; and they accordingly measured the lots with a tapeline, and each entered upon, and they and their grantees have since occupied, the parcels of land according to the measurement thus made. The grantees of O\u2019Connor had no knowledge of the agreement in respect to the measurement of the lots. The true measurement shows that a narrow strip of the land conveyed to AVainwright, is included within the lines of the O\u2019Connor lot, as run by the \u201ctape-line measurement.\u201d The title to the land in controversy passed, by virtue of the Van Hess Ordinance and its confirmation, either to AVainwright or to those holding under the O\u2019Con-nor deed. The defendants claim that title, and also set up the Statute of Limitations. The jury found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>37 Cal. 366, we stated that \u201c we are inclined to consider the word \u2018 tenant,\u2019 as used in the Van Hess Ordinance, as meaning a <em>conventional </em>tenant.\u201d The point, however, was not decided, nor, indeed, was it involved in the case. Since that case, we have had occasion to consider the question again, and we were not inclined to restrict the meaning of the word \u201ctenant,\u201d as used in the ordinance, to so narrow a limit as was intimated in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Hyde. </em>AVe held, in <em>Broad </em>v. <em>Broad, </em>40 Cal. 493, that the term included a tenant in common, and we are satisfied that the decision is in entire harmony with the meaning and intent of the ordinance. It is not requisite that the relation of landlord and tenant should have existed between the parties, but whenever one party held the actual possession, in subordination to another party, under or by virtue of an agreement, either express or implied, the party so in possession will, in our opinion, fall within the meaning of the word \u201ctenant,\u201d as employed in the ordinance. Here each party entered upon the portion of land which was outside his true line, in subor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>dination to the title of the party upon whom he encroached, and with the agreement to restore the possession when the true lines should be ascertained; and he held the possession of the same by the license or permission of the owner of the adjoining land.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">In respect to the defense of adverse possession, it is sufficient to say that a possession commenced as in this case is not adverse, and does not become so, until there is a distinct repudiation of the agreement under which the possession was taken. The grantees of O\u2019Connor, having simply succeeded him in the possession of that to which they acquired no title by their deeds, occupy no better position than he did. The rule laid down in <em>Sneed </em>v. Osborn, 25 Cal. 619, has no application here, for there the parties were not running a mere temporary line, as was done in this case, but were establishing what they then understood to be the true line, and it cannot be said here, as was said there, that the parties have acquiesced, for any period, in the lines which were run as the true lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
