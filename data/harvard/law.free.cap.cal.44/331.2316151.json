Both parties deraign title from one David Allen, who is admitted to have been the owner of the premises in 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">The testimony tends to show that one John W. Whisman (through whom the plaintiff claims by regular mesne conveyances) bought the premises of Allen in 1848, paid for them and went into possession. The testimony is meager upon this question, but we think it shows prima facie that there was a fully executed parol sale prior to the execution of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The only question presented for decision is whether the title to the premises could pass from Allen to Whisman by-virtue of a parol sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u2022 Under the Mexican law in force here in 1848, parol sales of real estate, when fully executed, were valid and binding between the parties, and passed the title to the vendee.
