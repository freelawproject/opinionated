Suppose that a complaint on a bill of exchange, payable sixty days after sight, contained no \"averment of the date of presentment, is there any doubt it would be held bad? (See <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Aslett, </em>1 Mees. &amp; W. 209; <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Excelsior F. I. Co., </em>1 Bosw. 514; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Charter Oak, </em>10 Allen, 218; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>1 Oregon, 234.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-10\">The terms \u201cforthwith\u201d and as soon \u201cas possible,\u201d in policies of insurance, are never rigorously interpreted\u2014 they are equivalent to the expression \u201cwith due diligence;\u201d and what is due diligence must depend on the circumstances of the case in which the question is raised. <em>(Wightman </em>v. <em>Western Marine I. Co., </em>8 Rob. La. 442; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Washington I. Co., </em>32 N. Y. 442; <em>Central I. Co. </em>v. <em>National I. Co., </em>20 Barb. 468; Angell on Insurance, Secs. 231, 234.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-11\">It cannot, therefore, be argued that the plaintiff\u2019s averment of due performance, which is simply the averment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>a conclusion of law, fixes the date either of giving notice of loss or of furnishing the particular account which the policy requires.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">Established precedents of complaints on policies providing that the amount 'shall only be payable a given period after notice and proof of loss, are against the plaintiff. (2 Chitty Pl. 539, 540, 541, 542; Archbold\u2019s Nisi Prius, 279\u2014being Vol. 34, Law Library, 275; Abbott\u2019s Pl. and Forms, 187, 190, 193, 196; 2 Greenleaf Ev. 383: Yates\u2019 Pleadings and Forms, 446.) The question of pleading here raised must be considered just as if it were presented on demurrer. Judgment was entered by default, consequently there was no verdict to heal any defect in the complaint, even if the present defect could have been so healed. (Gould\u2019s Plead. 505, Chap. X, Sec. 26.) The, defect in question is not remedied \u2022by the averment that \u201cthe whole of said sum is now due,\u201d for this is but a conclusion of law, which is of no effect in pleading. The plaintiff must set forth the facts, showing the sum to be due; and one of those facts is, that notice and proofs required were served sixty days before suit was commenced. <em>(Levinson </em>v. <em>Schwarz, </em>22 Cal. 229; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>9 Cal. 33; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>McPike, </em>21 Cal. 215; <em>Freisch </em>v. <em>Caler, </em>21 Cal. 71.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-7\"><em>Vanclief &amp; McCann, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">Counsel seem to have overlooked or disregarded a statute which is incorporated in the Practice Act, viz: section sixty, in exact accordance with which the complaint states \u201c that the plaintiff duly performed all the conditions on her part, in said policy to be performed;\u201d and in addition to this, and with much more particularity than required by the Practice Act, we allege the performance of the particular condition in question, as follows: \u201cThat she gave to defendant due notice and proof of the fire and loss aforesaid, and demanded payment,\u201d etc.' But we rely on the general allegation. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>covers every condition and every part of each condition, so that counsel can make nothing by attempting to sever from a single condition its attributes, and to make of each of them a distinct condition, as he does of the attribute of time, belonging to the condition in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">The sixtieth section of our Practice Act was intended specially to relieve from the great labor of pleading according to the old rules, in actions like those arising on modern policies of insurance, wherein the conditions precedent to a right of action are extremely numerous, and some of them very nearly, if not quite, impossible. <em>(Himmelmann </em>v. <em>Danos, </em>35 Cal. 447; <em>Cal. Nav. Co. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>6 Cal. 258; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>24 Cal. 632; 1 Abbott\u2019s Forms, 298, note <em>x; Hatch </em>v. <em>Peet, </em>23 Barb. 580.) Even under the old system of pleading, where the conditions are numerous, and under some other circumstances, performance of them may be pleaded generally. (Stephen on Pleading, 336, 356.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">If the allegation were defective in form only, as being too general, the defect would be cured by either a verdict or a default. <em>(Hentsch </em>v. <em>Porte, </em>10 Cal. 557; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rains, </em>23 Cal. 127; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Black, </em>30 Cal. 228; <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>30 Cal. 489; <em>Himmelmann </em>v. <em>Spanagel, </em>39 Cal. 402.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-7\">By the Court, Wallace, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The plaintiff brought this action upon three several policies of insurance by which the defendant had insured her against loss or damage by fire upon certain property of hers. The defendant not appearing, a default and final judgment for the plaintiff was entered below, and after an ineffectual effort made there to set aside the default and to obtain leave to defend the action, the defendant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The complaint contains three counts, each of which sets forth <em>in haec verba </em>the policy, for a breach of which it professes to proceed, and the first point made is, that each' of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>said counts is radically defective, and substantially insufficient to support the judgment by default which the plaintiff obtained, in that it does not appear that the sum for which judgment was rendered, or any part thereof, was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">As the several counts. and policies sued upon are, <em>mutatis </em>mutandis, identical, it will only be necessary to particularly notice the first one.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">By the terms of the policy it is provided as follows: \u201cThe amount of loss or damage to be estimated according to the actual cash value of property at the time of the loss, and <em>to be paid sixty days after due notice and proof of the same made by the assured,\u201d </em>etc. It is objected, that it does not appear from the allegations of the complaint that when the action was commenced this period of sixty days had elapsed. In answer to this point the respondent relies upon the following averments in the complaint:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u201c That the plaintiff duly performed all the conditions on her part, in the said policy of insurance, to be performed. That she gave to defendant due notice and proof of the fire, and loss aforesaid, and demanded payment of the said sum of six hundred dollars; that no part of the same has been paid, and that the whole of said sum is now due, for which she demands judgment,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The allegation that the sum <em>\u201cis now due </em>\u201d may be laid out of the case, inasmuch as that is a conclusion of law merely. \u00a1Mor does the averment that the plaintiff\" duly performed all the conditions on her part, in the said policy of insurance to be performed, and that she had given due notice and proof of the loss, aid the complaint in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Under the terms of the policy, the doing of these things would not give her an immediate right of action against the defendant for the payment of the sum demanded, for the defendant was not bound to pay until the lapse of sixty days thereafter. In a complaint filed on the very next day after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the notice and proof had been given, it might have been alleged, with truth, that all these things had been done; and yet it will not be pretended that she would at that time have had a cause of action against the defendant, or that the latter was then in default because payment had not been made. The delay of the sixty days after notice, to which, under the terms of the policy, the defendant is entitled, is a substantial right secured by the stipulation of the contract, not merely to enable it to prepare to pay, but also to investigate the circumstances under which the loss occurred, with a view of determining whether or not the loss had been of such a character as involved an obligation upon its part to pay at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Mr. Justice Belcher did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
