The defendants then appeared in Court and objected to a judgment without evidence to sustain the complaint. The Court overruled the objection and entered judgment by default without any evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-7\">The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-8\"><em>Levi Chase, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-9\">The complaint shows that the improvements assessed to appellant Culverwell were situate upon and were a part of his real estate already assessed to him. Section six thousand one hundred and sixty-nine of General Laws provides for the assessment of improvements separate from the realty only when such improvements are upon \u201creal estate assessed to a person other than the owner of the improvements.\u201d In such case the improvements are personal property, and as such property assessed; but where the real estate and improvements are owned by the same person, they all constitute the real estate of the owner, and cannot be assessed separately, since the assessment of the realty includes all improvements upon it owned by the person assessed, and another assessment for improvements creates a double assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-10\">The statute, in an action to recover taxes, does not justify a judgment by default without proof. It is not \u201can action arising on contract,\u201d as contemplated in the first division of section one hundred and fifty of the Practice Act, but comes under the second division of that section, where in \u201c other actions \u2019 \u2019 the \u201c proof of a fact is necessary to enable the Court to give judgment,\u201d \u201cthe Court may (shall) hear the proof, or order a reference,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b654-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Jo Hamilton, Attorney General, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b654-6\">By the Court, Rhodes, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The complaint in this case appears to be drawn with more than usual care and skill. It does not appear whether the blocks of land which were assessed to the defendant had been subdivided. If they had not been subdivided, they were properly assessed and described in the complaint by blocks; and if they had been subdivided, still that description was sufficient, as they were assessed to the defendant as the owner. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>43 Cal. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Improvements on real estate are, by section five of the General Revenue Act of 1861, classed as personal property; but section twenty, in stating the form of the assessment list, specifies \u201c value of improvements on real estate assessed to persons other than the owners of said real estate,\u201d and does not provide a separate column for the value of improvements on real estate, owned by the person assessed. Although the Assessor need not, under that Act, place the value of the land and the improvements in separate columns, where both are assessed to the same person; yet if that course is pursued, the assessment is not radically defective. That mode of assessment does not show that the improvements were twice assessed. \"We are of the opinion that the demurrer to the complaint was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">A defendant who fails to answer within the time allowed by the Court, on the overruling of his demurrer, and whose default is entered because of his failure to answer, is not entitled to participate in the further proceedings in the case, which eventuate in a judgment. After such default lias been entered in a suit for the recovery of delinquent taxes, the Court may enter judgment on the pleadings. If there be a provision in any of the numerous Acts in respect to tax suits, which requires the production of evidence, after all the alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>gations of the complaint are admitted by the defendants, it has not been brought to our notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Judgment affirmed, with ten per cent damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
