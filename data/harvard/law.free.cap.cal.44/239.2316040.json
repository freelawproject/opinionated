Brady and Thomas Brady, of the County of Solano, State aforesaid, parties of the second part, witnesseth: That the said parties of the second part do hereby agree and bind themselves to receive and feed three hundred and forty-one head of cattle, weighing two hundred and thirteen thousand and fifty-five (213,055) pounds net (said net weight to be arrived at by deducting one half of the .gross weight), from the date of this instrument until the 1st day of March, A. D. 1867; the said parties of the second part binding themselves to furnish good and sufficient corrals, with troughs, supplied daily with an abundance of fresh water for said cattle; and they (the said second party) bind themselves further to feed the aforesaid cattle barley hay, all they will eat, in mangers constructed in the aforesaid corrals; both parties to this agreement stipulating one with the other, that the said parties of the first' part shall at all times be in legal possession of said cattle, and that they (the said first parties) shall own and possess the original net weight at this date of the aforesaid cattle, to be valued at the price of eight (8) cents per pound, for the purposes hereinafter named. It is further agreed that if the cattle increase in net weight, the said parties of the first part are to allow the said parties of the second part eight (8) cents per pound for such net increase; but in the event they should decrease in net weight, the said parties of the second part are to allow the said parties of the first part eight (8) cents per pound for such net decrease, to be determined when sales of the cattle are made; the said parties of the first part reserving the right to sell the cattle, or any portion thereof, at any time, first giving the said parties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the second, part the refusal to buy the cattle offered at the price they (the said first parties) propose to sell. It is further agreed that the said parties of the second part are to have, for feeding and taking care of said cattle, two thirds of the increase in the price the cattle are sold for over and above eight (8) cents per pound on the net weight of said cattle at the date of this agreement. It is further agreed that should there be any cattle remaining unsold on the 1st day of March, A. B. 1867, in case the parties hereto cannot agree on the market price at that time, each party to this agreement shall choose a man (and in case they cannot agree upon the market price, they shall choose a third man); the referees are to examine the cattle and fix the market price of that quality of beef, at the corral, on the net weight as aforesaid. In case one half th% cattle should be taken out and sold before the 15th February, 1867, the said parties of the second part agree to feed the remaining half until the 15th March, 1867, if so desired by the parties of the first part. It is also agreed and understood, that at any time the said parties of the first part may want to market said cattle at San Francisco or elsewhere, the expenses of driving and selling shall be divided between the parties hereto as follows, to wit: the said parties of the first part to pay one third, and the said parties of the second part to pay two thirds of the whole amount of the expenses necessarily expended in the sale of said cattle, or any number of them, at any one time. It is agreed that if half, or a less number than half, of the above named cattle should remain until the 15th of March, 1867, then on that day the valuation is to take place, instead of the 1st of March, 1867, as above mentioned. The above mentioned cattle, when sold, or delivered, are to be weighed out at the corral of the parties of the second part, they furnishing correct scales, and men to assist in weighing, when required or called on by the parties of the first part.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The plaintiffs received and kept the cattle at their ranch, in Solano County, and they were sold by the defendants, and the proceeds of the sales were received by them, as follows: Twenty-five head were sold on the 4th of March, 1867, at the plaintiff\u2019s ranch, to one Stebbins, net weight.................................... 15,420 ibs.

The defendants claim that for the purpose of ascertaining how much plaintiffs are entitled to by reason of gain in weight, the sale must be deemed, within the meaning of this contract, to have taken place at the times when said cattle were taken from defendants\u2019 ranch to be sent to San Francisco to be sold. If such was the true construction of the contract\u2014if defendants were to enjoy the exclusive benefit of the San Francisco market, it would follow that the plaintiffs would not be chargeable with two thirds of the expense of feeding them from that time until they were slaughtered, and of marketing the beef; and with this condition plaintiffs would be quite willing to accept the construction claimed by defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-8\"><em>P. Dunlap, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b276-9\">By the Court, Niles, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The contract provided two separate compensations to the plaintiffs for their labor and expense in the care and keeping of the cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">First\u2014Eight cents per pound on the net increase in the weight of the cattle at the time of sale over the agreed net weight at the date of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Second\u2014Two thirds of the increase in the price the cattle should be sold for over and above eight cents per pound on the net weight at the date of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">These compensations must be considered as cumulative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>as there is nothing in the contract to show that either was to be received in lieu of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We think it is the only reasonable construction of the contract that the weight and price of the cattle sold at San Francisco are to be estimated at the time and place of sale. The defendants reserved the right to sell the cattle at any time and upon their own terms. If they chose to sell at San Francisco or elsewhere, the plaintiffs were to pay two thirds of the whole amount of the expenses of driving and of sale. It is unreasonable to suppose that the plaintiffs would agree to bear this large proportion of the losses without participation in the gains. Considering the whole contract, it is clear to us that the provision that the cattle when sold or delivered were \u201cto be weighed out at the corral of the parties of the second part,\u201d applied only to such of the cattle as might be there sold by the defendants, and not to those which.might be driven and sold elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">By this construction the plaintiffs aire entitled to the sum of seven hundred and thirty-three dollars and twelve cents for increase in weight of the cattle, and the further sum of one thousand six hundred and seventy-seven dollars and forty cents as their share of the increase in price. From these amounts must be deducted the sum of one thousand two hundred and forty-two dollars and forty-eight cents, for payments and offsets as found by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The plaintiffs are not entitled to interest. Their claim was an uncertain and unliquidated demand. The amount due cannot be ascertained from the face of the contract, but is to be settled by process of law. On such demands, interest, <em>eo </em>nomine, cannot be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum of one thousand one hundred and sixty-eight dollars and four cents, in United States gold coin.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Mr. Justice Crockett did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
