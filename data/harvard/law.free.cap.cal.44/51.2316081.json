On the 3d of September, 1870, after this action had been commenced, the Board of Supervisors ordered a warrant to he drawn in favor of the District Attorney, for the amount of damages allowed the plaintiff, and that the amount be paid or tendered the plaintiff. The warrant was drawn, and the District Attorney caused the amount of it in gold and silver to be tendered to the plaintiff, who refused it.

At most the order to the plaintiff only entitled him to a warrant upon the Current Expense Fund, which, upon presentation, would be paid if there was at the time money in the Fund to pay it. This was not a compliance with either the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>or spirit of the law, and the plaintiff\u2019s land was not thereafter \u201c deemed to be taken for public use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Nor was the tender made by the defendant to the plaintiff in September of the amount awarded as damages of any avail. No authority is found in the statute for such a tender. If the public needed the plaintiff\u2019s land for a road there was a plain, speedy, and easy method\u2019 provided by which it might be taken. That method, however, could not be departed from and a new one substituted in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\"Until all the provisions of the statute were strictly complied with the defendant had no right to open the proposed road over the land of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
