It also tended to show that at the time of the conveyance of December 3d, 1868, there were incumbrances to a large amount on the land, consisting of mortgages and liens for taxes, which mortgages had been given by the grantor\u2019s, and tb/it said Sainsevaine afterward delivered the note to the payee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">' The note was indorsed by Mrs. Carillo to her husband, and by him in blank to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">The trial was before a jury, and the defendants asked the Court to instruct the jury that \u201c the word ' deed ' in an instrument is a generic term, and embraces a mortgage or any other instrument under seal.\u201d The instruction was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-11\">The plaintiffs recovered judgment, and the defendants appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-12\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>V. E. Howard &amp; </em>Sepulveda, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-6\">It was error to refuse the instructions asked by the defendants, to the effect that the word \u201cdeed\u201d in the warranty included mortgages, as it is a well-settled rule that \u201c deed \u201d embraces any contract or agreement under seal. (1 Bouvier\u2019s Inst. 346, See. 880; <em>Rex </em>v. Fauntleroy, 2 British Crown Cases, 52, 57; Hitt. Dig., Conveyances, Sec. 36; 3 Wash. Real Property, 217.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-7\">There was no execution or acknowledgment of the wife, separate and apart from her husband, as required by the statute. (1 Hitt. Dig., Sec. 3568<em>; Selover </em>v. <em>American Russian Co., </em>7 Cal. 266; <em>Tillinghast </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>7 Rhode Island, 230.) Because, under the statute, the husband could not join the wife in a transfer or assignment to himself, and could not, therefore, become the indorser of the note. It is not the method required by the statute, and the husband and wife could not contract at common law. (7 Rhode Island, 230; 1 Bright on Husband and Wife, 29; 1 Parson\u2019s Cont. 286; Story on Bills, Secs. 90, 92.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>Glassell, Chapman &amp; Smith, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">Under our statute and decisions it is clear that a mortgage is never considered to be a deed conveying an interest in real estate, either before or after condition broken. (Hitt. Dig., Art. 5199; <em>Goodenow </em>v. <em>Ewer, </em>16 Cal. 467; <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Warschaur, </em>21 Cal. 621.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b135-10\">By the Court, Rhodes, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">It is admitted by the pleadings, that the promissory note in suit was assigned by the payee to the plaintiffs. That fact not being in issue, no question arises as to whether the assignment was made in such form as to pass the interest of a married woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Hpon the issue, as to whether the plaintiffs took the note with notice of the facts relating to its delivery to the payee, the evidence was conflicting, and the verdict therefore will not he disturbed on the ground, that on that issue it is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The agreement executed by Sainsevaine and Jos\u00e9 C. Carrillo to the purchasers of the rancho, acknowledges the receipt of thirteen thousand dollars, gold coin, \u201cfor and on account of the sale of the rancho,\u201d and does not mention a promissory note; but if it can be construed as referring to the note in suit, because it was proven that the note constituted a portion of the purchase money for the rancho, still the verdict must be sustained. That, the term \u201c deed \u201d will in its largest sense include a mortgage there can be no doubt; but it is manifest from the context, that the term was used in that instrument in a more limited sense. The deed referred to, as of even date with the instrument, was executed to the purchasers of the rancho, and is mentioned \u201c as the deed conveying said rancho to said parties;\u201d and a deed against which said purchasers desired to protect themselves, is described as \u201canother deed conveying the interest\u201d of the same grantor in the rancho. A proper construction of the instrument renders it clear that the parties used the term \u201cdeed\u201d in both instances, as meaning an instrument in writing which purported to convey the title of Maria Merced Williams de Carrillo to the rancho. It was not shown that another deed of conveyance had been executed by her prior to that which bore even date with that instrument; nor was it shown that the deed, to the purchasers mentioned in that instrument, failed to convey to them the title to the rancho.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u2022 Judgment and order affirmed with ten per cent damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Neither Mr. Chief Justice Wallace nor Mr. Justice Crockett expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
