The complaint alleged that the defendants were partners and made the note as partners. Stearns answered, denying the partnership. Stearns had commenced an action against Turner in the same Court in which this action was brought, to recover a large sum of money alleged by him to be his due on transactions connected with the running of a flouring mill. It was in relation to this mill that the partnership was claimed to exist, and Stearns, in said action, had procured an attachment. Turner, answered, setting up that he and Stearns were partners in running the mill, and moved on this ground to dissolve the attachment, and filed affidavits in support of the motion. This case was referred to the Court Commissioner, and on the trial the plaintiff, to prove that Stearns was a partner of Turner when the note was given, offered in evidence the answer of Turner and affidavits filed in the suit of <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Turner. </em>The defendant, Stearns, objected, and the referee overruled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>objection.

The main purpose for which they were used in that case, was to prove the principal point in issue in this case\u2014the partnership between Stearns and Turner\u2014which is affirmed by the latter, and denied by the former. We cannot conceive of any principle which would justify their admission under the circumstances of this case. Eor aught that appears in the case, all the persons who made those affidavits 'were living and within the jurisdiction of the Court, and in every respect competent as witnesses in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The answer of Turner, which was filed in the case of <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>was not admissible as against Stearns to prove the partnership.
