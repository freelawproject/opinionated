The defendant, Broad and his wife, acquired the title to the lot in 1852, by purchase from Logan, the grantee of the Alcalde, and held it as community property until 1858, when the wife died. The plaintiffs are the children of the wife. After the death of his wife the defendant Broad executed a deed to William Murray purporting to convey the title in fee to a part of the premises. The plaintiffs having parted with no interest vesting in them by the death of their mother, brought this action, claiming one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>half the premises as tenants in common with the defendants. Judgment was rendered for the defendants, and the plaintiffs appealed. (See <em>Broad </em>v. Broad, 40 Cal. 493.)</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-6\"><em>J.

It has been held that the Practice Act is merely directory, as to the time of filing the findings, and as to the order of filing in relation to the entry of the judgment. <em>(Vermule </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>4 Cal. 216; <em>Polhemus </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>42 Cal. 375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">It is evident that the principles announced by this Court in <em>Broad </em>v. <em>Broad, </em>40 Cal. 493, are decisive of this case. Charles Broad was a tenant in common with the plaintiff's of the land in controversy at the date of his conveyance to William Martin. The plaintiffs have never parted with their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>title, and have still an interest in the land which entitles them to some measure of relief. The findings were based upon the theory of an entire want of title in the plaintiffs, and do not sufficiently inform us of the relative rights of the parties to enable us to direct the manner of partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
