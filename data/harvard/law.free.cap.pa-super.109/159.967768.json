A responsive answer was filed by respondent, denying each allegation of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">The court below, Lewis, J., on November 10, 1932, discharged the rule to vacate and made absolute a rule reducing the order for alimony pendente lite from $100 per week to $60 per week. From the order so reducing the amount of alimony, this appeal is taken by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">At the time this appeal was taken no appeal had been taken by respondent from the decree granting the divorce. An appeal was subsequently taken at No. 358, October Term, 1932, and argued with this case, and an opinion filed herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Appellant contends that the court below, having discharged the rule to vacate the decree for alimony pendente lite, had no authority to reduce the amount of alimony theretofore granted, without a petition or a separate rule in support thereof. The right to alimony pendente lite is statutory. (Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1237, Sec. 46.) \u201cHow much shall be granted is a matter of judicial discretion. The court may annul or suspend such a decree in a proper case, but it is left to its discretion by the very words of the statute.\u201d Orlaby, P. J., in Karmany v. Karmany, 71 Pa. Superior Ct. 308, 310. The Act of 1929, supra, has not changed the discretionary power vested in the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We quote from the opinion of our Brother Balbrige, in Kuehnle v. Kuehnle, 103 Pa. Superior Ct. 415, 416; 157 A. 218: \u2018 \u2018 The order of the court allowing a wife her expenses, alimony pendente lite, is, in its nature, interlocutory and the amount thereof is largely within the sound discretion of the court, and the appellate court will not reverse except for plain abuse of discretion. In Ray v. Ray, 89 Pa. Superior Ct. 566, this court, speaking through Judge Keller, said, at page 567: \u2018The amount to be allowed a wife, respondent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>divorce, for her support pendente lite and counsel fees is largely in the discretion of the court of common pleas, subject to the condition that the allowance for support should not substantially exceed one-third of the income from the property and labor of the husband.\u2019 \u201d To same effect, see White v. White, 106 Pa. Superior Ct. 80, 161 A. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">While the rule in this case was on a petition to annul, the greater necessarily included the less. We cannot say that the lower court abused its discretion in reducing the alimony as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The assignments of error are overruled and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
