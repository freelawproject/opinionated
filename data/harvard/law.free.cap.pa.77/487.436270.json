They will confine themselves to the practical points presented for deliberation and decision. In the first place, does the Statute of Limitations apply to an action of dower. The second section of the Act of the 26th of March 1785, is in these words: \u2018 From henceforth no person or persons whatsoever shall make entry into any manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments after the expiration of twenty-one years next after his, her or their right or title to the same first descended or accrued, nor shall any person or persons whatsoever have or maintain any writ of right, or any other real or possessory writ or action for any manor, lands, tenements or hereditaments of the seisin or possession of him, her or themselves, his, her or their ancestors or predecessors, nor declare or allege any other seisin of him, her or themselves, his, her or their ancestors or predecessors, than within twenty-one years next before such writ, action or suit so hereafter to be sued, commenced or brought.\u2019 This language is certainly broad enough to include any suit brought to recover the possession of land. Before the Statute of Merton, nothing but land could be recovered in dower. Since the statute, it could hardly be claimed that the action would remain a real one where the husband should die disseised, when the widow would be entitled to an assignment of one-third by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>metes and bounds, and would become a personal one where the husband should die seised, when the widow could take damages equal to one-third of the annual value. The ground has been taken that the statute should not apply because the words \u2018ancestors or predecessors\u2019 would be incongruous if used in reference to a tenant in dower. But it was not the purpose of the legislature to define the status of a tenant of the freehold of any class. It was \u2018 the seisin or possession\u2019 of the tenant under whom title should be asserted, in regard to which the law was framed. The claimant was to be barred if the suit had not been commenced within twenty-one years after the previous \u2018 seisin or possession\u2019 had come to an end. Although the husband dying seised, the claim of the widow is for money, yet it is for an interest in land, \u2014 it is, at least, a right issuing out of land, \u2014 and it is founded directly upon the preceding \u2018 seisin or possession\u2019 of the husband, extending down to the very hour of his death. Nothing could indicate more clearly the uniform judicial, professional and popular conception of the nature of this action than the provisions of those sections of the Act of the 13th of June 1836, relating to the commencement of real actions : sects. 79, 80, 81, 88, Pamph. L. 587, 1 Br. Pui-d. 55, 56, pi. 1-4, title, <em>\u2018Actions Real.\u2019 </em>This act wa.s drawn by the commissioners appointed to revise the civil code, and was passed by the legislature in the words in which it was reported. The sections referred to regulated the practice of the courts in \u2018 actions of dower, partition, waste, ejectment, nuisance and all other pleas of land.\u2019 \u2018 With us,\u2019 said Bell, Jl, in Jones <em>v. </em>Patterson, 2 Jones 149, \u2018 dower is strictly a real action, originating in, and proceeding upon the principles, and according to the forms of the common law, and is so treated by our legislation in respect of it;\u2019 and reference was then made to the Act of 1836. In Culler <em>v. </em>Motzer, 13 S. &amp; R. 356, while the material question was whether the Statute of Limitations ran against a widow\u2019s claim of dower during coverture, or only commenced to run at the date of the husband\u2019s death, it was assumed as settled and undisputed that the statute applied to the action. The suit was on a bond for the purchase-, money of land conveyed with covenants of warranty, and defence was made on the ground of defect of title, and an outstanding claim of dower by the widow of the grantor. Justice Duncan, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, said: \u2018 If the enSry and possession had been adverse to the husband\u2019s right, and his right of entry had been barred by the Statute of Limitations, the widow\u2019s dower would have been barred. Our Act of Limitations comprehends as well all possessory actions, as all legal actions.\u2019 The same view of the subject was taken in Rankin <em>v. </em>Tenbrook, 6 Watts 388. The case of Culler <em>v. </em>Motzer, it is admitted, does not amount to an authoritative decision of the point in issue. But it certainly indicates settled professional opinion in regard to it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and it is not known that in any case any rule has been established to weaken its effect. In Jones <em>v. </em>Powell, 6 Johns. Ch. 194, the general subject was discussed by Chancellor Kent. The New York statute had declared that \u2018 no action for the recovery of any lands should be maintained unless on a seisin or possession of the plaintiff or of the ancestor or predecessor of the plaintiff, within twenty-five years before such action brought.\u2019 The chancellor said: <em>\u2018 </em>As far as the widow\u2019s action at law belonged to the class of possessory actions, founded on the right of entry, it would have fallen under the same limitation as an action of ejectment, and as far as it partook of the nature of a writ of right, it would seem to fall within the limitation of twenty-five years applicable to the writ of right. * * * The general and sweeping language of the act, no less than the sound policy of it, would dictate the application of it to the action of dower, as well as to any other real action.\u2019 It is true the judgment in Jones <em>v. </em>Powell, was controlled by another statute, but the courts of the country have never been accustomed to treat the carefully-considered utterances of Chancellor Kent as conjectural <em>diota. </em>The authorities collected in 2 Scribner on Dower 523-543, show that the general rule in the different states of the union is to hold Statutes of Limitation, similar to that of Pennsylvania, as applicable to dower. And, generally, where dower is held not to be barred, it is in states that have adopted, or re-enacted the provisions of the English statute of 32 Henry VIII., ch. 2, and have modeled their practice upon the precedents under that statute of the English courts. [It is believed that upon principle and authority the action of dower falls within the limitation of the Act of 1785.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">\u201c This conclusion reached, a single inquiry remains. In the circumstances of the present case, ought the bar of the statute to be applied ? The view of the plaintiff is, that John Keller died seised, inasmuch as he retained the legal title and died in possession ; that upon his death.there was no tenant of the freehold upon whom a writ in an action of dower could have been served; that the widow had no remedy in the Orphans\u2019 Court, because, although her husband died seised, his interest in the land had been converted into personalty by virtue of the contract; that George Keller became tenant of the freehold, so as to he liable to the widow only when the conveyance was made to him under the decree for specific performance, on the 24th of April 1848, and that, consequently, the action, having been commenced within twenty-one years from the date of the conveyance, the defence of the statute cannot be sustained. If this theory is to be taken as true, without qualification, it would follow that a widow in the position of Mrs. Keller could bring no suit for fifty years, if a vendee, satisfied with his contract, and possession under it, should pay the purchase-money, and leave the legal title in the vendor\u2019s heirs. It is mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fest that the problem presented must be solved in some other form than this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">\u201c The general rule of law in Pennsylvania is that the action of dower cannot be maintained where the husband dies seised and in possession, the remedy of the widow being in the Orphans\u2019 Court: Thomas <em>v. </em>Simpson, 3 Barr 60; Taylor <em>v. </em>Birmingham, 5 Casey 306. But the rule has been made subject to some peculiar modifications, in consequence of the importance that has always been attached here to equitable estates, and of the effect that has always been given to alienation by contract. This is illustrated by the cases of Riddlesberger <em>v. </em>Mentzer, 7 Watts 141, and Covert <em>v. </em>Hertzog, 4 Barr 145. In each of those eases suit was brought after probate of the contract and execution of the deed. In neither case does it appear from the report whether the action was for land in severalty, or fot damages. It is of course indispensable in the present case that John Keller should legally appear to have died seised. Otherwise the action, being for damages, could not be sustained, and if he was not seised, some vendee, grantee, or disseisor must have been tenant of the freehold, and in favor of such a tenant the statute would run from the time of the husband\u2019s death. That there was such seisin in John Keller at the time of his death as to warrant an action for damages is shown by the case of Jones <em>v. </em>Patterson, <em>2 </em>Jones 149. There, the husband of the plaintiff had sold by contract to Edward Hooper, and Hooper having died, the report states affirmatively that \u2018 no deed was ever executed to the administrators in trust, or to the heirs of the said Hooper.\u2019 Hooper\u2019s heirs conveyed to Patterson, one of the defendants, by deed. Patterson sold to John Harvey by articles of agreement; and Harvey sold, apparently by contract also, to John Casporus, who was joint defendant with Patterson. The special verdict found, also, that Patterson had never been in possession of the land. The Supreme Court held the action of dower to be maintainable as against both of the defendants. [The conveyance of the legal title, therefore, is not indispensable to give the widow the right to sue.] When, then, .does this right accrue? It would seem reasonable to answer, [when the vendee, by some unmistakable declaration, or some unmistakable act, made or done after the death of the vendor, has asserted his right under the contract, and has claimed the ownership of the land.] [Notice of his intention to hold the estate,given to the vendor\u2019s legal and personal representatives, the taking possession of the property, or, being in possession, the exercise of unequivocal acts of exclusive ownership would be such assertion of title as to give the widow her right of action, and from that moment her right would be affected by the Statute of Limitations.] Here, under the testimony of William Wamsher, it is claimed, on behalf of the defendants, that George Keller entered into the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sion of this land about the 1st of April 1846, within a month from the time of his father\u2019s death \u2014 that the widow left the premises before he moved in, \u2014 that he claimed exclusive ownership, and exercised exclusive control over the property, and that his possession under the contract was under a claim of right as definite as it afterwards was under the deed of the administrator, made in April 1848. The credibility of testimony is for the jury. [If after Creorge Keller\u2019s entry on the land, his possession and claim of title were so significant and unmistakable as, in view of the rules stated by the court, to give notice to the widow of his assertion of title, an .action of dower could have been maintained by her, and if this entry was made more than twenty-one years before the action was commenced, the Statute of Limitations, would be a bar to a recovery.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">The verdict was for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">The plaintiff sued out a writ of error and assigned for error the parts of the charge in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-8\"><em>A.

As the Statute of Merton substituted damages in lieu of the right to have dower assigned by metes and bounds, the widow had no longer a right of entry, and the Statute of Limitations of 32 Henry VIII., ch. 2, which enacted that no person should make entry into any lands, &amp;c., unless within threescore years, did not apply to the dower of the widow, as held consistently by the English courts : Angel\u00ed on Limitations, \u00a7 367 n.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">In the English law, the wife\u2019s remedy by action of dower is not within the ordinary Statutes of Limitation, for the widow has no seisin; 4 Kent 70; Davenport <em>v. </em>Wright, Dyer 224 a; 1 Shep.

After conveyance the seisin of the grantee is in his own right, and is of course adverse to the grantor and his heirs. The same effect must be attributed to a contract of sale executed by delivery of possession, and consummated by a decree of specific performance and conveyance. The estate is equitably converted by the contract of sale, and the specific performance under the decree relates back to the sale in giving effect to the rights acquired under it. The court below was therefore right in holding the possession to be adverse from the time it was taken under the contract, for from that time onward the vendee under the articles held for himself, and not for the vendor, except so far as the retention of the legal title made the possession subject to the rights of the vendor to enforce the contract, and this was finally extinguished by the execution of the decree for specific performance. These questions are so well discussed, and the reasons stated in the charge of the learned judge below, it is unnecessary to say more.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
