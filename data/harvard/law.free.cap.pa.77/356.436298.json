This is variously described in his will, above recited, as \u201c all my real and personal estate and property in the island of Jamaica,\u201d or \u201c the real estate in Jamaica,\u201d or \u201c the real estate and property in the island of Jamaica.\u201d Under the laws of Jamaica slaves were real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">On the 28th of August 1833, the British Parliament passed \u201c An Act for the abolition of slavery throughout the British colonies, &amp;c.-, 3 &amp; 4 Wm. IY., c, 73, wherein it was provided that on and after the 1st day of August 1834, all persons held in slavery within any British colony should become and be, to all intents and purposes, free and discharged of and from all manner of slavery, and be absolutely and for ever manumitted; and that in order to compensate the persons entitled to the services of the slaves for the loss of such services, 20,000,0007 should be set aside, and, by commissioners to be appointed by the crown, apportioned amongst the several slave colonies, and afterwards divided amongst the holders of the slaves. The material clauses of the Act of Parliament, are given at lai\u2019ge in the opinion of Judge Mercur. The slaves were set free August 1st 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-9\">The commissioners were authorized to frame rules, regard being had to the laws and usages of the respective colonies, for securing the just and equitable distribution of the funds, &amp;c.; the rules to be submitted to the Privy Council, and upon being confirmed by them, to be certified to the Court of Chancery, there to remain of record and <em>be </em>of the same validity as if made by Parliament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-10\">Rules were accordingly prepared, submitted and confirmed by the Privy Council, March 10th 1835. Amongst others, were the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-11\">That in respect to all persons who, as owners or creditors, legatees or annuitants, may have any joint or common interest in any slave or slaves, or may be entitled to or interested in any slave or slaves, either in possession, remainder, reversion or expectaucy, the compensation-moneys to be awarded in respect of such slave or slaves shall be deemed to be of the same nature and impressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>with the same character for all purposes whatsoever, so far as the same can be so taken and applied, as the slave or slaves in respect of whom such moneys shall be allotted, and'shall be subject to the same rules of distribution, and to the same charges and liabilities as the same slave or slaves respectively would have been subject to, according to the several estates and interests of the parties entitled thereto, and agreeably to the law an&lt;J usages of the particular colony in which such slave or slaves may be registered or settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">That the compensation-moneys to be awarded in respect of any slave or slaves subject to any trusts or powers whatsoever, shall be subject to the same trusts or powers in all respects as the same slave or slaves were subject to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">That in ease of the death of any person entitled to such compensation-moneys who may die intestate before the award of such compensation, the succession to such moneys shall be the same as the succession to the interest in the slave or slaves in respect of whom the compensation shall be allotted according to the law of the particular colony in which such slave or slaves were registered or settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">The testator did not live to receive the compensation-money. All the devisees and legatees named in his will survived him ; but his two children died under the age of twenty-one years, unmarried and without issue. On the 19th June 1835, the executors filed an \u201c inventory of the household goods and furniture of the late John Bowen,\u201d their appraised value amounting to $2384.50. No other inventory was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">On the 5th of October 1835, the commissioners of compensation awarded'to Martha P. Bowen and Austin Montgomery 2751Z. 3s. <em>Id. </em>for the slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-10\">On the 12th of March 1836, the amount of this award, with interest, $13,767.69, was paid to the executors ; of this sum they invested on the 7th of July 1836, $12,950.79 in the stock of the Bank of the United States, chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on the 7th of July preceding. The bank suspended specie payments in May 1837, and failed in February 1841; the whole investment was lost. The executors of Mr. Bowen never filed an administration account. Mrs. Bowen died unmarried on the 15th of July 1849, leaving a will by which she directed as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\">\u201c I direct that so much of my. six per cent, bonds of the city of Cincinnati as may be necessary for the purpose be sold, and the proceeds thereof to be applied as a repayment to the Bowen Hall estate in the island of Jamaica for certain moneys received from the sale of land belonging to the estate, and which moneys have been used in the management of the said estate.\u201d And she appointed J. Fisher Learning and John Bowen, late Ralph W. Peacock, executors. The auditor of Mr. Learning\u2019s accounts, reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>as to the power of sale given to her and her co-executor by the will of John Bowen; \u201c The power of sale appears to have been partially exercised (whether adequately or not the auditor does not undertake to determine), and the proceeds, amounting to about $2600, received by Mrs. Bowen. Austin Montgomery, surviving executor of John Bowen, and husband of Mrs. Isabel B. Montgomery, claimed the.sum of $2639.32, with interest from July 5th 1849, for moneys received from the Bowen Hall estate by Mrs Bowen during her lifetime, and which she directed to be repaid to that estate by the clause in her will, already recited. This claim was admitted to be correct by the executor of Mrs. Bowen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">After Mrs. Bowen\u2019s death, Mrs. Isabel B. Montgomery the next life-tenant, found the Jamaica estate in a very low condition, the buildings dilapidated, &amp;c., and stock wanting. ' She did not make any repairs to the houses, but authorized her agents in Jamaica to expend money for wages of labor, and restocking the place, so as to bring it into cultivation. On a settlement with her agents, on the-23d of September, she was found to be indebted to them $2286.37; her husband, Austin Montgomery, paid this amount to the agent on the 9th of December 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">On the 21st of May 1851, Mr. Learning, the executor, &amp;c., of Mrs. Bowen, paid to Austin Montgomery, as executor, &amp;c., of Bowen, $2929.51 in full, principal a,nd interest of the amount directed by Mrs. Bowen\u2019s will to be repaid to her husband\u2019s estate. On the final settlement' of Mrs. Bowen\u2019s estate, it was ascertained that it would not pay its creditors in full, and on the 18th of August 1854, the auditor reported that Mr. Montgomery, the executor, should refund $431.93 of the $2929.61 which had been paid to him as surviving executor of Mr. Bowmn\u2019s will; it was accordingly repaid. At this audit, John Bowen (whose name had been changed by Act of Assembly from Ralph W. Peacock), one of the remainder-men, in his own right, and as administrator, &amp;c., of George S. Peacock, the other remainder-man, claimed indemnity for losses from the investment of the funds of Bowmn, the testator, in the stock of the Bank of the United States; the auditor dismissed the claim, chiefly for reasons not involving the question of the propriety of the investment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">On the 29th of January 1855, Austin Montgomery, as surviving executor, &amp;c., of Bowen, the testator, executed to Learning, the executor, &amp;e., of Mrs. Martha P. Bowen, the other executor, ce release of all demands which he might have against him individually or as executor, or by reason of the claim of the remainder-men, set forth in the above-mentioned auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-9\">Austin Montgomery died November 5th 1855, having made his will, dated January 27th 1851, giving all his estate to his wife, Isabel B. Montgomery; he appointed her his executrix; letters testamentary were issued to her November 13th 1855, but she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>never filed any inventory or account. She died December 16th 1865, having made a will, of which John T. Montgomery and Edward E. Law were appointed executors, to whom, after some controversy as to the validity of the will, letters testamentary were issued July 11th 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">After the death of Austin Montgomery, letters of administration, d. b. n. c. t. a. of Bowen the testator were issued to James Pleasants ; he was also administrator, &amp;c., of John Bowen (late Peacock) and George S. Peacock, the remainder-men under the testator Bowen\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">On the 31st of April-1868, the executors, &amp;c., of Isabel B. Montgomery filed their administration account. Before the auditor to whom it was referred, Pleasants presented claims for the $13,477.77, compensation received for slaves, arid the $2929.61 repaid under Mrs. Bowen\u2019s will with interest. The executors of Mrs. Montgomery having in their hands a balance of about $119,000, by consent of all the parties, $20,000 were set aside to meet these claims, and the remainder of the balance distributed to the parties entitled under her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">About July 10th 1869, administration d. b. n. c. t. a. of the estate of Austin Montgomery was granted to \u201c The Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives,\u201d &amp;c. \u201d Upon the application of parties interested under the will of Bowen, the testator, the Orphans\u2019 Court appointed an auditor to state an account of the administration of Isabel B. Montgomery of the estate of Austin Montgomery, and to report the amount of assets which had come into her hands from his estate. The auditor reported, February 19th 187 0, that Mrs. Montgomery had received from Austin Montgomery\u2019s estate an amount beyond all allowances, exceeding the sum set aside to meet the claims for the investment in United States Bank stock and the money repaid under Mrs. Bowen\u2019s will, and that Mrs. Montgomery\u2019s executors should be charged with the sum so set aside, which then amounted to $21,111.93. This sum was afterwards transferred to The Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives, &amp;c., as administrator, &amp;c., of Austin Montgomery, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">So far as can be gathered from the report of the auditor \u2014 in which the foregoing facts were found \u2014 and the history of the case in the appellant\u2019s paper-book, The Pennsylvania Company, &amp;c., administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Austin Montgomery, deceased, settled the account of their administration, which was referred to an auditor to report distribution. He found that the accountants were chargeable with $21,111.93.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">The claims which were specially before the auditor were by the representatives of R. W. Peacock (now John Bowen) and George S. Peacock, for the amount of compensation paid for the slaves; also, for the $2929.61, repaid under the direction of Mrs. Bowen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>will, to Austin Montgomery as surviving executor of Bowen tbe testator\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-4\">The auditor reported that the Act of Parliament was an equitable conversion of the slaves into personal property, citing Richard <em>v. </em>Attorney-General of Jamaica, 6 Moore\u2019s Privy Council Cases 331, a case in which the effect of the same Act of Parliament as to conversion was considered. He further reported that there being a conversion, the property, thus being personal estate, did not pass under the specific gift of all his \u201c real and personal estate and property in the island of Jamaica,\u201d but had no locality apart from the person of the owner : it therefore followed the law of the pei\u2019son and passed to the widow as residuary legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">As regards the investment in United States Bank stock the auditor, quoting the clause in Bowen the testator\u2019s will, said that the executors <em>\u201c </em>were bound to invest the money in some safe and productive stock, mortgages or other real security, either in Jamaica or the United States of America.\u201d This duty they fulfilled as far as the bulk of the fund was concerned, by investing the same in said stock of the Bank of the United States. In July 1836, when said purchase of stock was made, the stock of said bank was generally regarded as a good and safe investment by the community \u2014 by business men; was selling at about the price at which the said executor and executrix bought, viz.: $123, which was $23 above its par value; that it sold for as much as $122.50 in October 1838, the fluctuations not being very great between 1836 and 1838. The bank was paying specie, and continued to do so, until about the 11th of May 1837. Not only was its reputation good, but its character was good so far as any ordinary person, cautious and seeking for information, could then discover, if he had scrutinized its affairs ; * * * The dividends on the stock were such as to characterize^the stock as <em>\u201c </em>productive\u201d also. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">It would be altogether contrary to equity to hold that Austin Montgomery, having power to invest in a <em>\u201c </em>safe and productive <em>stock,\u201d </em>was not authorized to invest in the United States Bank stock in July 1836. And having once made a proper investment, he could not be held liable for not selling it at a loss before the bank failed. * * * Upon the foregoing hypothesis, that portion of the compensation fund which was not invested, the said Austin Montgomery would be obliged to account for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-7\">In reference to the balance of the sum $2929.61 repaid under the directions of Mrs. Bowen\u2019s will, he reported : \u201c It must be assumed that the sale of land spoken of by Mrs. Bowen in her will, was one made during the minority of her son, and a valid one. It is further submitted that the direction to repay money to Bowen Hall estate was not intended as a gift but an honest restoration by Mrs. Bowen to the estate of her husband of a sum equal to the principal money she had received from a sale of part of his estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>in Jamaica, and which she, as life-tenant, had used in the management of said estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">The said $2929,61 being the proceeds of sale of land under the will of John Bowen, it was the plain duty of Austin Montgomery, under the Sd clause of said will, upon receiving said money, to invest the \u201c same' in some safe and productive stock, mortgages or other real security either in Jamaica or the United States of America and not having done so, he became responsible for the amount to all parties interested. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">This claim is allowed after deducting from the amount thereof the $431.93 refunded by order of court towards paying her debts, as hereinbefore mentioned, the interest to be computed on the balance from the death of Mrs. Isabel B. Montgomery. * * * The auditor cannot say that the estate of Austin Montgomery is liable for more than he received and was finally allowed to hold, viz., $2497.68, with interest. * * * He reported therefore that the estate of Austin Montgomery was liable for the balance of the amount paid him, which arose from the money repaid under the direction of Mr. Bowen\u2019s will and was paid to him. This sum, with interest to February 16th 1872, amounted to $3421.82, the remainder (after deducting costs and expenses), amounting to $17,765,21, he awarded to the executors, &amp;c., of Isabel B. Montgomery, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">James Pleasants filed exceptions to the report of the auditor ; they were quite voluminous, but raised the following questions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">Who were the persons entitled under the will of John Bowen, the testator, to the money received as compensation for his slaves; was the Act of Parliament a conversion into real estate, and if so, was the gift of his property in Jamaica specific, so that, whether real or personal, the compensation passed under it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">The other question was whether the executors were responsible for the loss arising from the investment in the stock of the Bank of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-11\">The Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report of the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-12\">Pleasants appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned for error, that the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in dismissing the exceptions and confirming the report of the auditor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-13\"><em>It. II. McGrath </em>and <em>J. U. Gowen </em>(with whom was <em>3.

Montgomery for life, and on her death absolutely to Ralph W. and George S. Peacock, whose estates are represented by the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-7\">The investment of the compensation-money, when received, by the executors of John Bowen\u2019s will, in the stock of the Bank of the United States in 1836, where it was lost, was not an investment in a \u201c safe and productive stock\u201d under the direction contained in his will, and they are liable to the appellant for the loss occasioned thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">Appellant\u2019s claim is not barred by lapse of time, he having no right of action until the death of Mrs. Montgomery, the life-tenant, in 1865.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-9\">As to the question of conversion, Richards <em>v. </em>Attorney General, cited by the auditor, is not binding on our courts : Cathcart <em>v. </em>Robinson, 5 Peters 280; Koontz <em>v. </em>Krable, 16 Md. 555; Skelly <em>v. </em>Bank, 9 Ohio St. 616; Lebanon Bank <em>v. </em>Mangan, 4 Casey 452.

The one covered by the first four assignments of error; the other, by the sixth and seventh assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The first question is, to whom, under the will of John Bowen, was given the compensation-money, subsequently paid, for the liberation of his slaves ?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">On the 20th of November 1832, he was the owner of a plantation, with 130 slaves thereon, situated in the island of Jamaica. On that day, being domiciled in the city of Philadelphia, he made his last will and testament. Therein and thereby he' devised and bequeathed to his wife all his real and personal estate and property in the island of Jamaica, for her own use, during her natural life, provided she continued unmarried, with remainders over terminating in the persons for Avhose estate the appellant is administrator. All the rest, residue and remainder of his estate, both real and personal, he devised and bequeathed to his wife, her heirs and assigns. He died on the 4th of March 1835, domiciled in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">This will was duly proved before the Register of Wills, in Philadelphia, on the 17th of June 1835, and letters testamentary granted to the executors therein named;</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">At the date of the will, slaves in Jamaica were real estate. They must have been transferred by acts <em>inter vivos, </em>or by devise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>in the same manner, and with the same formalities as lands: 1 Burges\u2019 Colonial and Foreign Laws 663-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On the 28th of August 1833, the British Parliament passed the Act of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV., ch. 73. It is entitled, \u201cAn Act for the abolition of slavery throughout the British colonies; for promoting the industry of the manumitted slaves, and for compensating the persons hitherto entitled to the services of such slaves.\u201d In the preamble is recited: \u201c Whereas, divers persons are holden in slavery within divers of his majesty\u2019s colonies, and it is just and expedient that all such persons should be manumitted and set free, and that a reasonable compensation should be made to the persons hitherto entitled to the services of such slaves, for the loss they will incur by being deprived of their right to such services.\u201d Subject to certain obligations, and a limited apprenticeship provided by the act, section 12 declares: \u201cAll and every the persons who, on the 1st day of August 1834, shall be holden in slavery within any such British colony as aforesaid, shall, upon and from, and after the said 1st day of August 1834, become and be to all intents and purposes, free and discharged of and from all manner of slavery, and shall be absolutely and for ever manumitted ; and that the children thereafter to be born to any such persons, and the offspring of such children, shall, in like manner, be free from their birth; and that from and after the said 1st day of August 1834, slavery shall be and is hereby utterly and for ever abolished and declared unlawful throughout the British colonies, plantations and possessions abroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Sect. 24 declares: \u201cAnd whereas, towards compensating the persons at present entitled to the services of the slaves to be manumitted and set free by virtue of this act, for the loss of such services, his majesty\u2019s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, have resolved to give and grant to his majesty the sum of 20,000,000/. sterling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Other sections of the act provide a mode for the distribution and apportionment of the fund among the several persons who may prefer claims thereon, after adequate and satisfactory provision shall have been made in the colonies respectively, for giving effect to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The colonial government of Jamaica made the required provision in March. 1834. Under the action of the commissioners appointed for that purpose, and under the general rules adopted, there were found to be 311,692 slaves in Jamaica, and the sum of 6,161,827/. 6s. lOJti. was given to pay for them. To the executors of John Bowen, and as compensation for his slaves manumitted by said act, was awarded the sum of 2751/. 3s. <em>Id., </em>on the 13th of February 1836. This sum was subsequently paid over to the executors, amounting at the time of its receipt to $13,477.77.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The appellant, as the representative of the parties entitled to the remainder in the real estate devised in Jamaica, claims .this fund. His counsel contend, that inasmuch as by the laws of Jamaica, the slaves were real estate at the time of the execution of the will of John Bowen, the compensation-money paid after his death being in lieu of the slaves, passed to the same devisees who would have been entitled to them had they remained real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">After the execution of his will and before his death, the legal <em>status </em>of his slaves had undergone a radical change. The British Parliament had exercised its transcendent powers. The 1st of August 1834 had come and gone. Slavery in Jamaica was on that day, and thenceforth, \u201cutterly and for ever abolished.\u201d No longer could persons be there sold or purchased, devised, or inherited as slaves. Their real estate quality was then divested and fell with their bonds of slavery. Hence, at the time of John Bowen\u2019s death, and for seven months next preceding it, he owned no slaves. Whether they had been taken from him, with or without his con'sent, they had, nevertheless, in fact and by law, been taken, and he did not die owning them. They had ceased to have the specific existence which they had when the will was executed. This entire destruction of their existence as slaves, withdrew them from the operation of the will devising them as real estate. It operated as a revocation of the will <em>quoad hoc: </em>Skerrett <em>v. </em>Burd, 1 Whart. 246 ; Blackstone <em>v. </em>Blackstone, 3 Watts 335 ; Hoke <em>v. </em>Herman, 9 Harris 301. The appellant cannot invoke the aid of the statute of 1 Vict. c. 26, passed after the death of John Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">As then the devisees of the real estate could not take the shares themselves, they cannot take the compensation received for them in lieu thereof. The devise was specific. It was of real estate in Jamaica. The conversion took place in the lifetime of the testator. The money received as a substitute cannot be held by said \"devisees: Sleech <em>v. </em>Thornington, 2 Ves. 561; Humphreys <em>v. </em>Humphreys, 2 Cox 184; Ashburner <em>v. </em>Maguire, 2 Bro. Ch. 108; 2 P. Wms. 330; Hoke <em>v. </em>Herman, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">It is true, at the time of the death of John Bowen, the precise amount of compensation-money to which he was entitled had not been ascertained and declared; yet his right to a just and reasonable proportion of the 20,000,000i. appropriated, could not be questioned. The faith of the British government was unequivocally pledged for its payment in the Act of Emancipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The right of the former owner of the slaves to compensation, and the assumption of the government to make it, are clearly admitted in the title, in the preamble, and in the body of the act. It was not a right which could be enforced by an action, inasmuch as a subject cannot sue his king. This affected only the mode of its collection, not the validity or existence of the demand. It was a valid subsisting claim against the government. The government admitted its indebtedness and actually paid the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>It is contended further, on the part of the appellant, that a proper construction of the rules framed <em>by </em>the commissioners and ratified hy her majesty\u2019s counsel, give this compensation-money to the devisees, who would have been entitled to the slaves had they remained such at the death of the testator. Those rules may be said to constitute a part of the Act of Parliament on which they are engrafted. The 3d, 4th and 5th rules are cited as establishing this conclusion. A careful reading of them does not lead our minds to that result. The facts for which they provide do not exist in the present case. No person had any joint or common interest with John Bowen in the slaves in question; nor had any other person any interest in them, either in possession, remainder, reversion or expectancy; nor were they held subject to any trust or powers whatsoever. He was the sole owner when the Act of Parliament was passed, and so continued until it went into full effect. To him, and to him alone, was the compensation-money then due. It partook of the character of a chose in action, for the recovery of which the owner was denied a common-law right of action against the debtor, but for the payment of which a specific mode had been provided by statute. If, however, the construction to be given to this Act of Parliament was doubtful, and the general rules adopted in pursuance thereof, were uncertain and obscure, Ave Avould give great Aveight to a construction put on them by the court in England. Richards <em>v. </em>Attorney-General of Jamaica, 6 Moore\u2019s Privy Council Cases 381, rules this case. There Clayton, the owner of plantations and slaves thereon, in the island of Jamaica, on the 13th of June 1834, devised his real and personal estate. He died on the same day. His will was attested by tAvo witnesses only. The law of Jamaica at that time required a Avill to be attested by three witnesses, in order to pass slaves or other real property. The Avill was, therefore, void as to the devise of real estate. After the compensation-money had been paid to the executors, a contention arose as to its distribution. The court in Jamaica held that it partook of the nature of real estate to the same extent as the slaves, and di'd not pass under the will. On appeal to the Privy Council the decree was reversed. In an able and exhaustive opinion, it Avas held, the legislature became the purchaser of the slaves under the 3 &amp; 4 Will. IY., c. 73, from the date of the act, and that the money to be received, under .the compulsory sale of the slaves, was converted into personal estate, and passed as such to the specific legatees under the Avill. The argument made before us, that the law did not go into full effect until the adoption of the rules, in 1835, was there made, and it was urged that the testator had died before their adoption. It was answered, \u201c-If (as they held) the act itself constituted this money personal estate, the right to it had vested before the rules were made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">It will be observed that Clayton died before the time designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>in tbe act for tbe slaves to become free; Bowen did not die until afterwards. The latter lived until their manumission had become an accomplished fact. The claim for compensation had then fully ripened. Thus fortified by the decision which an English court, .compos\u00e9d of able judges, has put on this act, and the identical kind of property, we have no difficulty in concluding that at the time of the death of John Bowen his claim for compensation was personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The next claim made, but not strongly pressed on the argument, is, that if it was personal estate, it passed under the specific devise. To this two answers may be given: 1. The devise was of \u201c personal estate in Jamaica.\u201d This compensation claim cannot be held to have been in Jamaica. It was due and payable in England. The language of the will was insufficient to take this claim from the residuary devisees: Hunter\u2019s Estate, 6 Barr 97; Bredlinger\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant\u2019s Cases 461; McGlaughlin <em>v. </em>McGlaughlin, 12 Harris 20; German v. German, 3 Casey 116. 2. This claim for compensation was a debt. It had in law no <em>situs, </em>but followed the person of the creditor. The <em>Ux loci rei sites </em>is, with great propriety, disregarded. John Bowen died domiciled in the city of Philadelphia. The money collected on this claim did not, therefore, pass under the specific devise of personal estate in Jamaica: Desesbats <em>v. </em>Berquier, 1 Binn. 386 ; Guier <em>v. </em>O\u2019Daniel, Id. 349, in note; Sill <em>v. </em>Worswick, 1 H. Black. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">This view of the case makes it unnecessary to consider at length the sixth and seventh assignments, which relate to the loss of the money after invested. The executors were authorized, in the words of the will, to invest <em>\u201c </em>in some safe and productive stock, mortgage, or other real security, either in Jamaica or the United States of America.\u201d In July 1836; the investment was made in the stock of the Bank of the United States. The auditor has found that the stock of the bank was then generally considered a good and safe investment by the community. It was selling for $23 per share above the par value, and the market value continued about the same for several months thereafter. The bank continued to pay specie until the 11th of May 1837. Under the powers given to the executors to invest, and an honest exercise of that power, we think it would be a very harsh application of law to their sound discretion, after this great lapse of time, to hold the executors personally liable for the loss of the bank stock. They should not be held responsible for not possessing a knowledge, and not exercising a forethought, superior to the great body of intelligent and prudent business men.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at' the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
