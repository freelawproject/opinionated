R. Hotchkiss;\u201d the declaration was in the name \u201c William Sweeney, endorsee of R. E. Wilson,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-11\">The case was tried November 19th 1873 before Lowrie, P. J., who charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-12\">That the instrument on which judgment was entered was in form of an ordinary promissory note payable to R. E. Wilson, and endorsed by him, and was transferred by him to Sweeney for valuable consideration before it became due. But there is added to the note, before the signatures of the makers, an agreement that five per cent, be added for collection in case of default of payment at maturity, and also a warrant of attorney to confess judgment on the note with said five per cent., and judgment was so entered, without allowing thejthree days of grace, and w7as afterwards opened by the court to let in this defence. And the case of the plaintiff having been presented as above, the defendants, in answer thereto, gave evidence, after objection by the plaintiff, to show that the note was .given for a patent right with warranty of its goodness, and an agreement to return the note if the said patent right should not he found good; that it was not at all equal to the warranty, and also that the note was obtained by fraud from the said Hotchkiss, in this, that by a secret agreement between the said Wilson and the defendant, Thickstun, unknown to his co-defendant, the said Thickstun was to be credited with the full payment of his half of the pretended purchase-money in consideration of. his aid in getting the said Hotchkiss to join him in the purchase of the patent right, and giving the note therefor, and immediately afterwards the said credit was entered on the said note as a payment by Thickstun. Defendants also filed a reconveyance of patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-13\">The court directed the jury to find for the defendants, if they -believe the evidence so given by them, reserving, with the consent of the parties, the question whether the facts, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>so, constituted a legal and sufficient defence to the said note, as against Sweeney, and if they do, then the judgment entered on the warrant of attorney is to be set aside and judgment' entered in favor of the defendants, and if they do not, then judgment is to be entered or confirmed in favor of the plaintiff, <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">The verdict was accordingly for the defendants, subject to the opinion of the court on the reserved question. Judge Lowrie after-wards delivered this opinion on the reserved point:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">\u201c Some doubts were expressed at the trial whether a point could properly be reserved in the above form with the consent of the parties, the plaintiff\u2019s case being admitted and the judgment being dependent on the sufficiency of the defendants\u2019 case, and I suppose this is allowable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Commonly there can be no judgment in favor of the plaintiff, after a verdict for the defendants, with a reserved point, on the sufficiency of the facts found as a defence, because commonly that would leave the plaintiff\u2019s facts not found; but no such reason exists in this case. And I suppose there may be eases where the plaintiff\u2019s case is admitted by pleadings, and the defence set up by the defendants is found by verdict in their favor. Where the question of the sufficiency of the defence may be raised by a reserved point and then decided in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment in his favor according to the declaration, a plea in confession and avoidance, even when found in favor of the defendants, does not prevent the plaintiff from having judgment in his favor, unless the plea is a sufficient answer. In our short pleadings a reserved point may stand in place of such a plea set out at length. If pleaded at length a demurrer would test its validity and bring its proper judgment, and a reserved point may do the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\"><em>\u201c </em>It seems to me that we cannot call this defence insufficient without disregarding Overton <em>v. </em>Tyler, 3 Barr 346. Besides the consideration expressed in this case, I cannot avoid thinking that an endorsee of such a paper would be required to exercise a different degree of diligence against the maker of such a note, from what is demanded in the case of negotiable instruments, in order to hold the endorsee, and if this is true 'the instrument is not negotiable. We decide the reserved point in favor of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-10\">The original judgment for the plaintiff was set aside, and judgment entered for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-11\">The plaintiff took a wont of error and assigned for error, setting aside the original judgment and entering judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-12\"><em>J.

Indeed the note in this instance has some provisions in it not in that in Overton <em>v. </em>Tyler. The reference made by Read, J., in Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Anderson, 17 P. F. Smith 421, to the case of Osborn <em>v. </em>Hanley, 19 Ohio 130, was <em>arguendo </em>and only to show how far the rule as to non-negotiable paper had been relaxed in other states. But he clearly did not intend to admit its authority, for he proceeded to distinguish the case before him from our own case of Overton <em>v. </em>Tyler, without questioning the authority of the latter. The note in this case was not negotiable by reason of the warrant of attorney contained in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
