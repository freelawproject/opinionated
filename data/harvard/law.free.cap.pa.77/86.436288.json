No scire facias was issued on the claim within three months after filing the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">By the Act of February 17th 1858, sect. 1 (Pamph. L. 2, 2 Br. Purd. 1029, pi. 23), the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of June 16th 1836 was extended to all improvements, engines, machinery, &amp;e., put up by tenants of leased estates on lands of others in Luzerne and Schuylkill counties, with the proviso that the lien should extend only to the interest of the tenants and to the improvements, &amp;c., put up by the mechanics, &amp;c., entering the lien. By Act of April 11th 1866 (Pamph. L. 649), the provisions of this act were extended to Crawford, Venango, Erie and Warren counties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">By the Act of April 8th 1868, a lien was given to persons furnishing materials to the erection, &amp;c., of any engine, engine-house, &amp;c., upon any leasehold, or material furnished, &amp;c., the lien to extend to the interest of the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-11\">The person entitled to the lien must file in the prothonotary\u2019s office within three months from the time the last work is done or last materials furnished, a statement of his claim, verified by affidavit ; the statement to set forth the names of the claimant and of the owner or reputed owner and of the contractors, the amount claimed to be due, the time when the work was done or the materials furnished, with the date and amount of each item, the locality of the property, and\u2019 a particular description of each part against which the claim is filed, describing it so as to identify it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-12\">Section 4th provided that the debt should' be a lien for six months after the last work is done or last materials furnished, although no claim should have been filed ; but the lien should not continue unless the claimant should within three months after filing his statement issue a scire facias in accordance with the provisions of the Act of June 16th 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-13\">By the 8th section the provisions of the act were to extend only to Venango county, \u201c and all laws, parts of laws and supplemental acts inconsistent herewith relating to liens of mechanics, &amp;c., doing work or furnishing materials for or about engines, buildings and mineral improvements or leasehold estates, heretofore passed or enacted for said county of Venango,\u201d were repealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-14\">By Act of March 18th 1869 (Pamph. L. 410), the provisions of the Venango Act of 1868, were extended to the counties of Crawford, Warren and Clarion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-15\">April 6th 1874 the court (Lowrie, P; J.), made the rule absolute, delivering the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-16\">\u201c It is claimed that this lien is valid under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of 17th February 1858, Pamph. L. 29, called the Luzerne Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and it is admitted that it is not valid if that act is not now the law for this county. In passing that law, the legislative mind was manifestly directed to the wants of the principal coal region of the state, and to the kind of business there carried on, especially with reference to the fact that a very large part of it consists of improvements made by mechanics on leased lands. But the expression of the law left room to give it a broader application to leased lands, and it was considered well adapted to the oil-producing business in our region, and therefore by the Act of 11th April 1866, it was extended to Erie, Crawford, Warren and Venango counties. After-wards another act was passed, 8th April 1868, for the same purpose, more expressly applicable and adapted to the oil business. It was, however, confined to Venango county, until it was extended to Crawford, Warren and Clarion, by the Act of 18th March 1869. This requires us to look at the Venango Act, and we will find the 8th section contains a repealing clause, which is quite broad enough to set aside the remedies given by the Luzerne Act, and substitute better ones in their place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">The plaintiffs removed the record to the Supreme Court by writ of error and assigned for error the striking off the mechanics\u2019 lien.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-6\"><em>Guthrie </em>Byles, for plaintiffs in error referred to the above cited Acts of Assembly.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9c\">The materials furnished come within the provisions of the Act of 1858: Thomas <em>v. </em>Smith, 6 Wright 68; Schmidt <em>v. </em>Armstrong, 22 P.

Under this act, it was only necessary that the mechanic or material-man should file his claim within six months from the date of the last item of work done or materials furnished, in order to create a valid lien. The lien, so created, continued without further action for the period of five years from the date of the filing of the claim. It is conceded, that if this act is still in force in the county of Crawford, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was a lien upon the leasehold in question, and the court erred in striking it off.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">The Act of April 8th 1868 (Pamph. L. 752), originally confined to the county of Venango, but extended, by the Act of 18th March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>1869 to the county of Crawford, altered the above-stated provisions of the Act of 1858 in this: the statement of claim must be verified by affidavit and filed within three months from the date of the last item of work done or materials furnished, and the lien thus created continues but three months from the filing of the claim, unless a scire facias is issued within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">It is admitted that the plaintiff did not comply with these provisions, hence if the latter statute supplied or repealed the former he has no lien. That the Act of 1868 did supply and repeal that of 1858, a very .cursory examination will prove. In the first place, the latter contains all the subjects of lien embraced in the former; and in the second place, if the former is still in force, then all the provisions of the latter requiring the affidavit of claim, the' filing of the claim within three months, and the issuing of the scire facias within a like period thereafter, are nugatory. For in such case all these provisions may be disregarded and the lien be good, nevertheless. It is clear, therefore, that, as the legislature intended the provisions of the Act of 1868 to have force over the subjects therein named, those of the Act of 1858 must give way.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
