Karcher against Ferdinand Fretton and Frederica Fretton. The trespass complained of was levying on the goods of the plaintiff under a distress for rent; the plaintiff alleging that no rent was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-15\">The premises on which the distress was made were a vacant lot occupied as a marble-yard, and belonging to Mrs. Fretton; the plaintiff was her lessee. He had occupied the lot for some years, at an annual rent o $50, the year expiring on the 20 th of January. The defendants alleged that the terms of the lease had been changed, and that it was to commence on the 20th of January 1867, at a rent of $150 per annum, payable monthly. The claim for rent at this rate not having been paid, the defendants, on the 20th of September 1867, issued a landlord\u2019s warrant to Allen Voorhees, a constable, for \u201c $100, eight months\u2019 rent due\u201d on that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-16\">The ease was tried in 1869, and a verdict rendered for the defendants. A new trial having been granted, it was tried the second time, November 13th 1872, before Thayer, <em>J.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-17\">The plaintiff gave in evidence the landlord\u2019s warrant, the list of goods levied on September 26th 1867, consisting of marble work, finished and unfinished, the appraisement by Andrew M. Donahue and E. D. Woodruff, October 2d 1867, amounting to $343; the appraisement was sworn to by the appraisers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-18\">The plaintiff testified as to the original renting at $50. \u201cAfter the end of three years, Mrs. Fretton demanded $150; the fourth year she sent me a notice to see her; she said the rent was to be $150 per year. I said I was satisfied; if she would enclose a lot I would pay it. I never paid by the month. The constable came there to collect the rent, the fifth month after the new rent began. The constable\u2019s advertisement was the only paper I had got. It was put upon a tombstone.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>On cross-examination he said, <em>\u201c </em>I got a notice from the aider-man in 1866, and then I called on her. * * * I remained on the lot till I got my notice to quit (October 12th 1867). Yoorhees did not give me a notice a week or so before the appraisement.\u201d He said that Yoorhees, at the time of the levy, did not say that he had a landlord\u2019s warrant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The plaintiff then gave evidence by himself and others as to the circumstances of the levy, sale, &amp;c., for the purpose of showing irregularity and unfairness in them, and also that there was personal violence to himself by those conducting the levy and sale. There was evidence that Mr. Eretton was at the sale and bid, but none of his having taken any other part in the matter after issuing the landlord\u2019s warrant, nor was there any evidence that Mrs. Eretton took any part after signing the warrant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">For the defendants, Donahue, one of the appraisers, testified that all the appraisement iras in his writing and made at the instance of Yoorhees; Woodruff, the other appraiser, was dead. Both appraisers were sworn before they made the appraisement. \u201cAt the time we were making the appraisement Karcher was present; I asked Yoorhees if he had given him a copy of the levy and distress; he said he had. * * * The valuation was a fair one at what it would bring at a forced sale. Woodruff kept an account at the time of sale.\u201d Witness further testified that the sale was properly conducted, that the plaintiff was boisterous, threatening to kill the constable, witness, and any one who entered the premises. Witness was not a freeholder; he was a renter from year to year; he did not know whether Woodruff was. The sale was six days after the appraisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">The testimony of E. D. Woodruff, one of the appraisers, deceased, taken at the first trial, was read from the notes of counsel. He testified that he had made the appraisement at the instance of Yoorhees; \u201cWe were sworn and made the valuation; plaintiff was present when the appraisement was made. Yoorhees told him he had levied, and would sell unless the rent was paid. * * * I am not a freeholder.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">The defendants requested the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">1. That if the jury find there was a landlord\u2019s warrant issued by the defendants to Allen Yoorhees, the constable, and he dis-trained the property under that warrant, and sold the same according to law, this action cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-11\">2. That if the jury find that the constable made a distress upon the property in dispute, and when he so distrained, gave notice to Karcher that he had levied upon his property and then had the same appraised by two competent persons, whom he called as freeholders to make such appraisement, and then made the sale, after giving public notice as required by law, there can be no recovery by the plaintiff in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>3. That should the jury find that the landlord\u2019s warrant was regularly issued to the constable, Voorhees, and he made a distress and gave notice of the same when it was made, and called two appraisers, and they were not owners of real estate or freeholders, in that acceptation of the word freeholder; still the defendant would not be a trespasser <em>\u201cah initio,\u201d </em>because the men who made the appraisement were not the owners of real estate at the time, as the selection of the appraisers was the official act of the constable, for which the defendant cannot be made liable in trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">4. That under the Act of Assembly and the law, the constable executing a landlord\u2019s warrant is made the judge officially of the qualification of the appraisers he selects to appraise the goods levied upon by him under such warrant, and the landlord is not responsible in trespass for such an official act of the constable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">5. That even should the jury find that the whole amount of rent claimed under the landlord\u2019s warrant in this case was not due, still this action of trespass cannot be sustained on that ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">6. That where it is alleged an excessive distress has been made, the remedy is by an action on the case under the Act of 1872, and not in trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\">7. That where there has been an excessive distress for rent by a landlord against his tenant, the remedy by the tenant is by an action in replevin, and not in action of trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\">8. That unless the jury find that the defendants have done some illegal act themselves, or directed some act to be done by the constable that was not judicial by him, they cannot be made liable in this action of trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-11\">9. That when the law has confided to a constable the exercise of his judgment in the selection of appraisers, and he acts wrongfully by not making the proper selection, he may be held liable; but a landlord who had no power or authority-to control such acts would\u2019 not be a trespasser \u201c <em>ah initio,\u201d </em>because he directed his warrant to an officer who erred in judgment as to the qualification of the men he selected to appraise the goods which he had distrained for rent that was due, if all the other requisitions of the law in relation'to a distress under a landlord\u2019s warrant were complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-12\">The court did not answer the points, but directed the jury to find a special verdict upon all the facts in the case. The several questions which were deemed material by the court were reduced to writing and submitted to the counsel for the respective parties, who were told that if there were any other questions of facts upon which in their judgment it was material for the jury to pass, they might add them, and the court would instruct the jury to find how such facts were. No addition being suggested, the court then directed the jury to find a special verdict upon the several questions of fact submitted to them. [In-order to enable the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>to find correctly upon the sixth question of fact submitted to them, the court instructed them that a tenant from year to year was not a freeholder within the meaning of the Act of 1772, which requires the appraisement of goods distrained to be made by two reputable freeholders.] All other questions of law arising upon the special verdict were reserved, and were subsequently argued before the court in banc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">The following were questions of fact submitted by the court to the jury, with the answers of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">2. Whether any, and if so, what amount of rent was due by the plaintiff to Mrs. Fretton at the date of the distress made ? \u201c We find that there was none.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\">5. Whether any notice of the distress with the cause of it was given to the plaintiff, or left upon the premises five days before appraisement ? \u201cWe find that no notice was given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">6. Whether any appraisement was made of the goods distrained? and if so by whom ? and are the persons by whom said appraisement was made freeholders or not ? and whether they were duly sworn ? and who appointed said appraisers ? \u201c Find : that the goods were distrained by Allen Yoorhees, constable, appraised by a Mr. Donahue and E. D. Woodruff, who were not freeholders and not duly sworn.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-13\">8. Whether six days\u2019 public notice was given of such sale after the making of such appraisement and before said sale ? \u201c Find that there was no notice given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-16\">9. If the jury find that notice of the distress and cause of it was not given to the plaintiff or left upon the premises five days before the appraisement, then they are to find whether the defendants knew that fact before or at the time of the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-17\">10. If the jury find that the persons who made the appraisement were not freeholders, then they are to find whether the defendants knew that fact at or before the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-18\">11. If the jury find that six days\u2019 public notice was not given of said sale after the appraisement and before said sale, then they are to find whether defendants knew that fact at or before the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-19\">' To the 9th, 10th and 11th questions, the answers of the jury were: \u201c Find that defendants knew these facts at and before the sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-20\">The jury to assess the damages, subject to the opinion of the court, on the law arising from the facts found by them ; the facts are to be put into the form of a special verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-21\">The finding was:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-22\">\u201c To the above points as answered we do agree and find a verdict for the plaintiff, and assess the damages at twenty-five hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-23\">A motion was made by the defendants for a rule for a new trial: the rule was granted and after argument discharged on condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of a remittitur by tbe plaintiff of $1250 of tbe verdict.

The defendants were not answerable for what the constable did in the execution of the warrant; that having been done officially: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Sheppard, 4 Penna.

There was no evidence of defendants\u2019 knowledge of the acts of the constable and a question based on it should not have been submitted to the jury: Snyder <em>v. </em>Wilt, 3 Harris 59 ; Haines <em>v. </em>Stouffer, 10 Barr 363 ; Brown <em>v. </em>Clark, 2 Harris 469.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-15\"><em>R.

The court answered one only, and under exceptions directed the jury to find a verdict on eleven points framed by the court, and to assess the damages,,subject to the opinion of the court on the law arising from the facts to be found by the jury. This gives rise to the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">The court had the undoubted right to direct the jury to return a special verdict. It is one of the recognised modes by which the facts are put into the record: Miller <em>v. </em>Hershey, 9 P. F. Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>64. The question, however, arises as to the correctness of the specific manner in which the court submitted the facts to the jury. It was the right of the counsel to ask the court to submit to the jury all the material and controverted facts on which evidence had been given, and to withhold from them all the alleged facts, in support of which no evidence had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The defendant in error sought to establish two controlling facts. The one, that no rent was due when the distress was made; the other, that the proceedings relating to the sale were grossly and intentionally irregular and defective. The former, to give a right to recover ; the latter, to enhance the damages. As the jury found no rent was due, the plaintiffs in error were thereby adjudged trespassers <em>ab </em>initio, and the right to recover against them the value of the goods distrained, was established. This practically disposes of all the assignments not relating to the measure of damages. The first five assignments are therefore not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The remaining assignments may be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">An examination of the testimony shows that each of the appraisers positively and distinctly testified that they were duly sworn; there was no evidence to contradict it, yet the court submitted to the jury to find that they were not sworn, and they so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The court also submitted to the jury to find that the plaintiffs in error, before and at the time of the sale, knew these three facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">1. That notice of the distress and cause of it was not given to the defendant in error, or left on the premises five days before the appraisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">2. That the persons who made the appraisement were not freeholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">3. That six days\u2019 public notice was not given of the sale after the appraisement and before the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">A careful reading fails to disclose any evidence that the plaintiffs in error had any knowledge of either of these facts. Mrs. Eretton is not shown to have had any knowledge whatever of the proceedings after she signed the landlord\u2019s warrant which was directed to the constable. Mr. Eretton thereafter participated on the day of sale only. He is not shown to have had any knowledge of any irregularity in the proceedings in the intermediate time. He was at the sale and bid off some property. There is no evidence that any notice was there given, or any averment there made, by any person, that all the proceedings were not regular and according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">It cannot admit of doubt that this supposed knowledge of the plaintiffs in error must have unduly influenced the minds of the jurors. It would naturally strike them as a wanton disregard of duty, and a reckless exercise of a pretended right through the forms of law. It must have been those facts, found without testb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>mony, that caused the jury to return a verdict for $2500. After one-half of that sum was remitted it still stands for more than three times the sum at which the property was appraised under oath. It was contended, that inasmuch as it ivas found that no rent was due and in arrear, the 3d sect, of 21st March 1772, gave the right to recover double- the value of the goods and chattels distrained and sold. There are two answers denying that right here.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">1.. The action was not brought, nor did the defendant in error declare under that statute: Morrison <em>v. </em>Gross, 1 Browne 1; Rees <em>v. </em>Emerick <em>et al., </em>6 S. &amp; R. 286; Campbell <em>v. </em>Finney, 3 Watts 86; Hughes <em>et al. v. </em>Stevens, 12 Casey 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">2. This action is not against the \u201c person or persons distraining,\u201d but against the persons in whose names the distress was made. The Act of 21st March 1772, giving double damages, applies to the former, and not the latter : Wells <em>v. </em>Hornish, 3 Penna. R. 30. This action was at common -law. The record does not show that any point was made by either counsel or cour,t, in regard .to the measure of damages. The good faith of the plaintiffs in error, on the one hand, or their participation in the officer\u2019s wilful disregard of his official duty on the other, will have a legitimate influence on the question of damages. The errors are therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias denovo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
