Neill and Simpson were joint owners of two wharves in the Delaware, between which was a dock. These wharves and docks were built by them as riparian owners of two pieces of ground, the northern of which (No. 1) embraced within its lines the northern wharf and dock, and the southern wharf and dock were within the lines of (No. 2). They each conveyed their interest to the other, so that each became separate owner, the conveyances being \u201cwith the docks and other appertenances.\u201d The defendants being lessees under Neill of the first property, which embraced the dock in question, an Act of Assembly was passed giving them the exclusive right to occupy the same, &amp;c., and requiring the harbor master to remove any vessel so moored as to obstruct the use, &amp;c., of the docks. The plaintiffs by their bill claiming that the dock was appertenant to the wharf granted to them, prayed to restrain the defendants from preventing them from the use of it. _ The defendants answered, denying that the dock was appertenant to plaintiff\u2019s wharf, and set up the Act of Assembly. The case was heard on hill and answer. <em>Held, </em>in absence of proof of title to the dock, the plaintiffs could not question the effect of the Act of Assembly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b270-9\">2.

Simpson and Adam M. Simpson, partners, as A. S. Simpson &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Brother, against The Philadelphia and Southern Mail Steamship Company and A. P. Colesberry, harbor master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">The averments of the bill were as follows: \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">John L. Neill and James Simpson were seised in fee as tenants in common of a certain wharf property, including one pier which extends into the river Delaware. Neill was sole seised of the wharf property adjoining the above on the south. As part of one transaction, by deeds bearing even date and recorded on the same day in the same book, Simpson conveyed his undivided half part of the first-mentioned premises to Neill, and Neill conveyed the other property to the plaintiffs, who are sons of James Simpson, \u201ctogether also with the passages, waters, water-courses, wharves, docks, landings, landing-places, and other appertenances thereunto belonging.\u201d The northernmost pier of the plaintiffs is on the line between the two properties, and is, and was, at and before the conveyance, built, fitted and intended for use on its north side, and on account of the width of the dock, this is the most valuable part of it. Plaintiffs claimed that the use of this dock passed to them under the express language of the deed above cited, and would have passed without it as an \u201capparent easement.\u201d Defendants, the Steamship Company, are lessees of Neill\u2019s property, having become so since the conveyance. Defendant Colesherry is harbor master of the port of Philadelphia. The Steamship Company claim the exclusive use of the dock, and are interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 use of it, and Colesberry at their instance is assisting them. They are about to interfere with a certain vessel at plaintiffs\u2019 pier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-8\">The prayers were that it might be declared, &amp;c., that the plaintiffs were entitled to the use of the pier, &amp;c., without molestation, &amp;c., by defendants, &amp;e,; that the defendants, their servants, &amp;c., bo enjoined from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of the pier, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-9\">The answer set up that the piers and docks on both properties were constructed prior to 1850. By sect. 2, Act of May 4th 1852 (Pamph. L. 569), the exclusive use of the dock in question was given to the owners and lessees of defendants\u2019 wharf then occupied by the Pennsylvania Steamship Company; it was made the duty of the harbor master to remove any vessel in the dock, and it was provided \u201c that the usual charge for occupancy in such cases be paid by said Steamship Company to the owner or owners of such side wharves.\u201d The effect which the plaintiffs attribute to the conveyancing set forth in the bill is denied; the inducement to the Steamship Company to accept a lease was the exclusive use of the dock; the interference alleged in the hill is admitted and justified under the act above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-10\">The following Acts of Assembly relate to the powers and duties of the wardens and harbor master of Philadelphia, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Av6g\">March 29th 1803,4 Sm.

It belongs to the people at large, except so far as his rights are affected by the Act of Assembly cited in the answer; and apart from this act our right to use the dock is as good as his: Wainwright <em>v. </em>McCullough, 13 P. F. Smith 66; Tinicum Fishing Co. <em>v. </em>Cartel\u2019, 11 Id. 21; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 427; Id. 431-2; Washb. on Easements 400; Kusenberg <em>v. </em>Browne, 6 Wright 173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">2. The Act of Assembly is unconstitutional: Com. <em>v. </em>Penna. Canal Co., 16 P. F. Smith 41; Com. <em>v. </em>Fisher, 1 Penna. R. 462; Shrunk <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Navigation Co., 14 S. &amp; R. 71; Susquehanna Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Wright, 9 W. &amp; S. 9; Bowman\u2019s Devisees <em>v. </em>Waltham, 2 McLean\u2019s C. C.

Sellers, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcY\">The Commonwealth has, <em>subject to the public right, </em>conferred a license to the riparian owner on the river Delaware, just as if it were private water, by giving him the right to charge dockage for any moored vessels lying in the water which covers the ground within his protracted lines. The Act of 1852 was mandatory on the harbor master.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-12\">This is not a question within the control of the parties, by conveyancing. The impression of sovereignty was cast on the wharf and docks. None but the legislature could recall or extinguish it. The power of the Commonwealth over public navigable waters and rivers is simply that of unqualified and unlimited sovereignty and ownership: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Fisher, 1 Penna. R. 463 ; Shrunk v. Navigation Co., 14 S. &amp; R. 71; Bird <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 Watts 434; Susquehanna Co. <em>v. </em>Wright, 9 W. &amp; S. 9; Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Ingham, 12 Casey 194; Kusenberg <em>v. </em>Browne, 6 Wright 173 ; Flanagan <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, Id. 219; McKean <em>v. </em>Delaware Division Canal Co., 13 Id. 433; Tinicum Fishing Co. <em>v. </em>Carter, 11 P. F.

It denies that the deed mentioned in the bill passed to the complainants the exclusive right to the dock, which, by the Act of Assembly set out in the answer, is granted by the Commonwealth to the owners and lessees thereof; and makes an express denial of every averment in the bill to the contrary of the facts set forth in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In this attitude of the case and without proof that the complainants have any title to the dock on the north side of their pier, they do not stand in a position to question the effect of the Act of 4th May 1852. The case is therefore governed by the general laws relating to the powers and duties of the harbor mastpr. If he acted oppressively or improperly in the execution of his duties as harbor master, this is not the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Decree of the Nisi Prius affirmed with costs and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
