Moore <em>et al.. </em>plaintiffs, and Lawrence F. Whitney <em>et </em>al., defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-14\">Prior to January 1867, John H. Bracken, by virtue of a sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>sale, had become the owner of a coal lease of the Charter Oak Mutual Coal Company, including the fixtures and personal property used about the colliery. On the 11th of February 1867, Bracken, for the consideration of $10,000, by writing under his hand and seal, sold an undivided one-third of the lease, fixtures, &amp;c., to William D. Moore. On the 1st of November 1867, by a similar writing, he sold the remaining two-thirds of the colliery, &amp;c., to Moore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">To December Term 1867, Whitney, one of the defendants in the issue, obtained two judgments against Bracken, amounting together to $8091.55, and on the 17th of December 1867, issued executions on them to March Term 1868. Under these executions, the sheriff levied, amongst other things, on mules, cars, iron, &amp;c., as the property of Bracken. The property was claimed by Moore,' and, on the application of the sheriff, this issue was framed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">The issue was tried April 23d 1872, before Walker, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">The plaintiff gave in evidence the writings conveying the coal-lease, fixtures, &amp;c., to him as, above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">He then offered in evidence execution \u2014 Morgan to the use of Oliver against Moore, issued June 12th 1868, No. 39, to September 1868 \u2014 and return of sheriff, \u201cLeasehold fixtures, &amp;c., sold to Whitney for $12,000also execution \u2014 Amerling to the use of Oliver against Moore, issued June 16th 1868 \u2014 to which the sheriff returned, \u201c Defendant\u2019s personal property levied on and sold for $1200 as per fi. fa., No. 39, to September 1868.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">The defendant objected to the offer; it was admitted by the court, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-11\">Plaintiff then offered landlord\u2019s warrant for $591.23 rent, issued against Bracken, and sale under it of divers articles of personal property to Whitney, the defendant.

If you believe the evidence as admitted by the court in that offer, that L. F. Whitney purchased tbe articles in question as the property of William D. Moore, at public sale, and the other evidence in the cause, then for the purpose of this case we direct you to find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and we propose to dispose of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>question (which is purely one of law) upon a motion for a new trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">A rule was granted to show cause why judgment should not be entered, for defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">The rule was afterwards discharged, and judgment entered for the plaintiff on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">The defendant took a writ of error and assigned for error the rulings on questions of evidence, the charge of the court and entering judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-10\">Cr. <em>F.

The executions were issued some months after the feigned issue had been ordered, and under them the leasehold and fixtures of the colliery had been levied upon as the property of William D. Moore, the plaintiff in said issue. The landlord\u2019s \u2022warrant was still later in point of time, and was issued against John N. Bracken. Whether the property purchased by Whitney at the sale, was the identical property that had been levied upon under his two executions, was a question of fact which, even in the view taken by the court below of the effect of the constable\u2019s sale and purchase of the property thereat by Whitney, should have been submitted to the jury. There was some evidence that all of the articles specified in the <em>narr. </em>were not sold at the constable\u2019s sale. But the radical error was in the admission of the evidence for any purpose. It could throw no light upon the question of the ownership of the property at the time of the levy under the executions of Mr. Whitney. This was the single issue before the jury. The conduct of Mr. Whitney in purchasing the property at the constable\u2019s sale, may or may not estop him from recovering hereafter upon the interpleader bond, in case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>a verdict in his favor upon the feigned issue. This record raises no such question. For the present it is sufficient to say that the inquiry into what became of the property, months after the issue was ordered, was wholly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
