Lump coal runs over first screen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Nut coal drops through to second screen. Nut coal was always shipped away.

If not a question of construction for the court, it is one of fact for the jury to determine from the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-13\">3. The case is one not requiring the testimony of experts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-14\">4. The evidence offered would contradict the written agreement of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-15\">Defendants also proposed to prove the relative value and quality of lump and nut coal, for the purpose of showing that nut coal is not screened coal in the common acceptation of that term, and that at the time the contract was made between the parties there was no market for nut coal in this section, and that the same was removed from the bank as a matter of necessity and did not pay the expense of mining and marketing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-16\">Plaintiff objected to this offer because it was irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-17\">Both offers were rejected, and several bills of exception sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-18\">The defendants gave evidence as to the amount of coal mined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-19\">The plaintiff\u2019s first point was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-20\">As a matter of law the plaintiff is, by the express terms of the lease, entitled to recover ten cents for each and every ton of coal mined by the defendants, and remaining above either of the two screens described by the witnesses, provided the same was screened and removed for the purpose of sale or profit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-21\">The answer of the court was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-22\">\u201c To the first point, we answer that the plaintiff has a right to recover ten cents for each ton of 2240 lbs. of screened coal and which has been mined and removed from the lands, and if you believe that there were two screens and two kinds of coal there screened called lump and nut coal, then he has a right to recover ten cents for each ton of 2240 lbs. of either lump or nut coal mined and removed from the lands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The defendants\u2019 points were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">1. The term \u201cscreened coal,\u201d used by the parties in this contract, includes only merchantable lump coal that is screened, and not what is known as nut coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">2. The term \u201cscreened coal\u201d includes only such screened coal as would satisfy a contract where one person had agreed to deliver a certain quantity of screened coal to another person at a stipulated price, to wit: merchantable coal screened ancl not nut coal, which is inferior in quality though screened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">3. Nut coal is not screened coal in the general and common acceptation of the term as used in this district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-9\">These points were answered in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\">The verdict was for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-11\">The defendants took a writ of error; they assigned for error the rejection of their offers of evidence and the refusal of their points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-12\"><em>Griffith Mason, </em>for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAv3\">The <em>meaning of words </em>in a written contract may be shown by parol: Gibson <em>v. </em>Tyson, 5 Watts 34; Case <em>v. </em>Cushman, 3 W. &amp; S. 544; Carey <em>v. </em>Bright, 8 P. F. Smith 70.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-13\"><em>McDermitt $ Miller, </em>for defendant in error, furnished no paper book.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Atl\">January 4th 1875.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b172-14\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"A0-\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">The question here lies within a narrow compass. The defendant\u2019s intestate owned coal lands. He entered into a written agreement with the plaintiff in error, by which, <em>inter alia, </em>the latter was to have the coal thereon, and agreed to pay therefor \u201c the sum of ten cents for each ton (of 2240 lbs.) of screened coal mined axxd removed from said lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">In this action the defendant in error claimed to recover for the coal only, which the company had actually screened and removed from the lands. The company showed that they had taken two sizes or kinds of coal. That in prepaxdng it for market they used two screens; by the use of one they prepax\u2019ed \u201clump coal,\u201d by the use of the other \u201cnut coal.\u201d They denied their liability to pay for the latter, and offered to prove that it was not known among coal dealers or miners as screened coal in the general acceptance of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">It is unquestionably true, as a general rule, that the meaning of a term or name given to any particular article in a trade or business, may be px'oved by persons engaged therein, when that term or name is used in a contract. This is admitted for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning with which the word was used by the parties. This rule of evidence is too well settled to be now controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"A1B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The question here, however, is as to the application of this law to the undisputed facts in the case. The plaintiffs in error did screen the nut coal, and did ship it to market. They had no right to screen and remove any coal without paying for it. If the contention was whether the company had omitted to screen and remove the largest practicable quantity of coal for market, then the relevancy of the testimony offered would be evident. So if the defendant in error had denied the right of the company to screen the nut coal, and had forbidden its removal, the evidence would have been admissible. Here, however, the company had elected and determined what coal they would screen and remove. The defendant assented to it; he accepted and ratified the <em>act; </em>the the minds of the parties thus met; the act of the company made it screened coal in fact; the defendant confirmed it; the company is now estopped from controverting it; they cannot now show that it ought not to have the name and character which their acts have given to it. Nor would evidence to prove that when the contract was made there was no market in that vicinity for nut coal, and that it did not pay the expenses of mining and marketing, change the result. Whether it was then and there in demand is unimportant. It has since been in demand and has been removed and sold. The question whether it was mined and marketed at a loss or at a profit to the company, is wholly irrelevant. The contract recognises no such distinction. The liability of the company to the defendant for the coal taken cannot be affected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We see no error in the rejection of the testimony, nor in the answer and charge of the learned judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
