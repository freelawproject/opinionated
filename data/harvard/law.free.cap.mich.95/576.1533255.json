Plaintiff, a farmer, was driving his farm team, hitched to a buggy containing himself and wife, upon a highway which was quite muddy. His horses were walking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Defendant had sent his team, in charge of his hired man, upon an errand. A rope, somewhere from 12 to. 20 feet long, had been tied to the rear axle-tree of this, wagon, to aid in moving a barn. Before starting, it was thrown into the wagon, except one end, which remained tied to* the axle-tree, for the reason that defendant was unable to untie it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">lC3. Defendant\u2019s team, proceeding upon a trot, overtook plaintiff, and passed him, with the rope dragging behind, it having gotten out of the wagon without the knowledge of' the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\"><em>\u201c\u00e1. </em>As the rope passed his wagon it was seen by the-plaintiff and his wife, and one of the horses, at sight, of it, began to kick, and jumped, and said horses ran; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>breaking loose from the buggy, throwing plaintiff and his wife out, injuring both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><em>\u201c5. </em>Defendant\u2019s man, seeing the trouble, tried to avoid a collision by driving to the side of -the road, but the buggy wheel struck his outer wheel, at which point the team left the buggy, throwing plaintiff and his wife out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u201c6. The off whippletree was broken, and the left wheel of defendant\u2019s wagon was the one that was hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\"><em>\u201c </em>7. Plaintiff\u2019s horse did not become unmanageable when he first kicked at the rope alongside of him. Plaintiff did not at that time stop his team, but allowed them to walk on, and the rope drew under his -feet, which frightened him, when he kicked again, and became unmanageable, as stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\"><em>\u201c </em>8. Had plaintiff stopped his horses when the horse first kicked at the rope, the rope would not have gotten under the horses\u2019 feet, as it would necessarily have followed the wagon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\"><em>\u201c9. As </em>the defendant\u2019s wagon began to turn in before the rope had fully passed plaintiff\u2019s horses, it was inevitable that the rope would draw into the road under the feet of plaintiff\u2019s horses, unless prevented by their stopping, or by the superior speed of defendant\u2019s team. Plaintiff was in a position to see and know this, while the driver of defendant\u2019^ team was not, and was ignorant of the fact that the rope was dragging. Plaintiff and his wife were both injured, whereby plaintiff suff\u00e9red damage to the amount of $200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">Ccl. Defendant is responsible for the conduct of his servant, the driver, on this occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u2018\u20222. It was not actionable negligence to pass plaintiff in the highway with a rope dragging from the end of the wagon. It was negligence to attempt to turn in before plaintiff under circumstances which would be likely to bring the rope under the feet of plaintiff\u2019s horses, if both teams continued to advance at their respective gaits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\"><em>\u201c </em>8. Plaintiff was legally required to exercise due care to avoid danger, and was as much bound to know that the rope might frighten his team as defendant\u2019s driver, especially after he had seen the rope, and after his horse first kicked at it. By not at once stopping his team while the rope was yet outside of the wagon track, Jie contributed to the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Judgment for costs for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">Exception was taken to the finding of fact that the plaintiff could have stopped his team in time to avoid accident, and was therefore guilty of contributory negligence in not doing so. Exceptions were also taken to the conclusions of law. The evidence is all returned, and the claim is now made in this Court that there is not a <em>scintilla </em>of evidence to support the finding that the plaintiff could have stopped his_ team before the rope dragged ' beneath-his horses\u2019 feet. The plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\"><em>\u201c </em>I was driving my horses along the track, and this team came along behind me, and as quick as it got up to me, driving a pretty good gait, they hauled out to go by me, and just far enough to skip my wagon, with a rope drawing behind; and when it got up so that my horse saw it, it kicked with one foot, and by that time the team was far enough ahead of me so he turned in to get on the track again, and that pulled the rope under my horses, and then they made a jump to get over it, causing the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">He was asked, <em>\u201c </em>When did you first see the rope?\u201d and answered: \u201cI didn\u2019t see it until it got up opposite my team. At that instant my horse caught sight of it, and kicked with .one foot at it, and by that time the team was far enough ahead of me to turn in, and that brought the rope right under my horses, and scared them. They jumped to get away from it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">Plaintiff was asked on cross-examination: \u201c Did you see the rope before it got under your horses\u2019 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I saw it as it came alongside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And you had an opportunity to have swung off to the right and get away from it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir; there were some grubs right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You could have stopped your horses, couldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, I couldn\u2019t. Just as soon as they caught sight of the rope they became unmanageable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">This testimony is undisputed. It is contended, however, that, inasmuch as the plaintiff\u2019s team was .on a walk, he should have stopped at the instant he saw the rope. But plaintiff gives the reason why he could not do this. His team <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>was walking; the defendant\u2019s team was being driven by on a trot; and the instant defendant\u2019s team got far enough by to turn in, it did so, thereby dragging the rope directly under the feet of the plaintiff\u2019s horses. It is possible that, had the plaintiff had sufficient presence of mind or foresight, he might have anticipated, when he first saw the rope dragging, that the defendant\u2019s driver would turn so quickly in front of him that the rope would .draw under his own horses unless he instantly stopped them. It must, be admitted that the driver of defendant\u2019s team was negligent in letting the rope drag and turning in and drawing it under the feet of plaintiff\u2019s horses. It is also quite apparent that the plaintiff, under the testimony, cannot-be said to have acted carelessly. There is no testimony in the case by which the court below should have so found. If there could be found a <em>scintilla </em>of testimony to support this finding, it could not be disturbed under our repeated rulings; but from the testimony of the-plaintiff- \u2014 which stands wholly uncontradicted \u2014 it appears that the injury was occasioned solely by the negligent conduct of defendant\u2019s driver; that the horse kicked, and the team became unmanageable from the instant the rope drew alongside of them; and -when the rope dragged beneath their feet they ran away, and injured the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not called upon to exercise any greater degree of care than persons of ordinary care and caution would be expected to exercise under the circumstances. The rule laid down by the learned circuit judge required the plaintiff to exercise a greater degree of care than this. It presumes that a person of ordinary care at the instant-would have anticipated the turning in of the defendant\u2019s team so that the rope would necessarily drag beneath the horses\u2019 feet; and again, it presumes that the plaintiff could have stopped his team when he first saw the rope, while the testimony conclusively shows that the plaintiff\u2019s horses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>became unmanageable and began kicking at tbe time they saw the rope dragging at their side.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-5\">McGrath, Grant, and Montgomery, JJ., concurred.
