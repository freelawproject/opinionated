This case is devoid of all of the elements of malice found in <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>69 Mich. 380, and <em>Flaherty v. Moran, 81 </em>Id. 52, the only facts or circumstances warranting the conclusion of its existence being the building of the fence at a height of 6 feet and <em>4 </em>inches on complainant\u2019s side, and of 4 feet and <em>4 </em>inches on defendant\u2019s side, and at a distance of 9 feet and 6 inches from complainant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-8\">3. The only question in the case is, has a man a right to build a fence of lawful height on the dividing line, if his neighbor\u2019s land happens to be lower than his, as in this case? \u2014 whether the level of his land or that of the adjoining land should govern as to the height of the fence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-13\"> The premises are situated on a residence street. The posts used in constructing the fence were discarded street-railway ties, containing large spike holes, and were set about 7 feet apart', with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>stringers at the top and bottom, to which old boards were nailed on the side next to defendant\u2019s lot. Complainant\u2019s premises are about 2 feet lower than defendant\u2019s, which had been filled in and terraced on the front.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b602-9\">McGrath, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">This is a bill to enjoin the erection and maintenance of a fence between premises occupied by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">We think the case is ruled by <em>Flaherty v. Moran, </em>81 Mich. 52. It is clear that the fence is the outcome of a quarrel between neighbors. Its character and style indicate the motive which prompted its construction, and the decree below must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b602-11\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
