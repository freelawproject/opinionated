The fruit trees, if any, are to be grafted or budded, and all the above are to be delivered in a thrifty and healthy condition.

He further claimed that no contract relations existed between the plaintiffs and himself, and, further, that the trees furnished in the spring, and for which he had paid Essig, never came from plaintiffs, and were worthless, by reason of which he sought to set off the money paid for them, as money paid without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The trial judge held that the order was a complete, valid, binding contract, and declined to admit proof' of any of the circumstances of its delivery, or the negotiations in\u2019 relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We cannot take this view. This paper is an order on the plaintiffs to ship stock mentioned therein. Before it could become a binding contract between these parties, it was necessary that the. plaintiffs or some one authorized to bind them should assent thereto in writing, and give the defendant notice \"thereof. <em>Weiden v. Woodruff, </em>38 Mich. 130; <em>Aldine Press v. Estes, </em>75 Id. 100. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel allege in their brief that the order was accepted in writing by Essig, who they claim was plaintiffs\u2019 agent, but they fail to point us to the evidence showing that fact. \u25a0 His name was appended to the order, but as a mere memorandum. This being true, it was a right of the defendant to show the negotiations and conditions upon which the order was given. Under his theory the furnishing of the trees in the spring was a part of this transaction, and a recoupment, which in that view would have been possible, is cut off by treating each delivery as a separate contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">Defendant sought to show that Essig, and not the plaintiffs, was the real party in interest; in other words, that the plaintiffs were not the owners of the claim. No rule is better settled than that a defendant may show in an action at law that the plaintiff has no cause of action against him. <em>Blackwood v. Brown, </em>32 Mich. 104. Hence it was proper cross-examination to ask plaintiffs whether, they charged this stock to the defendant upon their books, and whether the defendant ever promised to pay plaintiffs $1,255 on the order, and where the money would <em>go </em>if paid, and what interest the plaintiffs had in Essig\u2019s sales, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">. Again, defendant was entitled to prove his set-off if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>could, and have the same submitted to the jury. If he had paid to the plaintiffs $703.75, without consideration, in a prior transaction, it could be set off in this action. <em>Petersen v. Lumber Co., </em>51 Mich. 86; <em>Murphy v. McGraw, </em>74 Id. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">It is unnecessary to notice specifically the many allegations of error, as the foregoing discussion covers the main\u201d questions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We feel constrained to reverse the judgment and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">McGrath, Long, and Grant, JJ., concurred.
