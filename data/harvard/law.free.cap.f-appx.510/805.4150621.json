Lee is currently serving concurrent sentences of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and 180 months\u2019 imprisonment for being a felon in possession of a firearm, and a consecutive sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Lee\u2019s 300-month sentence was based in part on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. On appeal, Lee argues: (1) his \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d was improperly calculated under Amendment 506, (2) the district court improperly weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at his original sentencing, (3) he was convicted for possession of 27.3 grams of cocaine, but sentenced to possession of more than 28 grams of cocaine, and (4) he should not have been charged with carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). The district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>been imposed except ... (2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing,\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The district court did not err in denying Lee\u2019s motion. Lee\u2019s claims regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the weight of cocaine, and the carrying of a firearm charge concern \u201coriginal sentencing determinations,\u201d rather than the lowering of a sentencing range by the Sentencing Commission, and were thus outside the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. As to Lee\u2019s claim regarding Amendment 506, the language upon which his argument relies was superseded in 1997 by Amendment 567\u2019s definition of the same term. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 506, 567. Moreover, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes modifications of sentences based on sentencing ranges \u201csubsequently ... lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and Amendment 506 could not have \u201csubsequently ... lowered\u201d Lee\u2019s sentencing range, as it became effective five years before Lee was sentenced. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 506. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
