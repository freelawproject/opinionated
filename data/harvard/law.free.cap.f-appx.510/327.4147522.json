Chagoya argues that the district court reversibly erred in maintaining the increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12) (2011), which provides for a two-level in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>crease if the \u201cdefendant maintained a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance.\u201d The application note provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]mong the factors the court should consider in determining whether the defendant \u2018maintained\u2019 the premises are (A) whether the defendant held a pos-sessory interest in <em>{e.g., </em>owned or rented) the premises and (B) the extent to which the defendant controlled access to, or activities at, the premises.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.28).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Serfass, </em>684 F.3d 548, 549 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 623, 184 L.Ed.2d 404 (2012). This court will not find clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>A finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if, after reviewing all of the evidence, this court is left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Citing the recency of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) adjustment and the lack of controlling authority, Chagoya argues that this court should defer to cases such as <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>117 F.3d 849, 856-58 (5th Cir.1997), and <em>United States v. Soto-Silva, </em>129 F.3d 340, 345-47 (5th Cir.1997), which addressed the burden of proof required for convictions for maintaining a premises for the distribution of controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). He further argues that such cases require a showing of \u201cmore than just dominion and control over the premises\u201d and instead require a showing of \u201csupervisory control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">When Congress directed the addition of the two-level enhancement later designated as \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12), it specified that the enhancement was to apply to situations wherein the \u201cdefendant maintained an establishment for the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance, <em>as generally described in section 4.16 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 856).\u201d See </em>Pub. L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 6(2) (2010) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Miller, </em>698 F.3d 699, 706 (8th Cir.2012) (assuming that \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12) has the same elements as the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1) offense that it parallels).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">However, even if Chagoya is correct in his assertion that cases interpreting \u00a7 856(a)(1) are relevant to the instant analysis, he has not provided any authority which shows that the district court clearly erred. In <em>Morgan, </em>117 F.3d at 857, the court held that supervisory control over the premises was merely \u201cone factor\u201d that should be considered as probative of maintaining a premises; the court did not hold that it was the sole determinative factor. In the instant case, Chagoya resided at the premises, and he shared responsibility for the utilities and the expenses. Chagoya also controlled access to the premises, as evidenced by the fact that \u201cPepe\u201d asked for Chagoya\u2019s permission to store the marijuana on the premises and the fact that Chagoya was to be compensated by Pepe. Chagoya\u2019s willingness to call Pepe to complain about the condition of the marijuana also suggests that he was in control of the premises. In sum, Chagoya has not shown that the district court clearly erred in assessing him an increase in offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12). <em>See Serfass, </em>684 F.3d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
