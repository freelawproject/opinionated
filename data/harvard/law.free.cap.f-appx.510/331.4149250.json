Ritchie argues that his 24-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court relied on a prohibited sentencing factor, his need for mental health treatment, to impose or lengthen the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">Because Ritchie did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence based upon the district court\u2019s reference to his mental health/rehabilitative needs, our review of that issue is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). In <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), the Supreme Court held in a direct criminal appeal that a district court \u201cmay not impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\u201d Even if we assume that <em>Tapia </em>applies in the revocation context, <em>see United States v. Receskey, </em>699 F.3d 807, 810 (5th Cir.2012), Ritchie has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-25\">The district court in this case stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to sentence the defendant ... to 24 months [in prison]. I will recommend that he be placed at the Medical Center in Springfield, Missouri. This will afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and give the defendant an opportunity to participate in some mental health treatment service programs.\u201d This statement was the district court\u2019s sole remark regarding Ritchie\u2019s need for treatment, and it falls far short of showing that the district court lengthened Ritchie\u2019s sentence of imprisonment to further his rehabilitation. Accordingly, Ritchie has not shown that the district court plainly erred under <em>Tapia. See id. </em>at 812. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
