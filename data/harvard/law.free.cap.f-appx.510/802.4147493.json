He asserts that the district court had inherent jurisdiction or retained jurisdiction to alter the restitution order. He further asserts that the restitution order should credit the amount that the government had recovered from a codefendant and as part of its ongoing litigation. Further, the restitution order should have credited against the loss amount the value of property that some of the victims of the fraud had actually received. Finally, he argues that whether the restitution order should be reduced to reflect any tax deductions victims may have been able to take related to their losses is a factual matter that could only be addressed at a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court has jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1321-22 (11th Cir.2003) (reviewing whether a district court had jurisdiction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(3), to consider a defendant\u2019s motion to modify his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d) obligates the district court to order restitution in certain cases, including fraud cases. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii); <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>370 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2004). The MVRA sets forth the procedures for ordering restitution, as well as for challenging an otherwise final order of restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(o)(1) provides that an otherwise final order of restitution can be (1) corrected under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 35; (2) appealed and modified under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742; (3) amended under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5); or (4) adjusted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3664(k), 3572, or 3613A. We have held that a defendant cannot challenge a restitution order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Mam\u00f3me v. United States, </em>559 F.3d 1209, 1211 (11th Cir.2009). We have further held that the district court does not have the inherent authority to modify a sentence outside of the specific parameters provided by statute and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315, 1317-18 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 426, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 1466, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (providing that, whatever the scope of a district court\u2019s inherent power, it does not include the power to develop rules that circumvent or conflict with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or statutory provisions)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">Although MacArthur asserts that the district court had jurisdiction to consider his arguments, MacArthur does not argue the applicability of any of the procedures set forth in \u00a7 3664(o) for challenging an otherwise final restitution order or cite to any other statutory provision concerning a court\u2019s power to modify a restitution order under the circumstances at issue here. Rather, he argues that the district court had inherent or retained jurisdiction to modify the restitution order. However, in the absence of statutory authorization to modify MacArthur\u2019s restitution order, the district court lacked jurisdiction to modify the order. <em>See id. </em>at 1315,1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 (vacating and remanding for the district court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the district court lacked jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>tion under \u00a7 3582(b)(3) to consider the defendant\u2019s motion to modify his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">. MacArthur has conceded on appeal that his argument that his restitution order should be reduced due to his substantial assistance is without merit, and thus, we do not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
