The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, concluding that it was supported by substantial evidence and free from legal error. More specifically, the Board determined that the ALJ had applied the correct legal standards in finding that the immediate jeopardy determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Any person adversely affected by a determination of the Secretary may file a petition for review in the appropriate court of appeals within 60 days of the Secretary\u2019s decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1320a-7a(e), 1395i \u2014 8(h)(2)(B)(ii). The findings of the Secretary are conclusive \u201cas supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1320a-7a(e). Substantial evidence means such evidence \u201cas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (internal quotation marks omitted) (1971); <em>see also, Fla. Med. Ctr. of Clearwater, Inc. v. Sebelius, </em>614 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2010) (the court must \u201cabide\u201d by the Secretary\u2019s decisions unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion ... or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">In this case, the record demonstrates that Resident 1 had a history of developing pressure sores during her stay in the nursing home. In October 2010, Resident 1 developed sores that were not properly reported, treated, or prevented. As a result, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) found the nursing home not in compliance with the minimum federal standards and imposed a $3,550 per day civil monetary penalty (\u201cCMP\u201d) from October 7, 2010, through November 13, 2010. The nursing home did not dispute the noncompliance, nor did it dispute the amount of the CMP imposed or CMS\u2019s finding concerning the duration of noncompliance. Instead, the nursing home challenged CMS\u2019s determination that the noncompliance posed immediate jeopardy. The ALJ and the Appeals Board disagreed and found that the nursing home failed to prevent and properly treat the serious pressure sores on Resident l\u2019s heels. The Appeals Board\u2019s focus was not on an instance of failing to provide care to an individual resident, but on whether the noncompliance evidence by one or more failures was likely to cause serious injury or harm to a resident if not corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties briefs, we conclude that the nursing home has failed to show that the Secretary\u2019s immediate jeopardy finding is clearly erroneous. Moreover, we conclude the Secretary\u2019s finding of immediate jeopardy is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Immediate jeopardy exists if the nursing home\u2019s noncompliance has caused or is likely to cause \u201cserious injury, harm, impairment or death to a resident.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301. \u201c[T]he regulation only requires that the nursing home\u2019s noncompliance is likely to cause harm to \u2018a resident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Liberty Commons Nursing &amp; Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>hab. Ctr. </em>\u2014Johnston <em>v. Leavitt, </em>241 Fed. Appx. 76, 80 (4th Cir.2007) (citing 42 C.F.R. 488.301). Actual harm is not a prerequisite for an immediate jeopardy finding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Accordingly, for the aforementioned reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
