As the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s decision, we review both the IJ\u2019s decision and the order of the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Cir.2009); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">To the extent that he contends for the first time that he is eligible for asylum, his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies by raising the issue before the BIA precludes us from exercising jurisdiction over such a claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). Although he asserts in passing that the IJ violated his substantive due process rights, Lama fails to brief this contention and thus waives it. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). Lama has not renewed any, and therefore has abandoned all, of the other claims that he raised before the BIA with the exception of his claim that the IJ erred by denying withholding of removal relief based on an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We review for substantial evidence the decision to deny withholding of removal and will not reverse unless the record compels it. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). Under the substantial-evidence standard, factual findings are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In claiming that his credibility was compromised because he was denied the assistance of a Nepali translator, Lama does not address the BIA\u2019s holding that he had waived any such claim by explicitly conceding to proceed in English. Consequently, he has abandoned any contention that the BIA erred by holding that he waived that claim. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833. Even though he asserts that the IJ improperly based the adverse credibility determination on, inter alia, numerous inconsistencies in Lama\u2019s testimony, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 \u201d supports the determination. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538. Lama has failed to show that substantial evidence compels the conclusion that the denial of withholding of removal was erroneous. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
