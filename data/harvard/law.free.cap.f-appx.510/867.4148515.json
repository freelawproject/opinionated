Ms. Dixon argues that the court should have reduced her sentence because the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) amended the advisory guidelines range and the mandatory statutory minimum applicable to her. Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Ms. Dixon pled guilty to one count of conspiring to possess crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The presentence investigation report held her accountable for 4.2 kilograms of crack cocaine, which made her base offense level at her 2006 sentencing hearing 38. After a 4-level enhancement for her leadership role, a 2-level enhancement for using a minor in the offense, and a 3-level reduction for accepting responsibility, her adjusted offense level became 41. Ms. Dixon had a criminal history category of I, which resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 324 to 405 months for the drug conspiracy count. Because of a prior drug conviction, however, she also faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years on that count. The firearm count carried a mandatory, and consecutive, 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">The district court sentenced Ms. Dixon to 360 months on the drug conspiracy count and 60 months on the firearm count, for a total of 420 months. The government then filed a substantial-assistance motion, and the court reduced Ms. Dixon\u2019s sentence on the drug conspiracy count to 120 months \u2014 a third of her original sentence on that count and half of the mandatory minimum. The court did not alter her 60-month sentence on the firearm count, so her new total sentence became 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">In 2009, with the assistance of counsel, Ms. Dixon filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. She noted that Amendment 706 had lowered her base offense level from 38 to 36, which gave her a total offense level of 39 and an advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months on the drug conspiracy count. Although her 180-month total sentence was below the new advisory guidelines range, Ms. Dixon requested an even lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">In its opposition to her motion, the government agreed that Amendment 706 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>would reduce Ms. Dixon\u2019s base offense level to 36 and her guidelines range to 262 to 327 months. But it highlighted the fact that the court had already cut her sentence from 35 years to 15 years \u2014 a 20-year reduction \u2014 based on substantial assistance. It argued that she should not receive a farther reduction because her prior drug felony and her actions during the crimes leading to the original sentence (her use of weapons, leadership role, and corruption of a minor) indicated that the 20-year reduction she had already received was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The district court denied the motion, finding \u201ca further sentence reduction ... not warranted\u201d because Ms. Dixon was \u201chighly culpable (receiving a 4 level role adjustment)\u201d and had \u201cpreviously received a significant reduction.\u201d Ms. Dixon did not appeal that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In 2011, Ms. Dixon filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. She again argued that the advisory guidelines range applicable to her had changed and that the court should reduce her sentence. The government once again opposed Ms. Dixon\u2019s motion, this time contending that she was not eligible for a reduction because Amendment 706 had already lowered her base offense level to 36 and, based upon the drug quantity for which she was held responsible, Amendment 750 did not lower it any further. The government also renewed its argument that, regardless of her eligibility for a further reduction, Ms. Dixon did not deserve one because she was highly culpable. Although the government failed to so explain in its opposition, the fact that Ms. Dixon\u2019s base offense level remained at 36 even after Amendment 750 also meant that her advisory guidelines range for the drug conspiracy count remained at 262 to 327 months \u2014 the same as it was after Amendment 706. Recognizing this, the district court found that Amendment 750 had not changed Ms. Dixon\u2019s guidelines range, and it denied her second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Ms. Dixon continues her argument in broader terms on appeal, contending that the FSA amended the advisory guidelines range and mandatory statutory minimum applicable to her. The government maintains that Amendment 750 did not lower either Ms. Dixon\u2019s guidelines range or, because it was enhanced by her prior drug crime, her mandatory minimum; thus, it argues, the district court had no authority to reduce Ms. Dixon\u2019s sentence. We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Although Amendment 706, upon which Ms. Dixon based her first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, lowered her advisory guidelines range, Amendment 750 affected neither her guidelines range nor her statutory minimum. And where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d the district court \u201cis not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d to reduce her sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). <em>See also United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012) (affirming denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because appellant\u2019s \u201cguideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750\u201d). Thus, while the district court could have reduced her sentence had it deemed a reduction warranted when Ms. Dixon requested one based on Amendment 706, the court could not do so based on Amendment 750. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cGiven that h[er] sentencing range did not change, the district court correctly recognized that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce [the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>dant\u2019s] sentence.\u201d)- The court was therefore correct in finding that because Amendment 750 had not changed Ms. Dixon\u2019s guidelines range, she was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on that amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Ms. Dixon\u2019s suggestion that she was eligible for a sentence reduction based on the FSA, which amended certain statutory minimum sentences and took effect in 2010, is similarly incorrect. As we recently explained, the FSA \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. ...\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). We also recognized that \u201cthe FSA does not apply retroactively to\u201d defendants \u201cwho were sentenced long before [its] effective date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if Ms. Dixon were permitted to bring her FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, then, the Act would not entitle her to a sentence reduction because she was originally sentenced in 2006, four years before the FSA took effect. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Because neither Amendment 750 nor the FSA authorized the district court to reduce Ms. Dixon\u2019s sentence, the court did not err in denying her current \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The district court\u2019s denial of Ms. Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-10\">. Because we conclude that neither Amendment 750 nor the FSA entitled Ms. Dixon to a sentence reduction, we do not address her arguments regarding the proper method by which to calculate her new sentence or the importance of equal treatment among code-fendants when considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
