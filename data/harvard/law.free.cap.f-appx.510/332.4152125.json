The United States successfully intervened in the <em>in rem </em>proceedings on the basis of preferred mortgage liens on the two vessels. Asmarbunkers Consultadoria E Par-icipacoes Unipessoal LDA and Bunkers International Corporation (\u201cAppellants\u201d) challenged the United States\u2019 superior claim to the proceeds of the vessels\u2019 sale based on a fuel lien they possessed. The district court granted summary judgment for the United States, and this appeal followed. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The SS NEW RIVER and the SS THE MONSEIGNEUR (\u201cthe ships\u201d or \u201cthe vessels\u201d) are two ships that were reconstructed by American Heavy Lift Corporation (\u201cAHL\u201d) in 1995. The reconstruction was financed by issuing bonds. The bonds were in turn guarantied by the Maritime Administration (\u201cMARAD\u201d), which operates within the U.S. Department of Transportation, pursuant to its statutory authority. Those same statutes provide that MARAD\u2019s mortgage on vessels it finances receives priority over most other creditor claims in the event the vessel owner defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">From 1995 to 2009, AHL had no problem paying the principal and interest due on both ships. However, during the credit crisis of 2009, AHL began to experience financial difficulty. AHL sought MAR-AD\u2019s assistance with making a principal payment due in December 2009 while assuring MARAD that it would make the relevant interest payment and that it was only experiencing temporary difficulty. Before MARAD had responded to AHL\u2019s request, however, AHL revised its request and asked MARAD to pay both the principal and interest due for December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">As knowledge of AHL\u2019s hardships spread throughout the shipping industry, companies that AHL dealt with began to withdraw or modify AHL\u2019s credit. One of the most significant changes AHL experienced involved fuel suppliers demanding payment up front, instead of allowing AHL to pay for fuel at the conclusion of a shipping voyage, when AHL would receive payment for its services. These changes challenged AHL\u2019s ability to stay in business. In order to continue operating, AHL sought alternative sources of fuel and eventually contacted Appellants. AHL\u2019s situation presented a new, if risky, business proposition for Appellants, however, since AHL had exhausted its credit with other suppliers and needed fuel supplied on favorable terms. Appellants made some inquiries to other fuel suppliers to determine whether AHL was a reliable company. Appellants did not, however, seek a credit report or other financial documentation; nor did Appellants check public records regarding outstanding mortgages on AHL\u2019s vessels. Appellants, having satisfied themselves of AHL\u2019s creditworthiness, began supplying fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>MARAD ultimately declined to pay AHL\u2019s principal and interest payments for December 2009. As a result, AHL defaulted. Under the relevant agreements, AHL\u2019s default gave MARAD the option to immediately foreclose on the mortgage. The agreements also gave AHL a grace period within which it could cure its default. MARAD elected against immediate foreclosure and bond holders decided to wait in hopes that AHL would remit the amount owed. In January 2010, it was determined that AHL could not cure its default. MARAD paid the loan guaranty accordingly. MARAD then exercised its right to accelerate AHL\u2019s debt and demand immediate payment. AHL could not remit the amount due, so MARAD began negotiating the surrender of the two vessels at issue here. MARAD eventually took control of the ships in April 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">After their arrest, the ships were sued by AHL\u2019s creditors <em>in rem. </em>The United States moved to intervene, citing its preferred mortgage lien for some $91 million. Appellants contested the United States\u2019 position, alleging that their lien for fuel took priority and that the United States\u2019 mortgage should be equitably subordinated. The district court allowed the United States to intervene and granted summary judgment. The vessels were sold at auction for $5.7 million. As this satisfied only a fraction of the United States\u2019 mortgage, AHL\u2019s other creditors did not receive any of these funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants then filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir. 2010). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). However, a party asserting \u201cthat a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed\u201d must support such an assertion by citing specific parts of the record. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Appellants claim on appeal that their lien for fuel supplied to AHL should take precedence over the United States\u2019 preferred mortgage lien based on the principles of laches or equitable subordination. Appellants so claim because MARAD purportedly knew about AHL\u2019s financial difficulties before they began supplying AHL with fuel. It is Appellants\u2019 contention that they suffered prejudice as a result of MARAD\u2019s conduct. Appellants also seek reversal based on the district court\u2019s failure to enforce a local rule when it considered the United States\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">In order to justify equitable subordination of a valid claim, Appellants must show that (1) MARAD engaged in inequitable conduct; (2) the misconduct injured a creditor or conferred an unfair advantage on MARAD; and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with statutory provisions. <em>See Custom Fuel Servs., Inc. v. Lombas Indus., Inc., </em>805 F.2d 561, 566 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>(5th Cir.1986). Showing that MARAD is in a position of control over the debtor is generally \u201c[t]he prerequisite to a finding of inequitable conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Inequitable conduct exists in three categories of cases: (1) \u201cthose in which a fiduciary of the debtor misuses his position to the disadvantage of other creditors\u201d; (2) \u201cthose in which a third party, in effect, controls the debtor to the disadvantage of others\u201d; and (8) \u201cthose in which a third-party defrauds other creditors.\u201d <em>CTS Truss, Inc. v. Fed. Deposit. Ins. Co., </em>868 F.2d 146, 148-49 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Equitable subordination is not appropriate here because, as the district court found, Appellants fail the first prong of the test. Appellants have neither alleged nor demonstrated that MARAD was in control of AHL; and Appellants do not claim that MARAD defrauded other creditors or that MARAD is a fiduciary of AHL. <em>See id.; Custom Fuel Servs., </em>805 F.2d at 566. As a result, it cannot be shown that MARAD engaged in inequitable conduct for purposes of equitable subordination. Summary judgment was thus appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In response, Appellants claim that a showing of control over the debtor is irrelevant, though they do not present persuasive precedent on point. As our cases makes clear, demonstrating inequitable conduct on the part of a claimant requires showing the claimant\u2019s control over the debtor. <em>Id. </em>The point is aptly illustrated by <em>Custom Fuel Services, </em>805 F.2d 561 (5th Cir.1986). In that case, this Court encountered the sort of sham transaction against which equitable subordination is meant to protect creditors. A ship owner attempted to insulate its vessel from maritime liens by transferring title to a wholly owned subsidiary and taking a preferred ship mortgage equal to the ship\u2019s value. <em>Id. </em>at 563. When the parent company attempted to assert the priority of its mortgage lien against other creditors, this Court employed equitable subordination to avoid the ship owner\u2019s sham transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69. In <em>Custom Fuel Services, </em>the Court required a showing of control and found such a showing given that the debtor company was a wholly owned subsidiary of the creditor asserting a preferred mortgage lien. <em>Id. </em>at 566. Such is not the case here. Appellants have made no showing that MARAD was in a position of control over AHL. Therefore, we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Laches-the claim that another party\u2019s inexcusable delay resulted in prejudice&amp;emdash;has three elements: (1) delay in asserting a right; (2) the delay was inexcusable; and (3) undue prejudice resulted from the delay. <em>Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece, </em>141 F.3d 188, 205 (5th Cir.1998). Here, Appellants claim that laches applies because MARAD did not foreclose on AHL\u2019s vessels at the first sign of financial distress. This claim fails for two reasons. First, MARAD had no obligation to foreclose on AHL\u2019s ships when AHL first encountered financial difficulty. The relevant agreement gave MARAD the option, but not the obligation, to foreclose. Second, when MARAD opted to delay foreclosure, it did so for justifiable reasons: given the state of the credit market when AHL first exhibited signs of distress, it was in creditors\u2019 interest to give AHL an opportunity to cure default. The ships\u2019 value as collateral was minimal, and the interest rate on AHL\u2019s bonds was far preferable to the alternatives available towards the end of 2009. It was also in the interest of the industry overall given the number of jobs dependent on AHL\u2019s continued operation. Any delay was thus excusable. To the extent Appellants regret their decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>supply the ships with fuel after AHL\u2019s default, it was not MARAD\u2019s obligation to ensure AHL was creditworthy. Therefore, we affirm on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Appellants also cursorily claim that the district court\u2019s summary judgment order should be reversed because the district court ignored a local rule requiring that motions for summary judgment include a statement of issues to be decided by the court and a statement of undisputed material facts. We review a district court\u2019s application of local rules for an abuse of discretion. <em>Victor F. v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., 793 </em>F.2d 633, 635 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Here, Appellants have not demonstrated an abuse of discretion. Rather, Appellants rely merely on the fact that the district court considered the United States\u2019 motion, despite the government\u2019s failure to submit the required statements. Nevertheless, the relevant issues were fully briefed and the district court issued well-reasoned opinions clearly explaining the facts of this case, the relevant standards, and the analysis that led to the court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion. To the extent this local rule is intended to aid the court\u2019s handling of motions, the court clearly did not believe the government\u2019s oversight impaired that ability. If the rule is intended to assist opposing parties in responding, Appellants have not claimed that their ability to respond on the merits was hampered. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. There is one exception. The crew of each ship successfully pressed claims for unpaid contributions to the crews' IRAs and vacation plans. Under the applicable law, these were the only claims with statutory superiority to the United States\u2019 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
