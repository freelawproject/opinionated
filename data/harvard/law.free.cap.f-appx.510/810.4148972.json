The parties consented to jurisdiction by a magistrate judge, who granted Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Hill\u2019s retaliation claim, but denied summary judgment on Hill\u2019s hostile work environment claim. The case proceeded to a bench trial. Although the magistrate judge found that Hill suffered discomfort and anxiety at work, he concluded that Hill failed to satisfy his burden of proof and was \u201cnot the victim of actionable conduct on the part of his employer.\u201d A judgment was entered in favor of Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-18\">Hill raises four central issues on appeal. He argues that the district court erred by 1) failing to inform him that he had to request a jury trial; 2) failing to tell him which claims he should file; 3) granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>summary judgment to Wal-Mart based only on his deposition and the false declarations of accused Wal-Mart employees; and 4) granting judgment to Wal-Mart when the witnesses contradicted each other. We consider each of Hill\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">First, Hill asserts that the district court erred by neglecting to tell him that he had to request a jury trial. Hill argues that he did not request a jury trial because, as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, he was not aware of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">\u201cThe Constitution guarantees to litigants in the federal courts the right to have their case tried by a jury, and Rule 38 of the Rules of Civil Procedure explicitly implements that guarantee.\u201d <em>City of Morgantown, W. Va. v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>387 U.S. 254, 258, 69 S.Ct. 1067, 1069, 93 L.Ed. 1347 (1949). But, Rule 38(d) also provides that \u201c[a] party waives a jury trial unless its demand is properly served and filed.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">\u201cInterpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure presents a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review....\u201d <em>Mega Life and Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1403 (11th Cir.2009). The \u201cdenial of a jury trial is reviewed with the most exacting scrutiny\u201d and \u201cthis Court indulge[s] every reasonable presumption against waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). This Court also liberally construes <em>pro se </em>briefs and pleadings. <em>Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir.2008). However, Hill points to no pleading that we might liberally interpret as a request for a jury trial. Instead he suggests that the requirement in Rule 38 should not apply to him because he was not made aware of it. <em>Pro se </em>litigants remain \u201csubject to the relevant law and rules of court, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989). This being the case, under Rule 38, Hill waived his right to a jury trial when he failed to make a proper demand. <em>See LaMarca v. Turner, </em>995 F.2d 1526, 1545 (11th Cir. 1993) (explaining that a party waives the right to a jury trial \u201cby failing to make a timely demand upon the courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Second, Hill contends that the district court erred when it did not tell him which claims he could bring. Specifically, Hill stresses that he enumerated twenty-four claims in his original complaint. He argues that the magistrate judge should have told him which claims he could bring, instead of just informing him of the problems with his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Following Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to dismiss, or motion for a more definite statement, the magistrate judge issued a seven-page order instructing Hill on how to plead a claim. This order explained the purpose and requirements of a complaint; described in detail the problem with \u201cshotgun\u201d pleadings; \u201curged [Hill] to review Rule 8, Rule 10 and Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d; and ordered Hill to file an amended complaint in conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The magistrate judge then suggested that Hill \u201cseriously consider presenting only such claims as literally \u2018the law will allow.\u2019 \u201d In view of the explanations given to Hill by the magistrate judge, and noting our admonishment that a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s \u201clack of legal expertise is not a basis for reversal,\u201d <em>United States v. LaChance, </em>817 F.2d 1491, 1499 (11th Cir. 1987), we conclude that the district court did not err by failing to advise Hill on which claims to bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Third, Hill argues that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment based on contradictory and incomplete evidence presented by Wal-Mart. Specifically, he says that the district court did not consider \u201cthe additional evidence and witness testimony that hadn\u2019t yet been presented,\u201d and that the district court accepted as true the false statements made by Wal-Mart employees, who were motivated to hide the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We review the district court\u2019s granting of a summary judgment motion <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.2005). A moving party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif [it] shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We consider the facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">We interpret Hill\u2019s assertion of incomplete, false, and inconsistent evidence as an argument that factual issues were in dispute about whether Hill was subject to retaliation under Title VII. <em>See Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d at 1320 (explaining that we liberally interpret pleadings from a <em>pro se </em>litigant). We agree with the district court that Wal-Mart was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Hill\u2019s retaliation claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To establish a claim of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that 1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; 2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and 3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Butler v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>536 F.3d 1209, 1212-13 (11th Cir.2008). If a plaintiff-employee makes out a prima facie case of retaliation, and the employer articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the action, the plaintiff must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer\u2019s reason is pretextual. <em>Lip-phardt v. Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Even assuming that Hill made a prima facie case of retaliation, he has not rebutted the legitimate reasons offered by Wal-Mart for his discipline and termination. Specifically, Wal-Mart alleges, and Hill concedes, that he was disciplined for failing to finish his work in the dairy department; clocking-out early; clocking excessive overtime; and failing to clean the cooler. Hill was told if he was disciplined again within twelve months, he would be terminated. Hill was then terminated after using \u201csevere profanity\u201d in front of a customer. The store manager who fired Hill said that he was not aware of the allegedly hostile condition of Hill\u2019s work environment. Hill did not rebut Wal-Mart\u2019s reasons for his termination or discipline by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that Wal-Mart\u2019s reason was pretextual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on this record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>district court properly granted summary judgment in Wal-Mart\u2019s favor on Hill\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Fourth, Hill argues that the district court erred by granting judgment in favor of Wal-Mart on his hostile work environment claim following the bench trial. \u201cOn appeal of a district court order from a bench trial, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>HGI Assocs., Inc. v. Wetmore Printing Co., </em>427 F.3d 867, 873 (11th Cir.2005). The clear error standard of review is highly deferential. \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Morrissette-Brown v. Mobile Infirmary Med. Ctr., </em>506 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). Under this standard, \u201c[i]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">First, Hill contests the district court\u2019s factual findings by asserting that ten witnesses contradicted themselves. His argument is essentially a \u201csummation of] the many false statements and actions made by Wal-Mart during this action.\u201d However, assessing the credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder. We ordinarily do not review a factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility. <em>Crystal Entm\u2019t &amp; Filmworks, Inc. v. Jurado, </em>643 F.3d 1313, 1320 (11th Cir.2011). Because we \u201cmust give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6), we will not second-guess the district court\u2019s determinations of the witnesses\u2019 credibility under clear error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Second, Hill seems to argue that the district court\u2019s legal conclusions were erroneous. As for the hostile work environment claim, Hill argues that the conduct in his case was \u201cmore frequent, voluminous, and explicit\u201d than our circuit precedent requires. To prove a hostile work environment, Hill must show that 1) he belonged to a protected group; 2) he was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment; 3) the harassment was based on his sex; 4) \u201cthe harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment\u201d; and 5) there is a basis for holding Wal-Mart ha-ble. <em>See Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">\u2018When, as in this case, the alleged harassment is committed by co-workers or customers, a Title VII plaintiff must show that the employer either knew (actual notice) or should have known (constructive notice) of the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.\u201d <em>Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., </em>324 F.3d 1252, 1259 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cActual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>notice is established by proof that management knew of the harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court found that Wal-Mart did not have actual knowledge that Hill complained of his co-workers\u2019 conduct. Although Hill testified that three of his supervisors knew that he complained of his co-workers\u2019 behavior, these three supervisors testified that they were not aware that Hill complained of sexual harassment. We need not resolve this factual dispute, however, because the supervisors\u2019 testimony is evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Wal-Mart did not have actual knowledge of Hill\u2019s alleged harassment, and we review that finding for clear error. <em>See HGI </em>Assocs., <em>Inc., </em>427 F.3d at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The district court also determined that Hill failed to show that Wal-Mart had constructive knowledge of Hill\u2019s alleged harassment. \u201cThe question of constructive knowledge is an issue of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Farley v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>115 F.3d 1548, 1553 (11th Cir. 1997). The district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the fact that Wal-Mart had a well-advertised sexual harassment policy, which allowed associates to bring complaints to management. When a company has developed and disseminated such a policy, \u201cit has fulfilled its obligation to make reasonably diligent efforts to \u2018know what is going on\u2019 within the company\u201d and \u201cthe existence of [such a] policy precludes a finding of constructive knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1153-54. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Wal-Mart did not know of the harassment alleged by Hill. The district court did not err in granting judgment in favor of Wal-Mart.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the decisions of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">. We also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hill was precluded from raising his race discrimination claim because he did not include this claim in his amended complaint. Because an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint, claims that were omitted from the amended complaint are not properly before the district court. <em>Pintando v. Miami-Dade Housing Agency, </em>501 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-11\">. In his response to Wal-Mart\u2019s summary judgment motion, Hill stated that he \"will present evidence that demonstrates that a retaliatory reason is what motivated Wal-Mart to terminate his employment.\u201d However, he never provided that evidence during the district court\u2019s consideration of Wal-Mart's summary judgment motion. Indeed, Hill argues that the magistrate judge prematurely granted summary judgment without considering evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>dence that Hill had not yet presented. As the moving party, Wal-Mart had the initial burden of establishing that there were no genuine issues of material fact. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The burden then shifted to Hill to \u201crebut that showing by producing affidavits or other relevant and admissible evidence beyond the pleadings.\u201d <em>Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, </em>683 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). Because Hill had the burden of producing evidence after Wal-Mart\u2019s initial showing, the district court did not err when it granted partial summary judgment without considering evidence that Hill had not presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">. Hill also argues that the district court erred by changing the defendant from \u201cWal-Mart Stores, Inc. to Wal-Mart Stores East, L.P.\u201d when members of senior management worked for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Even assuming such an error, it was harmless because Hill has not shown that his employer, whether Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or Wal-Mart Stores East, L.P., engaged in actionable conduct. As Hill acknowledges, the name change does not impact his substantive rights. \"We will not reverse if an error of the district court is harmless, and the standard for harmless error is whether the complaining party\u2019s substantive rights were affected.\" <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1276 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
