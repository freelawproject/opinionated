The district court granted the individual defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding that Tilus did not exhaust his administrative remedies within five business days of the alleged assault as was required by the Jail\u2019s grievance procedures. Tilus now argues that his administrative remedies remained unavailable to him because he was hospitalized until July 30, 2010, and could not file any grievances when officials thereafter placed him under \u201cpsych watch.\u201d He further asserts that officials returned his grievances to him unanswered after he was transferred to administrative segregation on August 3, 2010. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)\u2019s exhaustion requirement. <em>Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.3d 1152, 1155 (11th Cir.2005). The exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) is a matter in abatement that should be raised in a motion to dismiss, or treated as such if raised in a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bryant v. Rich, </em>530 F.3d 1368, 1374-75 (11th Cir.2008). Under such circumstances, the district court may consider facts outside of the pleadings and r\u00e9solve factual disputes so long as it does not decide the merits of the case and so long as it permits the parties a sufficient opportunity to develop the record. <em>Id. </em>at 1376. Resolving motions to dismiss for failing to exhaust administrative remedies is a two-step process. <em>Turner v. Burnside, </em>541 F.3d 1077, 1082 (11th Cir.2008). First, the court must look to the factual allegations in the defendant\u2019s motion and the plaintiffs response, taking the plaintiffs version of the facts as true to the extent it conflicts with that of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>If the complaint is not subject to dismissal at this step, the court must then make specific findings to resolve the parties\u2019 factual disputes, and determine whether the defendant bore its burden of proving that the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1082-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Under the PLRA, an inmate confined in a jail may not bring a \u00a7 1983 action until he exhausts the administrative remedies that are available. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>The exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, including those that raise excessive force claims, and the inmate who alleges harm suffered from prison conditions must file a grievance and exhaust the remedies available under a state\u2019s grievance procedures as a prerequisite to a federal \u00a7 1988 action. <em>See Johnson, </em>418 F.3d at 1155-56. The PLRA requires \u201cproper exhaustion,\u201d which demands compliance with a state\u2019s deadlines and other procedural rules. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90-91, 93, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 2386-87, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). Thus, where an inmate\u2019s grievance fails to meet administrative deadlines or an existing exception to a timely filing requirement, his federal claim will be barred. <em>See Johnson, </em>418 F.3d at 1155-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">A remedy must first be available to be exhausted, and availability requires that the remedy is \u201ccapable of use for the accomplishment of [its] purpose.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>541 F.3d at 1084 (citation omitted). We have recognized that a prison official\u2019s conduct, under certain circumstances, might prevent an inmate from pursuing his administrative remedies, thereby rendering them \u201cunavailable\u201d and lifting the exhaustion requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 1084-85. Thus, we concluded that a prison official\u2019s serious threats of substantial retaliation against an inmate for pursuing a grievance in good faith render the inmate\u2019s administrative remedy unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 1085. Without deciding the issue, we have also recognized that other courts of appeals have concluded that administrative remedies are unavailable where prison officials do not respond to an inmate\u2019s grievances or prevent the filing of grievances. <em>Bryant, </em>530 F.3d at 1373 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We note initially that the district court appears to have erred by not treating the individual defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss. <em>See id. </em>at 1374-75. However, the district court was permitted to consider facts outside of the pleadings, <em>see id. </em>at 1376, and we hold that the district court correctly concluded that the undisputed material evidence established that Tilus failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">It is undisputed that, at all relevant times, the Jail maintained a grievance procedure and claims of excessive force were subject to these procedures. These procedures required Tilus to file a formal grievance by August 3, 2010, five business days after the alleged assault on July 27, 2010. Tilus returned from the hospital to the Jail on July 30, 2010, and was placed in the infirmary under psych watch until August 3, 2010 \u2014 the fifth business day from the alleged assault. In Tilus\u2019s response to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, he argues that the Jail\u2019s rules and regulations prohibited him from filing any grievances while he was under psych watch. Tilus does not offer any evidence to this effect, and, as the district court found, the Jail\u2019s grievance procedures in fact state that, \u201cgrievances will be accessible to inmates at <em>all times </em>\u201d and that \u201cunder <em>no circumstance </em>will the grievance process be denied.\u201d Dkt. 97-2 at 2 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Tilus also argued below that Jail officials, at some date, confiscated his property and have not returned his possessions, including copies of unsigned and unanswered grievances that he filed regarding this alleged assault. However, except for stating that he filed grievances sometime after he was transferred to administrative segregation on August 3, Tilus does not allege that any of these grievances were submitted to the Jail staff, in accordance with the Jail\u2019s grievance procedures, on or before August 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Because Thus failed to take advantage of available administrative remedies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>timely file a grievance regarding the alleged assault, his \u00a7 1988 claims are barred in federal court. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Accordingly, after a careful and thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-10\">. The district court dismissed Tilus\u2019s complaint for failing to state a claim to the extent that it raised claims against the individual defendants in their official capacities and against the Jail. Tilus has not argued that the district court erred in this respect, and has abandoned any such argument. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that, although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs, issues that are not briefed on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-15\">. Tilus's other arguments on appeal are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
