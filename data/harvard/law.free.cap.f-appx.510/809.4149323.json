Here, the appellants voluntarily executed consent orders relinquishing any right, title, or interest and claims to the properties identified in those consents and, thus, they lack standing to challenge the forfeiture of those properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">Moreover, the appellants also lack standing because they failed to timely file third-party petitions and pursue ancillary proceedings. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2) (requiring third-party claimants to file a petition for a hearing to adjudicate their interests in the forfeited property \u201cwithin thirty days of the final publication of notice [of forfeiture]\u201d); <em>Libretti v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 44, 116 S.Ct. 356, 133 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>271 (1995) (\u201c[T]hird-party claimants can establish their entitlement to return of the [forfeited] assets only by means of the hearing afforded under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n).\u201d). If a third party fails to file a \u00a7 853(n)(2) petition within the prescribed thirty-day deadline, her interests in the property are forfeited. <em>United States v. Marion, </em>562 F.3d 1330, 1336 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Accordingly, because the appellants lack standing, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss the entirety of the Rule 60(b) motion for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>questions about our subject matter jurisdiction, including standing. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>668 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-15\">. Because we find that the appellants lack standing, we need not address the appellants\u2019 substantive arguments that (1) the court had jurisdiction to vacate a forfeiture order; (2) the forfeiture order is improper in light of <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010); (3) the court did not address the substantive merits of their claim; (4) the court had jurisdiction to consider a forfeiture that was accomplished through the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s administrative forfeiture authority; (5) the court failed to afford them <em>de novo </em>review of the entire record and their objections; and (6) the forfeiture violates the Eighth Amendment. We also need not address the government\u2019s contention that the appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
