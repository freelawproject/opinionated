The district court dismissed Dollar\u2019s complaint without prejudice under the three strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), concluding that Dollar had been erroneously granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>After review, we vacate the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and remand this appeal for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">On June 11, 2010, Dollar filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint against the Coweta County Sheriff Office, the Coweta County Jail medical staff, and various prison officers. Dollar\u2019s complaint alleged that in November 2008, he was arrested and taken to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Coweta County Jail. Dollar alleged that, while at the jail, (1) he was interviewed without being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and while still under the influence of pain medication and needing detoxification; (2) during the interview, he was tightly handcuffed to a chair, which injured his left hand; (3) he was forced to sleep on the floor for three weeks due to overcrowding; (4) he did not have access to fresh drinking water, suffered respiratory problems due to a raw sewage leak and staph infections from rusty beds and showers; (5) jail medical staff provided inadequate medical treatment for his injured left hand, spinal injury and respiratory problems; and (6) he was denied access to a law library or other legal assistance and the right to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The district court dismissed Dollar\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, concluding that his claims of unlawful confinement were improperly brought under \u00a7 1983 and should have been brought as a habeas petition. The district court dismissed his claims relating to excessive force and confinement conditions because Dollar had not exhausted all administrative remedies at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Dollar appealed to this Court, which affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his unlawful confinement claims. <em>See Dollar v. Coweta Cnty. Sheriff Office, et al., </em>446 Fed.Appx. 248, 251 (2011). However, this Court vacated the dismissal of Dollar\u2019s excessive force and conditions-of-conflnement claims and ordered the appeal remanded to the district court as to those claims, concluding that it was not clear from the face of the complaint that Dollar had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">II. REMAND BEFORE THE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">On remand from this Court, the district court determined <em>sua sponte </em>that Dollar previously had filed numerous civil actions in federal courts while incarcerated, at least three of which had been dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court therefore concluded that, in light of these dismissals, \u00a7 1915(g) prohibited Dollar from bringing any civil actions while proceeding <em>informa pauper-is. </em>On this basis, the district court found that it had erroneously granted Dollar leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed his \u00a7 1983 complaint without prejudice. Thereafter, Dollar filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Under the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) prisoners are permitted to file only three meritless suits in the <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Specifically, the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of the PLRA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-12\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-13\"><em>Id. </em>The purpose of the PLRA is to conserve judicial resources by preventing meritless cases initiated by prisoners. <em>Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cAfter the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>meritless suit, the prisoner must pay the full filing fee at the time he initiates suit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Our published decisions have consistently looked at the <em>time of filing </em>when considering whether \u00a7 1915(g) prevents a prisoner from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis. See Brown v. Johnson, </em>887 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that a prisoner is prevented from proceeding <em>in forma pau-peris \u201cafter </em>he has filed three meritless lawsuits\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Dupree v. Palmer, </em>284 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir. 2002) (examining whether a prisoner\u2019s complaint fell under \u00a7 1915(g) \u201cat the moment of filing\u201d); <em>Vanderberg, </em>259 F.3d at 1324 <em>(\u201cAfter </em>the third meritless suit, the prisoner must pay the full filing fee at the time he initiates suit.\u201d (emphasis added)). The plain reading of \u00a7 1915(g) also suggests that strikes are to be counted at the time the complaint is filed. The relevant language of the provision reads \u201c[i]n no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action ... if the prisoner has, on 3 or more <em>prior occasions ... </em>brought an action or. appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">After review of Dollar\u2019s litigation record, we conclude that the district court erred when it dismissed Dollar\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915(g). When Dollar filed his complaint in the present case on June 11, 2010, he only had \u201cone strike\u201d against him, based on the dismissal of his 2007 case for frivolousness. <em>See Dollar v. Duffey, </em>3:07-cv-0085-JTC (N.D. Ga., dismissed September 28, 2007). With the exception of this 2007 case, the district court supported its dismissal order by referencing cases brought by Dollar that were dismissed in 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, Dollar filed his complaint in the present case prior to becoming a \u201cthree-striker,\u201d and the district court\u2019s conclusion that Dollar was prohibited from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand this appeal to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">.
