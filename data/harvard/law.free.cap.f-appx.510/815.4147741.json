California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In response, Knapp has filed a motion to withdraw his appeal alleging his counsel has not directly communicated with him about counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit on appeal as to Knapp\u2019s convictions and sentences, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, Knapp\u2019s motion to withdraw his appeal is DENIED, and Knapp\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
