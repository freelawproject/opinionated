At sentencing, the district court held him accountable for 144.6 kilograms of crack cocaine, which triggered a base offense level of 42 under the Sentencing Guidelines and a total offense level of 45. Burgess\u2019s resulting guidelines range was life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Burgess to life imprisonment on the drug count and a mandatory five-year sentence on the firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">We upheld Burgess\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120 (11th Cir.1997). In doing so, we expressed doubt that Burgess was responsible for 144.6 kilograms of crack cocaine, but stated that there was sufficient evidence to hold him accountable for 85.6 kilograms, which was still significantly more than required to trigger a base offense level of 42. <em>Id. </em>at <em>1158-61.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In September 1997, Burgess moved for a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 505, which capped the offense level at 38 \u2014 corresponding to 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine\u2014 for certain drug offenses, including Burgess\u2019s. The district court declined to exercise its discretion to lower Burgess\u2019s sentence and denied the motion, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Burgess (Burgess I), </em>190 F.3d 540 (11th Cir.1999) (unpublished table decision). Ten years later, Burgess again moved for a reduction in sentence under Amendment 505. This time, he argued that the district court erred in his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, in part by basing its decision on an amount of crack cocaine that this court rejected in his direct appeal. The government responded that, due to the extraordinary quantity of crack cocaine for which Burgess was responsible, even if the district court accepted the amount we mentioned in dicta on direct appeal, a reduction in his sentence was unwarranted. The district court adopted the government\u2019s reasoning and denied Burgess\u2019s motion. We affirmed again. <em>United States v. Burgess (Burgess II), </em>278 Fed.Appx. 959, 959 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">In December 2008, Burgess filed a third \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, based in part on Amendment 505. The district court denied this motion based on the government\u2019s argument that the law-of-the-case doctrine prohibited Burgess\u2019s Amendment 505 argument. Burgess filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court denied. Burgess did not appeal. Then, in January 2012, Burgess filed this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his fourth. The government responded that the court had already declined to exercise its discretion to reduce Burgess\u2019s sentence under Amendment 505. The district court agreed with the government\u2019s reasoning and denied Burgess\u2019s motion. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). A district court\u2019s application of the law-of-the-case doctrine, however, is a legal conclusion that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Bobo, </em>419 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The law-of-the-case doctrine provides: \u201cAn appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case not only as to explicit rulings, but also as to issues decided necessarily by implication on the prior appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir. 1996). There are narrow exceptions \u201cwhere there is new evidence, an intervening change in controlling law dictating a different result, or the appellate decision, if implemented, would cause manifest injustice because it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The law-of-the-case doctrine applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">We conclude the law-of-the-case doctrine applies to preclude a reduction in Burgess\u2019s sentence based on Amendment 505. In <em>Burgess II </em>we affirmed the denial of Burgess\u2019s request for a reduction under Amendment 505, necessarily by implication incorporating the district court\u2019s reasoning that, whether Burgess was held responsible for 85.6 or 144.6 kilograms of crack cocaine, a reduction in sentence was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>warranted. <em>See Burgess II, </em>278 Fed.Appx. at 959. That holding is the law of this case and accordingly binds us with respect to our analysis of Burgess\u2019s current appeal based on the same argument. <em>See Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">And we cannot agree with Burgess that the manifest injustice exception to the doctrine applies here. In denying Burgess\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court found that, even if the court were to hold Burgess responsible for only 85.6 kilograms of crack cocaine, that amount \u2014 more than 50 times the triggering amount for a base offense level 38\u2014 was so extraordinary that a reduction was not warranted. We affirmed that ruling. Burgess cannot show that this reasoning is clearly erroneous because it relies, in part, on exactly the drug calculation he asks us to consider. Accordingly, Burgess cannot show our reliance on that reasoning in this appeal would cause manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-9\">. Although Burgess also based his motion on Amendment 750, he has not made this argument on appeal and has, therefore, abandoned it. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
