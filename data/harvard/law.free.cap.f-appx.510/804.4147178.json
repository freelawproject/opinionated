In the instant complaint, Hargrove alleged that (1) the government had made the citizens of the United States \u201cassets\u201d to keep the government afloat after it went bankrupt in 1933; (2) the Fourteenth Amendment was invalid; (3) the United States was a corporation; and (4) Hargrove was owed $400,000,000, because he became the \u201csecured party\u201d and \u201cholder in due course of the preferred stock\u201d of the United States. On appeal, Hargrove reiterates the allegations from his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), using the same standards that govern dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). Under \u00a7 1915A, the district eourt (1) shall review, either before docketing or as soon as practicable after docketing, a civil complaint brought by a prisoner against a government defendant, and (2) dismiss the complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and, thus, are construed liberally. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). A legal claim or argument that is not briefed on appeal is deemed abandoned. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324 ,1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">To properly state a claim, a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). In reviewing a court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint, we must accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.2008). However, the complaint must allege facts that, if true, \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d and conclusory statements, without more, are insufficient. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678,129 S.Ct. 1937,1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Hargrove abandoned his claim on appeal by failing to raise any legal argument challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. Even if Hargrove\u2019s appellate brief could be construed as arguing that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint, Hargrove\u2019s complaint contains nothing more than conclusory, facially implausible allegations; thus, the district court did not err in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
