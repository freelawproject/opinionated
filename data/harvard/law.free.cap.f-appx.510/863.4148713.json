The district court held that to conform to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), as interpreted by <em>Hubbard v. Haley, </em>262 F.3d 1194, 1195 (11th Cir.2001), each inmate must file a new, individual complaint, and either pay the full filing fee or submit an individual motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP). On appeal, Bowens argues that because <em>Hubbard </em>aimed to curtail the flux of frivolous lawsuits by inmates, the Court never ruled on inmates (1) sharing the mandatory filing fee for non-frivolous civil rights lawsuits brought under exigent circumstances. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of the PLRA constitutes a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 1196. We have held that the PLRA \u201camended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b) to require a prisoner to pay the full amount of the filing fee when a prisoner brings a civil suit IFP.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Hubbard, </em>18 prisoners filed a single pro se civil rights action under \u00a7 1983 against a correctional facility and other defendants. The prisoners alleged that the correctional facility failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical care and diet. <em>Id. </em>at 1195. We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, holding that the plain language of the PLRA requires that each prisoner proceeding IFP pay the full initial filing fee and the appellate filing fee. <em>Id. </em>at 1195, 1198. To the extent that the Rules Enabling Act, as expressed in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>conflicts with the PLRA, we held that the statute repeals the Rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Here, as a preliminary matter, this Court only has jurisdiction to hear this appeal as to Bowens, because only Bowens signed the document that was construed as a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(2). Bowens, however, has faded to show that the district court erred when it dismissed the original complaint because the PLRA, as interpreted by <em>Hubbard, </em>did not provide exceptions for joinder of inmate plaintiffs based on the nature of the claims that they raised. To the contrary, because the prisoners in <em>Hubbard </em>claimed inadequate medical care, the court in <em>Hubbard </em>arguably anticipated claims that could involve exigent danger to the prisoners, such as those claims seemingly raised by Bowens here.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
