We conclude that this post crime character evidence is relevant and, like all relevant evidence, is admissible unless properly excluded under Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">A jury convicted defendant of assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)), and found he inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of that crime. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7.) He admitted a prior conviction. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) Sentenced to state prison for an aggregate term of seven years, his sole contention on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of subsequent acts of violence by the victim. We find no discretionary error and consequently affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Late in the afternoon of January 20, 1981, Ralph Kelly observed a woman he had known previously walking on Rio Linda Boulevard in Sacramento. The woman, Barbara C., was arguing with the defendant, her boyfriend. At Kelly\u2019s invitation, Barbara got into the pickup truck in which Kelly was riding. They drove to the home where Barbara and defendant lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">When they arrived, defendant had also returned and was outside. Barbara invited Kelly inside where the three had some drinks and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>talked. Later that evening, all three went to a nearby bar. Barbara and Kelly returned to the house and went to bed together. Defendant remained at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Kelly later awoke to the sound of Barbara screaming and felt a knife in his side. He jumped up and saw defendant with the knife. As Kelly and defendant wrestled for the knife, Kelly was stabbed eight times. Defendant went to a neighbor\u2019s house and told the resident he had stabbed a man because the man was having sex with his girl friend. Defendant also told police after his arrest that he saw his girl friend and Kelly in bed together and that he stabbed Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Defendant testified he stabbed Kelly in self-defense. Defendant told the jury when he returned home he found the door broken and, as he went inside, he was struck on the head and knocked unconscious. After regaining consciousness, defendant assumed there was a burglar on the premises. When he opened the bedroom door, Barbara screamed and defendant saw a man jump up and try to grab him. Defendant used the knife to protect himself. He denied telling his neighbor he stabbed Kelly because Kelly was having sex with Barbara, and only vaguely remembered talking with police after his arrest. The parties stipulated that shortly after his arrest defendant had a blood alcohol level of .30.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The People moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any reference by defendant to an incident occurring two and a half months after the instant offense in which Kelly allegedly terrorized an elderly couple in their home and fired a shot at one of them. The court ruled that evidence of Kelly\u2019s alleged assault would have little probative value, would be cumulative and prejudicial, and would confuse the jury and consume too much time. The couple\u2019s testimony was consequently excluded under Evidence Code section 352. Nevertheless, the court took judicial notice of the pending charges against Kelly arising out of that incident and read them to the jury: Single counts of burglary, attempted robbery, and attempted murder, as well as various weapons charges. Those charges were admitted into evidence on the issue of Kelly\u2019s possible bias or motive in testifying for the prosecution. In addition, two defense witnesses were permitted to testify that Kelly was violent and dangerous, and had assaulted both his ex-wife and a former girl friend. Finally, the court instructed the jury that evidence of Kelly\u2019s character for violence was admissible for the purpose of showing Kelly acted in conformity with such character and was the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Defendant contends he was denied a fair trial because he was precluded from presenting all the evidence about the circumstances of the subsequent acts of violence by Kelly. He asserts that the excluded evidence would have shown Kelly had a character for violence and had a tendency to attack, without reason, people who had befriended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Evidence Code section 1103<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes the defense in a criminal case to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s character to prove his conduct at the time of the charged crime.  Consequently, in a prosecution for a homicide or an assaultive crime where self-defense is raised, evidence of the violent character<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the victim is admissible to show that the victim was the aggressor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1968) 262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Cal.App.2d 790, 797 [69 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 395, 404-405 [57 Cal.Rptr. 508].)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">As the <em>Rowland </em>court explained, \u201c[b]efore the Evidence Code, the character trait could be shown by reputation evidence, but not by evidence of specific acts of the victim on third persons. [Citations.] It is now permissible under section 1103 of the Evidence Code to prove the aggressive and violent character by specific acts of the victim on third persons. [Citation.]\u201d (262 Cal.App.2d at p. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">All of the decisions relating to character evidence of violence have dealt with prior, rather than <em>subsequent, </em>acts of aggression by the alleged victim. (See e.g., <em>Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531, 534 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305] (\u201cexcessive force on previous occasions\u201d); <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 82, 89 [162 Cal.Rptr. 82] (\u201cpast assaultive behavior\u201d); <em>Kelvin L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 823, 828 [133 Cal.Rptr. 325] (\u201cprior acts of unwarranted or excessive violence\u201d); <em>Engstrom </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 240, 245 [97 Cal.Rptr. 484] (\u201cprior acts of violence or assaultive conduct\u201d).) The Attorney General notes that the Law Revision Commission, in its historical comment to Evidence Code sections 1102 and 1103, referred to \u201cprior acts.\u201d Relying upon this decisional history and that comment the Attorney General reasons that \u201conly instances of <em>prior </em>conduct are those that come within the meaning of section 1103, since subsequent conduct to prove a trait of character would be irrelevant as not tending to demonstrate conformity of conduct with such trait on an earlier occasion.\u201d (Italics in original.) We find that reasoning incongruent. As Wigmore astutely observed, the time of character evidence \u201c.. . as a question of Relevancy, is simple enough .... Character at an earlier or later <em>time </em>than that of the deed in question is relevant only on the assumption that it was substantially unchanged in the meantime, <em>i.e. </em>the offer is really of character at one period to prove character at another, and the real question is of relevancy of this evidence to prove character, not of the character to prove the act.\u201d (1 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 60, p. 463; italics in original.) He then concluded that \u201c. .. there is no difficulty from the point of view of the relevancy of character; a man\u2019s trait or disposition a month or a year after a certain date is as evidential of his trait on that date as his nature a month or a year before that date; because character is a more or less permanent quality and we may make inferences from it either forward or backward.\u201d (5 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ed. 1974) \u00a7 1618, p. 595.) We find Wigmore\u2019s views compelling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore hold that evidence of the victim\u2019s subsequent acts of violence, when offered by the defendant in a criminal case, is relevant and admissible under section 1103 to prove the victim\u2019s violent character at the time of the earlier crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">As the trial court recognized, section 352 permits it to exclude evidence if in the court\u2019s discretion \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Like all proffered evidence, character evidence is subject to exclusion under that section. (See e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Covino </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 660, 666 [161 Cal.Rptr. 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Defendant acknowledges the prosecution is accorded the same protection that the defense enjoys from the use of prejudicial evidence having little probative value. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Love </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 928, 939 [142 Cal.Rptr. 532]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrow </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 984, 994-995 [131 Cal.Rptr. 913]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arline </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 200, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>205 [91 Cal.Rptr. 520].) But he urges, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Reeder </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 543, 553 [147 Cal.Rptr. 275], that section 352 \u201cmust bow to the due process right of a defendant to a fair trial and to his right to present all relevant evidence of significant probative value to his defense.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Defendant claims, in light of his own testimony someone struck him on the head for no reason, he needed to prove Kelly\u2019s tendency to act violently without provocation. Evidence of the circumstances surrounding Kelly\u2019s alleged attack on the elderly couple would, it is urged, bolster defendant\u2019s theory and support his contention Kelly attacked him in the bedroom. Defendant argues testimony of the attack on the elderly victims was of a qualitatively different nature than the other evidence of Kelly\u2019s previous attacks on his ex-spouse and girl friend. The subsequent attack was on strangers to Kelly in a nondomestic context. Thus, it was more akin to Kelly\u2019s alleged assault on defendant in this case. A comparison of the subsequent attack with Kelly\u2019s earlier assaults, defendant asserts, demonstrates that the subsequent character evidence was not cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Absent a clear showing of abuse, we are compelled to uphold the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 352. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barrow, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d at p. 995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We discern no such abuse here. Two defense witnesses testified Kelly was a violent, dangerous person who had committed prior assaults. The jury learned of the charges Kelly faced arising from the alleged assault on the elderly couple, and that Kelly had two prior assault convictions. The court instructed the jury it could consider evidence of Kelly\u2019s violent character on the issue of whether he was the aggressor in the fight with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Under these circumstances, the trial court could reasonably find, as it did, that the prejudicial impact of testimony by the victims of Kelly\u2019s alleged assault would far outweigh whatever minimal probative value the testimony had. In light of the multiplicity of charges against Kelly, and the fact he had not yet been tried, undue consumption of time, as well as confusion of the issues and the jury, was substantially certain to result. Moreover, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the testimony was in fact cumulative. The jury had already been presented with ample evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>dence of Kelly\u2019s character for violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d at pp. 403-405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We agree with defendant that he has a due process right to present evidence material to his defense so long as the evidence is of significant probative value. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reeder, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.3d at p. 553.) However, as the <em>Reeder </em>court emphasized, a defendant has no constitutional right \u201cto present all relevant evidence in his favor, no matter how limited in probative value such evidence will be so as to preclude the trial court from using Evidence Code section 352.\u201d (Ibid.) We cannot say the court abused its discretion when it ruled the testimony of the subsequent assault was so different from the facts of the present case that its probative value was \u201crelatively slight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Moreover, in light of the abundant evidence presented that Kelly was a violent person, any error (and we find none) in the failure to admit testimony of the subsequent incident could not be prejudicial to defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d at p. 405.) Defendant\u2019s damning admissions to his neighbor and the police constitute overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Thus, any conceivable error depriving defendant of a due process right to present this character evidence would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Puglia, P.

(See Model Code of Evidence, rule 304, com. (1942); see also 1 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 52, p. 446.) As Witkin notes, \u201c[t]here are <em>different traits of character </em>and the evidence must relate to the particular trait involved.\u201d (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) Circumstantial Evidence, \u00a7 321, p. 285; italics in original.) The trait involved here is for violence and that violent trait has been variously depicted as bloodthirsty, dangerous, revengeful and turbulent.
