His attorney argued that the facts of the crime and petitioner\u2019s prior criminal record justified such a reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">After the prosecutor argued against the motion, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Staley [Defense Counsel], if the court made it a misdemeanor under Section 17, is the defendant going to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201cMr. Staley: Not at this time, your Honor. I would point out October 1st was a Thursday. It was in approximately in the middle of the week, Thursday morning. Court\u2019s already heard the testimony concerning the residential use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Any other defense or motions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u201cMr. Staley: No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I will deny the motion to make it a Section 17.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Petitioner was held to answer for felony burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Petitioner moved respondent court to set aside the information upon the ground, inter alia, that he was illegally committed because the magistrate inquired whether he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Review by writ of mandate is proper. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519, 529 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941].)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 174 [167 Cal.Rptr. 749] the magistrate expressly stated that he would grant the defendant\u2019s motion to reduce a felony charge to a misdemeanor if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>defendant would plead guilty to the reduced charge, but otherwise would deny the motion. The reviewing court held that a magistrate may not condition the exercise of his judicial discretion to reduce the offense to a misdemeanor upon the entry of a plea of guilty by the defendant. In doing so, the court relied upon <em>In re Lewallen </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 274 [152 Cal.Rptr. 528, 590 P.2d 383, 100 A.L.R.3d 823], and <em>Esteybar </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 119 [95 Cal.Rptr. 524, 485 P.2d 1140],</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><em>Lewallen </em>holds that the fact of conviction upon a plea of not guilty is \u201ccompletely irrelevant at sentencing; if a judge bases a sentence, or any aspect thereof, on the fact that such a plea is entered, error has been committed and the sentence cannot stand.\u201d (23 Cal.3d at p. 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Esteybar </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 119, 125 states, \u201cIn determining whether a defendant should be held to answer on a felony or a misdemeanor, a committing magistrate exercises a judicial power which must be based upon an examination of the circumstances of the particular case before him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In this case, the magistrate did not expressly condition the exercise of his discretion upon petitioner\u2019s willingness to plead guilty to a misdemeanor; however, the magistrate inferably considered petitioner\u2019s willingness to plead guilty in exercising his discretion to reduce the charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The circumstances of the case within the meaning of <em>Esteybar </em>do not include petitioner\u2019s intent to exercise his constitutional right to stand trial upon the misdemeanor if Penal Code section 17 relief is granted. Such an intent is as irrelevant to the charge reduction issue before the magistrate in this case as a not guilty plea to sentencing after conviction. (See <em>In re Lewallen, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 274, 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Furthermore, the magistrate\u2019s inquiry as to petitioner\u2019s intent to plead guilty gives rise to one or more of the following appearances of impropriety: (1) judicial discretion was being exercised to encourage and/or coerce a guilty plea; (2) petitioner was penalized by an adverse ruling upon his motion to reduce the charge for exercising his constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tional right to thereafter stand trial; and (3) the municipal court\u2019s future trial calendar was a factor in the exercise of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Therefore, we hold that the magistrate\u2019s inquiry regarding petitioner\u2019s intent to plead guilty was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Respondent court erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to set aside the information. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.3d 174, 177-178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the Kern County Superior Court to vacate its order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside information No. 22885 and to enter a new order granting said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The stay order issued by this court on April 23, 1982, shall remain in effect until all acts herein directed have been performed, this decision is final in all courts, or the Supreme Court grants a hearing herein, whichever may first occur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-14\"> Before Zenovich, Acting P. J., Hanson (P. D.), J., and Martin, J.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Afd\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-15\"> Defense counsel stated, \u201cAsk the court to look at the court\u2019s record, which ought to be attached somewhere in the court\u2019s file. Because it is my understanding, either no record or minimal record at all for some type of driving under the influence a number of years ago. No theft related offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\"> The magistrate presumably would not elicit information about a guilty plea unless he considered it relevant to the motion before him for decision. The question was asked immediately prior to the ruling on the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
