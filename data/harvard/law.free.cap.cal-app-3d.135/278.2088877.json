The superior court reached a contrary conclusion, ordered the Commission to discharge Harris and required repayment of attorney fees. Harris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Harris taught Spanish and English as a permanent certificated employee of the District. Beginning in 1976 she was absent intermittently from her teaching duties due to various serious illnesses of her young son, her mother and herself. Harris\u2019 absences totaled some 21 percent of all work days for the preceding four school years: 22 days in 1976-1977; 54 days in 1977-1978; 38 1/2 days in 1978-1979; 33 1/2 days in 1979-1980. The parties stipulated at the hearing before the Commission and on the record on appeal these absences were \u201cfor reasons considered legitimate under District policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On May 8, 1980, the Governing Board of the District gave Harris written notice of dismissal after it had found by a majority vote that cause existed for her dismissal under Education Code section 44932, subdivision (e) (evident unfitness for service) and section 44932, subdivision (g) (persistent violation of or refusal to obey \u201cschool laws or reasonable regulations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">At Harris\u2019 request a four-day evidentiary hearing was held before the Commission. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 44944, subd. (b).) There was little dispute over the facts of Harris\u2019 absences. The conflict arose over the effect of the absences and Harris\u2019 alleged violation of the rules governing preparation and provision of lesson plans for substitute teachers. Harris\u2019 supervisors, testifying for the District, said the absences had a disruptive effect on the students. Two substitute teachers out of sixteen who had filled in for Harris said they could not find lesson plans on Harris\u2019 desk when they substituted for her. One of the substitutes (Oversmith) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>said Harris\u2019 lesson plans were provided only three or four times of the seventeen times she substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Beginning in 1977 Harris received numerous written and oral warnings from her superiors of the negative effects of her absences. Harris testified she had not noticed any problems with the students due to her absences and said she had always provided lessons for substitutes as required by school policy. She admitted her plans were sometimes not received by the substitutes but this was due to a breakdown in the District\u2019s system of substitute teacher preparation. Harris stated she had never received complaints upon her return to school about the missing lesson plans. Harris said the frequent illnesses in her family appeared to be over and she did not anticipate further difficulty in her attendance at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Several fellow teachers were called as her witnesses. One coworker testified he had excessive absences over the past several years due to family illnesses and had not received memos from the administration nor had termination proceedings been initiated against him. Other witnesses testified substitute teachers could, if properly qualified, carry on proper classroom continuity and Harris\u2019 teaching performance was satisfactory. The Commission unanimously decided cause for dismissal was not established. The Commission recommended the District hire a stand-in substitute in case of further absences by Harris and ordered payment of her attorney fees. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 44944, subd. (e).) The District petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate to set aside the Commission\u2019s decision. The superior court judge disagreed with the Commission and found that the District did have cause for dismissal. This determination was made upon the identical factual base used by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The decision of the Commission may be challenged in the superior court by means of a petition for writ of mandate. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 44945; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.)  In reviewing a Commission\u2019s decision for either the governing board or the employee the superior court shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 44945.) An appellate court must sustain the superior court\u2019s finding if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Commission on Professional Competence </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 309, 314 [142 Cal.Rptr. 439, 572 P.2d 53].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The first ground for Harris\u2019 dismissal was \u201cevident unfitness\u201d for service.  The applicable standard or determinative test in a teacher discharge case is whether the person is fit to teach. <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Professional Competence </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 555, 560 [162 Cal.Rptr. 590].) Fitness to teach is probably a question of ultimate fact. (See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Jack M. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 691, 698, fn. 3 [139 Cal.Rptr. 700, 566 P.2d 602].) In <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Jack M., supra, </em>the Supreme Court delineates the process for determining fitness. This objective and analytical approach to determining fitness to teach was first enunciated in <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 214 [82 Cal.Rptr. 175, 461 P.2d 375], where it was held that a discharged teacher is entitled to a fitness hearing. The hearing reviews the teacher\u2019s conduct <em>and </em>several factors: (1) likelihood of recurrence of the questioned conduct; (2) extenuating or aggravating circumstances; (3) effect of notoriety and publicity; (4) impairment of teacher-student relationships; (5) disruption of the education process; (6) motive; and (7) proximity or remoteness in time of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Morrison </em>discussed (at p. 235) fitness to teach in the context of credential revocation: \u201c[A]n individual can be removed from the teaching profession only upon a showing that his retention in the profession poses a significant danger of harm to either students, school employees, or others who might be affected by his actions as a teacher.\u201d In <em>Oakland Unified Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Olicker </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1108 [102 Cal.Rptr. 421], the appeal court said: \u201cWe observe, moreover, that the term \u2018evident unfitness for service\u2019 should not be given a definite technical meaning and that a court should not arbitrarily find that it is subsumed under some set formula. [Citation.] In applying the standard due consideration must be given to the circumstances of the case at hand. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Morrison </em>is followed by the California courts for good reason. In the absence of a consideration of all the evidence and a reflection of the factual base on which to apply the <em>Morrison </em>standards, the trial court\u2019s finding becomes little more than an abstract moral judgment. For example, the <em>Morrison </em>court said: \u201cIn using [the terms \u2018immoral or unprofessional conduct\u2019] the Legislature surely did not mean to endow the employing agency with the power to dismiss any employee whose personal private conduct incurred its disapproval.\u201d <em>(Morrison, supra, </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 225.) Without the <em>Morrison </em>standards \u201cevident unfitness to teach\u201d would be vulnerable to such a broad application virtually every teacher in the state could be subject to discipline and discharge. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Judge </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 920, 929 [123 Cal.Rptr. 830], it was said: \u201cThere must be a nexus between the teacher\u2019s conduct and his usefulness to the school district.\u201d And as was said in <em>Hostetter </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>38 Cal.2d 499, 504, \u201cpersonal fault [of the absent public employee] does not appear to be the primary consideration [in a discharge decision].\u201d Rather, the absences are important only insofar as they affect the efficiency of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In <em>Rankins </em>v. <em>Commission on Professional Competence </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 167 [154 Cal.Rptr. 907, 593 P.2d 852], Byars had been discharged for excessive absences. When he was absent, his class was taught by a substitute teacher for whom he had prepared a detailed lesson plan and the same substitute was employed in most absences. The commission found that none of his absences had a substantial detrimental effect on the educational program and the district\u2019s denial of his request for permission to be absent together with its threats of discharge interfered with his free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court said: \u201cAccordingly the merits of the district\u2019s claim of undue hardship must turn on whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding, contrary to that of the commission, that Byars\u2019 absences and his replacement by substitutes had a substantial detrimental effect on the educational program of the district. .. . Though there is evidence that instruction by a regular teacher is generally preferable to instruction by a substitute, such evidence falls short of showing that Byars\u2019 absences for five to ten holy days a year imposed a hardship sufficiently severe to warrant disqualifying him from employment as a teacher. By statute each teacher is allowed at least 10 days of paid leave each year for illness or \u2018personal necessity.\u2019 (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 44978, 44981.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Particularly enlightening is <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ritenour, etc. </em>(Mo. 1978) 574 S.W.2d 471, in which a teacher was absent for 124 days before March 20 during the 1973-1974 school year. The district allowed teachers to accumulate up to 180 days of sick leave but the teacher exceeded her accumulated sick leave by 28.5 days. The court pointed out numbers alone did not establish the absences were excessive. \u201cThis is true in spite of the fact that substitute teachers had to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>hired to take her place, a condition which was certainly foreseeable when the board adopted its liberal, open-ended policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 474.) The court said: \u201cThe board, under the law and its own policy, cannot here be sustained in its conclusion that Miss Stewart\u2019s absences were excessive on the strength of their duration alone.\u201d Thus <em>Ritenour </em>considers whether absences are reasonable or unreasonable when defining excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Finally in <em>Governing Board of the Oakdale Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Seaman </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77 [104 Cal.Rptr. 64, 104 Cal.Rptr. 527], the appellate court found the teacher\u2019s unauthorized absence for one month did not constitute a persistent violation of school laws and regulations although the teacher took the absence without approval of the school board. The court stated: \u201cThis is not a case where it is reasonable to say that Mrs. Seaman\u2019s absence, by its very duration, amounted to a \u2018persistent\u2019 violation of the governing board\u2019s rules. [Citation.] Nor can it fairly be said from the evidence presented that the teacher was motivated by an attitude of continuous insubordination. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 81-82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In the present case the trial court concluded Harris\u2019 absences were of such frequency and nature as to show evident unfitness pursuant to Education Code section 44932, subdivision (e). This conclusion rests upon this nonsupportive base: Harris\u2019 absences were stipulated to be \u201cfor reasons considered legitimate under District policy.\u201d Her absences consisted of sick leave, personal leave and leave without pay and other recognized categories of legitimate absence. The trial court was presented with undisputed facts the absences upon which the District formed the basis for removal were considered legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Second, the trial court\u2019s conclusion Harris be dismissed as \u201cunfit to teach\u201d did not result from an evaluation of Harris\u2019 conduct in light of the seven <em>Morrison </em>criteria. In determining unfitness the trial court must conduct a careful and reasoned inquiry and base its decision on all of the evidence, not a single act alone. <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Professional Competence, supra, </em>102 Cal.App.3d 555, 561.) The trial court considered only the frequency and duration of Harris\u2019 absences, failed to consider all of the evidence presented to the Commission, and did not analyze the various factors suggested by <em>Morrison </em>for determining fitness. The uncontradicted evidence is that Etarris is a satisfactory teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The District by its stipulation has precluded the charge that Harris\u2019 absences are unreasonable. Here the District stipulated the policy regarding absences had not been violated. The District did in fact deduct from Harris\u2019 pay after she had used up her sick leave. The school system assumes a teacher will on occasion be absent and provides for competent substitutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The trial court further erred in its reliance upon inappropriate case law in determining Harris was unfit to teach. The trial court relied upon the authorities cited in 78 A.L.R.3d 117 for support of its conclusion of unfitness. However, this article deals with <em>unauthorized </em>absences which usually involve wilfulness and defiance of school rules and policies. Here Harris\u2019 absences were legitimate under District policy and could not therefore be wilful, defiant or unauthorized. (See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coffeeville Consolidated School Dist. </em>365 F.Supp. 990, relied upon by the trial court, where the absences were without reason and the dismissal was for wilful violation of the rules.) In light of the concession by the board that Harris\u2019 absences were authorized without evidence of the necessary nexus between the absences and unfitness the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding of fact\u2014unfitness to teach\u2014is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The trial court also found Harris guilty of persistent violation of, or refusal to obey, the rules of the District by not preparing adequate and timely lesson plans for substitute teachers. Two of sixteen substitutes complained of this lack. In the cases where a teacher has been dismissed for persistent failure to obey rules the acts have been clearly wilful.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Here the factual basis underlying the charge of failure to submit lesson plans for substitute teachers does not demonstrate wilfulness as a matter of law. Harris offered lengthy explanations about the difficulty of submitting lesson plans when suddenly her illness or that of her family prevented notification in advance or preparation for such contingencies. Without question a persistent refusal to prepare lesson plans for substitute teachers, viewed in light of the number of absences Harris was experiencing, might be sufficient to constitute \u201cpersistent violation ... of school rules\u201d within the meaning of Education Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>44932, subdivision (g). (See <em>Governing Board of the Oakdale Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Seaman, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 77, 82-83; <em>Evard </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 745 [149 P.2d 413]; <em>Buss </em>v. J. <em>O. Martin Co. </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 123, 134 [50 Cal.Rptr. 206]; <em>Midway School Dist. </em>v. <em>Griffeath </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 13 [172 P.2d 857], for decisions defining the term \u201cpersistent\u201d in the teacher discharge context.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The findings show the trial court relied solely upon the number of absences to constitute unfitness. This conclusion is demonstrably incorrect, yet we are unable on this record to say as matter of law that Harris\u2019 failure to prepare lesson plans was not a ground for discharge under the statute and judicial interpretation of the critical language; therefore remand for further proceedings on this issue is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Upon remand these premises must be established to avoid future error. The basic defect in the first charge was the trial court\u2019s failure to consider all the evidence and to establish a factual nexus between Harris\u2019 absences and unfitness to teach. So also must a persistent failure to supply lesson plans be connected by the evidence to, and warrant the ultimate conclusion of, unfitness to teach.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The Commission is a legislatively mandated professional body, with experience and expertise in the area of determining fitness to teach. This body, including one member appointed by the board and one neutral member, determined after an extensive factual hearing with an opportunity to see, hear and evaluate the veracity of the witnesses that cause was not established to discharge Harris on either of the two grounds asserted. Such factual finding is entitled to substantial weight even in an \u201cindependent judgment\u201d hearing before the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s conclusions of unfitness must be based upon an objective standard such as that articulated in <em>Morrison. </em>The <em>Morrison </em>standard gives substance to the tenured teacher\u2019s right to be discharged only for cause. If the <em>Morrison </em>standards are not applied, the teacher is left essentially at the mercy of the Board (or the trial court) to be discharged whenever cause exists in the subjective estimation of either body. Such a procedure would make a shambles out of the tenure and job security now enjoyed by teaching employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Judgment reversed and the order for reimbursement of attorney fees is vacated; the cause is remanded for further proceedings conformable to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Cologne, Acting P. J., and Work, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 16, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Education Code section 44944, subdivision (b), provides for the appointment of a three-member Commission on Professional Competence to conduct a hearing to determine whether cause exists for a school district to dismiss a public school employee. The State Office of Administrative Procedure appoints one member, a hearing officer who chairs the hearing; the Governing Board of the District selects a second member; and the employee chooses a third. The latter two members must hold currently valid teaching credentials and must have at least five years\u2019 experience in employee disciplinary matters within the last ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
