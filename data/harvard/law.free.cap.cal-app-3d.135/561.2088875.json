Harn, to produce hospital records pertaining to four unnamed patients. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Appellant, the Division of Medical Quality, is responsible for reviewing the quality of the medical practice in the State of California, and instituting, if necessary, disciplinary actions against physicians and surgeons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7 2004.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">As required by section 805,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> respondent hospital reported to appellant that it had revoked the clinical and admitting privileges of Dr. B. on February 20, 1980. This \u201c805\u201d report listed the following six reasons for the action: (1) In the past three years, there had been three separate cases of \u201cinappropriate medical care,\u201d and as a result of one of them in October of 1977, Dr. B. lost his privileges to attend patients in the intensive care and coronary care units; (2) in November of 1977, Dr. B.\u2019s emergency room privileges were withdrawn; (3) in January of 1979, his privileges in surgery, obstetrics and medicine were restricted; (4) during the past three years Dr. B. had two \u201csyncopal\u201d (fainting) attacks while assisting in surgery; (5) as a consequence of the attacks and his age, Dr. B. was requested by the hospital to undergo a complete physical and neurological examination, but as of February 1980, he had not complied with that request; and (6) a recent case of \u201cinappropriate medical judgment and care\u201d resulted in the revocation of Dr. B.\u2019s clinical and admitting privileges in February of 1980. The \u201c805\u201d report did not identify the four patients who had received the inappropriate medical care from Dr. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>After receipt of the report, appellant began to investigate the circumstances surrounding the hospital\u2019s action with respect to Dr. B. After appellant\u2019s investigator failed in his attempt to secure additional information from the hospital administrator, he served an investigational subpoena duces tecum on respondent Harn, commanding him to produce: \u201c1. The three patient charts containing evidence of inappropriate medical care by [Dr. B.], M.D., which resulted in the loss of his privileges to attend patients in ICU/CCU on 10-13-77\u201d and \u201c2. The patient chart which indicated inappropriate medical judgment and care by [Dr. B.], M.D., resulting in the revocation of his clinical and admitting privileges on 2-20-80.\u201d Attached to the subpoena was the investigator\u2019s declaration which: (a) stated that he was conducting an investigation of Dr. B. involving an allegation of inappropriate medical treatment of four patients over the past three years; (b) set forth the contents of the \u201c805\u201d report, and the refusal of Harn to supply the necessary information; and (c) stated \u201c[ijnasmuch as we have no independent knowledge of the facts surrounding the actions\u201d taken against the physician by the hospital, \u201cwe must have the patient records to determine whether or not a violation of the Medical Practices Act exists. [IT] The activities, if confirmed, are violations of the Business and Professions Code . . . Section 2361(b) (gross negligence) and 2361(d) (incompetence).\u201d Finally, the declaration noted that it was impossible for appellant to obtain consent from the patients because their identities would not be disclosed by the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">After Harn refused to produce the records, appellant filed a petition for an order compelling respondents to testify and produce papers and records. (See, Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11186-11188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">After a hearing, the superior court denied the petition. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The sole question is whether appellant\u2019s showing before the superior court was sufficient to require the issuance of an order compelling compliance with the subpoena. It was.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Our starting point is <em>Brovelli </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 524, 529 [15 Cal.Rptr. 630, 364 P.2d 462], which sets forth a threefold test for subpoenas issued by administrative agencies: (1) the inquiry must be one that the agency demanding production is authorized to make; (2) the demand must not be too indefinite; and (3) the information sought must be relevant. (See also <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Molino </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 46, 54 [162 Cal.Rptr. 786].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">There is no question but that the inquiry by appellant is one that it is authorized to make. (See \u00a7\u00a7 101.6, 108; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11180 et seq.) Nor can it be said that the demand is too indefinite. On the contrary, the demand was specific, limited, and in the same language respondent hospital had employed in its \u201c805\u201d report which had triggered the investigation. Finally, the relevancy of the charts is equally apparent: appellant\u2019s determination of whether to instigate disciplinary action against Dr. B. would hinge upon an analysis of his medical treatment of the four patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">When an investigative subpoena seeks production of individually identifiable medical records the demanding agency must also demonstrate that the right of privacy of the patient is protected. <em>(Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Gherardini </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669, 679 [156 Cal.Rptr. 55].) \u201cThe state of a person\u2019s gastro-intestinal tract is as much entitled to privacy from unauthorized ... bureaucratic snooping as is that person\u2019s bank account, the contents of his library or his membership in the NAACP.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>However, this additional privacy safeguard was not infringed here because neither disclosure of the patients\u2019 identities nor disclosure of identifying medical information was requested. Appellant merely sought the unnamed charts of four of Dr. B.\u2019s patients. No further showing was required of appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Respondents\u2019 sole remaining argument, that compelling production of the four charts would violate the physician-patient privilege, fails in the face of Evidence Code section 1007 which provides: \u201cThere is no privilege under this article in <em>a proceeding </em>brought by a public entity to determine whether a right, authority, license, or privilege . .. should be revoked, suspended, terminated, limited, or conditioned.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because testimony can be compelled in appellant\u2019s investigation of Dr. B. (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 11181, subd. (e)), it is a \u201cproceeding.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 901.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the physician-patient privilege does not apply to this investigative \u201cproceeding\u201d conducted by appellant to determine whether Dr. B.\u2019s license \u201cshould be revoked, suspended, terminated, limited, or conditioned.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1007.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In sum, appellant\u2019s showing before the superior court was, as a matter of law, sufficient to require the issuance of an order compelling compliance with the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the superior court for proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Caldecott, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-11\"> The Board of Medical Quality Assurance is a state agency within the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>of Consumer Affairs. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2001.) The board is composed of three divisions: (1) the Division of Medical Quality, (2) the Division of Licensing, and (3) the Division of Allied Health Professions.

[11] Failure to make a report pursuant to this section shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than six hundred dollars ($600).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> In light of this holding, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the Legislature\u2019s action in making appellant\u2019s investigatory action confidential (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6254, subd. (f)) is sufficient, as a matter of law, to protect the patient\u2019s privacy interest as delineated in <em>Gherardini.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> Evidence Code section 1007 is located in article 6 of chapter 4 of division 8 of the Evidence Code, which is entitled \u201cPhysician-Patient Privilege.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> Evidence Code section 901 defines a \u201c [proceeding\u201d as \u201cany action, hearing, <em>investigation, </em>inquest, or inquiry (whether conducted by a court, administrative agency, hearing officer, arbitrator, legislative body, or any other person authorized by law) in which, pursuant to law, testimony can be compelled to be given.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> We do not read <em>Gherardini </em>to hold otherwise, although the opinion\u2019s final paragraph is troublesome: \u201cBy interposition of such minimal due process requirements the mandate of <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>[(1967) 389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507]]; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>[(1965) 381 U.S. 479 [14 L.Ed.2d 510, 85 S.Ct. 1678]], and article I, section 1, of the California Constitution will be fulfilled <em>and Evidence Code section 1007 held constitutional.\u201d (Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Gherardini, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at pp. 681-682, italics <em>added.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">There is no constitutional provision that we know of which would prohibit a so inclined Legislature from totally abolishing the physician-patient privilege. Nor is there any constitutional prohibition against abolishing the privilege in certain instances, such as the Legislature has done by enacting Evidence Code section 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Therefore, we interpret <em>Gherardini </em>as holding that where the patient\u2019s right of privacy is coterminous with the physician-patient privilege, Evidence Code section 1007 cannot be read to destroy both.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
