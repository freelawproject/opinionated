Sandra Smith filed a petition to dissolve her marriage to Leland Smith. Contrary to law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sandra herself handed the summons and petition to Leland. Sandra\u2019s mother executed the return of service filed with the clerk. Leland\u2019s default was entered and the court granted Sandra an interlocutory decree and later a final decree of dissolution. The decrees ordered Leland to make child support payments to Sandra.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Five months later, Sandra filed a notice of motion to increase child support payments and obtained an order directing Leland to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failure to obey the child support orders previously made. She had these properly served upon Leland. Leland filed a motion to quash the service of summons upon him and to set aside his default and the interlocutory and final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>merits. Leland\u2019s attorney appeared in court on the date set for Sandra\u2019s motions and requested a continuance in order to prepare defenses to <em>both </em>motions. The court granted the continuance. Leland\u2019s attorney also noticed and took Sandra\u2019s deposition and served notice of taking the deposition of the custodian of Sandra\u2019s employment records pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The trial court granted Leland\u2019s motion to quash service of summons upon him and set aside Leland\u2019s default and the interlocutory and final judgments of dissolution. Sandra appeals from this order, contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">1. Leland\u2019s request for a continuance of Sandra\u2019s motion to increase support, his taking her deposition, and noticing the custodian\u2019s deposition pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum each were acts constituting a general appearance which retroactively made valid the defective service of summons upon Leland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">2. The superior court had a constitutionally proper basis of jurisdiction over Leland pursuant to section 410.10<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because Leland\u2019s general appearance was a consent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person from the time of the defective attempt to serve him with summons or, alternatively, a waiver of his right to have the service declared void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">3. Section 473.5 bars Leland\u2019s motion to quash because the service of summons, although void, gave Leland actual notice of the pendency of the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">We conclude California\u2019s Jurisdiction and Service of Process Act of 1969 preempted the subjects of jurisdiction and service of process and clearly rejected the rule that a defendant\u2019s general appearance after entry of a default judgment against him based upon a void service of summons retroactively makes valid that void service.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">We also conclude that the term \u201cbasis\u201d in reference to jurisdiction in section 410.10 does not refer to the service of process or potice and therefore section 410.10 does not support Sandra\u2019s second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">We reiterate that section 473.5 does not govern a default or default judgment obtained through a fraudulent return of service of summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\n<em>The Waiver Rule and the Retroactive Validity of Void Service of Summons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">That Leland\u2019s request for a continuance to defend against Sandra\u2019s support motion was a general appearance is not contested. (See <em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Zobel </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 98 [90 P. 191].) Sandra relies upon <em>Farmers, etc. Nat. Bk. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 842 [155 P.2d 823], for the rule that: \u201c[A] general appearance made after entry of judgment has the effect of curing any defect arising from the lack of jurisdiction due to the failure to serve or notify a person of the proceedings [citations], and a judgment based upon such an appearance is valid.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 846-847.) This seems to have been the judge-made rule in California at that time and although it was stated in <em>Farmers </em>and in five other California cases, it was necessary to the court\u2019s decision only in <em>Security etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston etc. Co. </em>(1899) 126 Cal. 418 [58 P. 941 ]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (hereafter <em>Security).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Inasmuch as the rule in <em>Security </em>is vital to our consideration of the case at bar, we shall examine <em>Security </em>and the history of the rule upon which Sandra relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In <em>Security </em>plaintiff served the nonresident defendant by publication, took its default and judgment, and sold certain property pursuant to the judgment. Defendant filed a special appearance, moving to quash service of summons on the hypertechnical ground that the affidavit supporting service by publication omitted to mention that defendant had no agent for service of process in California. Another asserted ground was that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The Supreme Court held (at p. 422) that the asserted ground, failure to state a cause of action, constituted a demurrer and general appearance, resulting in \u201c\u2018a submission to the jurisdiction of the court as completely as if he had been regularly served with process, .. citing 2 Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice, page 625, and affirmed the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The <em>Security </em>court cited four cases to support its position, all of which state the rule quoted. But only one of them, <em>Burdette </em>v. <em>Corgan </em>(1881) 26 Kan. 102, held that a general appearance <em>after </em>judgment deprived defendant of the right to challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>person and made personal jurisdiction retroactive to the date of the irregular service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The authorities relied upon by the court in <em>Security </em>demonstrate that the decision is a confluence of two lines of cases: one line holds that a general appearance by an unserved or improperly served defendant is equivalent to personal service so that the court has personal jurisdiction throughout <em>subsequent </em>proceedings in the action. The second line holds that a defendant\u2019s general appearance, either before or after judgment, retroactively makes valid a defective service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The treatise cited in <em>Security, </em>2 Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice, at page 625, refers to the first line of cases. It cites <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Stringham </em>(1861) 14 Wis. 241 as the \u201cReason of the Rule\u201d quoted in <em>Security. </em>That reason is to preclude a defendant from litigating an action to a conclusion and later, if dissatisfied, urging lack of personal jurisdiction over him. This \u201cReason of the Rule\u201d is obviously inapplicable to a case where judgment has already been entered. (See <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Freeman Nat\u2019l Printing Equip. Co. </em>(1977) 51 Ill.App.3d 581, 586-587 [366 N.E.2d 1015].)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">It seems incongruous that <em>Security </em>ignored that section of the cited treatise which discussed the validation of void judgments by subsequent appearance. (See 2 Encyc. P. &amp; P. pp. 655-656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The second, or \u201cretroactive waiver,\u201d line of cases came to <em>Security </em>via <em>Burdette </em>v. <em>Corgan, supra, 26 </em>Kan. 102. <em>Burdette </em>relied upon four cases for its holding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Only one of them<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> involved defendant\u2019s general appearance <em>after </em>judgment. But three of them say that a general appearance constitutes a retroactive <em>waiver </em>of defects in service of process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A review of these and the numerous other cases in the retroactive waiver line of cases all lead back to <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1840) 42 Mass. 508. The development of this line of cases illustrates the dangers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of legal categorization and that in law as, \u201c[i]n all aspects of life, ... we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In law we speak of \u201ccategories\u201d or \u201cconcepts\u201d rather than metaphors.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>42 Mass. 508, service on defendant was defective. Nevertheless, defendant demurred, his demurrer was overruled, judgment was entered and defendant appealed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When the case was called for <em>trial, </em>defendant moved to quash. The court invoked the doctrine of waiver to hold the motion was not timely. The court observed that waiver is an equitable doctrine requiring diligence and good faith, meant to avoid injustice. The case implies the defendant still had his right to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The waiver metaphor was employed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court which relied on <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>42 Mass. 508, as authority in <em>Upper Mississippi Transportation Company </em>v. <em>Whittaker </em>(1862) 16 Wis. 233, to hold a general appearance <em>before </em>judgment \u201c[w]as an appearance, an unqualified <em>waiver </em>of previous defects in the service of process.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 236, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>Grander </em>v. <em>Rosecrance, supra, </em>27 Wis. 488, appears to be the first case to apply the waiver metaphor to a general appearance <em>after </em>default judgment, citing <em>Upper Mississippi Transportation Company </em>v. <em>Whittaker, supra, </em>16 Wis. 233; then <em>Burdette </em>v. <em>Corgan, supra, </em>26 Kan. 102, relied upon <em>Grander, </em>and then <em>Security, supra, </em>126 Cal. at pages 422-423, relied upon Burdette; and here we are\u2014as fine an example as possible of the quotation above concerning metaphors and how unreflecting use of legal concepts leads to unintended results. The rule began as an aid to justice and became one of automatic application, a trap for attorneys who find it difficult to predict safely what the next judge will call a \u201cgeneral appearance,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> depriving unwary defendants of \u201c\u2018The fundamental requisite of due process of law ... the opportunity to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>heard.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Having lost sight of the purpose of the rule, later cases justify it as necessary to avoid inconsistency. <em>(Burdette </em>v. <em>Corgan, supra, </em>26 Kan. 102; <em>Gilbert-Arnold Land Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hare, supra, </em>93 Wis. 194.) \u201cThe reason which gave rise to the rule has been forgotten, ... Some ground of policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career.\u201d (Holmes, The Common Law (1963) p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Recognizing the rule to be harsh, several California cases have criticized or avoided it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In no case was the issue raised whether the rule of the <em>Security </em>case was rejected by the Jurisdiction and Service of Process Act of 1969. But for that Act, we would be governed in this case by the <em>Security </em>rule. We requested briefs on this issue and Sandra has responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\n<em>The Jurisdiction and Service of Process Act of 1969 Preempted Those Subjects</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In 1969, the California Legislature passed the Jurisdiction and Service of Process Act, Code of Civil Procedure sections 410.10-418.10 (the Act). (See Stats. 1969, ch. 1610, \u00a7\u00a7 3-30 and ch. 1611, \u00a7\u00a7 1-52, pp. 3363-3406.) The Act was the product of an extensive study by the Judicial Council of California and the Committee on Administration of Justice of the State Bar of California.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It. constitutes a comprehensive and detailed statutory plan governing jurisdiction, process, and related problems. We conclude that the Legislature preempted the entire area of law relating to these subjects in passing the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Section 410.50 provides: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided by statute, the court in which an action is pending has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10). A general appearance by a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>is equivalent to personal service of summons on such party. [H] (b) Jurisdiction of the court over the parties and the subject matter of an action continues throughout subsequent proceedings in the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Because the Act is preemptive, common law rules concerning its subject matter are not a part of California law. <em>(Milwaukee </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1980) 451 U.S. 304 [68 L.Ed.2d 114, 101 S.Ct. 1784]; <em>Isbrandtsen Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 779 [96 L.Ed. 1294, 72 S.Ct. 1011].) It is also significant that in reenacting the rule that a general appearance is tantamount to personal service of summons, no mention is made in the Act of the common law rule of <em>Security </em>that such a general appearance retroactively turns an invalid service into a valid one. Such a rule could easily have been stated. This omission manifests legislative rejection of the rule. <em>(Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 102, 109 [64 L.Ed.2d 766, 772-773, 100 S.Ct. 2051]; <em>Iselin </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1926) 270 U.S. 245, 251 [70 L.Ed. 566, 569-570, 46 S.Ct. 248]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>I.M. Jameson Corp. </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 60, 67 [59 P.2d 962].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 410.50 is inconsistent with the waiver rule of <em>Security </em>because subdivision (b) specifically states that jurisdiction obtained pursuant to subdivision (a) \u201ccontinues throughout <em>subsequent </em>proceedings in the action.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The common law rule of <em>Security </em>did not rest on section 410.50, subdivision (a) or its antecedent, former section 416.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The cases which developed the <em>Security </em>rule ignored these sections. The origin and history of the rule are entirely nonstatutory. That courts have frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ignored statutory law has been remarked often by commentators, including Chief Justice Traynor<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and Roscoe Pound.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (See also <em>Isbrandtsen Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>343 U.S. 779, 781 [96 L.Ed. 1294, 1298].) Ergo, it cannot be argued that reenactment in section 410.50, subdivision (a) of the rule that a general appearance is tantamount to service of summons reenacts the <em>Security </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Since the Legislature has rejected the waiver rule of <em>Security </em>without ambiguity, no examination of legislative purpose aside from the statute itself is necessary. <em>(Diamond </em>v. <em>Chakrabarty </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 303, 315, 318 [65 L.Ed.2d 144, 153, 155, 100 S.Ct. 2204]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oregon </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 643, 648 [6 L.Ed.2d 575, 579, 81 S.Ct. 1278]; <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 353-354 [139 P.2d 908].)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>\u201cBasis\u201d in Section 410.10 Does Not Refer to Service of Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Sandra argues that no matter how section 410.50 is construed, section 410.10 provides sufficient statutory authority for the retroactive waiver rule in <em>Security. </em>Section 410.10 provides: \u201cA court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">She contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">1. A general appearance is either a consent to jurisdiction or a waiver of any objection to jurisdiction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">2. \u201cThere is nothing unconstitutional about a person consenting to the jurisdiction of a court or waiving complaints against the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The word \u201cbasis\u201d has several uses. One common use refers to relationships between things or individuals. This use is consistent with \u2022 Sandra\u2019s position that the relationship between a court and a defendant is any constitutionally proper relationship the court designates, including the court\u2019s power to declare retroactively valid a void attempt to serve a summons on defendant upon defendant\u2019s general appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">But this is not the use which lawyers, judges, teachers, and legislators have made of \u201cbasis\u201d in reference to the jurisdiction of courts. They use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>it to refer to the relationship between a court and persons, entities, or things a court may seek to bring before it. Thus, if a \u201cbasis of jurisdiction\u201d exists between a court and a defendant, the court may bring that defendant within its authority and thereafter make orders binding upon that defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cContacts\u201d is used in <em>Internat. Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 310 [90 L.Ed. 95, 66 S.Ct. 154, 161 A.L.R. 1057], synonymously with \u201cbasis of jurisdiction.\u201d The process by which a court brings the defendant within its power is another subject, usually discussed under the heading \u201cNotice.\u201d This distinction is clearly made by Professor Horowitz: \u201cDue process requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard should be carefully distinguished from due process requirements of basis of jurisdiction. If there is no constitutionally adequate basis of jurisdiction for a court to grant a plaintiff the specific judgment he seeks against the defendant it will make no difference if the defendant has been given notice and opportunity to be heard.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> These subjects are considered in different articles of the Act<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and in different sections of Restatement Second, Conflict of Laws,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and Wit-kin, California Procedure 2d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In the case at bar, there is no issue surrounding the superior court\u2019s basis of jurisdiction over Leland. The issue before us involves the effectiveness of the service by Sandra of summons upon him, i.e., whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>his later general appearance converted an invalid service into a valid one. We conclude, therefore, that section 410.10 does not empower a court to employ the <em>Security </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">A second and independent reason for rejecting Sandra\u2019s argument regarding the effect of section 410.10 is the rule that a statute must be interpreted, where possible, to give effect and consistency to all of its parts. <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, 54 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935]; <em>Estate of McDill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 831, 836 [122 Cal.Rptr. 754, 537 P.2d 874].) To give effect to Sandra\u2019s argument would be inconsistent with our conclusion that section 410.50 is contrary to the rule in <em>Security. </em>It would also render section 410.50, subdivision (b) meaningless and the specific rules regulating the service of process redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>Code of Civil Procedure Section 473.5 Is Not Applicable to Acquisition of Jurisdiction by Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Sandra argues that Leland\u2019s motion to quash service of summons is barred by section 473.5<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">(1) Former section 411 was replaced by section 410.10 which provides that jurisdiction attaches on any constitutional basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">(2) Leland had actual notice of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Point (1) is answered by our foregoing analysis of section 410.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Argument (2) fails because section 473.5 refers only to persons upon whom service was <em>made </em>or attempted and who did <em>not </em>have actual notice of the pendency of the action. Clearly, Leland could not move to set aside his default under this section and he did not rely upon it. Leland correctly relies upon <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, 256 </em>Cal.App.2d 301, footnote 1, for the proposition that a court has inherent power to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud upon it.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In this action, as in <em>Sullivan, </em>the fraud consisted in filing a false return of service, executed in this case by Sandra\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The order from which Sandra appealed is affirmed.
