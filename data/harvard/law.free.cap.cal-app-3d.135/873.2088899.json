At the second trial, McJimson was found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to state prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Because we conclude the judgment must be reversed on \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d grounds, no exposition of the facts of the crime is necessary, but this court is mindful that the victim was the mother of a small child and that its ruling precludes retrial of a man convicted by a jury of beating her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">While not wishing to be unduly harsh on the trial judge, who attempted to be both fair and solicitous to the needs of counsel, our ruling, to which we feel absolutely compelled, makes brutally clear the need for extreme care\u2014by deputy district attorneys as well as judges\u2014 in matters such as the declaration of mistrials.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">A jury was impanelled on Thursday, November 13, 1980, and instructed to return to begin the trial on the following Monday, the 17th. By that date, however, Mr. Weiss, the deputy district attorney assigned to try the case, had come down with a strep throat. While no \u201cformal\u201d finding was made on this issue, the record is clear that Mr. Weiss\u2019 condition was completely incapacitating and that both the court and defense counsel agreed that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The trial was continued, generally from day-to-day, until November 24, whereupon the court ascertained that Mr. Weiss was still too sick to begin trial. The following colloquy then took place between defense counsel (Mr. Lenoir), the court and Mr. Vezzani, the deputy district attorney \u201cstanding in\u201d for Mr. Weiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Vezzani, I think the first thing that I ought to do is let Mr. Lenoir get his request on the record, which I believe is something like, \u2018Don\u2019t you have someone else that can try this case?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>\u201cMr. Lenoir: Yes. I put that on the record Friday, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">\u201cMr. Vezzani: Notwithstanding Mr. Lenoir\u2019s request, I don\u2019t know what he is going to do about it. He might go upstairs and talk to Mr. Ron Carroll, who is the Director of Central Operations. He might try talking to the calendar deputy from the court Mr. Weiss\u2019 case came from. I don\u2019t know where the files are. They may be in Mr. Weiss\u2019 office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cI would have a feeling that because of the charges here, whoever would take over the case would need time to prepare it anyway, and by that time the likelihood is Weiss would be back anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cWhat do you want to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">\u201cMr. Lenoir: I discussed it with my client in very great detail. Both he and I, as the court knows, have been very considerate in this matter. We were considerate when Mr. Weiss was engaged in another trial. We gave him an opportunity, waived time before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201cI discussed it with my client last week. He was totally upset last week about it, but somehow he agreed to go on until today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">\u201cMr. Vezzani: What would you like me to do, Gerry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">\u201cMr. Lenoir: Nothing in particular. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">\u201cMr. Vezzani: You have jeopardy attached, so what you are trying to say [is] you got us by the short and curlies and you want to have someone walk in the door and say, T don\u2019t know what the case is about, but get on the stand and tell your story.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">\u201cMr. Lenoir: You know better than that. I have a client to represent. The client is insisting. I got him to go along this far.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">The record contains a great deal of other conversation between counsel and the court, but, significantly, at no point can it be shown, even by some sort of implication or silence, that defense counsel or his client agreed to the granting of a mistrial. To the contrary, counsel advised the court that he and his client \u201clik[ed] this jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>The Attorney General concedes, as surely he must, that article I, section 15, of the California Constitution prevents a person from being placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense. The question of what constitutes \u201cbeing placed on trial\u201d or being \u201cin jeopardy\u201d is one which pretty well requires an arbitrary answer. There is nothing more logically compelling about the swearing in of the jury than some other point in a trial such as the swearing of the first witness, the first question being asked of a witness or the trial judge\u2019s telling the People to \u201cproceed.\u201d  But plainly swearing the jury <em>is </em>California\u2019s time when jeopardy is deemed to \u201cattach\u201d and, after that point, the jury\u2019s being discharged is the equivalent to an acquittal, barring retrial unless <em>\u201clegal </em>necessity\u201d for the discharge is present. <em>(Larios </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 324 [155 Cal.Rptr. 374, 594 P.2d 491].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The leading case on \u201clegal necessity\u201d in California is <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 707 [87 Cal.Rptr. 361, 470 P.2d 345], in which the trial judge, because he felt bizarre testimony from a key witness had \u201cprejudiced both sides,\u201d declared a mistrial.  The Supreme Court, in addition to confirming the timing of \u201cjeopardy attaching,\u201d held unequivocally that, absent clear consent of a defendant or his counsel, a mistried case may not be retried except for the inability of the jury to agree (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1140<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), death or serious illness of a juror (\u00a7 1123) or some other extraordinary cause \u201cbeyond the control of the court\u201d (\u00a7 1141; <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 273 [14 Cal.Rptr. 657, 363 P.2d 889, 100 A.L.R.2d 371]). Even a cause so extreme as known juror misconduct does not warrant declaring a mistrial (i.e., permit a retrial) without a defendant\u2019s consent. <em>(Larios, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Because we recognize the enormity of reversal of a killer\u2019s conviction under circumstances which will not permit a retrial, we have undertaken a review of not only federal precedent in the area, but that of our sister states as well. Notwithstanding the clear holding of our Supreme Court that our <em>state </em>constitutional standard (at art. I, \u00a7 15) is different from and higher than that demanded by the United States Supreme Court <em>(Curry, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d at p. 716, citing <em>Cardenas, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 273) we have made that review to determine whether cases <em>factually </em>more similar to the instant one than <em>Curry </em>might suggest a different result. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1978 pocket supp.) \u00a7 183.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>At first blush, the federal standard, which has come to be the constitutionally mandated <em>minimum </em>for 14th Amendment analysis of state convictions <em>(Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 784 [23 L.Ed.2d 707, 89 S.Ct. 2056]), appears significantly lower than our own, permitting retrial after the declaration of a mistrial in a variety of situations since the landmark 1824 opinion by Mr. Justice Story in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 [6 L.Ed. 165].</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">But, whether the federal standard is <em>lower </em>or not, it can be said that the cases enunciating it deal with issues which are simply <em>different </em>from any in the instant case. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 458 [35 L.Ed.2d 425, 93 S.Ct. 1066], for example, permits a state to retry a defendant after the declaration of a mistrial (following the jury being sworn) in a situation where the charging indictment was fatally defective and, under relevant state law, not amendable. Were the trial to have been held, reversal of a conviction would have been essentially automatic. Attempting to define the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d and \u201cends of public justice\u201d standards used by the United States Supreme Court since <em>Perez, </em>Justice Rehnquist held: \u201cA trial judge properly exercises his discretion to declare a mistrial if an impartial verdict cannot be reached, or if a verdict of conviction could be reached but would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial. If an error would make reversal on appeal a certainty, it would not serve \u2018the ends of public justice\u2019 to require that the Government proceed with its proof when, if it succeeded before the jury, it would automatically be stripped of that success by an appellate court.\u201d (410 U.S. at p. 464 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 431 ].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We have found no case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> suggesting that prosecutorial illness is a proper basis for declaration of a mistrial, regardless of the particular language employed to define the standard. The only case expressly dealing with the issue in recent years is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1973) 225 Pa.Super. 247 [310 A.2d 338], in which the court stated \u201cRecent decisional law leads us to the inexorable conclusion that such a reason for subjecting the defendant to a second trial can hardly be considered tantamount to \u2018manifest necessity.\u2019\u201d (310 A.2d at p. 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Respondent cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Manson </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 102 [132 Cal.Rptr. 265], certiorari denied (1977) 430 U.S. 986 [52 L.Ed.2d 382, 97 S.Ct. 1686] for the proposition that \u201cabsence of counsel may qualify as legal necessity.\u201d But that case was one in which <em>defense </em>counsel (for a codefendant, Van Houten) <em>disappeared without a trace </em>near the end of a trial. Those are very substantial differences from the instant case. The most obvious distinction is that the defendant personally <em>favored </em>a mistrial after her lawyer\u2019s disappearance, as her substitute counsel simply could not realistically argue her cause. Secondly, counsel was absolutely missing (under the circumstances of that case, quite likely never to return).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Here, we deal with a strep throat, a serious illness, but not one with long-term incapacity a likely outcome. Moreover, the illness was the <em>prosecutor\u2019s, </em>and the double jeopardy clauses of the state and federal Constitutions are among those rights afforded to individuals vis-a-vis the state. They are not intended to be reciprocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>McNally </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 387 [165 Cal.Rptr. 715], involving disqualification of defense counsel during the trial due to a previously unknown conflict of interest, seems to be the <em>least </em>extreme circumstance in which a mistrial has been held proper without the defendant\u2019s own consent, but note that this situation is, again, not manipulable by the prosecutor or court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We do not remotely suggest prosecutorial impropriety here, but the extremely strict standards of our law in this area reflect that the potential for abuse was very much on the minds of the framers. (See <em>Larios, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 324.) A prosecutor has no ability whatever under our system to \u201chave a second chance at a defendant\u201d absent a \u201chung jury\u201d or reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">It is important to stress what this case does <em>not </em>involve. It does not involve questions such as \u201cgood cause\u201d to continue a case as against a defendant\u2019s \u201cspeedy trial\u201d rights. (See \u00a7 1382.)  Certainly attorney\u2014including prosecutor\u2014illness is generally considered good cause to continue even beyond statutory time limits, the issue rarely even receiving appellate scrutiny. \u201cGood cause\u201d for continuances in this area is highly discretionary in the trial courts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Andrade </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 963 [150 Cal.Rptr. 662]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Lerma) (1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 1003 [122 Cal.Rptr. 267].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>We are neither unconcerned with the plight of the trial court and counsel, nor unmindful of the burden of constant day-to-day continuances. Further, it is critical that courts pay attention to the impact on the personal lives of citizens called to service on juries and, whenever constitutionally possible, to make that attention a high-priority factor in scheduling their matters. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McNally </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 387, 393 [165 Cal.Rptr. 715].) Here, all concerned had already put up with a highly inconvenient situation for a week. We do not have a <em>good </em>solution to the problem, any more than the prosecutor\u2019s doctors had any good solution for a strep throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">But given that a bad situation often compels a search for the least onerous alternative, there were several lawful things that might have been done:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">(1) The court could have gone on continuing the case from day to day, assuming it was in a position to make a proper finding of good cause for such continuances; it appears that good cause was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">(2) The district attorney could have assigned another deputy to try the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">(3) Especially if the court went ahead and continued the case for a few more days, the defendant might well have rethought his position on the desirability of a mistrial and agreed to one if, for example, he and his counsel concluded that the jurors would be angered by the delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">As to reassigning the case within the district attorney\u2019s office, we recognized that institution\u2019s quite proper wariness of the judicial branch\u2019s transgression of the separation of powers doctrine, more informally phrased as \u201ctrying to tell us how to run the d.a.\u2019s office.\u201d The record, including but not limited to the portions quoted above, does not place the \u201cstand-in\u201d deputy district attorney, Mr. Vezzani, in a professionally becoming light. Little assistance was given a trial judge who manifestly was seeking it and the caustic remarks directed at a defense attorney who was, with considerable courtesy, protecting his client\u2019s procedural posture were, at best, unnecessary. Professional prosecutors also resent anyone\u2014courts included\u2014assuming that deputies, in even the largest offices are \u201cfungible\u201d (in the slang term for this issue). Whatever truth there may be, historically or currently, in the \u201chandoff\u201d method of case assignment, in which a deputy picks up a case on the way into the courtroom, it is not looked upon with favor. \u201cVertical representation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>in which a particular deputy handles a case from the complaint, through the preliminary and pretrial motions and into the trial, is increasingly the preferred method, particularly in serious cases as we have here. Indeed, Mr. Weiss had handled the case in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">But, having said all of that, we return to the proposition that Mr. Weiss could not then handle the trial and his office should have, more meaningfully than the record indicates it did, considered a reassignment. To say that this would be desirable would be inaccurate, but to say that reassignment is never done\u2014including situations far less pressing than this one\u2014would be assuming a level of naivete not present here. When a prosecutor (i) dies, (ii) is appointed to the bench or (iii) is seriously ill or injured,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reassignment is accomplished. We do not in this case, deal with the situation of a very small county with, perhaps, a single prosecutor; the facts of life in Los Angeles County include the presence of many very capable prosecuting attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In the real world, a combination of the three not-very-satisfactory remedies set forth above would probably be the best answer to the problem. A finding by the court, based on some on the record evidence, of Mr. Weiss\u2019 inability to proceed, coupled with a two- or three-day continuance<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for either his recovery or the reassignment of the case (the choice properly being left between Mr. Weiss and his superiors) would not only eliminate the problem of an unprepared deputy representing the People but might well have caused reconsideration of the defense position on agreeing to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The case is remanded to the trial court, with directions to sustain appellant\u2019s plea of once in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Feinerman, P. J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 12, 1982, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 15, 1982. Newman, J., and Kaus, J., did not participate therein. Richardson, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> The trial judge reduced the conviction to one of manslaughter at the time of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\"> In spite of the lengthy review of the federal standard in the majority opinion in <em>Somerville, </em>four justices felt compelled to dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\"><em> Rasmussen </em>v. <em>White </em>(E.D.Tex. 1980) 502 F.Supp. 237, in which a federal court, on <em>habeas corpus, </em>in language clearly identified as dicta, indicated it might permit the state to begin a new trial after a first was aborted due to trial court congestion, is simply in accord with no precedent in any jurisdiction found by us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\"> These situations are more \u201cemergency\u201d in nature than vacations, resignations or reassignments, where some \u201clead time\u201d is generally available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\"> Sometimes, of course, a trial judge will simply get lucky and find, on inquiry, that all jurors <em>could </em>return on a date certain a week or two later.
