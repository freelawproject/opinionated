The Appellate Term properly determined that the tape recording was pivotal to the trial court\u2019s determination of guilt and that, without that evidence, the remaining evidence presented by the People was insufficient to support a finding of guilt. <em>(People v Strollo, </em>191 NY 42; <em>People v Cabey, </em>85 NY2d 417; <em>People v Johnson, </em>196 AD2d 408, 82 NY2d 806; <em>People v Garafolo, </em>44 AD2d 86; <em>People v Gallella, </em>23 AD2d 285; <em>People v Buford, </em>37 AD2d 38; <em>People v Genova, </em>15 AD2d 44; <em>Alva v Hurley, Fox, Selig, Caprari &amp; Kelleher, </em>162 Misc 2d 402; <em>Fowler v Manahan, </em>100 AD2d 860; <em>Matter of Respeto v McNab, </em>90 AD2d 308.) II. While not considered by the appellate court, the other issues raised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>defendant-respondent on appeal are independent bases for reversal of the conviction. <em>(May v Shaw, </em>79 AD2d 970; <em>Matter of Motell v Napolitano, </em>186 AD2d 989; <em>Matter of Meyer, </em>132 Misc 2d 415; <em>People v Vernon, </em>89 Misc 2d 472; <em>United States v Posado, </em>57 F3d 428; <em>People v Daniels, </em>102 Misc 2d 540; <em>Zinn v Bernic Constr., </em>99 Misc 2d 510; <em>Matter of Stenzel v B, </em>71 Misc 2d 719; <em>Walther v O\u2019Connell, </em>72 Misc 2d 316; <em>People v Shedrick, </em>66 NY2d 1015.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b124-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b124-6\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Defendant, a dentist, was convicted of sexual abuse in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.55) for fondling a 17-year-old girl during an appointment. The issue in this case is whether the loss on appeal of a trial exhibit \u2014 a tape recording of a conversation in which defendant responded to the victim\u2019s allegations of abuse \u2014 warranted summary reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the loss deprived the Appellate Term of the ability to conduct any meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The complainant testified at a bench trial about the events in question, including that defendant sexually abused her while purportedly treating her teeth. A police investigator also testified that, when this incident was reported to the police several months later, she requested the complainant to call defendant at his office to confront him with the accusations of sexual abuse. A tape recording of that conversation was admitted into evidence. When questioned at trial about the conversation, defendant testified that he was shocked by the allegations and could not freely discuss them at the time of the phone call because of the presence of his dental assistant and a patient. However, he conceded his failure to deny the allegations of physical contact, testifying instead that he had told the complainant that \u201cthere is a misunderstanding; there is a mistake. * * * I am sorry for the way you feel, okay\u201d and that \u201cit was not my intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The court found defendant guilty and sentenced him to one year probation. At the sentencing hearing, the court noted that defendant\u2019s statement on the tape recording \u201cwas revealing\u201d and it characterized the recording as \u201cthe icing on the cake in this case.\u201d Nonetheless, the court emphasized that \u201cthere is no doubt in my mind when evaluating the complainant\u2019s credibility and the defendant\u2019s this was not an even mix by any standard. The complainant impressed me as immeasurably more truthful and sincere than the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Defendant appealed, primarily arguing that the trial court erred in denying his request to admit certain expert opinion testimony pertaining to a polygraph exam. Defendant also contended that the evidence was legally insufficient because \u201cthe only direct evidence that the crime occurred consisted of the complainant\u2019s inconsistent and unreliable testimony.\u201d He did not assert, however, that the taped telephone conversation was exculpatory, inaccurate or otherwise crucial to guilt or innocence or to any of the other issues he raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The Appellate Term reversed, but not on any of the grounds urged by defendant. Rather, noting that the tape recording of the conversation between defendant and the victim had been lost, the court sua sponte determined that proper appellate review was impossible. In reaching this conclusion, the court characterized the tape as \u201ccritical\u201d to the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt. Because defendant had already served his sentence of probation on this class B misdemeanor, the court dismissed the accusatory instrument, citing <em>People v Flynn </em>(79 NY2d 879 [1992]) and <em>People v West </em>(56 NY2d 637 [1982]). A Judge of this Court granted the People leave to appeal and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We begin with the basic proposition that a defendant has a fundamental right to appellate review of a criminal conviction <em>(see People v Harrison, </em>85 NY2d 794, 796 [1995]; <em>People v Montgomery, </em>24 NY2d 130, 132 [1969]; <em>see also </em>CPL 450.10). The loss of a trial exhibit, however, does not necessarily deprive a defendant of effective appellate review <em>(see People v Glass, </em>43 NY2d 283 [1977]; <em>People v Strollo, </em>191 NY 42 [1908]). To determine whether the loss of a trial exhibit necessitates the reversal of a conviction or requires some other corrective action, an appellate court must engage in the analysis established in <em>Strollo </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In <em>Strollo, </em>this Court held that the loss of original handwritten exhibits on appeal did not require a reversal and new trial. The exhibits \u2014 letters written in a foreign language \u2014 had been translated into English. Because these translations were in the record, their accuracy was not seriously disputed and the evidence was legally sufficient without them, the Court held that reversal was not required. In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized that a reversal may have been appropriate if the case was \u201cso wholly or largely dependent upon documentary evidence that there would be no proof and could be no judgment without the documents\u201d (191 NY at 66). The Court also noted that the loss of documents would <em>not </em>necessitate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>reversal in those cases where the documents have \u201cno substantial importance\u201d to the issues raised on appeal or where there are copies of the documents \u201cand the correctness of the copies is unquestioned or unquestionable\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Moreover, as articulated in our later precedents, there \u201cis a presumption of regularity which attaches to a judicial proceeding * * * and the unavailability of [an exhibit], either because it has been lost or inadvertently destroyed, standing by itself, will not rebut that presumption\u201d <em>(Harrison, </em>85 NY2d at 796). Indeed, to rebut the presumption, the defendant has the burden to make an \u201cappropriate showing\u201d that \u201calternative methods to provide an adequate record are not available\u201d <em>(Glass, </em>43 NY2d at 286 [1977]). Therefore, a reversal is appropriate only \u201cwhen a record cannot be reconstructed because of the lapse of time, the unavailability of the participants in the proceeding or some similar circumstance\u201d <em>(Harrison, </em>85 NY2d at 796).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><em>Glass </em>is particularly instructive. In that case, the defendant, who was convicted after a jury trial, argued that he was deprived of effective appellate review because the court reporter could not find the untranscribed stenographic notes covering the summations and jury charge. We held that the defendant did not overcome the presumption of regularity that attached to his trial because he failed to establish that those portions of the record could not be reconstructed. Specifically, the defendant did not establish \u201cthat he, his trial counsel, the prosecutor, court personnel, others present during trial, or, for that matter, the Trial Judge were not willing and capable of aiding in the reconstruction of a substitute record\u201d (43 NY2d at 286).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Strollo </em>and its progeny thus provide a sound analytic framework for determining whether the loss of a trial exhibit precludes meaningful appellate review. An appellate court must first determine whether the exhibit has \u201csubstantial importance\u201d to the issues in the case or is essentially collateral. If the information contained within the exhibit is needed to resolve the issues raised on appeal, the appellate court must then determine whether the record otherwise reflects that information. If the information in the missing exhibit can be gleaned from the record and there is no dispute as to its accuracy, the loss of the exhibit itself would not prevent proper appellate review. On the other hand, if the information in the exhibit is important, but otherwise not contained in the record, the appellate court should order a reconstruction hearing unless the defendant establishes that such a hearing would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In this case, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the actual tape recording was necessary for effective appellate review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction \u2014 the only issue defendant raised on appeal that may have required review of the lost recording. Initially, it is far from clear that the legal sufficiency issue could not be resolved purely on the victim\u2019s testimony. Indeed, the trial court apparently viewed the victim\u2019s testimony as providing legally sufficient evidence, characterizing the tape recording only as the \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d rather than as necessary to establish some element of the crime. Nor does the record otherwise support the Appellate Term\u2019s determination that the tape was \u201ccritical\u201d to the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt. After all, putting the tape aside, the trial court stressed that the complainant was \u201cimmeasurably\u201d more credible than defendant. In any event, defendant did not argue at the Appellate Term that the tape was needed to establish a prima facie case against him or that it was exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Moreover, the tape recording would be material only insofar as it revealed defendant\u2019s actual response to being confronted with the victim\u2019s accusations. But defendant himself testified that he responded \u201cthere is a misunderstanding; there is a mistake. * * * I am sorry for the way you feel, okay\u201d and \u201cit was not my intent.\u201d Thus, the record itself does not definitively reflect the existence of a conflict over the contents of the exhibit. Even assuming that effective appellate review required the contents of the tape to be further developed, the Appellate Term failed to conduct any inquiry as to whether the contents could have been reconstructed at a hearing. In addition, the Appellate Term decision does not reflect consideration of any of the pertinent factors in determining whether the tape was needed for its weight of the evidence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The Appellate Term\u2019s order therefore must be reversed and the case remitted to that court to allow the parties the opportunity to both brief and argue the need for the tape recording in order to accomplish effective appellate review, based upon the criteria set forth in <em>Strollo </em>and its progeny. If the court concludes that the tape is not needed, it should consider all issues raised but not decided by that court on the initial appeal. If it determines that the tape is needed for appropriate appellate review, the court should determine whether defendant has met his burden to establish that a reconstruction hearing would be futile. If defendant has not done so, the court should hold the appeal in abeyance and remit the matter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Criminal Court for such a hearing. If reconstruction of the tape is accomplished, the court should then address all issues raised but not decided in the initial appeal. If reconstruction of the tape was deemed necessary but was not accomplished, the court should reverse the judgment of conviction and sentence and dismiss the accusatory instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Term should be reversed and the case remitted to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Term for the Second and Eleventh Judicial Districts for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
