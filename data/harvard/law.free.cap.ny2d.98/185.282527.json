A court\u2019s reservation of the right to unilaterally increase a bargained-for sentence for a defendant\u2019s \u201clies\u201d concerning culpability during a presentence interview is fundamentally incompatible with its obligation to supervise the plea bargaining process, since the threat will inhibit defendants from making even well-founded post-plea claims of coercion or innocence. Imposition of such a condition violates public policy because it compromises the court\u2019s critical role in ensuring that a guilty plea is knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered. <em>(People v Parker, </em>271 AD2d 63; <em>People v McConnell, </em>49 NY2d 340; <em>People v Flowers, </em>30 NY2d 315; <em>Britt v Legal Aid Socy., </em>95 NY2d 443; <em>Matter of Randall v Rothwax, </em>78 NY2d 494; <em>People v Pelchat, </em>62 NY2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>97; <em>People v Wheaton, </em>45 NY2d 769; <em>People v Flowers, </em>30 NY2d 315; <em>People v Beasley, </em>25 NY2d 483; <em>People v Berger, </em>9 NY2d 692.) II. This Court should reject the lower court\u2019s sentence condition because widespread acceptance of it by criminal court judges in New York would lead to increased costs and delays without any corresponding benefit to the administration of justice. <em>(People v Palazo, </em>147 Misc 2d 829; <em>United States v Ming He, </em>94 F3d 782; <em>United States v Herrera-Figueroa, </em>918 F2d 1430; <em>People v Parker, </em>271 AD2d 63.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b253-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b253-6\">Chief Judge Kaye.</author>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Was defendant\u2019s false denial of his criminal conduct to the Probation Department \u2014 in violation of an explicit written plea condition that he truthfully answer questions asked of him by the Department \u2014 an appropriate basis for enhancement of his sentence? In this case it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In a written statement given to the police, defendant admitted to sexual contact with two sisters \u2014 then six and seven years old \u2014 who had been entrusted to his care. Defendant was later indicted on three counts of first degree rape, one count of second degree rape and four counts of endangering the welfare of a child. In satisfaction of all counts, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of rape in the first degree. Defendant negotiated a proposed sentence of consecutive three-to-six-year terms on the satisfaction of several requirements agreed to in writing. Most relevantly, defendant agreed that he would <em>\u201ctruthfully </em>answer all qu\u00e9stions asked of [him] by the Court\u201d and <em>\u201ctruthfully </em>answer all questions asked of [him] by the Probation Department\u201d (emphasis in original). Defendant further agreed that if he violated any condition, the sentencing court was not bound by its promises made to him and defendant could not withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">At the plea colloquy, the court asked defendant whether he understood that the agreement was conditional, and that defendant had certain requirements to live up to, including an obligation \u201cto answer all of the questions that the probation officer asks you in a truthful fashion.\u201d Defendant answered that he understood. Defendant then admitted that he had sexual intercourse with both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Two weeks later, the Probation Department interviewed defendant in preparation of a presentence investigation report. According to the report, at this interview defendant \u201cdenied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>guilt in this crime. He said he never had any sexual intercourse or touched the children with any sexual provocation.\u201d Rather, defendant told the probation officer that the children initiated sexually suggestive contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Based on defendant\u2019s acknowledged lie to the probation officer, the trial court sentenced him to two consecutive 10-to-20-year terms. On appeal, the Appellate Division held that \u201cthe court improperly enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence in this case\u201d (citing <em>People v Parker, </em>271 AD2d 63, 69-70 [4th Dept], <em>lv denied </em>95 NY2d 967 [2000]; <em>People v Burns, </em>279 AD2d 586, 587 [2d Dept 2001]), and modified the judgment to impose the bargained-for sentence (288 AD2d 882, 883).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In urging reversal, the People argue that the sentencing court appropriately considered defendant\u2019s lie in enhancing his sentence. While conceding that he lied to the probation officer about his crime, defendant argues that the court acted inappropriately in departing from the negotiated agreement, first because breach of a condition to answer truthfully is necessarily subjective, and second because \u2014 unlike factors like family background and personal history \u2014 failure to acknowledge guilt to a probation officer is not directly related to the court\u2019s sentencing function.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We conclude that defendant\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Conditions agreed upon as part of a plea bargain are generally enforceable, unless violative of statute or public policy. <em>(People v Avery, </em>85 NY2d 503, 507 [1995]). Additionally, even where a plea agreement has been reached, and a defendant has entered a plea in reliance on the agreement, it is ultimately up to the court to impose what it considers an appropriate sentence <em>(People v Farrar, </em>52 NY2d 302, 306 [1981]). As a matter of law and strong public policy, a sentencing promise made in conjunction with a plea is conditioned upon \u201cits being lawful and appropriate in light of the subsequent presentence report or information obtained from other reliable sources\u201d <em>(People v Selikoff, </em>35 NY2d 227, 238 [1974]).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Criminal Procedure Law provides that, where a person is convicted of a felony, the court must order a presentence investigation of the defendant, and it may not pronounce sentence until it has received a written report of such investigation (CPL 390.20 [1]). The investigation supporting the presentence report includes the gathering of a wide variety of infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>mation \u2014 including a criminal, social, employment, family, economic, educational and personal history of defendant; information \u201cwith respect to the circumstances attending the commission of the offense\u201d; and other information that the court directs to be included or is otherwise deemed relevant to the question of sentence (CPL 390.30 [1]). The presentence report may well be \u201c \u2018the single most important document at both the sentencing and correctional levels of the criminal process\u2019 \u201d (5 LaFave, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 26.5 [b], at 788 [2d ed], quoting Fennell &amp; Hall, <em>Due Process at Sentencing: An Empirical and Legal Analysis of the Disclosure of Presentence Reports in Federal Courts, </em>93 Harv L Rev 1613 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Several considerations support the court\u2019s enhancement of defendant\u2019s sentence. Initially, there is nothing \u201csubjective\u201d about the particular condition at issue in this case. It was explicit, objective, accepted by defendant \u2014 and concededly breached (see, <em>by contrast, People v Outley, </em>80 NY2d 702 [1993] [defendants denied complicity in crimes underlying violation of \u201cno-arrest\u201d condition]). Sentence enhancement based on defendant\u2019s violation of the condition, moreover, did not violate any statute or public policy. Defendant\u2019s failure to answer the Probation Department truthfully about his crime hindered the preparation of an accurate report for the court\u2019s use at sentencing. Finally, as the sentencing court noted, the acceptance of responsibility for a sexual offense is a step toward rehabilitation (se<em>e e.g. McKune v Lile, </em>536 US 24, 57 [2002]). In short, the result we reach in this case is premised on the nature of defendant\u2019s breached promise and its pertinence to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed and the case remitted to that Court for consideration of the facts (CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"> While defendant before us attempts to recast the issue as one of due process, he made no such claim before the sentencing court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
