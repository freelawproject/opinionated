The Constitution confers jurisdiction on the Commission to determine a disciplinary sanction for \u201ccause,\u201d which includes prejudicial misconduct, subject to review by this Court. <em>(Matter of Sarisohn, </em>26 AD2d 388, 21 NY2d 36; <em>Matter of Nicholson v State Commn. on Jud.

Petitioner\u2019s dissemination of literature was inappropriate since the reference to petitioner as a \u201cgraduate\u201d was inaccurate and misleading, and the reference to petitioner as a \u201claw and order candidate\u201d was a slogan that suggested how she would administer the criminal laws. <em>(Weaver v Bonner, </em>114 F Supp 2d 1337; <em>Republican Party of Minn. v Kelly, </em>247 F3d 854.) III. The Commission\u2019s disciplinary sanction was reasonable and appropriate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b377-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Petitioner, a Justice of the Esopus Town Court, Ulster County, seeks review of a determination of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct sustaining one charge of misconduct and imposing the sanction of admonition <em>(see </em>NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 22; Judiciary Law \u00a7 44). The charge contains two separate allegations, both involving petitioner\u2019s campaign activity while running for her present position. The first asserts that petitioner circulated campaign literature stating she was a \u201cgraduate\u201d of \u201cJudicial Law Course [s]\u201d at Albany Law School, St. Lawrence University and Columbia/Greene Community College. In actuality, petitioner has a high school diploma. The courses referenced in her campaign literature related to the Court Clerks\u2019 Continuing Education Program sponsored by the Office of Court Administration. She had taken the courses at the college campuses in conjunction with her job as a court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The second allegation charges her with using campaign literature in which she identified herself as a \u201cLaw and order Candidate.\u201d In the Commission\u2019s view, that phrase committed, or appeared to commit, petitioner to a pro-prosecution bias in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The Referee who heard the complaint determined that petitioner misled voters by misrepresenting herself as a \u201cgraduate\u201d of judicial law courses at Albany Law School, St. Lawrence University and Columbia/Greene Community College. The Referee determined, however, that the allegation as to her \u201claw and order\u201d campaign literature could not form the basis for any disciplinary action. In the Referee\u2019s opinion, the phrase \u201claw and order candidate\u201d is \u201csubject to several interpretations,\u201d and as such did not constitute an improper pledge or promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The Commission affirmed, and petitioner does not challenge, the Referee\u2019s findings as to petitioner\u2019s misrepresentation of her academic credentials. The Commission, however, rejected the Referee\u2019s finding on the \u201claw and order\u201d charge. In the Commission\u2019s view, the phrase created the appearance that petitioner would favor the prosecution, and amounted to an impermissible pledge as to how she would decide cases. The Commission contends that petitioner\u2019s campaign posture was inconsistent with the neutral administration of justice and is prohibited by the impartiality requirements of the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 100.5 [A] [4] [d] [i], [ii]). We disagree, and conclude that simply using the phrase \u201claw and order\u201d in judicial campaign literature does not amount to misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In pertinent part, the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct require that candidates<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for elective judicial office shall not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201c(i) make pledges or promises of conduct in office other than the faithful and impartial performance of the duties of the office;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201c(ii) make statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201c(in) knowingly make any false statement or misrepresent the identity, qualifications, current position or other fact concerning the candidate or an opponent\u201d (22 NYCRR 100.5 [A] [4] [d] [i], [ii], [in]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai3A\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The Commission argues that by holding herself out as a \u201claw and order candidate,\u201d petitioner violated subparagraphs (i) and (ii). According to the Commission, the phrase promises stern treatment of criminal defendants when interpreted in light of its \u201cwidely held perception.\u201d In its brief the Commission cites the popular origin of the phrase in a political context, referring to President Richard Nixon\u2019s promise that, if elected, he would appoint \u201claw and order\u201d judges to reverse what he and others regarded as unwarranted judicial leniency toward criminal offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Commission argues that petitioner\u2019s invocation of \u201claw and order\u201d was meant to, and did in fact, convey the image of petitioner as a criminal law conservative. We need not determine whether this was petitioner\u2019s intent, or whether a reasonable person viewing the advertisements would have seen it that way. Even under its own interpretation, the Commission has not shown that the phrase carries a representation that compromises judicial impartiality. \u201cLaw and order\u201d is a phrase widely and indiscriminately used in everyday parlance and election campaigns. We decline to treat it as a \u201ccommittment]\u201d or a \u201cpledget] or promise! ] of conduct in office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Petitioner has conceded that it was improper for her to refer to herself as a \u201cgraduate\u201d of the judicial law courses that she took in her capacity as court clerk. While petitioner urges us to dismiss her public admonition, we consider her misrepresentation serious enough to justify it. Reasonable voters viewing petitioner\u2019s advertisements would be led to believe that the courses trained enrollees in judging, and voters would not have suspected that the last formal educational institution to have graduated petitioner was her high school. The Commission\u2019s determined sanction is appropriate in light of the unchallenged finding that petitioner misrepresented her educational background <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 100.5 [A] [4] [d] [iii]).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Accordingly, the determined sanction should be accepted, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur in per curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Determined sanction accepted, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\"> We disagree with petitioner\u2019s contention that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to evaluate the campaign practices of nonjudge candidates for judicial office. We have already permitted the Commission to discipline a judge for conduct occurring prior to taking office <em>(see Matter of Nicholson v State Commn. on Jud. Conduct, </em>50 NY2d 597, 605 [1980]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
