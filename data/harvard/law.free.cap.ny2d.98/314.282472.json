On its face, General Business Law \u00a7 349 (a) applies only to consumer transactions occurring in New York. <em>(Padula v Lilarn Props. Corp., </em>84 NY2d 519; <em>Scott v Bell Atl.

II. Well-settled principles of statutory construction dictate that use of the general term \u201cany person\u201d in General Business Law \u00a7 349 (h) cannot expand the geographic reach of the statute and must be construed to mean \u201cany person in New York.\u201d <em>(Padula v Lilarn Props.

The relevant legislative history further underscores that General Business Law \u00a7 349 was enacted to protect <em>New York </em>consumers, not to regulate transactions entered into by New York businesses anywhere in the world. IV. Sound public policy considerations compel the conclusion that General Business Law \u00a7 349 applies only to consumer transactions consummated in New York. <em>(Ohralik v Ohio State Bar Assn., </em>436 US 447; <em>State of New York v General Motors Corp., </em>547 F Supp 703; <em>Kelley v Carr, </em>442 F Supp 346.)

The Attorney General\u2019s criticisms of the decision of the court below based upon Federal Trade Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>cases are also lacking in merit. <em>(Aronberg v Federal Trade Commn., </em>132 F2d 165; <em>Kraft, Inc. v Federal Trade Commn., </em>970 F2d 311; <em>Holloway v Bristol-Myers Corp., </em>485 F2d 986; <em>Karlin v IVF Am., </em>93 NY2d 282; <em>Federal Trade Commn. v Sterling Drug, </em>317 F2d 669; <em>Brower v Gateway 2000, </em>246 AD2d 246; <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v Federal Trade Commn., </em>379 F2d 666.)

General Business Law \u00a7 349 (a) prohibits \u201c[deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state.\u201d An issue common to both appeals is whether an allegedly deceptive scheme that originates in New York, but injures a consumer in a transaction outside the state, constitutes an actionable deceptive act or practice under General Business Law \u00a7 349 (a). An additional issue in <em>Scott </em>is whether the New York plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for deceptive acts and practices, or false advertising, under General Business Law \u00a7 349 (h) or \u00a7 350. In the circumstances presented, we answer the first question in the negative and the second in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">A. The <em>Goshen </em>Action</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Plaintiffs in this action are insurance policy purchasers who claim to be the victims of a deceptive scheme contrived and implemented by defendants Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York and its wholly owned subsidiary, MONY Life Insurance Company of America (MONY). Defendants have extensive ties to New York and conduct business in the state. Plaintiffs purchased \u201cvanishing premium\u201d policies from defendants at various times before starting this action. A \u201cvanishing premium\u201d would allegedly allow consumers to make periodic premium payments at a rate that would yield investment income to permit premium payments to decline until the obligation to make payments vanished entirely without affecting coverage <em>(see Gaidon v Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.., </em>94 NY2d 330 [1999]). Plaintiffs claim that the vanishing premium is a deceptive scheme based on the artificial inflation of projected policy dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Plaintiff Paul A. Goshen, a Florida resident, used the cash surrender proceeds of his MONY life insurance policy to purchase a vanishing premium policy. Plaintiff claims that a MONY sales agent induced him to surrender his prior policy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>order to purchase the vanishing premium policy using a deceptive sales presentation to illustrate its potential economic benefits. Plaintiff, believing the sales information to be true, ultimately purchased a vanishing premium policy through a MONY representative in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged several causes of action, including \u201cdeceptive trade practices.\u201d Following commencement of the action, Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action in its entirety, and the Appellate Division affirmed. On appeal, this Court reinstated only plaintiffs General Business Law \u00a7 349 cause of action, holding that an issue of fact remained as to whether defendants\u2019 acts were misleading to a \u201creasonable consumer,\u201d and remitted the matter to Supreme Court <em>(see Gaidon, </em>94 NY2d at 344). On remittal, defendants sought dismissal as to plaintiff Goshen. Supreme Court granted the motion and dismissed Goshen\u2019s claim because he purchased his policy in Florida. The Appellate Division affirmed, and we granted plaintiff leave to appeal (97 NY2d 609 [2002]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A9-\">B. The <em>Scott </em>Action</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Plaintiffs here, as in <em>Goshen, </em>collectively seek relief for acts that they allege are deceptive. Plaintiffs are consumers who subscribed to defendants\u2019 Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Internet service. Defendants are Delaware corporations with principal places of business in New York and Virginia. Plaintiffs Walter Scott, David Solomon and Eric Wu are New York residents. The remaining plaintiffs \u2014 Alvarez &amp; Co., Inc., John F. Latuperissa, Andrew Boncek and Greg Howard \u2014 are out-of-state residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In 1999, defendants initiated a significant marketing campaign to promote its DSL service. Through their Web site and various forms of print media, defendants advertised the service as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201cfast \u2014 High speed Internet access up to 126X faster than your 56K modem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">\u201cdedicated \u2014 You\u2019re always connected \u2014 no dialing in and no busy signals, ever! * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">\u201csimple \u2014 Works on your existing phone line and our self-installation kit can be set up in minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABs\">Defendants\u2019 Web site also made representations, in the form of a customer testimonial, about the quality of the technical sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>port services. The DSL service had a 30-day money-back guarantee, and the Internet Access Service Agreement contained several disclaimers, including a representation that \u201cthe service is provided on an \u2018as is\u2019 or \u2018as available\u2019 basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Plaintiffs subscribed to defendants\u2019 DSL service and were dissatisfied with its performance. They allege that, contrary to defendants\u2019 representations, the service was slow and unreliable and that customer service was woefully inadequate. Plaintiffs claim that the DSL connection \u201crarely, if ever, approaches the high speed\u201d expressly represented by defendants. Plaintiffs further maintain that the \u201cset up in minutes\u201d self-installation kits are actually unusable by a substantial number of purchasers who are forced to wait for weeks or months to be connected. Finally, plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 technical support service is inadequate to support DSL service and well below the quality represented by defendants. According to the complaint, these alleged deceptions injured plaintiffs by precipitating their purchase of a service that they are not receiving and causing them to spend inordinate time attempting to resolve problems with defendants\u2019 technical support personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Plaintiffs commenced this action alleging, among other things, violations of General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350. Defendants promptly moved to dismiss the complaint under CPLR 3211 (a) (1) and (7), and plaintiffs sought leave to amend their second amended complaint to add a claim for fraudulent inducement. Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 motion and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, finding the pleadings sufficient to defeat defendants\u2019 CPLR 3211 motion. The Appellate Division reversed on the law, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We granted plaintiffs leave to appeal (97 NY2d 698 [2002]). On this appeal, plaintiffs seek reinstatement of their General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350 claims. We now modify the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate these claims for only the New York plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">New York\u2019s Consumer Protection Act \u2014 General Business Law article 22-A \u2014 was enacted to provide consumers with a means of redress for injuries caused by unlawfully deceptive acts and practices <em>(see </em>General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350; <em>see also, Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20 [1995]). This legislation, much like its federal counterpart, the Federal Trade Commission Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>(15 USC \u00a7 45), is intentionally broad, applying \u201cto virtually all economic activity\u201d <em>(Karlin v IVFAm., </em>93 NY2d 282, 290 [1999]). The statute seeks to secure an \u201chonest market place\u201d where \u201ctrust,\u201d and not deception, prevails (Oswego, 85 NY2d at 25, quoting Mem of Governor Rockefeller, 1970 NY Legis Ann, at 472).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">General Business Law \u00a7 349 provides that \u201c[deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 349 [a]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Attorney General is afforded broad enforcement powers under the statute <em>(see </em>General Business Law \u00a7 349 [f], [g]). Unlike private plaintiffs, the Attorney General may, for example, seek injunctive relief without a showing of injury <em>(see </em>General Business Law \u00a7 349 [b]). In an attempt to broaden the effectiveness of the statute, in 1980 a private right of action was provided to \u201cany person who has been injured by reason of any violation of this section\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 349 [h]).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Under General Business Law \u00a7 349 (h) \u201c[a] prima facie case requires * * * a showing that defendant is engaging in an act or practice that is deceptive or misleading in a material way and that plaintiff has been injured by reason thereof\u2019 <em>(Oswego, 85 </em>NY2d at 25). Additionally, the allegedly deceptive acts, representations or omissions must be misleading to \u201ca reasonable consumer\u201d <em>(Oswego, 85 </em>NY2d at 26; <em>see also, Karlin, </em>93 NY2d 282; <em>Gaidon, </em>94 NY2d 330).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The novel issue before us today concerns the territorial reach of General Business Law \u00a7 349: can \u201chatching a scheme\u201d or originating a marketing campaign in New York in and of itself constitute an actionable deceptive act or practice under the statute, or does the statute also require that the consumer be deceived in New York? We conclude that the transaction in which the consumer is deceived must occur in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">We reach that conclusion by first looking to the words of the statute. The reference in section 349 (a) to deceptive practices in \u201cthe conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service <em>in this state\u201d </em>(emphasis added) unambiguously evinces a legislative intent to address commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>misconduct occurring within New York. Indeed, an examination of the text of General Business Law \u00a7 349 leads us to conclude that \u201cin this state\u201d can only modify \u201cthe conduct of any business, trade or commerce [or] the furnishing of any service.\u201d The phrase \u201cdeceptive acts or practices\u201d under the statute is not the mere invention of a scheme or marketing strategy, but the actual misrepresentation or omission to a consumer (see <em>Gaidon, </em>94 NY2d 330; <em>Oswego, </em>85 NY2d 20). Thus, to qualify as a prohibited act under the statute, the deception of a consumer must occur in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Legislative history also supports that reading of the statute. Attorney General Robert Abrams\u2019 1980 memorandum to Governor Hugh Carey described the law as adding \u201csignificant new protection to consumers in this state\u201d (Bill Jacket, L 1980, ch 346; <em>see also </em>Mem of Attorney General, 1963 NY Legis Ann, at 106 [noting that General Business Law \u00a7 350 \u201cborrows the substantive standards of the Federal Trade Commission Act and applies them to intrastate transactions in New York\u201d]). To apply the statute to out-of-state transactions in the case before us would lead to an unwarranted expansive reading of the statute, contrary to legislative intent, and potentially leading to the nationwide, if not global application of General Business Law \u00a7 349 (see <em>Oswego, </em>85 NY2d at 26 [striking a balance between protecting consumers and avoiding a \u201cpotential * * * tidal wave of litigation against businesses * * * not intended by the Legislature\u201d]). Furthermore, the interpretation out-of-state plaintiffs would have us adopt would tread on the ability of other states to regulate their own markets and enforce their own consumer protection laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Lastly, we note that our General Business Law analysis does not turn on the residency of the parties. As both the text of the statute and the history suggest, the intent is to protect consumers in their transactions that take place in New York State. It was not intended to police the out-of-state transactions of New York companies, nor was it intended to function as a per se bar to out-of-state plaintiffs\u2019 claims of deceptive acts leading to transactions within the state. We next apply these principles to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Plaintiff in <em>Goshen </em>contends that the elaborate \u201cvanishing premium\u201d concept was conceived and orchestrated in New York prior to any dissemination to potential consumers. Therefore, plaintiff would have us hold that actionable deceptive conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>occurred in New York at the time MONY developed or devised a potentially deceptive plan, regardless of its implementation. Similarly, plaintiffs in <em>Scott </em>allege that they have adequately stated a claim under General Business Law \u00a7 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Plaintiffs in both appeals ignore a basic point with regard to General Business Law \u00a7 349. The origin of any advertising or promotional conduct is irrelevant if the deception itself\u2014 that is, the advertisement or promotional package \u2014 did not result in a transaction in which the consumer was harmed. In <em>Oswego, </em>we required \u201c[p]roof that defendant\u2019s acts are directed to consumers\u201d in order to maintain a claim under section 349 <em>(Oswego, </em>85 NY2d at 25). Again in <em>Gaidon </em>our analysis involved transactions with consumers (94 NY2d 330).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Plaintiff in <em>Goshen </em>concedes that he received MONY\u2019s information in Florida. He purchased his policy and paid his premiums in Florida, through a Florida insurance agent. Plainly, for purposes of section 349, any deception took place in Florida, not New York. Out-of-state plaintiffs in <em>Scott </em>similarly cannot allege that they were deceived in New York. Thus,'their complaint does not state any cognizable cause of action <em>(see Leon v Martinez, </em>84 NY2d 83 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">As to the New York plaintiffs, however, the allegations are sufficient to withstand a CPLR 3211 (a) (7) challenge. In the context of a CPLR 3211 motion to dismiss, the pleadings are necessarily afforded a liberal construction <em>(see Leon, </em>84 NY2d 83; <em>see also </em>CPLR 3026). Indeed, we accord plaintiffs \u201cthe benefit of every possible favorable inference\u201d <em>(Leon, </em>84 NY2d at 87; <em>see also Rovello v Orofino Realty Co., </em>40 NY2d 633, 634 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Turning to defendants\u2019 CPLR 3211 (a) (1) motion to dismiss on the ground that the action is barred by documentary evidence, such motion may be appropriately granted only where the documentary evidence utterly refutes plaintiffs factual allegations, conclusively establishing a defense as a matter of law <em>(see Leon, </em>84 NY2d at 88). Defendants produced documentation illustrating the 30-day trial period and the contractual terms and conditions, including the product disclaimer. These documents do not, however, bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims for deceptive trade practices at this stage of the proceedings, as they do not establish a defense as a matter of law. Plaintiffs assert that the service they purchased was defective due to malfunctions largely or wholly within defendants\u2019 control. They further assert that defendants knew this to be the case and that defendants\u2019 promotional representations were therefore know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ingly deceptive. As pleaded this is sufficient. Thus, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1) and (7) was improperly granted as to the New York plaintiffs and their General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350 claims should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Accordingly, in <em>Goshen v Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, </em>the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be affirmed with costs. In <em>Scott v Bell Atlantic Corporation, </em>the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be modified in accordance with this opinion, without costs, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Wesley, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Green<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Ritter2 concur; Judges Smith and Levine taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In <em>Goshen v Mutual Life Ins.
