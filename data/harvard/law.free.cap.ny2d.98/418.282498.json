II. Respondent candidate does not meet constitutional residency requirements; the Supreme Court was bound by the decisional law of the Second Department. <em>(Matter of Robertson v Foster, </em>185 AD2d 963; <em>Matter of Bradley v Brody, </em>230 AD2d 871; <em>Matter of Thompson v Hayduk, </em>45 AD2d 955, 34 NY2d 980.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b485-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Petitioners brought this proceeding pursuant to Election Law \u00a7 16-102 to declare invalid the designating petitions naming respondent Kenneth P. LeBlanc as the Independence Party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and. Democratic Party candidate for the public office of Member of New York State Assembly, 99th Assembly District. Petitioners alleged that, because respondent lived continuously in California from 1987 until 1999, he failed to satisfy the New York residency requirements of article III (\u00a7 7) of the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Section 7 provides that: \u201cNo person shall serve as a member of the legislature unless he or she is a citizen of the United States and <em>has been a resident of the state of New York for five years, and, </em>except as hereinafter otherwise prescribed, <em>of the assembly or senate district for the twelve months immediately preceding his or her election\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Supreme Court concluded that article III (\u00a7 7) requires that only the 12-month district residency period \u2014 and not the five-year state residency period \u2014 immediately precede the election. In that court\u2019s view, any five years of residency satisfies the requirements of the Constitution. The Appellate Division disagreed, holding that article III (\u00a7 7) requires members of the State Legislature to reside in New York for a period of five years immediately preceding their election. We agree with the Appellate Division and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Although the constitutional language is susceptible of both interpretations, review of the record of the Constitutional Convention of 1938, which added the five-year residency requirement, reveals that both the sponsors and opponents of the provision understood that the period must immediately precede the election <em>(see </em>3 Revised Rec, 1938 NY Constitutional Convention, at 2387-2391). To read the constitutional provision in the manner urged by respondent would frustrate the Convention\u2019s objective of ensuring that legislative representatives have contemporaneous familiarity and involvement with the issues facing the state and the community they represent. As the sponsor argued, \u201cif a man lives in the State for 20 years and he moves out to San Francisco and stays there for five years, I still contend that being away for five years, he loses close touch with the local situation, and he should live here another five years, if he wants to be a legislator in the State\u201d <em>(see id. </em>at 2390).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur in per curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"A70G\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\"> Upon the provision\u2019s adoption, the published version read: \u201chas been a resident of the state of New York for five years, and of the assembly or senate district for the twelve months immediately preceding his or her election\u201d <em>(see </em>NY Const of 1938, art III, \u00a7 7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
