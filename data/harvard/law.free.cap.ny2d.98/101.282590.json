Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when the trial court allowed him to waive his right to counsel without conducting any inquiry whatsoever into his understanding of such a waiver. <em>(People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10; <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806; <em>People v Sawyer, </em>57 NY2d 12, 459 US 1178; <em>People v Kaltenbach, </em>60 NY2d 797; <em>People v Smith, </em>92 NY2d 516; <em>People v Slaughter, </em>78 NY2d 485; <em>People v Allen, </em>39 NY2d 916; <em>People v Harris, </em>85 AD2d 742, 58 NY2d 704; <em>United States v Cronic, </em>466 US 648; <em>People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264.) II. Because the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish physical injury within the meaning of the Penal Law, this Court must vacate defendant\u2019s conviction of robbery in the second degree. <em>(Matter of Philip A., </em>49 NY2d 198; <em>People v Ingram, </em>143 AD2d 448; <em>People v Patterson, </em>192 AD2d 1083; <em>People v Melcherts, </em>160 Misc 2d 470; <em>People v Ware, </em>148 Misc 2d 943; <em>People v Feliciano, </em>156 AD2d 258; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-5\"><em>Robert M.

During trial, Arroyo informed Supreme Court of his desire to proceed pro se, expressing dissatisfaction with his at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>torney\u2019s efforts on his behalf. After inquiring whether defendant \u201creally want[ed]\u201d to represent himself, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cyou have a right to do it because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with you. A person has a right to represent himself, but it is usually not a good idea. * * * I don\u2019t have to ask you any questions to know that you are sensible to some extent and have a right to represent yourself. I have to make sure that you\u2019re of sound mind and the rest of it and I\u2019m convinced of that. But I would like to talk you out of it because [defense counsel is] going to make a better summation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Undaunted by these cursory warnings and committed to his own defense, Arroyo proceeded pro se. However, at the court\u2019s request, defense counsel did stand by in the event he was needed. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction (279 AD2d 386) and a Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The constitutional right to counsel is fundamental to our system of justice <em>(see </em>US Const 6th Amend; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6). Implicit in the exercise of this right is the concomitant right to forego the advantages of counsel and represent oneself <em>(see People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10, 15; <em>see also Adams v United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 US 269, 279 [recognizing right to counsel implicitly embodies \u201ccorrelative right to dispense with a lawyer\u2019s help\u201d]). It is a \u201cnearly universal conviction, on the part of our people as well as our courts, that forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so\u201d <em>(Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806, 817; <em>see also People v Smith, </em>68 NY2d 737, 739). The right to counsel and the right to forego counsel are \u201cinherently antagonistic\u201d ideals; in order to best promote the orderly administration of justice and insulate convictions from claims of deprivation of fundamental fairness, the right to self-representation is necessarily a qualified right <em>(see McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d at 14, 16-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Thus, before proceeding pro se a defendant must make a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel <em>(see People v Slaughter, </em>78 NY2d 485, 491; <em>People v Vivenzio, </em>62 NY2d 775, 776). In determining whether a waiver meets this requirement, the court should undertake a \u201c \u2018searching inquiry\u2019 \u201d of defendant <em>(Slaughter, </em>78 NY2d at 491 [citing <em>Faretta, </em>422 US at 835]). A defendant need not have the professional skills and experience of an attorney to choose self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>representation. However, a defendant should be \u201cmade aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open\u2019 \u201d (Faretta, 422 US at 835). Moreover, appropriate record evidence is required which \u201cshould affirmatively disclose that a trial court has delved into a defendant\u2019s age, education, occupation, previous exposure to legal procedures and other relevant factors bearing on a competent, intelligent, voluntary waiver\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>92 NY2d 516, 520 [citing <em>McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d at 17]). Although we have eschewed application of any rigid formula and endorsed the use of a nonformalistic, flexible inquiry, the court\u2019s record exploration of the issue \u201cmust accomplish the goals of adequately warning a defendant of the risks inherent in proceeding <em>pro se, </em>and apprising a defendant of the singular importance of the lawyer in the adversarial system of adjudication\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citing <em>People v Kaltenbach, </em>60 NY2d 797, 799]).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Here, the trial court failed to secure an effective waiver of counsel necessary to allow defendant to represent himself. Although aware of the need for a \u201csearching inquiry,\u201d the court concluded there was no need to ask defendant any questions to know that he was \u201csensible to some extent.\u201d By its summary disposition of defendant\u2019s request, the trial court neither tested defendant\u2019s understanding of choosing self-representation nor provided a reliable basis for appellate review <em>(see People v Allen, </em>39 NY2d 916, 917). Thus, the court failed, at the outset, to evaluate adequately defendant\u2019s competency to waive counsel, to warn him of the \u201crisks inherent in proceeding <em>pro se\u201d </em>and to apprise him of the \u201cimportance of the lawyer in the adversarial system of adjudication\u201d <em>(Smith, </em>92 NY2d at 520).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
