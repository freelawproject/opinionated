The attorney\u2019s lien on the <em>tort </em>judgment for conversion is a vested property right superior to the Bank\u2019s right to set off the later judgment obtained against the clients on its <em>contract </em>claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>(LMWT Realty Corp. v Davis Agency, </em>85 NY2d 462; <em>Matter of Herlihy v Phoenix Assur.

II. The authorities the Bank relies on are all distinguishable. In no case has the equitable doctrine of setoff been employed to permit an adjudicated tortfeasor, such as the Bank, to escape <em>without any punishment whatsoever </em>for its wrongdoing at the expense of the injured parties\u2019 attorneys. <em>(LMWT Realty Corp. v Davis Agency, </em>85 NY2d 462; <em>Baumwald v Two Star Laundry Serv., </em>234 App Div 392, 260 NY 538; <em>Fromme v Gray, 17 </em>Misc 77; <em>Graham v Fisher, </em>251 App Div 859; <em>Smith v Cayuga Lake Cement Co., </em>107 App Div 524; <em>Dunn v Bleeck, 246 </em>App Div 382; <em>Kretsch v Denofrio, </em>137 App Div 617; <em>Beecher v Vogt Mfg.

The Bank was <em>not </em>the prevailing party on the tort claim for conversion. This case does <em>not </em>involve an attack on the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that each party to an action must pay its own attorneys. <em>(Matter of A.G.

The parties\u2019 competing claims were adjudicated in a consolidated action. Each side obtained a judgment after a jury trial, with plaintiff bank\u2019s recovery exceeding that of defendants. The merits of the parties\u2019 claims are not before us. Instead, our focus is on the narrow issue of whether an attorney\u2019s charging lien acquired by defendants\u2019 attorneys on their successful cause of action is entitled to priority over plaintiffs right to set off its larger judgment against defendants. Under the facts and circumstances presented, we hold that the attorneys\u2019 lien is subordinate to plaintiffs setoff rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In New York, an attorney\u2019s charging lien is governed by statute (<em>see </em>Judiciary Law \u00a7 475). However, even before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Legislature enacted section 475 or any of its predecessors, attorneys\u2019 liens had been \u201crecognized and enforced by the courts from very early times\u201d <em>(Matter of City of New York, </em>5 NY2d 300, 307 [1959], <em>cert denied sub nom. United States v Coblentz, </em>363 US 841 [I960]). As this Court observed in <em>Goodrich v McDonald </em>(112 NY 157, 163 [1889]), under the common law, the attorney\u2019s lien \u201cwas a device invented by the courts for the protection of attorneys against the knavery of their clients, by disabling clients from receiving the fruits of recoveries without paying for the valuable services by which the recoveries were obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In 1879, the Legislature amended section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201c[flrom the commencement of an action or the service of an answer containing a counter-claim, the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action or counter-claim, which attaches to a verdict, report, decision, or judgment in his client\u2019s favor, and the proceeds thereof in whosoever hands they may come; and cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment\u201d (L 1879, ch 542).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiB\">Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, New York statutes and case law gave attorneys lien rights that arose from the client\u2019s claim and merged with the verdict or judgment, attaching to the \u201cproceeds thereof\u2019 <em>(see Fischer-Hansen v Brooklyn Hgts. R.R. Co., </em>173 NY 492, 497-498 [1903]).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Although this provision was recodified in 1909 as section 475 of the Judiciary Law <em>(see </em>L 1909, ch 35) and was subsequently amended to encompass proceedings before most state <em>(see </em>L 1936, ch 876), federal <em>(see </em>L 1938, ch 34) and municipal <em>(see </em>L 1946, ch 105) departments, the statutory language underlying an attorney\u2019s charging lien remained relatively unchanged for over a century. Judiciary Law \u00a7 475 currently reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201cFrom the commencement of an action, special or other proceeding in any court or before any state, municipal or federal department, except a department of labor, or the service of an answer containing a counterclaim, the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>claim or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, report, determination, decision, judgment or final order in his client\u2019s favor, and the proceeds thereof in whatever hands they may come; and the lien cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment, final order or determination. The court upon the petition of the client or attorney may determine and enforce the lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The central issue in these appeals concerns the long-standing controversy over the priority between an attorney\u2019s lien on a client\u2019s award versus an adverse party\u2019s right to offset its judgment against that client. Here, the priority controversy arose incident to a dispute between plaintiff Banque Indosuez,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a bank organized under the laws of France but authorized to conduct business in New York, and five investment firms that were formed to conduct foreign exchange trades through the Bank. All five companies \u2014 Sopwith Holdings Corp., Algol Investment Company Limited, Trisha Investments Limited, Optimum Investments, Inc. and Hungarian Investments, Inc.\u2014 are incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and maintain their principal places of business in Caracas, Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Each company executed a contract with the Bank entitled \u201cForeign Exchange Line with Cash Margin Requirement\u201d (the Agreements), which set forth the rights and liabilities of the parties, including the procedure for entering into foreign currency transaction contracts, the minimum collateral requirements for the accounts and the parameters of the Bank\u2019s control of the collateral. Notably, the Agreements also provide that the Bank may recover attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and disbursements \u201cincurred by the Bank in connection with the preparation, negotiation, enforcement and amendment of this Agreement and the preservation of the Bank\u2019s rights hereunder and under any Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In 1994, the Bank commenced an action for breach of contract and account stated against Sopwith, Algol, Trisha and Optimum to recover losses from their trading accounts maintained with the Bank. Those companies, along with Hungarian, then brought suit against the Bank, asserting it engaged in unauthorized trading and attributing the losses they suffered to the Bank\u2019s unauthorized trades. Sopwith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Trisha and Hungarian (the Sopwith defendants) also pursued claims for conversion, contending that the Bank wrongfully retained collateral from their accounts to cover the alleged trading losses of Algol and Optimum. Ultimately, these two actions were consolidated by Supreme Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Following a jury trial, the Bank prevailed on its breach of contract claim and received a $3.1 million verdict only against Algol and Optimum; that judgment is not at issue in these appeals. Although the jury rejected the unauthorized trading claims against the Bank, the Sopwith defendants were awarded $2.4 million on their cause of action for conversion. The jury determinations were upheld on appeal (see 257 AD2d 519 [1st Dept], <em>lv denied </em>93 NY2d 806 [1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">A flurry of postjudgment litigation ensued. Relevant to these appeals, the law firm of Katz, Barron, Squitero, Faust &amp; Berman; P.A. (Katz, Barron), attorneys for the Sopwith defendants in the underlying litigation, moved for an order enforcing an attorney\u2019s lien under Judiciary Law \u00a7 475, based on a retainer agreement between the law firm and the Sopwith defendants, against their clients\u2019 $2.4 million award.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">After Supreme Court granted Katz, Barron\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Bank responded with a motion for reargument. Relying on its Agreements with the Sopwith defendants, the Bank contended that it was owed over $7 million in attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and disbursements in connection with the successful litigation of its breach of contract cause of action and its defense against the unauthorized trading claims. It maintained that the Katz, Barron lien should attach only to net proceeds, if any, due to the Sopwith defendants after the deduction of the Bank\u2019s contractual fees and expenses from the Sopwith defendants\u2019 $2.4 million judgment. Supreme Court disagreed, finding that although the Sopwith defendants\u2019 judgment should be set off against any attorneys\u2019 fees or costs awarded to the Bank, the charging lien was superior and should be paid prior to the setoff. The Appellate Division affirmed (see 275 AD2d 662 [1st Dept 2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The Bank\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and disbursements was then considered by Supreme Court. Citing paragraph 10 (b) of the Agreements,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court held that the Bank was entitled to recover legal fees since it prevailed on the unauthorized trading claims, the prevalent issue in the underlying litigation. Calculation of the amount due was assigned to a special referee, and the parties eventually agreed to the entry of judgment in favor of the Bank in the amount of $3.5 million against all defendants jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">With the amounts awarded to the parties finally determined, Supreme Court directed the Bank to pay Katz, Barron\u2019s charging lien in the sum of $860,666.64 from the Sopwith defendants\u2019 $2.4 million judgment before allowing the Bank to set off its $3.5 million judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Thus the Bank, having prevailed against defendants on the unauthorized trading claims and been awarded the larger judgment, was obligated first to pay defendants\u2019 counsel before it could pursue its own right of offset. We granted the Bank leave to appeal, bringing up for review the Appellate Division\u2019s order affirming the priority of the attorneys\u2019 lien over the Bank\u2019s right of setoff. As part of the order directing payment of the lien, Supreme Court and the Appellate Division also held that the law firm was not entitled to postjudgment interest on the charging lien <em>(see </em>288 AD2d 91 [1st Dept 2001]). We granted the Sopwith defendants leave to appeal the postjudgment interest issue and both appeals were joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">For as long as courts have recognized and enforced attorneys\u2019 liens, there has been tension between an attorney\u2019s right to collect under a charging lien and an adverse party\u2019s right to a setoff \u2014 specifically, which has priority over the other. As Judge Cardozo artfully described, this issue \u201crevives the smouldering fires of an ancient judicial controversy\u201d <em>(Beecher v Vogt Mfg. Co., </em>227 NY 468, 469 [1920]). In the 82 years since that observation, this issue continues to ignite priority controversies in different contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Priority disputes can be traced back in this state\u2019s jurisprudence to <em>Mohawk Bank v Burrows </em>(6 Johns Ch 317 [1822]), where the Court of Chancery held the right of setoff superior to an attorney\u2019s lien. The court adopted the \u201cclear balance\u201d view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>of the English Court of Common Pleas, which declared that only \u201cthe result of the equity between the parties\u201d was subject to the attorney\u2019s lien <em>(id. </em>at 321 [internal quotation marks omitted]). In <em>Dunkin v Vandenbergh </em>(1 Paige Ch 622, 625 [1829]), the Court of Chancery provided further clarification by examining \u201cwhether the costs in different and independent suits can be off set against each other to the exclusion of the attorney\u2019s lien.\u201d The court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201cWhere different claims arise in the course of the same suit, or in relation to the same matter, it is undoubtably equitable and just that these equities should be arranged between the parties without reference to the solicitor\u2019s or attorney\u2019s lien. His lien is only on the clear balance due to his client after all these equities are settled. But when other claims, arising out of different transactions and which could not have been a legal or equitable set-off in that suit, exist between the parties, the court ought not to divest the lien of the attorney or solicitor which has already attached on the amount recovered for the costs of that particular litigation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 625-626).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The pendulum apparently swung the other way in <em>Nicoll v Nicoll </em>(16 Wend 446 [1836]), when the Court for the Correction of Errors subordinated an attorney\u2019s lien to a right of setoff from a prior, unrelated judgment. Not surprisingly, this Court later noted that there remained \u201csome confusion in the authorities\u201d regarding the question whether an attorney\u2019s lien is superior to an adverse party\u2019s right to offset a judgment <em>(Perry v Chester, </em>53 NY 240, 243 [1873]).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The enactment of Judiciary Law \u00a7 475 did not resolve these priority controversies. For example, in <em>Beecher, </em>attorneys for the Vogt Manufacturing Company acquired a lien on a money judgment recovered by their client against Beecher and Smith. The two judgment debtors then obtained an assignment of a money judgment held by the German-American Bank of Buffalo against Vogt and sought to set off the assigned judgment, which would have defeated Vogt\u2019s attorneys\u2019 lien. This Court, emphasizing that the attempted setoff arose from \u201cseparate transactions,\u201d determined that the attorneys\u2019 lien had priority (227 NY at 472-473).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Similarly, <em>LMWT Realty Corp. v Davis Agency </em>(85 NY2d 462 [1995]) involved a priority dispute between an attorney\u2019s lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and a tax lien. In <em>LMWT, </em>the attorneys secured a settlement of an insured property owner\u2019s fire loss claim against the insurer. A question arose as to whether the attorneys\u2019 charging lien against the settlement proceeds should be given priority over a preexisting City of New York lien for unpaid property taxes. This Court determined that the attorneys\u2019 lien was superior to the City\u2019s tax lien. Notably, the tax lien did not arise from the insured-insurer relationship, nor was the tax lien related to the fire loss settlement negotiated by the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Our decisions in <em>Beecher </em>and <em>LMWT </em>indicate that an attorney\u2019s charging lien maintains superiority over a right of set-off where the setoff is unrelated to the judgment or settlement to which the attorney\u2019s lien attached. However, we conclude that a different rule should apply here, where the setoff is the result of judgments emanating from the same transaction or instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In this case, both the Bank\u2019s judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and the Sopwith defendants\u2019 judgment for conversion share a common origin \u2014 the rights and obligations in the parties\u2019 Foreign Exchange Agreements. These Agreements detail, among other things, how the Bank is to handle the collateral in the Sopwith defendants\u2019 foreign currency trading accounts. It follows that these Agreements are at the heart of whether the Bank converted these funds, which is the basis of the Sopwith defendants\u2019 $2.4 million judgment. Moreover, it is the Agreements that contain the Bank\u2019s explicit right to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Thus, because the proposed setoff arises from the underlying customer-bank written agreements, the balancing of equities between the parties leads us to conclude that the Bank\u2019s judgment should be accorded priority over its adversaries\u2019 attorneys\u2019 charging lien.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">This result is consistent with the statutory framework regarding attorneys\u2019 liens. It is well settled that, under section 475, an attorney\u2019s charging lien comes into existence, without notice or filing, upon commencement of the cause of action or proceeding <em>(see LMWT, </em>85 NY2d at 467; <em>Beecher, </em>227 NY at 471). But since its enactment, the statutory provision has limited such lien rights to outcomes where \u201cproceeds\u201d have been obtained \u201cin [a] client\u2019s favor\u201d (Judiciary Law \u00a7 475; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>also LMWT, </em>85 NY2d at 470; <em>Robinson v Rogers, </em>237 NY 467, 473 [1924]; <em>Goldstein, Goldman, Kessler &amp; Underberg v 4000 E. Riv. Rd. Assoc., </em>64 AD2d 484, 488 [4th Dept 1978], <em>affd on op below </em>48 NY2d 890 [1979]). In other words, the litigation or settlement must result in more than the mere entry of a judgment on behalf of a client: there must be proceeds from the litigation upon which the lien can affix. We therefore hold that where competing claims arise out of the same transaction or instrument, an attorney\u2019s charging lien under section 475 will be recoverable against the client\u2019s net recovery, if any, after offsetting the parties\u2019 judgments. Here, the Sopwith defendants won no net recovery because the Bank\u2019s $3.5 million judgment against them exceeded their $2.4 million judgment against the Bank. There are simply no funds remaining from the Sopwith judgment from which Katz, Barron may collect its lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Given this holding, the appeal in the companion case challenging the Appellate Division\u2019s denial of statutory postjudgment interest on the attorneys\u2019 charging lien is academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Accordingly, in case number 36, the judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be reversed, with costs, and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. In case number 37, the appeal should be dismissed, without costs, as academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">In <em>Banque Indosuez v Sopwith Holdings Corp. </em>(case No. 36): Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">In <em>Banque Indosuez v Sopwith Holdings Corp. </em>(case No. 37): Appeal dismissed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\">.

Supreme Court initially calculated the charging lien based on a retainer agreement that was executed after the jury determination.
