The board affirmed the decision of the defendant administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Act (administrator), General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 et seq., determining that the plaintiff is ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly affirmed the decision of the board because the record has not been certified as complete and accurate. More specifically, the plaintiff claims that the testimony given at the hearing was hearsay. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The appeal arises out of the plaintiffs part-time employment as a mail room clerk by the defendant American-Republican, Inc., the publisher of the Waterbury Republican-American, where he had been employed from March 27, 1996, until April 29, 2003, when he was discharged. The plaintiff filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits. The administrator found that the plaintiff had been discharged for wilful misconduct for failure to follow an order given by his supervisor and was, therefore, ineligible for benefits. The administrator\u2019s decision was upheld by an appeal referee and the board. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal. Although the plaintiff claims that the record is inaccurate, he failed to file a motion to correct the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201c[Rjeview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>JSF Promotions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>265 Conn. 413, 417, 828 A.2d 609 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 515 [now \u00a7 22-4] provides the mechanism for the correction of the board\u2019s findings. If the appellant desires that the findings be corrected, the appellant must, within two weeks of the filing of the record in the Superior Court, file with the board a motion for correction of the findings.\u201d <em>Calnan </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>43 Conn.

The plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a timely motion for correction of the board\u2019s findings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 22-4 prevents this court from reviewing facts found by the board.
