On appeal, the plaintiff, Louis Gherlone Excavating, Inc., claims that the trial court improperly dismissed the action by concluding that the mechanic\u2019s lien was defective on its face because there was no verification of the truth of the statements contained in it, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>trial court properly may conclude that a plaintiff cannot prevail in an action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien where the certificate required by \u00a7 49-34 does not contain a verification, the court has subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether the lien is valid. Although we agree that the mechanic\u2019s lien was defective on its face, the court\u2019s judgment of dismissal is improper. Nonetheless, we conclude that judgment should be rendered in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The material facts and procedural history do not appear to be in dispute. In January, 2004, the plaintiff commenced this action against several defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien on premises known as 990-992 North Avenue, Bridgeport (premises). The mechanic\u2019s lien was attached to the complaint as exhibit B. In response, the defendants North Main Bridge, LLC, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., filed motions to dismiss the action because the mechanic\u2019s lien failed to indicate that the plaintiffs agent had verified, under oath, the truth of the statements contained in the lien, as required by \u00a7 49-34.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed objections to the motions to dismiss to which it attached an affidavit signed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Louis Gherlone, the plaintiffs president. Gherlone attested to the manner in which he signed the mechanic\u2019s lien, including that he swore that he was familiar with the facts underlying the lien and that the facts stated in the hen were true.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the court dismissed the action, stating: <em>\u201cRed Rooster Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number><em>struction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 577, 620 A.2d 118 (1993), requires that a document \u2018sworn to\u2019 must contain language that the facts contained in it are true.\u201d The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff raised three claims, all of which concern the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien with respect to \u00a7 49-34 and <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 577. The defendants\u2019 counterstatements of the issues do not raise other issues. In other words, none of the parties questioned the propriety of the court\u2019s having dismissed the action, rather than exercising its jurisdiction over the matter to rale on the merits of the plaintiffs claim. In support of their motions to dismiss the plaintiffs foreclosure action, the defendants cited one sentence from <em>H. G. Bass Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ethan Allen, Inc., </em>26 Conn. App. 426, 601 A.2d 1040 (1992), but without noting the distinguishing fact of that case. <em>H. G. Bass Associates, Inc., </em>does not apply to this action because that case is controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 49-39.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statutory basis of the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss is \u00a7 49-34. Aside from setting forth the applicable standard of review, the parties did not address subject matter jurisdiction in their briefs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\u201c[T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>can be raised by any of the parties, <em>or by the court sua sponte, </em>at any time.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beneduci </em>v. <em>Valadares, </em>73 Conn. App. 795, 805, 812 A.2d 41 (2002). \u201cAny defendant, wishing to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction . . . must do so by filing a motion to dismiss . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 10-30. \u201cThe motion to dismiss shall be used to assert (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) improper venue, (4) insufficiency of process, and (5) insufficiency of service of process. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a). \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting grant of the motion to dismiss [is] de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Welwood, </em>258 Conn. 425, 433, 780 A.2d 924 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. ... A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Once it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action. ... It is well established that, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 727-28, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999). \u201cAny mechanic\u2019s hen may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (i). In filing their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>motions to dismiss, the defendants did not question the authority of the court to adjudicate the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien; rather, they asked the court to determine the validity of the lien.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The defendants were not without a means to raise the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien prior to trial. \u201cHistorically, defenses to a foreclosure action have been limited to payment, discharge, release or satisfaction <em>... or, if there had never been a valid lien. . . . </em>The purpose of a special defense is to plead facts that are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action. . . . A valid special defense at law to a foreclosure proceeding must be legally sufficient and address the making, validity or enforcement of the mortgage, the note or both.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fidelity Bank </em>v. <em>Krenisky, </em>72 Conn. App. 700, 705, 807 A.2d 968, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 915, 811 A.2d 1291 (2002). \u201cNo facts may be proved under either a general or special denial except such as show that the plaintiffs statements of fact are untrue. Facts which are consistent with such statements but show, notwithstanding, that the plaintiff has no cause of action, must be specially alleged. ...\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 10-50. After filing an answer and special defense, the defendants may move for summary judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Although the court improperly dismissed the action because the court had subject matter jurisdiction, we decline to remand the case for further proceedings for reasons of judicial economy. See <em>New England Pipe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number><em>Corp. </em>v. <em>Northeast Corridor Foundation, </em>271 Conn. 329, 338 n.9, 857 A.2d 348 (2004) (judicial economy militates strongly in favor of resolution of issue that is matter of law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>242 Conn. 445, 447, 700 A.2d 1089 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Angeli, </em>237 Conn. 321, 330, 677 A.2d 912 (1996). In all likelihood, if the matter were remanded, the defendants would answer the complaint and allege a special defense that the lien is invalid. The defendants thereafter would file motions for summary judgment. \u201cThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Altfeter </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>53 Conn. App. 791, 800-801, 732 A.2d 207 (1999). None of the facts at issue would change on remand. On a second appeal, we again would be faced with the substantive question regarding the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien, which is a question of law. For reasons of judicial economy, therefore, we will resolve the legal question concerning the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The substance of the plaintiffs claim is that the court improperly construed \u00a7 49-34 with respect to the mechanic\u2019s lien concerning the premises and concluded that Gherlone had to state in writing on the mechanic\u2019s lien certificate that the facts recited therein were true. The plaintiff also argues that \u00a7 49-34 is to be construed liberally. The issue presents a question of statutory construction. We, however, do not begin on a clean page, as a fair amount of ink has been used to construe, repeatedly, the very language at issue here. See <em>First Constitution Bank </em>v. <em>Harbor Village Ltd. Partnership, </em>230 Conn. 807, 646 A.2d 812 (1994); <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 563; <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>Co., </em>210 Conn. 511, 555 A.2d 990 (1989); <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heyward-Robinson Co., </em>23 Conn. Sup. 296, 182 A.2d 339 (1962). Each of these cases held, under facts similar to those presented here, that the words \u201csworn to\u201d imply that the subscriber shall declare upon oath the truth of the statement to which her or his name is subscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 512, the defendant argued, as the plaintiff does here, that \u00a7 49-34 (1) (C) \u201crequires only a signing under oath, and that the oath need not be set forth in the document itself.\u201d Our Supreme Court did not agree. \u201c \u2018An acknowledgment is a verification of the fact of the execution of the instrument but not of its contents. ... A verification, on the other hand, is a sworn statement of the truth of the facts stated in the instrument verified. It always involves the administration of an oath. . . .\u2019 <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heyward-Robinson Co., </em>[supra, 23 Conn. Sup. 298].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018swear\u2019 means in law to take oath; to give evidence or state on oath or legal equivalent, as on affirmation \u2014 as, to \u2018swear\u2019 to a fact, against a party.\u201d <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heyward-Robinson Co., </em>supra, 23 Conn. Sup. 298. Our General Statutes distinguish between the words \u201cswear\u201d and \u201cacknowledgment.\u201d See id. Although our Supreme Court has long endorsed a policy favoring liberal construction of claimed inadequacies in certificates of mechanic\u2019s liens to achieve the remedial purpose of \u00a7 49-34, it has recognized that such a policy has limitations. See <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 514. \u201c[T]he principles that guide our interpretation of mechanic\u2019s lien legislation are well settled. Although this legislation creates a statutory lien in derogation of the common law ... its remedial purpose to furnish security for a contractor\u2019s labor and materials requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>a generous construction. . . . Generosity of spirit does not, however, permit departure from reasonable compliance with the specific provisions of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">\u201cIn accordance with this policy, our courts have been liberal in validating liens despite claimed errors on the face of the lien certificate where the mistake was made in good faith and no resulting prejudice was claimed.\u201d Id., 515; see also <em>First Constitution Bank </em>v. <em>Harbor Village Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 816 (listing examples of liberal validation of liens despite claimed errors). The defendant, however, has cited no Connecticut case in which a court has validated a certificate of mechanic\u2019s hen despite the clear absence of a necessary statutory element of the certificate, nor have we found such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">\u201cWhile \u00a7 49-34 is to be construed so as to reasonably and fairly carry out its remedial intent . . . the plain meaning of the language of the statute cannot be ignored. . . . The term \u2018sworn to\u2019 implies that the subscriber shall have declared upon oath the truth of the statement to which his name is subscribed, and a certificate which merely recites that the claimant \u2018acknowledges\u2019 execution of the hen is insufficient.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heyward-Robinson Co., </em>supra, 23 Conn. Sup. 298-99. \u201c[A] requirement that a document be sworn to contemplates the execution of an affidavit that the facts contained in it are true. ... An oath . . . signifies the undertaking of an obligation to speak the truth at a time [that] may deeply affect the rights and the character of individuals. . . . Consequently, we have held that the mechanic\u2019s hen statute requires the performance or execution of an oath swearing that the facts contained in the document are true.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <em>omitted.) Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>We therefore conclude that the plaintiff cannot prevail in this action to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s hen because the certification does not contain a verification that the facts contained in it are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The form of the judgment is improper, the judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In this opinion BISHOP, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 provides in relevant part: \u201cA mechanic\u2019s lien is not valid unless the person performing the services or furnishing the materials .. . lodges ... a certificate in writing ...

The Supreme Court in <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>cited J. <em>C.

The court thereupon refused to \u201cvalidate a mechanic\u2019s lien certificate without any evidence that the claimant performed some act or form of ceremony indicating that the claimant consciously undertook the obligation of an oath . . . .\u201d Id., 579. Viewed in concert, <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>and J. <em>C.

Neither case, either explicitly or by implication, requires a written oath on the face of the lien certificate stating in effect, \u201cI, claimant, swear that the facts contained herein are true, /s/ claimant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The certification on the lien in the present case contains an affirmation by a notary that the lien was \u201c[subscribed and sworn\u201d before him by the president of the claimant. This affirmation makes apparent on the face of the lien certificate, absent a showing to the contrary, that the claimant\u2019s agent made an oath. \u201cAn oath . . . is a solemn and formal declaration that the contents of a declaration, written or oral, are true . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 578. The affirmation by the notary that an oath was taken, therefore, informs the reader that the claimant\u2019s agent performed an oath, swearing that the contents of the lien document were true. Thus, to require that the claimant state in the hen certificate that its agent took an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>oath swearing that the facts alleged therein are true, is redundant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">To invalidate the certificate here exalts form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-11\"> The defendant North Main Bridge, LLC, also alleges that the lien certificate is invalid because it fails to state that the amount claimed is \u201cjustly due.\u201d North Main Bridge, LLC, did not brief this claim; however, I address it briefly. General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 requires that a lien certificate state \u201cthat the amount claimed is justly due, as nearly as the same can be ascertained . . . .\u201d The claimant here avers in the lien certificate that it has a lien \u201cin the amount of ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN AND 05/100 ($174,037.05) DOLLARS, as nearly as the same can be ascertained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">\u201cProvisions of mechanics\u2019 lien law should be liberally construed so as to reasonably and fairly implement its remedial intent. . . . Generosity of spirit does not, however, permit departure from reasonable compliance with specific provisions of the statute.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>J. C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter M. Santella Co., </em>supra, 210 Conn. 514. Reasonable compliance is \u201cmeasured by whether the lienor\u2019s mistake was made in good faith and by whether prejudice resulted from the mistake.\u201d <em>First Constitution Bank </em>v. <em>Harbor Village Ltd. Partnership, </em>230 Conn. 807, 818, 646 A.2d 812 (1994). The claimant stated in the lien certificate the amount it claims is due on the lien. There is no evidence to suggest that the omission of \u201cjustly due\u201d was made in bad faith. Presumably, the purpose of the statutory requirement is to inform the party subject to the lien the amount sought by the claimant, an objective that was met here. Furthermore, the fact that the claimant\u2019s agent swore to the contents of the lien certificate implies that the amount sought was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
