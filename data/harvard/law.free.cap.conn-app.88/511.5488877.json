The sole appellee, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>state, limits its opposition on appeal to the requested release of materials within the state\u2019s case file. On appeal, the appellants claim that the court improperly limited the disclosure sought and ruled on an ex parte inquiry seeking the advice of the Juvenile Court as to a court order issued by a second court sitting in civil session. We reverse in part the judgment on the motion for disclosure, and we reverse the court\u2019s advice of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The procedural history of this appeal involves two cases, one in juvenile matters and one in the civil division. On November 20, 2001, the respondent, William H., was adjudicated delinquent by the Juvenile Court on charges of risk of injury to two minor girls. After the close of the juvenile case, the victims and their parents brought a civil action in the Superior Court against the respondent and his parents, asserting various causes of action arising out of the matter in the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">On September 25, 2002, the respondent\u2019s mother filed a motion in the juvenile case for the release of all materials in the possession of the court and the Stamford police department regarding the investigation and prosecution of the respondent. Specifically, the mother sought the videotaped statements of the victims, statements of the victims\u2019 parents, photographs of the premises where the alleged crimes occurred, psychiatric examinations of the respondent and any medical examinations of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">On October 8, 2002, the victims and their parents filed a motion in the civil case for the release of materials within the possession of the court, the prosecutor\u2019s office and the police department relating to the juvenile action. The motion was transferred to the Juvenile Court, to be heard in conjunction with that of the respondent\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The court, sua sponte, appointed three guardians ad litem, one for each of the minor victims and one for the respondent. Those guardians were directed to examine the files, to discuss the requested disclosures with all counsel in the civil action and to consider, in light of relevant law and the best interests of the children, what part of the requested disclosures should be granted. At a January 28, 2002 hearing on the motions, all parties to the civil action appeared through counsel, and the state, the respondent\u2019s probation officer and the guardians were present. Defense counsel for the respondent in the delinquency action was not present. At argument, all parties to the civil action agreed to the release of all the requested material contingent on a confidentiality agreement. The guardians generally objected to disclosure on the basis of General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-124 and <em>In re James B., Jr., </em>45 Conn. Sup. 315, 714 A.2d 735 (1998). It was the position of the victims\u2019 guardians that the victims had the right to access many of the documents sought, but could not use them in the civil action, even if it were in the best interests of the victims to do so. The guardian for the respondent stated that his position on disclosure remained the same as he previously had stated to the court, but should the court permit disclosure, he had divided the materials sought into those the disclosure of which would be harmful or not harmful to the respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state apparently expressed its position in a memorandum given to the court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but orally argued that any disclosure granted should be monitored by the guardians, that photocopying should be prohibited and that because the psychological examinations were privileged, they should not be disclosed to the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>By memorandum of decision filed February 6, 2003, the Juvenile Court granted both motions for disclosure in part and denied them in part. As to the request of the respondent\u2019s mother, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-124 (b), and on her showing of compelling need, the court granted her access to the police report, statements of the victims\u2019 parents, photographs of the premises, psychosexua! evaluations of the respondent and the videotaped statements of the victims. As there was no record of any medical reports on the victims, the request for those was denied as moot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to the victims\u2019 request, pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, and General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-124 (e) and <em>In re James B., Jr., </em>supra, 45 Conn. Sup. 315, the court granted the victims access to the police report, written statements, the victims\u2019 videotaped statements and all other items in the court file that the guardians listed as disclosable. The victims were denied access to the respondent\u2019s psychosexual reports as privileged, and the files of the prosecutor and the probation office, as they are not court files and are not generally open to discovery. Those items the court ordered disclosed were subject to a confidentiality requirement, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-124, under which they could not be disseminated to third parties or otherwise used in the civil action. The victims\u2019 videotaped statements could be viewed, but could not be transmitted to any attorney without further order of the court. The Juvenile Court also indicated that it would allow the videotaped statements to be released to the Superior Court under seal for the purpose of testimony in the civil action should all attorneys therein stipulate that that material would be used in lieu of new testimony by the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The victims and their parents requested reconsideration by motion dated February 26, 2003, claiming that the court incorrectly determined that the respondent could not waive confidentiality and the limitations imposed by \u00a7 46b-124, and improperly limited the victims\u2019 access to and use of their own statements, especially as the tapes did not belong to the corut but to a private child welfare organization. The motion further stated that the victims and their parents were having difficulty accessing the materials ordered disclosed and suggested that the records be collected so that they could be reviewed properly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Juvenile Court heard oral argument on March 25, 2003. Present at the hearing were the state, the respondent\u2019s guardian, a guardian for one of the victims and counsel in the civil action for each of the respondent\u2019s parents and for the victims and their parents. At argument, the court clarified that the parties were free to obtain access to the information sought from other sources, but that any of the materials ordered disclosed, from whatever source, were to remain confidential. The parties were also given a copy of the police report from the prosecutor\u2019s file. The victims and their parents appealed from the decision of the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After the filing of this appeal, but prior to oral argument, the Juvenile Court issued an advice of court in response to an ex parte communication from the respondent\u2019s criminal defense attorney, dated October 21, 2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The communication requested a hearing and the court\u2019s advice on what materials in his possession could be disclosed in the civil case. In a letter from the court dated October 30, 2003, the court directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>attorney to submit to the court a list of those items and materials in his possession about which he was concerned. By letter dated December 1, 2003, the attorney provided such a list. That letter disclosed that the inquiry was based on an order issued in the civil matter directing the civil defendants to obtain and to disclose materials in the possession of the respondent\u2019s criminal defense attorney. In the advice of court issued December 30, 2003, the court stated that the psychological evaluations of the respondent performed by a psychologist that he had retained were not part of the court file and therefore not subject to the court\u2019s order, that the court-ordered psychological tests were not to be disclosed as per the order, that the victims were entitled to the arrest warrant application and accompanying affidavits and to investigative police reports also per the order, but that the presentence investigation and interim reports prepared by the court support services division exceeded the scope of the court order and were not to be disclosed. Following the issuance of the advice of court, the appellants filed a request for reconsideration or articulation with the court, which was denied summarily. The appellants, thereafter, filed an amended appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the court properly applied \u00a7 46b-124.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our review of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>interpretation of \u00a7 46b-124 and its application to the facts of this case is plenary. See <em>Franklin Credit Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>73 Conn. App. 830, 839, 812 A.2d 51 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 937, 815 A.2d 136 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Section 46b-124 provides in general for the confidentiality of records in delinquency proceedings and directs that any records released by the court are not to be further disclosed. It is the appellants\u2019 position that the statute applies only to contested discovery requests for juvenile records and that the statutory confidentiality requirements do not apply in this case because all parties to the civil action waived the protection of the statute. The questions before us are, therefore, whether \u00a7 46b-124 can be waived and, if so, whether it was effectively waived in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In general, \u201crights granted by statute may be waived unless the statute is intended to protect the general rights of the public rather than private rights.\u201d <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Max Services, Inc., </em>42 Conn. App. 147, 175, 679 A.2d 37, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 915, 682 A.2d 1005 (1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Our Supreme Court has recognized that the provisions of \u00a7 46b-124 can be waived, stating that \u201c[t]he judges of the juvenile courts have long construed the confidentiality requirements of \u00a7 46b-124 ... to require the written consent of the juvenile and of his parent, if he is still a minor, to waive the protection of the statute.\u201d <em>In re Sheldon G., </em>216 Conn. 563, 577 n.11, 583 A.2d 112 (1990). In <em>In re Sheldon G., </em>a victim of sexual assault requested the juvenile records of her assailant for use in a civil action. Id., 564-65. The Supreme Court concluded that, despite a prior consensual release of medical records, because the respondent in that case had never \u201cprovided express written consent to the release of his juvenile court records,\u201d he had not waived his right to assert the protection of the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id. Implicit in the <em>In re Sheldon G. </em>holding is the conclusion that \u00a7 46b-124 may be waived by a juvenile. Because \u00a7 46b-124 may be waived, it follows that the statute applies only to contested requests for the disclosure of juvenile records.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We now consider whether waiver in fact occurred. The request for disclosure filed with the Juvenile Court by the respondent\u2019s mother expressed in written form her consent to the full disclosure of the respondent\u2019s juvenile records. Presumably, the letters from counsel for the respondent and the respondent\u2019s father attached to the disclosure request did the same.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, all counsel in the civil case articulated to the Juvenile Court that all parties consented to the release of the materials sought subject to a confidentiality agreement. Were that the extent of the record at trial, it would be clear that the respondent had effectively waived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>protection of \u00a7 46b-124.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The appellants would have a right to view and to use the materials requested subject to the confidentiality agreement between the parties to the civil action. A number of procedural irregularities occurred at trial, however, making it impossible for us to determine whether the respondent in fact waived the protection of \u00a7 46b-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The first procedural problem is the court\u2019s appointment of the guardians ad litem for the three minor children. It is not entirely clear from the record whether the appointment of guardians was appropriate. The court\u2019s authority and its reasoning for appointing the guardians under the circumstances of this case are not apparent. The matter before the court was a request for discovery in a civil case in which all the minors were represented by counsel. In addition, the record provides no indication that the minors\u2019 parents were incompetent to represent their children\u2019s interests. The court held no hearing to determine whether in fact there was a need for guardians to be appointed. The record is, therefore, unclear as to whether the guardians in fact had standing to object to the requested disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Our second concern is the guardians\u2019 role in the decision-making process of the court. As a general rule, the role of a guardian ad litem is to represent the best interest of the child. See <em>In re Tayquon H., </em>76 Conn. App. 693, 704, 821 A.2d 796 (2003). It would follow that in this case, the guardians\u2019 role would have been to review the materials requested and to communicate to the court which materials they believed should or should not be released in light of the best interests of the children they represented.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The guardians, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>premised their opinions as to what the court should or should not release on whether \u00a7 46b-124 precluded the requested disclosure. As previously discussed, the statutory provision applies only after opposition to disclosure is voiced by the concerned party. Because the victims\u2019 guardians voiced their opinions on the requested materials in terms of \u00a7 46b-124, we have no record of what disclosure they believed was in or not in the best interests of their wards. As for the respondent\u2019s guardian, his position on disclosure is not documented because any communication to the court on the matter occurred off the record or in a written list that is not included in the court file. The record, therefore, does not inform this court whether the guardians in fact objected to disclosure on the basis of the best interests of the children or, if they did so, what materials in particular were considered objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">We conclude that the record is inadequate for us to determine whether the provisions of \u00a7 46b-124 have in fact been waived.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We accordingly remand the case for further proceedings to determine whether the respondent has waived the protection of \u00a7 46b-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">It is clear from the record that the state made a blanket objection before the Juvenile Court to the disclosure of any of the requested materials. The grounds for that objection are unknown, however, because the memorandum in which the state apparently expressed its opinion is not part of the record. Regardless, on appeal the state has chosen to object only to the requested disclosure of its file. We therefore deem its wholesale objection to the appellants\u2019 discovery request waived and consider its objection to the disclosure of its own file only.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Juvenile Court denied the appellants access to the state\u2019s case file except for a copy of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>report. On appeal, the appellants do not raise any specific claim regarding right of access to the state\u2019s case file. Because that issue was not raised or adequately briefed on appeal, it is deemed abandoned. See <em>Trappe </em>v. <em>Bolgard, 80 </em>Conn. App. 384, 385, 835 A.2d 115 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In light of our remand on the issue of whether \u00a7 46b-124 applies on the facts of this case, the appellants\u2019 claim regarding the request for advice of court as to the civil discovery order requires little discussion. Whether the substance of the court\u2019s advice is correct will depend on the court\u2019s conclusion regarding the applicability of \u00a7 46b-124. We would note, however, that ex parte communication between a judge and attorney or party to a case is generally impermissible. See Code of Judicial Conduct, canon 3. The attorney seeking the advice of court did notify opposing counsel in the delinquency proceeding, the state, but did not provide notice to the parties to the civil case, the proceeding from which the discovery order emanated. We are more concerned, however, by the court\u2019s failure to provide the parties to the civil litigation the opportunity to be heard on the matter. Because the request for advice of court affected the rights of the parties to the civil action, the court should not have considered and acted on the request without providing those parties the opportunity to be heard. As no such opportunity to be heard was afforded, reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The judgment of the trial court denying, in part, the appellants\u2019 motion for disclosure is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the respondent waived the protection of \u00a7 46b-124. The trial court\u2019s advice of court is reversed and the request for advice of court is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-12\"> The appellants are two juvenile girls and their parents who are plaintiffs in an underlying civil action, which arose out of a delinquency case regarding the respondent\u2019s criminal behavior against the juvenile girls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> Apparently, the guardian for the respondent previously had expressed his position to the court. Because we have no transcript of any hearing containing that expression, his position is unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> That memorandum is not in the case file, nor is it clear whether it was provided to other counsel present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AZ8g\"> There is no challenge on appeal to the court\u2019s action on the motion by the respondent\u2019s mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> It should be noted that the attorneys in the civil action have been unable to address the specific materials requested because they have not been given access to the Juvenile Court file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> The letter and all further communication concerning that issue were sent only to the court and to the prosecutor in the juvenile case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-124 provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) All records of cases of juvenile matters involving delinquency proceedings, or any part thereof, including court records, records of law enforcement agencies including fingerprints, photographs and physical descriptions, and medical, psychological, psychiatric and social welfare studies and reports by probation officers, public or private institutions, social agencies and clinics, shall be confidential and for the use of the court in juvenile matters and shall not be disclosed except as provided in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u201c(c) Records of cases of juvenile matters involving delinquency proceedings shall be available to . . .
