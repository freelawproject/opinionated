Under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 54-157 et seq., he is subject to mandatory extradition only if he is a fugitive from justice in Texas. The petitioner claims that he is not a fugitive from justice in Texas because he was taken involuntarily from Texas to this state in order to stand trial on criminal charges here. In the absence of any disputed questions of fact, the issue he raises calls for statutory construction of the act. The trial court concluded that the act authorized his extradition and dismissed the petitioner\u2019s application for the writ. The petitioner has appealed. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The petitioner, Kenneth Clark, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he claimed that, because he is not a fugitive from justice, the respondent, the commissioner of correction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is illegally retaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>petitioner in his custody. On April 3,2003, the petitioner was arrested in Connecticut without a warrant, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-170,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a fugitive from justice on an outstanding felony charge from the state of Texas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the petitioner refused to waive his right to challenge extradition, the trial court, <em>B. Kaplan, J., </em>ordered the petitioner confined to enable the state to obtain a governor\u2019s extradition warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The facts of this case are uncontested. In 1996, the petitioner had been extradited involuntarily from Texas to this state because of an outstanding parole violation. After having been returned to this state, the petitioner was incarcerated here until April, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In pursuit of his request for extradition in the present case, the governor of Texas sent to our governor a written demand, dated April 17,2003, for the extradition of the petitioner. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-157 et seq. In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 54-159,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>extradition demand stated that the petitioner had been charged with the commission of a crime in the state of Texas, \u201cwas present in [Texas] at the time of the commission of said crime,\u201d \u201cthereafter fled from the justice of [Texas],\u201d and had taken refuge in Connecticut. The extradition demand consistently referred to the petitioner as a \u201cfugitive.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, on April 29, 2003, our governor exercised his power, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-163,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to issue a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The petitioner was arrested on May 2, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his status as a fugitive was heard by the habeas court, <em>Hon. William L. Hadden, Jr., </em>judge trial referee. Judge Hadden found that \u201cthe extradition papers [were] in order in satisfaction of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>utes \u00a7 54-159, that the petitioner has been identified as the individual the state of Texas seeks to extradite, there is probable cause to believe he committed a crime in that state, and he is a fugitive from justice.\u201d Accordingly, Judge Hadden dismissed the habeas petition and ordered the petitioner extradited to Texas. The petitioner now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the parties stand on common ground with regard to three important issues. First, the parties agree that the petitioner left Texas involuntarily when he was extradited to Connecticut in 1996. Second, they agree that Connecticut\u2019s version of the act draws a distinction between the extradition of a fugitive and the extradition of a nonfugitive. A demand for a fugitive imposes on the governor a mandatory duty of compliance,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> whereas a demand for a nonfugitive authorizes the governor to exercise discretion to decide whether to order extradition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Third, the parties agree that our resolution of the disputed issue of whether the petitioner is a fugitive from justice is dispositive for the outcome of this case. If we conclude that the petitioner was not a fugitive from justice, the respondent agrees with the petitioner that the present extradition demand was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The underlying issue in this appeal, therefore, concerns the relative scope of the mandatory and discretionary provisions of the act, as enacted in Connecticut. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Because this is a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. See, <em>e.g., Harris v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>271 Conn. 808, 818, 860 A.2d 715 (2004). General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z provides that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d If, on the other hand, the meaning of the statute is not plain and unambiguous, then \u201cwe [also] look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter for [interpretive guidance].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>272 Conn. 72, 76, 861 A.2d 1155 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The petitioner argues that \u00a7 5 of the act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> enacted in this state as General Statutes \u00a7 54-161,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> plainly establishes the principle that a person is not a fugitive if he was removed involuntarily from the demanding state by government compulsion. From this premise, he contends that, because he was not a fugitive under \u00a7 54-161, the extradition demand from the state of Texas was invalid because it sought to extradite him as such. This misconception caused the Texas demand to mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>lead our governor into believing that he had no discretion in deciding whether to extradite the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The respondent does not challenge the petitioner\u2019s reading of \u00a7 54-161. It argues, instead, that General Statutes \u00a7 54-158 is the applicable statute because it reflects the holdings of Connecticut common-law cases decided before the enactment of the act. It is undisputed that this case law held that a person could be deemed a fugitive even if he had been removed involuntarily from the demanding state by government compulsion. <em>Moulthrope </em>v. <em>Matus, </em>139 Conn. 272, 277-78, 93 A.2d 149 (1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 926, 73 S. Ct. 785, 97 L. Ed. 1357 (1953). The question is whether <em>Moulthrope </em>has been overruled by the enactment of \u00a7 54-161.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The uniform act was promulgated to supplement federal extradition law. Federal extradition law, which derives its authority from the United States constitution<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and from federal statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> neither requires nor prohibits the extradition of nonfugitives. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>186 Conn. 404, 408, 441 A.2d 841 (1982). By contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>under federal law, extradition of fugitives is mandatory. Once the required formalities have been satisfied, a governor must comply with an extradition demand. <em>New Mexico ex rel. Ortiz </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>524 U.S. 151, 154-55, 118 S. Ct. 1860, 141 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The uniform act not only implements the extradition requirements of federal law,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but also includes provisions \u201cdesigned to cover cases not clearly reached by existing [federal] extradition laws.\u201d Commissioners\u2019 prefatory note, Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 11 U.L.A. 292 (2003). The commissioners were aware of the fact that, prior to the adoption of the act, state courts were divided about the status of a person resisting extradition because he had left the demanding state under the legal compulsion of the state in which he was then residing. Id., \u00a7 5, commissioners\u2019 note, p. 464. To resolve this conflict, the commissioners drafted \u00a7 5, which permits the extradition of certain criminals not recognized as fugitives by some state courts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Under \u00a7 5, the extradition of those who are not fugitives is left to the discretion of the governor of the state in which the putative criminal is found. Id., pp. 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">When our legislature enacted \u00a7 5 of the act as General Statutes \u00a7 54-161, it modified the title of that section by deleting any reference to a person\u2019s leaving a demanding state under compulsion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Without changing the text of \u00a7 5, the legislature also deleted all of the commissioners\u2019 commentary about the purpose of \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-161 unconditionally provides, however, that our governor <em>\u201cmay . . . surrender </em>. . . any person in this state who is charged . . . with having violated the laws of [another] state . . . <em>even though such person left the demanding state involuntarily.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The plain language of \u00a7 54-161 supports the petitioner\u2019s argument that our extradition law does not make it mandatory to extradite a nonfugitive. No Connecticut court has directly considered whether to attribute a different meaning to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The respondent argues, however, that our case law indirectly has declined to make the distinction between fugitives and nonfugitives that \u00a7 54-161 seems to embody. He relies on two cases, <em>Barrila </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>190 Conn. 631, 461 A.2d 1375 (1983), and <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 409, both of which were decided subsequent to the enactment of the act. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Barrita </em>was a case in which the plaintiff challenged the legality of an extradition demand by asserting that he had not been present in the demanding state at the time that he allegedly committed the crime for which he was being extradited. Although the plaintiff did not contest his status as a fugitive, our Supreme Court cited <em>Moulthrope </em>for the proposition that a person is a fugitive from justice if he commits a crime in one state and is thereafter found in another state. <em>Barrila </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>190 Conn. 634-35. The dispositive issue in <em>Barrila, </em>nonetheless, was whether the plaintiff had met his burden of proving his absence from the demanding state at the relevant time. Id., 636. That issue arose under General Statutes \u00a7 54-159, not under \u00a7 54-161. <em>Barrila </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, 635-36. <em>Barrila, </em>therefore, sheds no light on the issue before us, in which the factual basis of the petitioner\u2019s claim \u2014 that he had been removed involuntarily from the demanding state by government compulsion \u2014 is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Hille v. Blake, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 409, the issue before our Supreme Court was whether an extradition warrant was invalid because the governor of this state had extradited the petitioner as a nonfugitive when the requesting papers had referred to him both as a fugitive and also as a nonfugitive. In contrast to the present case, <em>Hill </em>involved the application of General Statutes \u00a7 54-162, not \u00a7 54-161. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, 405 n.2. Furthermore, the petitioner in <em>Hill </em>\u201cat no time claimed that he was not a nonfugitive.\u201d Id., 410 n.6. Here, by contrast, the petitioner\u2019s claim focuses on his fugitive status and not on alleged inconsistencies in the extradition papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In the absence of more persuasive Connecticut authority, we must decide this case as one of first impression. Because \u00a7 54-161 replicates a provision in a uniform statute, it is useful to look for guidance to courts in other jurisdictions that have interpreted \u00a7 5 of the act. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-185; see also <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Lundburg, </em>149 Conn. 67, 70, 175 A.2d 568 (1961), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>cert. denied, 369 U.S. 819, 82 S. Ct. 831, 7 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The case law in other jurisdictions falls into two categories. One category consists of cases interpreting a version of the act that is similar to ours. The other category includes cases interpreting statutory language that differs substantively from that contained in our act.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Of those cases in the former category, the evolution of extradition law in New York is particularly enlightening regarding the effect of the enactment of \u00a7 5 on earlier state law precedents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Prior to New York\u2019s adoption of the act, New York courts had held that, in order to be considered a fugitive from justice, one need only commit a crime in one jurisdiction and later be found in another. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stilwell, </em>244 N.Y. 196, 201, 155 N.E. 98 (1926). After the enactment of the act in New York in 1936, courts in that state consistently have held, however, that the procedures set forth in New York\u2019s version of \u00a7 5<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> govern extradition cases involving persons who have been removed involuntarily from the demanding state by government compulsion. <em>People ex rel. Davis </em>v. <em>Quinlan, </em>69 Misc. 2d 708, 709, 330 N.Y.S.2d 544 (1972); <em>People ex rel. Brunner </em>v. <em>Dominy, </em>22 Misc. 2d 863, 864, 191 N.Y.S.2d 46 (1959). In such cases, extradition is contingent on the exercise of discretion by the governor. <em>People ex rel. Brunner </em>v. <em>Dominy, </em>supra, 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Florida case law provides additional support for this interpretation of \u00a7 5. In <em>Matter of Extradition of Dixon, </em>487 So. 2d 1195, 1197-98 (Fla. App.), review denied, 492 So. 2d 1335 (Fla. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1054, 107 S. Ct. 928, 93 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1987), a petitioner sought habeas relief in Florida. He had fled to Mississippi after escaping from a Florida prison. Id., 1196. He later was arrested and indicted for burglary in Mississippi. Id. Before trial on that charge, however, he was extradited back to Florida to face the escape charge. Id. After his return to Florida, a warrant from Mississippi sought his extradition to face the burglary charge. Id. The Florida District Court of Appeal held that he was not a fugitive from justice in Mississippi because, when he was extradited by Florida, he had been removed from Mississippi involuntarily. Id., 1197. According to that court, the petitioner was not subject to extradition because he had \u201cpresented unrefuted evidence that he [was] not a \u2018fugitive\u2019 in the traditional sense ... [by demonstrating that he] had not voluntarily absented himself from Mississippi.\u201d Id. <em>Matter of Extradition of Dixon </em>is factually on all fours with this case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Kansas is another state that has enacted a version of \u00a7 5 comparable to General Statutes \u00a7 54-161.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Dunn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>v. <em>Hindman, </em>18 Kan. App. 2d 537, 540, 855 P.2d 994, review denied, 253 Kan. 857 (1993), the Kansas Court of Appeals recognized that \u00a7 5 of the act, as enacted in Kansas, provides the governor of that state with discretion to grant extradition requests when the person whose extradition was sought left the demanding state under government compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The law is different in states that have adopted a nonuniform version of the act. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Bonomo </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>428 Pa. 167, 236 A.2d 810 (1968), is such a case. In <em>Haas, </em>the court held that \u201cthe involuntariness of the removal to the asylum state does not prevent the petitioner from being subject to extradition under the fugitive from justice provision of the extradition statutes.\u201d Id., 170. Pennsylvania, however, has enacted a version of the act that prohibits Pennsylvania\u2019s governor from exercising discretion pursuant to \u00a7 5 because, except in cases involving \u00a7 6, it required <em>all </em>extradition warrants to \u201callege that the person sought \u2018fled\u2019 from the demanding state.\u201d Id., 171 n.2. The fact that, under Pennsylvania law, a governor does not have discretion to deny an extradition demand does not enlighten the proper interpretation of \u00a7 5 of the act in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Similarly, Texas law has been inhospitable to claims based on a statutory distinction between voluntary and involuntary absence from a demanding state. The respondent cites a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, <em>Landry </em>v. <em>A-Able Bonding, </em>75 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir. 1996). That case involved claims of false imprisonment and violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and did not address any of the issues presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Although other Texas cases interpreting that state\u2019s version of \u00a7 5<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> have declined to give relief from extradition to a nonfugitive, they have done so on grounds other than those at issue in this case. <em>In Ex Parte Guinn, </em>284 S.W.2d 721 (Tex. Crim. App. 1955), the petitioner unsuccessfully defended against extradition because he was involuntarily removed from the demanding state. Without ruling on it directly, the court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim because of the language of Texas\u2019 version of \u00a7 5 of the act. Id., 722. In <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>812 S.W.2d 439, 440-41 (Tex. App. 1991), the court, recognizing the difference between the text in the act and Texas law, held that, under Texas\u2019 version of \u00a7 5, \u201cextradition is permitted even though a person leaves the demanding state involuntarily\u201d; id.; and that \u201c[t]his situation would necessarily not involve an allegation that [the person] fled the state . . . .\u201d Id., 441. The court concluded that, \u201cunder the disjunctive language of [\u00a7 3], it is unnecessary to allege all the requirements of Section 3 ... in the form of the demand.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Although California also has enacted a nonuniform version of the act,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> its courts have adopted the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>rale as that of New York, Florida and Kansas. The California Supreme Court has held that the procedures set forth in California\u2019s version of \u00a7 5 of the act govern the extradition of persons who have been removed involuntarily from California by government compulsion. <em>In re Patterson, </em>64 Cal. 2d 357, 363-64, 411 P.2d 897, 49 Cal. Rptr. 801 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Consistent with the majority of courts that have interpreted \u00a7 5 of the act, we hold that it governs the extradition of persons who have been removed involuntarily from the demanding state by government compulsion and that such persons properly are treated as nonfugi-tives. In our view, it is persuasive that our legislature enacted both \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 5 of the act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-159 and 54-161, respectively, without substantive alteration. It thereby manifested its intention that the governor\u2019s authority to order extradition depends on the status of the individual sought as having left the demanding state voluntarily or involuntarily. Its manifest intention necessarily requires limitation of <em>Moulthrope </em>v. <em>Matus, </em>supra, 139 Conn. 272, to cases involving fugitives rather than nonfugitives.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Because the petitioner in this case was removed involuntarily from Texas to Connecticut, his status visa-vis Texas is that of a nonfugitive. The extradition demand, which described the petitioner as a fugitive from justice, therefore, is void. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 410 n.6 (recognizing that extradition warrant is invalid where accused proves in habeas proceeding that his or her status does not conform to status indicated on extradition papers).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment issuing a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\"> The petitioner\u2019s original habeas petition named Connecticut state police Detective Jeffrey Correia as the respondent. The habeas court\u2019s memorandum of decision, however, named the respondent as an official from the department of correction. We note that the petitioner is being held by the department of correction on the basis of the governor\u2019s extradition warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and by Detective Correia as the governor\u2019s duly authorized agent for extradition purposes. The governor\u2019s extradition warrant, therefore, authorized both named respondents to place the petitioner into custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-170 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe arrest of a person may be lawfully made also by any peace officer or a private person, without a warrant, upon reasonable information that the accused stands charged in the courts of a state with a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\"> On July, 16, 2002, the state of Texas charged the petitioner with the crime of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of fourteen.
