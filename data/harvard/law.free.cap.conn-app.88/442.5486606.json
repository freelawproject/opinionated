Kennedy, which arose out of the alleged noncompliance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>defendant, Leanna L. Kennedy, with the plaintiffs court-ordered visitation of the parties\u2019 children. We reverse in part the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">A lengthy discussion of the case history is unnecessary given the limited issue before us. The defendant has sole custody of the parties\u2019 three children. The plaintiff has limited visitation rights. The parties have had numerous heated disagreements over the terms and scheduling of visitation, the police having been called on several occasions to settle disputes. In this case, the plaintiff filed several motions, including a motion for the recusal of the trial court judge and two motions for contempt due to the defendant\u2019s alleged interference with visitation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing on the motions consumed nearly an entire day of testimony. During the hearing, it became clear to the court that the parties offered differing views of the wishes of the children with respect to visitation with the plaintiff. The court, therefore, determined that it would appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the children. The court, however, decided the plaintiffs motion for contempt that is the subject of this appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> without first hearing from the guardian ad litem. The plaintiff claims that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to do so, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u201cA finding of contempt is a question of fact, and our standard of review is to determine whether the court abused its discretion in failing to find that the actions or inactions of the [party] were in contempt of a court order. To constitute contempt, a party\u2019s conduct must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>be wilful. . . . Noncompliance alone will not support a judgment of contempt. \u201c (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Behrns </em>v. <em>Behrns, </em>80 Conn. App. 286, 289, 835 A.2d 68 (2003), cert. denied, 267 Conn. 914, 840 A.2d 1173 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">A principal issue at the hearing on the motion for contempt was whether the defendant reasonably refused to comply with the court\u2019s visitation orders because the children did not want to visit with the plaintiff. The court did not hear from the unrepresented children regarding whether the defendant kept them from seeing the plaintiff or if the children for good reason refused to visit. Despite its express wish to hear the children\u2019s views, the court did not wait to do so. For that reason, a new hearing on the plaintiffs motion is warranted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for contempt, number 223, and the case is remanded for a new hearing on that motion. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-14\"> This is one of five recent appeals involving these parties. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>83 Conn. App. 106, 847 A.2d 1104, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 915, 853 A.2d 530 (2004). Two other appeals, AC 25220 and AC 25425, were dismissed as moot and another, AC 25802, is pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> The record is inadequate to review the plaintiffs claim challenging the court\u2019s denial of his motion for recusal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> The plaintiff at oral argument abandoned his claim that the court improperly denied his motion for contempt, number 222 in the court file, in connection with the defendant\u2019s alleged interference with vacation time he had claimed he was entitled to have with the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> This is not the first time that we have expressed our concern regarding the lack of independent counsel for the parties\u2019 children in this matter. In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>83 Conn. App. 106, 114 n.8, 847 A.2d 1104, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 915, 853 A.2d 530 (2004), we stated: \u201cWe note that a matter of concern to this court is the absence of independent counsel acting on behalf of the minor children in what was clearly an embattled custody dispute. The purpose of appointing counsel for a minor child in a [custody matter] is to ensure independent representation of the child\u2019s interest and such representation must be entrusted to the professional judgment of appointed counsel within the usual constraints applicable to such representation. . . . Whenever child custody is seriously contested, it is preferable to appoint independent counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) That opinion was published after the hearing that is the subject of this appeal, but our concern remains the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
