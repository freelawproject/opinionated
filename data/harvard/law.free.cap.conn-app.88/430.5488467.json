Because we are constrained by our Supreme Court\u2019s construction of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (formerly \u00a7 366), as explained in <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>137 Conn. 277, 278-79, 77 A.2d 80 (1950), we answer that question in the affirmative,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mindful that it is not within the province of an intermediate appellate court to overrule the Supreme Court. <em>Hanes </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>65 Conn. App. 224, 230 n.6, 783 A.2d 1 (2001); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Otero, </em>49 Conn. App. 459, 468 n.9, 715 A.2d 782, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 910, 719 A.2d 905 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Valley View Associates and Kings Highway Associates, appeal from the August 4, 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>judgment of strict foreclosure rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, RAL Management, Inc. On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure notwithstanding the fact that their filing of an answer had, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 17-32 and 17-33, automatically opened the default previously entered against them, and (2) enforced an illegal note by reforming the usurious rate of interest contained therein without an evidentiary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On November 29, 2004, the Appellate Court sent notice to the parties that they should \u201cbe prepared to address at oral argument any questions the court may have as to why the appeal should not be dismissed as moot in light of the fact that the judgment that was appealed has been opened and, thus, is no longer in effect. See <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>[supra, 137 Conn. 277]; <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 106 [616 A.2d 798] (1992).\u201d Although both parties assert that this court has jurisdiction and that the appeal is not moot, \u201ca subject matter jurisdictional defect may not be waived . . . [or] conferred by the parties, explicitly or implicitly. . . . [T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . and, once raised, either by a party or by the court itself, the question must be answered before the court may decide the case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 337, 819 A.2d 803 (2003). On the basis of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11, as interpreted by <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 278-79, we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our decision. On July 20, 1998, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>entered into a $250,000 loan transaction with the plaintiffs assignor, Timothy McDonald. Pursuant to that transaction, McDonald loaned the principal sum of $87,000 to the defendants and the principal sum of $163,000 to a related party, Kersten Rigi (Rigi note). Each loan was memorialized by a promissory note payable to McDonald. The $87,000 note provided that, if any of the payments provided for under the terms of the note were in default, interest would run at the rate of 30 percent per month, for a total of 360 percent per annum. The Rigi note, however, did not provide for a default rate of interest. On July 23,1998, the defendants additionally guaranteed and warranted the prompt payment of all obligations under the Rigi note. To secure the note and guaranty, the defendants mortgaged to McDonald real property, located at 320-322 Kings Highway in North Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On July 28, 2000, McDonald assigned his interest in the notes and mortgage to the plaintiff. On April 3,2001, claiming that the principal and interest due on July 20, 1999, under both notes had not been paid, the plaintiff exercised its right under the mortgage notes to declare the entire balance due and payable and sought to foreclose on the mortgage. On July 9, 2001, the defendants were defaulted for failure to plead. Approximately nineteen months after the defendants were defaulted, the plaintiff, on February 27, 2003, filed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendants then filed an answer and three special defenses: (1) the interest rate of the $87,000 note was unconscionable and usurious; (2) the note was invalid and unenforceable because of mutual mistake; and (3) the plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment of strict foreclosure because of unclean hands, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and unfair trade practices. The plaintiffs motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure was heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and granted on May 5, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court determined the amount of the debt to be $191,167.50 on the basis of the affidavit of debt filed by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On May 23, 2003, the defendants filed a motion to reargue the judgment of strict foreclosure, which was heard on July 3, 2003. The defendants argued that the note was unconscionable and usurious because it contained a default interest rate of 30 percent per month. Counsel for the plaintiff explained that, despite the earlier demands for payment with a 30 percent per month default rate of interest, the 30 percent per month was a scrivener\u2019s error that should have read 30 percent per year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before the court rendered its decision on the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue, the defendants filed a motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure, alleging that there was no evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s judgment as to the amount of the debt. On August 4, 2003, after a hearing, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to open and ordered reentry of a judgment of strict foreclosure, setting a law day of September 22, 2003, and again setting the debt at $191,167.50. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">It is the events that occurred after the timely filing of this appeal from the August 4, 2003 judgment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>raised the issue of mootness. Prior to oral argument before this court, the parties were ordered to be prepared to discuss the issue of mootness in light of the following additional procedural history of this case. Although both parties argue that the appeal is not moot, we are constrained because of <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 278-79, to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">On August 20, 2003, the defendants appealed from the August 4, 2003 judgment of strict foreclosure, which initiated an automatic stay of the foreclosure. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 30, 2003, the plaintiff filed a motion to terminate the automatic stay pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (c) and (d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On October 30, 2003, the trial court granted the motion to terminate the automatic stay, with notice to the parties dated November 7, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On November 10, 2003, the defendants filed with this court a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s order terminating the automatic stay. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-14 and 66-6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court denied the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>motion on December 9, 2003. The defendants then filed a motion for reconsideration of that denial on December 19, 2003. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 71-5 and 71-6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">However, the plaintiff, on December, 1, 2003, had filed a new motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure with the trial court, and, on December 22, 2003, the trial court granted that motion, set a new law day of February 23, 2004, and rendered a new judgment of strict foreclosure. The court also reset the debt to $423,735.98, now including the $163,000 guaranty of the Rigi note.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On January 14, 2004, this court granted the defendants\u2019 December 19, 2003 motion for reconsideration of our denial of the their motion for review of the trial court\u2019s termination of the automatic stay. After sua sponte ordering the trial court to articulate the basis of its decision to terminate the automatic stay, this court, on July 8, 2004, almost seven months after the trial court had opened the judgment and set new law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>days, granted the defendants\u2019 motion for review and vacated the order of the trial court terminating the automatic stay. The appellate stay, thus, remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The question of mootness arises because the trial court opened the August 4, 2003 judgment of strict foreclosure, from which this appeal derived, and, on December 22, 2003, rendered a new judgment of strict foreclosure, with a revised debt and a new law day. On the basis of our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 278-79, we are constrained to conclude that the new judgment rendered on December 22, 2003, extinguished any prior judgment, thereby rendering this appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u201cAlthough the filing of an appeal stays further proceedings to enforce or carry out the judgment, this does not preclude the filing and granting of a motion to [open a] judgment while the appeal is pending. <em>Milford Trust [Co.] </em>indicates that if the court were to grant such a motion, the operative effect would be to render void any appeal that might have been taken from the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cIf a motion to [open a] judgment is filed during the appeal period, the time for filing the appeal then commences from the issuance of notice of the decision on the motion, as provided in Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 .... This rule can have profound effects on a foreclosure decree, since Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 stays \u2018proceedings to enforce or carry out the judgment . . . until the time to take an appeal has expired.\u2019 Thus, law days in a strict foreclosure cannot run, or a sale cannot take place, if a motion to [open] was filed during the appeal period but has yet to be ruled upon; any redemption or auction under such circumstances would be violative of the automatic stay, and any title derived through such stayed proceedings would be subject to defeasance.\u201d D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Caron &amp; G. Milne, Connecticut Foreclosures (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 17.06, p. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 278, the initial judgment of foreclosure, rendered on May 5, 1950, automatically was stayed under the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 366, now \u00a7 61-11, upon the defendant\u2019s appeal from that judgment. On June 8, 1950, the plaintiff filed a motion for execution, which was granted by the trial court, and the court extended the law days until June 13, 1950. <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 277-78. Pursuant to a motion by a subsequent encumbrancer, the trial court, on June 13, 1950, opened the May 5, 1950 judgment for the sole purpose of extending the dates of redemption to July 10, 1950; in all other respects, the judgment of May 5, 1950, was reentered. Id., 278. On appeal, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant\u2019s appeal of the May 5, 1950 judgment was rendered moot by the court\u2019s opening of that judgment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Our Supreme Court agreed with the plaintiff and explained: \u201cUpon the filing of [the defendant\u2019s] appeal . . . Practice Book \u00a7 366 [now \u00a7 61-11] became operative to stay further proceedings under the [initial] judgment of May 5, precluding the passage of title upon any of the law days provided for in that judgment. . . . This did not, however, militate against the [trial] court\u2019s right to open the [initial] judgment ... for this [right] is not affected by beginning or not beginning an appeal. . . . The court\u2019s order of June 8 involved a modification of the judgment of May 5 and necessarily implied an opening of the preceding judgment which it modified and a complete substitution for its operative portions. [It] was in essence and substance a new judgment. . . . Since the court\u2019s order of June 8 was operative to open the judgment of May 5, the case then stood as though that judgment as originally entered had never been rendered.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In this case, although the August 4, 2003 judgment was stayed by the filing of the appeal and by our vacating of the trial court\u2019s termination of the stay, the court was not precluded from opening the judgment, modifying its provisions and rendering a new judgment of strict foreclosure. See id. Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 serves to stay \u201cproceedings to enforce or carry out the judgment . . . until the time to take an appeal has expired,\u201d thereby forbidding the running of the law days in a strict foreclosure or a sale in a foreclosure by sale. See D. Caron <em>&amp; </em>G. Milne, supra, \u00a7 17.06, p. 395. However, under <em>Milford Trust Co., </em>Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 apparently does not prevent the court from opening a judgment of strict foreclosure, setting new law days and rendering a new judgment of strict foreclosure from which title could then be derived unless a new appeal was filed. See id.; <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We have struggled with this decision because we find the result particularly harsh especially in light of the fact that we agree with the claim of the plaintiff that there was no evidence before the trial court to allow a reformation of the interest rate to 30 percent per annum. Additionally, we think that <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>creates a judicially inefficient result. As we explained in <em>Pavliscak </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>48 Conn. App. 580, 711 A.2d 747, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 911, 718 A.2d 17 (1998), a case criticized by commentators; see, e.g., W. Horton <em>&amp; </em>K. Bartschi, Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut Rules of Appellate Procedure (2005 Ed.) \u00a7 61-11, comment 3, p. 109;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[i]t is fundamental to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>judicial process that a party\u2019s right to judicial review shall not be obliterated or undermined by the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction by the court whose doings are, or may be, subject to review. ... A party accorded the right of appellate review is entitled to the full and unhampered exercise of that right in accordance with the applicable rules of practice or statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pavliscak </em>v. <em>Bridgeport </em>Hospital, supra, 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In Pavliscak, while an appeal was pending and a stay was in effect, the trial court set aside the verdict and rendered judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Id., 585-86. The defendant argued that the court\u2019s action was not improper because it was not a proceeding to enforce or carry out the judgment but, rather, was an effectuation of the court\u2019s original order. Id., 588. We held that the court\u2019s action violated the automatic stay because it \u201cserved to change completely the complexion of the case while the underlying basis of that action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>was being challenged on appeal.\u201d Id., 588-89. Accordingly, we held that the order was void and that the case stood in the same procedural posture that existed at the time the appeal was filed. Id., 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">We are unable to reconcile the holding in <em>Pavliscak </em>with the holding in <em>Milford Trust Co., </em>and, although we agree with <em>Pavliscak, </em>we are constrained to follow the law as set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>Nevertheless, we feel the need to explain what we see as an inefficient and perhaps unworkable result. Consider, for example, an appeal from a judgment of strict foreclosure that is upheld by the Appellate Court and in which certification to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court. What if shortly after oral argument before the Supreme Court, the trial court was to open the judgment simply to reset the law days as sometimes is done?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under <em>Milford Trust Co., </em>the appeal that has gone through the Appellate Court and has been argued before the Supreme Court now would be rendered moot and a new appeal would have to be taken from this new judgment. This potentially results in a series of aborted piecemeal appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Nevertheless, in this case, the August 4, 2003 judgment was opened on December 22, 2003, a revised debt was found, new law days were set and a new judgment of strict foreclosure was rendered. In accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 278-79, it is as though the August 4, 2003 judgment never was rendered, and any appeal therefrom is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-10\"> Athough we are constrained to follow the direction of our Supreme Court in <em>Milford Trust Co., </em>we have no way of assessing whether there was some special nuance in that case that led the Supreme Court to its determination. Because the case was dismissed on a motion, there are no appellate briefs or a record in the bound volumes of the Supreme Court records and briefs that would assist us with such an assessment. For that reason, we must accept the case on its face.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-11\"> Also named as defendants in the original complaint were Kersten Rigi and the law firm of DiSerio, Martin, O\u2019Connor and Castiglioni, LLP (law firm). The complaint as to Rigi was withdrawn on February 27, 2003, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the law firm is not a party to this appeal. Accordingly, we refer to Valley View Associates and Kings Highway Associates as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> The defendants assert that they did not have notice that the plaintiff would be going forward with this motion on May 5, 2003.

App. 586-89], the Appellate Court held that this rule prevents atrial judge from granting amotion which dramatically changes the judgment while the appeal is pending. <em>Pavliscak </em>is clearly wrong. Under <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>243 Conn. 471, 706 A.2d 960 (1998), the trial court has the power to open a judgment and enter a wholly new one even though an appeal is pending. Where the Appellate Court went wrong was in equating execution on the judgment (which this rule governs) with significant alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ation of the judgment (which this rule does not govern). The Supreme Court may have denied certification because the trial judge was prevented for other valid reasons from granting the motion.\u201d W. Horton &amp; K. Bartschi, supra, \u00a7 61-11, comment 3, p. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">We do not agree with the commentators\u2019 reading of <em>Ahneman </em>as holding that the trial court has the blanket power to \u201copen a judgment and enter a wholly new one even though an appeal is pending.\u201d Id. Rather, we read <em>Ahneman </em>as holding that the trial court is allowed to act on subsequent motions dealing with financial issues during the pendency of an appeal in a family matter. In such a case, the underlying appeal is not rendered moot by the court\u2019s action on the subsequent motion. We also recognize that Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (b) specifically excludes from the provisions of the automatic stay certain financial orders: \u201cIn addition, no automatic stay shall apply to . . . orders of periodic alimony, support, custody or visitation in domestic relations matters brought pursuant to chapter 25 or to any later modification of such orders. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (b). Although this provision of our rules of practice was amended to include this language in 2001, it was amended <em>\u201cto make clear </em>that there is no automatic stay of rulings that modify certain orders in domestic relations matters brought pursuant to Chapter 25.\u201d (Emphasis added.) W. Horton &amp; K. Bartschi, supra, \u00a7 61-11, official commentary to 2001 amendments, p. 104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> We recognize that the trial court, at times, opens a judgment solely to reset the law days while a case is on appeal. Under <em>Milford Trust Go., </em>this action renders the underlying appeal moot. The oddity this presents, however, is that normally the appellate courts are not aware of the action of the trial court subsequent to the taking of the appeal, and, unless the parties were to raise the issue of mootness on appeal, the fact that the appeal had been rendered moot by the setting of new law days would never be considered on appeal, and the appellate courts, in effect, would be rendering a decision, without subject matter jurisdiction, on a judgment that no longer existed. In the case before us today, we are aware of the subsequent proceedings only because of the unusual procedural history of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
