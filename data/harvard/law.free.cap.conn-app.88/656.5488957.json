On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">The defendant was convicted of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 and sentenced on November 21, 2000, to six years imprisonment, execution suspended, and three years of probation. The special conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation required him to receive counseling for domestic violence and prohibited him from harming, threatening or harassing Shante Brown and her nephew, Rashan Bostic. The defendant was later found to be in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>of his probation and was sentenced on August 10, 2001, to six years imprisonment, execution suspended after one year, and four years of probation. In addition to the same special conditions of probation that were mandated at the November, 2000 sentencing, the court also required the defendant to be evaluated and treated for substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">On December 27, 2002, while the defendant was visiting Brown\u2019s apartment in Hamden, he became involved in an argument with her brother, Jonathan W. Robinson. Bostic was also present in the apartment. Brown told the defendant to leave. A security officer on routine patrol for Southern Connecticut State University, which is adjacent to Brown\u2019s apartment building, saw the defendant in the building\u2019s courtyard. According to the security officer, David McNeice, Jr., the defendant yelled up to Brown\u2019s apartment, threatening to kill someone. The defendant then left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">McNeice summoned Hamden police, who interviewed Brown, Bostic and Robinson. Bostic and Robinson also provided written statements. Bostic\u2019s written statement indicated that the defendant had tried to stab Bostic. Robinson\u2019s written statement indicated that the defendant had thrown a bottle at Robinson, tried to stab Bostic and threw rocks at one of the apartment\u2019s windows, nearly hitting Brown. Later that evening, the defendant visited the Hamden police department to file a complaint against Robinson. The defendant was then arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, risk of injury to a child and threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The defendant\u2019s probation officer secured an arrest warrant for the defendant on the basis of the incident at Brown\u2019s apartment. The court held an evidentiary hearing on January 26, 2004, and found that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>court stated: \u201cThe court finds particularly persuasive the testimony of Officer McNeice, and that the threat was made by [the defendant] to kill and [that] it was directed to Shante Brown. That alone would persuade the court that there has been a violation of probation, but also the court finds that there was a threatening and violence directed to Mr. Robinson and Mr. Bostic.\u201d On January 29, 2004, the court sentenced the defendant to five years imprisonment, execution suspended after three years, and two years of probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence the written statement that Robinson provided to the police. On direct examination by the state at trial, Robinson contradicted his written statement. Robinson testified that he had pushed the defendant and that Bostic mistakenly had believed that the defendant had a knife in his pocket. In light of Robinson\u2019s contradiction, the court told Robinson that his written statement had been made under oath and advised him of his right to remain silent. The prosecutor ended the direct examination and suggested that the court use Robinson\u2019s written statement for substantive purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court responded: \u201cAll right.\u201d We conclude that we need not reach the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">A probation revocation proceeding consists of an adjudicative phase and a dispositional phase. In the adjudicative phase, \u201c[a] trial court . . . makes a factual determination of whether a condition of probation has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>been violated. In making its factual determination, the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence. . . . Our review is limited to whether such a finding was clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174, 185, 842 A.2d 567 (2004). Only the adjudicative phase of the present case is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">After reviewing the evidence, the court found that McNeice\u2019s unchallenged testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s threat, in and of itself, was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation. Therefore, additional findings, although made, were not necessary to support the court\u2019s decision. Because the court\u2019s finding of a violation of probation was based on McNeice\u2019s testimony, we determine that the finding is not clearly erroneous and therefore need not address the propriety of the court\u2019s consideration of Robinson\u2019s written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> Our Supreme Court has adopted \u201ca rule allowing the substantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S.
