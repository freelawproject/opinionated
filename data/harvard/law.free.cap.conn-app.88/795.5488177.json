On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court (1) violated the 120 day rule set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b and (2) improperly applied the doctrine of res judicata.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with plaintiffs second claim and, accordingly, reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision sets forth the following facts: \u201cThe parties\u2019 seventeen year marriage was dissolved on March 19, 1992. The parties had made agreements incident to the dissolution. The agreements of the parties were approved by the court and incorporated by reference in the judgment. ... A separation agreement dated March 19, 1992, contained the provision regarding alimony in article III thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">\u201c \u2018Ten years from the date hereof, unless sooner terminated, alimony shall be reduced to One ($1.00) Dollar per year, modifiable upwards only in the event of the Wife\u2019s medical disability which prevents the Wife from gainful employment ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The court also found, after reviewing its file, that the \u201cplaintiff had previously filed for a modification of alimony [on February 23, 2000]. . . . [0]n May 18, 2001, there had been a full evidentiary hearing on that motion. That motion was denied by the court on June 20, 2001. Barely seven months after the denial of that motion, [the] plaintiff, with new counsel, filed the present motion for modification now before the court. The court noted the similarity of the grounds asserted for modification on the two postjudgment motions to modify. This raised the question whether the denial of the earlier motion was a bar to the plaintiffs proceeding again on what appeared to be the same claim.\u201d Following a hearing on a motion in limine, the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the new motion for modification was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The plaintiff first raises a jurisdictional issue. She maintains that \u00a7 51-183b, which sets time limits for rendering judgments in civil actions, specifically requires that \u201c[a]ny judge of the Superior Court . . . who has commenced the trial of any civil cause, shall have power to continue such trial and shall render judgment not later than one hundred and twenty days from the completion date of the trial of such civil cause. . . .\u201d She maintains that the trial court last heard argument on July 20,2002, and that she moved for an order on February 10,2003, asserting that the court had lost jurisdiction because no decision had been reached by the court and 120 days had passed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject this claim and hold that a hearing held for the very purpose of determining whether a second and subsequent trial or hearing is precluded or barred is not a \u201ctrial\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Because this claim involves the construction of a statute, our review of the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 51-183b is plenary. See <em>Nunno </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>257 Conn. 671, 677, 778 A.2d 145 (2001); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Ankerman, </em>74 Conn. App. 464, 470, 812 A.2d 169, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 911, 821 A.2d 767 (2003). The bill before the legislature, which later was codified as the antecedent of \u00a7 51-183b, was signed into law on February 20, 1879, and took effect from its passage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its original form, it empowered a judge \u201cwho shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>have commenced the trial of any cause,\u201d to continue such trial and render judgment after the expiration of the term of the court at which such trial commenced. It required, however, that the trial be completed and judgment rendered before the close of the next succeeding term. As originally adopted, the statute did not define the term \u201ctrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">If, in fact, the July 20, 2002 proceeding constituted a \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 51-183b, then the 120 day rule would apply, and the plaintiffs assertion of that statute on February 10, 2003, would have voided the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to render a decision. If that proceeding did not constitute a \u201ctrial,\u201d then the 120 day rule set forth in \u00a7 51-183b would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">No definition of what constitutes a trial is to be found in \u00a7 51-183b. \u201c[I]n the absence of other statutory . . . guidance, we may appropriately look to the meaning of the [word] as commonly expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vitti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 169, 178, 713 A.2d 1269 (1998). The New College Edition of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1983) defines a trial as: \u201cThe examination of evidence and applicable law by a competent tribunal to determine the issue of specified charges or claims.\u201d In interpreting General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a, the offer of judgment statute, our Supreme Court found a similar definition to be pertinent: \u201cBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) defines trial as \u2018[a] formal judicial examination of evidence and determination of legal claims in an adversary proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nunno </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In <em>Nunno, </em>our Supreme Court was required to interpret \u00a7 52-192a. That statute requires a trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>examine the record \u201c[a]fter trial,\u201d and, if \u201cthe plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater\u201d than his offer of judgment, to assess 12 percent interest on the amount. General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b). In <em>Nunno, </em>the plaintiff sought the benefit of the offer of judgment statute after an arbitration proceeding which had become a final judgment because no timely petition for a trial de novo had been filed by the defendant. Our Supreme Court, although noting that some evidence had been taken during the arbitration, interpreted the definition of trial narrowly and determined that, because of the informality of the arbitration proceedings, those proceedings did not constitute a \u201ctrial\u201d that would trigger the right to imposition of interest \u201cafter trial\u201d under the statute. <em>Nunno </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">A fortiori, where <em>no evidence </em>is taken by the trial court in hearing argument on a motion in limine, the proceeding, which solely involves the arguments of the attorneys, cannot be considered a trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>tiff concedes that she did not have an evidentiary hearing on her motion. In fact, the entire July 20, 2002 hearing centered around the defendant\u2019s motion in limine contesting whether the plaintiff was entitled to offer evidence at a hearing because she had raised the same issue in an earlier proceeding before the court, <em>B. Fischer, J. </em>After careful consideration, we conclude that the General Assembly did not intend to include within the definition of \u201ctrial,\u201d for purposes of the 120 day rule found in \u00a7 51-183b, arguments on motions addressed to whether a plaintiff is precluded from an evidentiary hearing or trial because of a prior trial on the same or similar issues between the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs claim that the court\u2019s decision was void under the provisions of \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly applied the doctrine of res judicata. We conclude that this is the principal issue to be decided in this appeal and that it is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Initially, we set forth the standard of review that governs our examination of this issue. \u201cThe issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>whether the doctrine of res judicata is applicable to the facts of the present case is a question of law. Accordingly, our review is plenary.\u201d <em>Gaynor </em>v. Payne, 261 Conn. 585, 595, 804 A.2d 170 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">\u201cThe principles underlying the doctrine of res judi-cata, or claim preclusion, are well settled. [A] valid, final judgment rendered on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is an absolute bar to a subsequent action between the same parties, or those in privity with them, upon the same claim or demand. . . . Furthermore, the doctrine of claim preclusion . . . bars not only subsequent relitigation of a claim previously asserted, but subsequent relitigation of any claims relating to the same cause of action which were actually made or which might have been made.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In <em>Borkowski </em>v. Borkowski, 228 Conn. 729, 638 A.2d 1060 (1994), our Supreme Court held: \u201cApplicable to dissolution actions, as well as to other kinds of litigation, is the principle that an adjudication by a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties is final and conclusive not only as to matters actually determined, but as to matters which the parties might have litigated as incident thereto and coming within the legitimate purview of the subject matter of the action. . . . This policy of avoiding duplicitous litigation is particularly important in the context of family law where courts should welcome the opportunity to ease the burden of post-divorce litigation over enforcement or modification of alimony claims . . . and attempt to foster amicable dissolution and certainty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">We agree with the defendant in the present case that the central issue arises out of that portion of the dissolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>tion of marriage agreement that states: \u201cTen years from the date hereof, unless sooner terminated, alimony shall be reduced to One ($1.00) Dollar per year, modifiable upwards only in the event of the Wife\u2019s medical disability which prevents the Wife from gainful employment . . . .\u201d This issue was first presented to the court, <em>B. Fischer, J., </em>on May 18, 2001, ten months before the ten year period expired. We do not agree, however, that the court, <em>Parker, J., </em>properly determined that the plaintiffs later motion, heard after the ten year anniversary of the divorce had passed, seeking to avoid the reduction of alimony to $1 per year was \u201cbarred by the doctrine of res judicata\u201d because Judge Fischer had denied the plaintiff relief prior to the ten year anniversary having occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">As a part of our plenary review of Judge Parker\u2019s holding that there was a res judicata bar to the later motion, we review the factual findings and legal conclusions of the court. The court held that the claim made in the motion for alimony modification was \u201cmade in the earlier motion,\u201d and it found that \u201c[t]he reason or reasons for the denial of the earlier motion are unknown [to the court].\u201d However, the key provision at issue in the stipulation and agreement of the parties that was incorporated into the dissolution decree provided that if alimony had not been terminated earlier, it automatically would be reduced to $1 per year ten years from the date of the decree unless a medical disability prevented the plaintiff from gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The plaintiffs counsel stated that she thought Judge Fischer\u2019s denial of the earlier motion was made on the basis of prematurity because, at the time the motion was made, the ten year anniversary of the decree had not yet been reached. In its memorandum of decision, the court addressed this statement of counsel, stating that it was \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201can unadulterated acknowledgement by the plaintiff that the claim made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>in the earlier motion is the same made in the motion now before the court.\u201d The court also reasoned: \u201cOn May 18, 2001, the plaintiffs counsel told the court: \u2018[The plaintiff] . . . has no reasonable prospects for future employment ever. That evidence is not contradicted.\u2019 The plaintiff can not now disavow the position her counsel maintained on her behalf at the May 18, 2001 hearing on her earlier motion. \u2018A party is bound by a concession made during the trial by his attorney. <em>Kiss </em>v. <em>Kahm, </em>132 Conn. 593, 595, 46 A.2d 337 [1946]; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Lassoff </em>125 Conn. 736, 737, 7 A.2d 435 [1939]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuller, </em>34 Conn. 280, 294 [1867]; 9 [J.] Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 2594, 2597. The employment of new counsel does not affect the validity of a concession made. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>95 Cal. 279, 289, 30 P. 529 [1892].\u2019 <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Pezenik, </em>137 Conn. 442, 448, 78 A.2d 546 (1951). Oral concessions made by a party\u2019s attorney during a colloquy with the court constitute judicial admissions. <em>Kopacz </em>v. <em>Day Kimball Hospital of Windham County, Inc., </em>64 Conn. App. 263, 779 A.2d 862 (2001). \u2018Judicial admissions are voluntary and knowing concessions of fact by a party or a party\u2019s attorney occurring during judicial proceedings. ... A judicial admission is, in truth, a substitute for evidence, in that it does away with the need for evidence.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>52 Conn. App. 85, 89-90, 726 A.2d 119 (1999), aff'd, 253 Conn. 639, 756 A.2d 833 (2000). \u2018A party is bound by a judicial admission unless the court, in the exercise of its discretion, permits the admission to be withdrawn, explained or modified. . . . <em>Days Inn of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>161 Hotel Group, Inc., </em>55 Conn. App. 118, 127, 739 A.2d 280 (1999).\u2019 <em>Kopacz </em>v. <em>Day Kimball Hospital of Windham County, Inc., </em>supra, 272-73. In fairness, the plaintiffs present attorney has not denied that her present claim was made in her earlier motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In our opinion, a \u201cconcession\u201d by the plaintiffs attorney in the May 18, 2001 proceeding could not govern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>what the plaintiffs health would be ten months later when the ten year anniversary of the dissolution occurred, which, according to the decree, triggered diminution of the annual alimony to $1 per year unless the plaintiff was medically disabled and unable to maintain gainful employment. Her attorney was not possessed of some divine omniscience that accurately could predict events and conditions in the future. Although we acknowledge that a party may be bound by an admission of her attorney as to some past event, it is impossible for her attorney to make an \u201cadmission\u201d as to what will happen in the future as to his Ghent\u2019s health. Further, the court acknowledged that it did not know the basis for the denial of the plaintiffs earlier motion, and, even if it were based on the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was not medically disabled at that time, such a finding would not preclude the plaintiff from relitigating that issue should her health change.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Here, the plaintiff is possessed of a right under her dissolution decree to have the court hear evidence of her disability and her inability to maintain gainful employment. The denial of her earlier motion for modification, whether based on the same or a similar claim of medical disability, should not automatically bar her renewed motion, nor should the defendant be barred from again litigating a claim that the plaintiff is no longer medically disabled should her health improve at some point in the future.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new hearing on the plaintiffs motion for modification of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\"> Because we agree with the plaintiffs second claim, we need not discuss her additional claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\"> The plaintiff solely relies on General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b and not on our rules of practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\"> House Bill No. 32 entitled \u201cAn Act relating to Courts,\u201d which was approved in the 1879 session of the General Assembly, provided: <em>\u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened: </em>Section 1.

It also concluded that it could have more than one meaning, one of which could include the typical, formal evidentiary trial, the other of which could include \u201cthe investigation and decision of a matter in issue between parties <em>before a competent tribunal, </em>including all the steps taken in the case from its submission to the court or jury to the rendition of the judgment\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nunno </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 691 <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting), quoting <em>Tureck </em>v. <em>George, </em>44 Conn.
