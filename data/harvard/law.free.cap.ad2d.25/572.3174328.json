(See <em>People ex rel. Cline </em>v. <em>Herold, </em>25 A D 2d 572.) We take up appellant\u2019s various contentions in order. (1) The Surrogate\u2019s Court was not, in the then and present state of the law at least, required to assign counsel upon the hearing (see <em>People ex rel. Kamisaroff </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>13 N Y 2d 66, 71, and cf. dissenting opinion p. 72). (2) Under the statutes then existing (but since amended) notice was not required to be served upon appellant\u2019s sister, since she was not \u201cknown to be within the county\u201d (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 74, subd. 3 [as constituted Dec. 30, 1964\u2014 Jan. 13, 1965]; Correction Law, \u00a7 384 [as amd. by L. 1964, eh. 105, eff. March 16, 1964]). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the applicability to prisoners such as appellant of the succeeding provisions of subdivision 3 requiring, should there be no relative within the county, that service be made upon the person with whom he \u201cmay reside, or at whose home he may be, or in their absence, upon a friend\u201d, with no express limitation as to the place of residence of any of the persons within these latter categories; certainly service upon appellant\u2019s sister residing in Herkimer County (although not required upon her as a \u201crelative\u201d since she was not \u201cknown to be within the county\u201d of Clinton) would have to be deemed equivalent to service \u201cupon a friend\u201d; and since subdivision 3 twice provides for <em>personal </em>serviee upon the alleged mentally ill person but merely that notice \u201c <em>be served </em>upon such * * \u00bb relative * * * or * * * upon a friend\u201d (emphasis supplied) we cannot agree that the court was deprived of jurisdiction or appellant of due process because service upon the sister was by mail. (3) The application was timely as made <em>\u201cwithm </em>thirty days prior to the expiration of the term\u201d (Correction Law, \u00a7 384; emphasis supplied). Order affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"A22\">Gibson, P. J., Reynolds, Taylor, Aulisi and Hamm, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
