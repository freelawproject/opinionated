The board originally found that as a result of both injuries the decedent \u201c was caused to develop a depressed state inducing him to commit suicide\u201d and we reversed (22 A D 2d 741) because the state of the record was ambiguous as to whether the board had in fact found brain derangement or psychosis to be present or had found merely that the decedent was depressed. The board has now found \u201c that as a result of both accidental injuries deceased developed a psychosis which finally caused him to commit suicide.\u201d That the decedent committed suicide is not disputed. It is further undisputed that both the 1945 and 1954 occurrences were industrial accidents. The claimant\u2019s medical witness, an experienced psychiatrist stated that in his opinion the suicide was causally related to the injury sustained by the decedent in 1954. He characterized the decedent\u2019s mental condition as \u201cpsychosis\u201d and said that legally it could be called insanity. There were conflicting expert opinions but we think, on this record, the selection of the opinion of the claimant\u2019s expert was an exercise of fact-finding power within the province of the board and that the board\u2019s finding of causal relation between the 1954 accident and the death was supported by substantial evidence. As to the 1945 occurrence the doctor was asked whether the injury sustained \u201c played any part either directly or indirectly in this man\u2019s demise at the time it occurred.\u201d His answer was: \u201cIn my opinion it did not have a direct bearing but it was part and parcel of the predisposition of the disturbed personality which he had in the past and which played a part in his subsequent deeper reaction at the time when he was injured, after he was injured and the time he committed suicide.\u201d It appears that it was the doctor\u2019s intendment that the injury did not have \u201c a direct bearing\u201d in that it was not the immediate precipitant of the suicide; at least the board in the exercise of its fact-finding power could so construe the answer. And the doctor continued that it was a contributing cause of the decedent\u2019s mental condition, which he had denominated psychosis, at the time of the suicide. Viewed in the light of the record as a whole including the grounds on which the conclusions were based we think that the testimony, although, of course, controverted by other medical opinion, constituted substantial evidence in support of the board\u2019s findings as to the earlier accident. Decision affirmed, with costs to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.</p>\n<judges id=\"AQh\">Reynolds and Taylor, JJ., concur; Gibson, P. J., and Herlihy, J., concur in part and dissent in part, in a memorandum by Herlihy, J.:</judges>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">The board found, without taking further testimony, that the medical evidence indicated that as a result of both accidents, deceased developed a psychosis which finally caused him to commit suicide. At the time of the 1945 accident, the deceased struck his head, was unconscious for several hours, but thereafter reverted to his before-accident physical and mental status. The causal relationship found by the board between the 1945 accident and decedent\u2019s death 14 years later depends solely upon a physician\u2019s equivocal and unclear answer to the equally unsatisfactory question, whether the 1945 incident \u201cplayed any part either directly or indirectly in this man\u2019s demise\u201d. The doctor replied that \u201cit did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>direct bearing but it was part and parcel of the predisposition of the disturbed personality which he had in the past and which played a part in his subsequent deeper reaction at the time when he was injured, after he was injured and the time he committed suicide.\u201d The statement that \u201c it did not have a direct bearing\u201d seems clearly a denial of proximate cause and nothing in the obscure language that follows serves to establish a comprehensible theory of causal relationship. Further, the conclusion that the prior accident \u201c played a part \u201d is very similar to the testimony that an accident was a \u201c factor \u201d which we held insufficient in <em>Matter of Aponte v. Santiago &amp; Garcia </em>(279 App. Div. 269, 275). While we agree that the record is sufficient to sustain the award for the 1954 accident, the evidence relied on to establish causal relationship to the 1945 accident is too indefinite and \u201cbut an imaginative structure built upon a theory.\u201d (See <em>Matter of Aponte </em>v. <em>Santiago &amp; Garcia, supra.) </em>There are too many intervening events and sequete between the two happenings to permit the answer to the hypothetical question to sweep in the first accident. It is not for us to speculate and surmise, as does the majority statement, as to what might have been the doctor\u2019s intendment. The decision of the board should be modified so as to dismiss the award as to the 1945 accident and remitted for the making of a new award as to the 1954 accident.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
