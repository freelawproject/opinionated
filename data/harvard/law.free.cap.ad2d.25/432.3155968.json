Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted. In our opinion, under the facts of this ease and the applicable sections of the law then in force, the plaintiff was entitled to one year and 73 days from the accrual of the cause of action within which to commence the action against the Board of Education (General Municipal Law, \u00a7 50-h; General Corporation Law, \u00a7 3, subd. 2; former Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 24, now CPLR 204, subd. [a]; <em>Amex Asphalt Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>263 App. Div. 968, affd. 288 N.
