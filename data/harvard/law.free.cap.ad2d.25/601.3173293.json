Memorandum: Following argument and submission of this appeal an intermediate order denying a motion to suppress certain evidence was reversed and that pretrial proceeding remanded to Erie County Court (23 A D 2d 806). Thereafter, an order was made 'by County Court suppressing the evidence upon a finding that the search warrant was invalid. The court is informed by the District Attorney that he does not seek a review of the correctness of that determination. He further concedes that in the absence of the suppressed evidence a new trial would be futile.
