Memorandum: The few slight matters preliminary to trial require little further time. There is no reason why the ease cannot be tried as a preferred day certain case, commencing May 2, 1966. (Appeal from order of Monroe Trial Term granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preference and denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike case from calendar.)</p>\n<judges id=\"A59F\">Present \u2014 'Williams, P.
