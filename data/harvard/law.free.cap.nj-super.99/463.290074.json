A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AAb\">This is an appeal hy defendant Progressive Life Insurance Company from a judgment in the amount of $8,021.81 in favor of the substituted plaintiff Katherine F. Johnson, executrix of the estate of James L. Johnson. Decedent had instituted suit in his lifetime to recover benefits claimed to be due him under a lifetime disability policy issued by Progressive to him on December 13, 1961. He died before trial and his personal representative was substituted as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Another suit against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not involved in this appeal. There was a stipulation of dismissal as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">A full recital of the facts is necessary for an understanding of the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">As noted above, the policy upon which suit was based was issued on December 13, 1961. The insured, James L. Johnson, in his written application for the policy gave answers to questions therein as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201c10. Have you ever been treated for, or ever been told that you had any one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">* * * Heart Disease? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">13. Have you consulted a physician or other practitioner within the past five years or to the best of your knowledge and belief have you had any illness or disease not mentioned in the answers above? Yes [X], No \u25a1_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>REMARKSGive full details including names and addresses of attending physicians, dates and reasons when any questions 8 through 13 are answered \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">No. 13\u2014July 1961 Hydrocele removed surgical. Ross of time about 6-8 weeks. Complete rec. R. Gove, M.D. Brant Beach, N. J.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">15. Do you represent that the above answers are true and complete to the best of your knowledge and belief and do you agree (1) that the falsity of any answer in this application shall void the policy, if such answer materially affects either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the Company, (2) that the insurance, if issued, shall take effect on delivery of the policy and payment of the first premium during your good health, but only if no change shall have occurred in your insurability since the completion of this application? Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The application was dated December 13, 1961 and signed by Johnson before a licensed agent of defendant insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">On August 5, 1963 Johnson became totally disabled within the terms and meaning of the policy in question. He was then admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Thereafter he submitted a claim for permanent disability benefits under the policy. A routine investigation was made by defendant. An examination of the hospital records from the time of his admission revealed to defendant for the first time that Johnson had at the time of his application for the insurance and for several years prior thereto a medical history of coronary insufficiency. Johnson himself supplied this history to the hospital authorities. This history manifested that his answers on the application, as noted above, were false and incomplete. Defendant deemed his representations to be not only false and incomplete, but also such as to have materially affected its acceptance of the risk and the hazard assumed by it. Details thereof are noted <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Defendant notified Johnson by letter of October 16, 1963 of its election to declare the policy void, enclosing therewith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>a check refunding all premiums paid. The present action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Trial of the cause was before a jury and it returned a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor. The jury answered by an 11-to-l vote in the negative the following special interrogatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201cDid Mr. Johnson have a heart disease including a coronary insufficiency or a cardiovascular illness at any time during the period November 19, 1957, through May 23, 1959?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In another special interrogatory the jury was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201cWhat is the amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to under the policy of insurance\u2014$5762.31 or $8021.81?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Its answer, by a 10-to-2 vote, was $8,021.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Judgment was entered on the basis of the verdict. Defendant moved for judgment in its favor, notwithstanding the verdict. The motion was denied, as had its earlier motions for judgment in its favor. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Defendant\u2019s main argument is that its several motions for judgment in its favor, during and after the trial, should have been granted on the basis of the insured\u2019s material misrepresentations in his application for the policy in question. In appraising that contention the following additional facts must be noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">On November 19, 1957 Johnson, the insured, consulted his family physician, Dr. Richard Gove, complaining of fatigue and pains in his chest. He saw Dr. Gove again for chest pains and distress on December 3rd, 13th and 27th, all in 1957. He was physically examined and was given an electrocardiogram. Dr. Gove interpreted the EKG \u201cas suggestive of coronary insufficiency.\u201d The doctor recommended the taking of peritrate. This is a vessel-dilating drug, used primarily for coronary diseases. Mrs. Johnson admitted in her testimony that her husband told her in 1957 that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Gove said he might have a \u201cheart condition.\u201d Dr. Gove testified that he told Johnson of his finding of coronary insufficiency. Johnson was told \u201cthat he should refrain from working, for a while, which he did, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Dr. Gove testified that Johnson \u201chad a cardiac pain, which would mean his chest, in the area that would probably cause this.\u201d The coronary insuffieieny itself, according to the doctor\u2019s testimony, \u2018\u201cis more of a symptom, really, than it is specifically a disease. * * * The coronary vessels are not getting sufficient blood supply, is what it means.\u201d Johnson\u2019s distress persisted and Dr. Gove advised him to see a specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On May 5, 1959 Johnson desired another doctor\u2019s opinion and consulted Dr. George J. Slotoroff. lie saw this doctor also on May 12th and 23rd. The doctor examined the insured electroeardiographically and found him negative as far as coronary artery disease. A chest x-ray, taken by a Dr. Willner, proved negative. The doctor told Johnson that \u201che had no coronary artery disease * * * and convinced him that he could do his active work without any problem.\u201d We note that Dr. Slotoroff was graduated from a school of osteopathy, as opposed to a general medical college, but his license entitles him to practice medicine in New Jersey. He is, admittedly, not a heart specialist. He did not recall Johnson\u2019s complaints when he came to his office in 1959, and he had no records as to his clinical findings. He was aware, however, that Johnson had been treated by medication, \u201cperitrate,\u201d for a year and a half prior to his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In answering the questions in the December 1961 insurance application, the insured failed to disclose his having consulted Dr. Gove or Dr. Slotoroff in 1957 and 1959, respectively, for the purposes above noted. His only disclosure of having consulted any physician during the five years preceding the application was tersely set forth, as noted above: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>That disclosure related only to a relatively immaterial surgical incident, considering that he fully recovered therefrom. A \u201chydrocele\u201d is an accumulation of serous fluid in a sacculated cavity, specifically in the scrotum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201cJuly 1961 Hydrocele removed surgical. Loss of time about 6-8 wks. Complete rec. B. Gove, M.D. Brant Beach, N. J.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>For did Johnson, as applicant for a policy, disclose that on October 27, 1961, less than two months before he signed the application, he again consulted Dr. Gove and \u201ccomplained of pains in his chest.\u201d The doctor then gave him medication \u201cfor chest pains,\u201d <em>viz., </em>codeine and papavarine, which the doctor testified \u201cwas primarily for cardiac distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">It was Dr. Gove who referred Johnson to Temple University Hospital on August 5, 1963, where he was placed in the care of Dr. Murtagh. The hospital records are very revealing. Under \u201cPersonal History,\u201d Johnson stated that \u201c3-5 yrs ago had \u2018Heart attack\u2019 and nervous breakdown.\u201d Eeference is also made to \u201c1961\u2014Hydrocele operated on.\u201d The person who took the history noted \u201cpatient gives vague hx [history].\u201d Dr. Murtagh noted that there was a \u201cpossible cardiac problem several yrs. ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We are not unmindful of the fact that Johnson was suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease when he entered the hospital. His mental acuity was affected and he needed assistance to walk to the ambulance. This disease is a progressive deterioration of mental and physical motor ability. It is caused principally by arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries in the brain, thus preventing the proper vascular supply needed for complete and efficient cerebral activity. Once started, it is an irreversible process and ultimately leads to death, as it did here. The early symptoms are headaches and loss of motor ability\u2014here, in the forms of bilateral frontal head pain, right-side paralysis and slurred speech. This indicated that the first affected areas were in the left side of the brain, with some right-side involvement. The pathogen has not been identified, but it is clear that this vascular condition is not related to heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Johnson was operated on at the hospital (bilateral brain biopsy) and the suspicion of Alzheimer\u2019s disease was confirmed. The operation is diagnostic only. No treatment is available for this disease. After the operation he was taken home. His condition never significantly improved before he began his final decline. He was confined to a wheelchair and was wheeled to football and basketball games occasionally. However, he was paralyzed and unable to attend to his own needs and became dependent on others. As noted above, he died in May of 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The trial court properly observed that the insured had \u201cnot fully and completely answered\u201d question number 13 in the application because he made no mention of having seen Dr. Gove, who diagnosed his chest pains in 1957 as being due to coronary insufficiency and told Johnson so at that time. Nor did he disclose that ho had seen Dr. Slotoroff in 1959 for his opinion as to his condition. As the trial judge expressed it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201c* * * certainly there was a non-disclosure of any treatment of any vascular condition, if we characterize a coronary insufficiency not a heart disease, but as a vascular condition. There is no mention of Doctor Gove having treated the decedent for a two-year period, nor is there any reference to Doctor Slotoroff there [in the application]. And it is obvious that the applicant is incorrect. What the effect of it is legally, I am not going to rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The trial court told the jury that it need not decide whether there was a misstatement, \u201cbecause the Court has already so determined that fact as a matter of law from the testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">We shall assume from the conflicting medical testimony that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Johnson did not suffer from heart disease or coronary insufficiency when he applied for the insurance policy in December 1961. We shall also assume that the cause of his death was Alzheimer\u2019s disease, unrelated to heart disease or coronary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The uneontroverted facts remain that Johnson was examined by his family physician for fatigue and pains in the chest on several occasions between November 1957 and October 1961; his condition was diagnosed by his family physician as being one of coronary insufficiency; he was so told by his doctor and he, in turn, told his wife; he received medication, in the form of peritrate, a drug used primarily for that condition; he sought the opinion of another doctor in 1959, who found him negative for coronary insufficiency; but, two months before making his application in 1961 for the insurance policy, he was back in the office of his family physician with chest pains for which drugs were prescribed on the theory that the pains were \u201ccardiac\u201d in nature. Yet, the insured disclosed none of this information in his application in response to questions specifically directed toward eliciting it. The trial judge found as a matter of law that Johnson had made a \u201cmisstatement\u201d in his application for the policy, as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In the light of these uncontradicted proofs, the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motions for judgment in its favor. Certainly, the nondisclosure by Johnson in his answer to question 13 of the application of facts material to defendant\u2019s \u201cacceptance of the risk\u201d and of \u201cthe hazard assumed by the Company\u201d was tantamount to a \u201cfraudulent misstatement,\u201d at least in an equitable sense, on his part. He took pains to recite the hydrocele operation from which he had completely recovered. Yet, he failed to reveal his consultations with two doctors as to chest pains of long duration, his family physician\u2019s diagnosis and medications prescribed, the electrocardiograms and the x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Silence as to a material fact is not necessarily equivalent to a false representation. But mere silence is quite different from concealment. <em>Aliud est tacere, aliud celare. </em>A suppression of the truth may amount to a suggestion of falsehood. <em>Stewart v. Wyoming Cattle Ranche Co., </em>128 <em>U. S. </em>383, 388-389, 9 <em>S. Ct. </em>101, 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>439 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The issue was not solely whether the applicant <em>had </em>heart disease or coronary insufficiency when he applied for the policy. Question 10 inquired whether he had ever \u201cbeen treated for, or ever been told\u201d that he had \u201cheart disease.\u201d He had been treated for and told that he had coronary insufficiency. Nor is it crucial that his death was due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, unrelated to heart disease or coronary insufficiency. Bather, the issue is whether Johnson\u2019s false, because incomplete, answers to the questions in the application were material to defendant\u2019s \u201cacceptance of the risk\u201d or assumption of the hazard. Obviously, the insurance company had the right to a full disclosure and the option, based thereon, to accept or reject Johnson\u2019s application. The failure to make full and honest disclosure prejudiced it into accepting a risk without further examination. Its position has been that it would not have issued this policy to Johnson, if the questions in the application had been fully and correctly answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The trial judge told the jury that \u201cif the insurance company was not prejudiced or they [the misstatements in the application] were not material to the risk, then that would not be a basis for the insurance company setting aside this policy.\u201d He then limited the issue, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201c* * * the <em>only question </em>in this connection that has to be determined, which is a question of fact, is <em>whether or not Mr. Johnson did in fact have this condition </em>during the period aforesaid; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">This was one of the two interrogatories to be answered by the jury. As to this question, the jury was instructed to answer \u201cyes or no.\u201d The jury was then reminded of the conflicting medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We find that it was error to submit the case to the jury on that limited basis. It disregarded the materiality of the nondisclosure of pertinent information bearing upon defendant\u2019s right to \u201caccept\u201d the risk. In effect, the jury was told that defendant would be prejudiced by the false answers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>only if </em>the insured did not have heart disease or coronary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u201cAn insurance contract is preeminently one of the utmost good faith. * * * The insurance company customarily relies On the truthfulness of the insured\u2019s rendition of his medical history.\u201d <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of United States v. New Horizons, Inc., </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>307, 312 (1958). \u201cInnocent material misrepresentations will, in equity, support rescission of an insurance contract. <em>Scienter </em>is not an essential element of equitable fraud.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at <em>p. </em>314.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The prior medical history of an applicant is naturally and logically a most material matter to an insurance company, \u201cand the working rule is that inquiries propounded in the application form, and the truthfulness and completeness of answers thereto touching the physical condition and pathological history of the applicant, are material to the risk as a matter of law and such materiality is not the subject of a finding of fact by a jury.\u201d <em>Gallagher v. New England Mutual Life Ins. Co. of Boston, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>14, 21 (1955). To the same effect, see <em>Kerpchak v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>196, 198 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1922); <em>Urback v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>585, 586 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942). The insurance company bargains for full and truthful disclosure, so that it may investigate the risk and determine ultimately its acceptance or rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The falsity of any statement in the application for a policy may not bar the right to recover thereunder unless' such false statement <em>materially </em>affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:38-13.4(C).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cThe most generally accepted test of materiality is whether or not the matter misstated could reasonably be considered material in affecting the insurer\u2019s decision as to whether or not to enter into the contract, in estimating the degree or character of the risk, or in fixing the premium rate thereon.\u201d 12 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, </em>\u00a7 7294, p. 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We follow that test. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Lodzinski, 122 N. J. Eq. </em>404, 408 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1937); <em>Kerpchak v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>196, 198 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Johnson\u2019s chest pains were not some transitory or temporary indispositions. They had been diagnosed as being dne to coronary insufficiency. His doctor told him so and treated him for that condition. There were several visits, the last only two months before his application. Nondisclosure was material under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Plaintiff argues that the incontestability clause in the policy barred defendant insurance company from contesting the statements contained in the application. That clause provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u201cTIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">(a) alter two years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except <em>fraudulent misstatements, </em>made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred <em>for disability </em>(as defined in the policy) <em>commencing after the expiration of such two-year period.\u201d </em>(Italics ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Plaintiff claims that the trial court erroneously denied her request to charge the jury that if it found \u201can absence of intentional fraud, then it should return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The trial court properly denied this request because the reference to \u201cintentional fraud\u201d was conjoined in the request with other language equating \u201cintentional\u201d with \u201cknowingly.\u201d For example, the following was included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">\u201cThe defendant insurance company must show you by clear and convincing proof that Mr. Johnson <em>knew </em>that the fact represented to be true was false, or that the fact concealed was a fact <em>known </em>to him.\u201d (Italics ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\"><em>Scienter </em>is necessary for <em>legal </em>fraud, but it is not a requirement of <em>equitable </em>fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\"> The incontestability clause expressly excluded from the two-year limitation \u201cfraudulent\u201d misstatements. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>included those equitably fraudulent as well as those legally fraudulent. Therefore, Johnson\u2019s materially false representations in the application, upon which he intended the insurance company to rely, as it did, were fraudulent in the equitable sense, even if it were found that he acted innocently and without knowledge as to the falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Moreover, defendant insurance company notified Johnson by letter of October 16, 1963\u2014about two months after his total disability began on August 5, 1963, upon his making claim\u2014that it was disclaiming liability because of his answers to the questions on the application. It returned its check to his order for $428.60, a \u201creturn of all premiums that you have paid.\u201d It was Johnson who waited until July 29, 1965 to file his complaint, which defendant answered shortly thereafter. The <em>disability </em>herein did not <em>commence after </em>the expiration of such two-year period, as the clause provides, but <em>before </em>its expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Under all the circumstances, the incontestability clause in this policy did not bar defendant from raising the defense of materially false representations by the insured in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Nor did the trial court err in rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s proffer of proof that the agent for the insurance company filled out the application after Mr. Johnson had told him of his medical consultations. Such an attempted avoidance of the defense of fraud was not pleaded in a reply or raised in the pretrial order. It was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to disallow this new factor to be asserted during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Our decision in favor of defendant makes it unnecessary to decide other points advanced by it for reversal. However, for the sake of completeness we shall dispose of them briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Plaintiff concedes that the trial court erred with respect to the payment of compound interest. Hence, we need not consider that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The trial court properly instructed the jury that the burden of proving the affirmative defense of fraud was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>on defendant insurance company \u201cand under our law this must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, which means more than a preponderance of evidence. It has been defined in our State as clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence.\u201d Our cases so hold. <em>Wiley v. </em>Wirbelauer, 116 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>391, 396 <em>(Ch. </em>1934); <em>Bell v. Merchants Bldg. &amp; Loan </em>Ass\u2019n, 133 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>356, 361 <em>(Ch. </em>1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">If plaintiff had been entitled to a recovery, it would have been proper to submit to the jury for its determination whether plaintiff\u2019s claim was for a \u201cConfining Sickness\u201d under section 3(a), for which $300 monthly is payable for the duration of the sickness, or for a \u201cNon-confining Sickness\u201d under section 3(b) of the policy, under which the $300 monthly is limited to 34 months for any one sickness. The evidence, though strongly persuasive of a conclusion that the sickness was of a \u201cconfining\u201d character within the reasonable interpretation of the policy, as the jury found, did raise a factual issue for jury determination. Plaintiff does not complain of the submission of this issue to the jury. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the sickness was \u201cnon-confining\u201d merely by reason of Johnson\u2019s being wheeled out-of-doors on a few isolated occasions. This phase of the case related to the issue whether plaintiff was entitled to the larger sum of $8,031.81 or the smaller sum of $5,763.31 in the event of a recovery. The jury\u2019s award of the larger sum reflected its finding that the sickness was \u201cconfining.\u201d There was adequate evidence to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The submission to the jury for special factual finding as to whether the insured had a heart disease, including a coronary insufficiency or cardiovascular illness, at any time during the period November 19, 1957 through May 33, 1959, was proper insofar as its finding would resolve that factual question and help to determine the defense of fraud. The jury\u2019s negative answer, however, would not derogate from defendant\u2019s right to rescind the policy and avoid liability thereunder by reason of the materially false answers in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The judgment in favor of plaintiff is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for entry of a judgment in favor of defendant Progressive Life Insurance Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
