J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A6V\">Plaintiff appeals from an adverse judgment in the Law Division in her action on certain defaulted notes, as against an accommodation maker, defendant Radziwon. The reason for the trial court\u2019s action was that the holder of the notes had extended the date for their payment by accepting from the obligors new notes with extended due dates without obtaining defendant\u2019s consent of the defendant and without expressly reserving her rights against him. Since the record satisfies us that plaintiff did expressly reserve her rights against Radziwon, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The original series of 12 notes was for $518.75 each, the first due April 29, 1963, the others every two months thereafter. They provided that upon default in any, all became due at once. Radziwon was eoncededly an accommodation maker. No payment was made on these notes until June 3, 1963, when the first one was paid. Thereafter, without consent of or notice to Radziwon, who was not then available, plaintiff agreed to extend the time for payment of the obligation by accepting a new series of notes for the balance then due in smaller amounts, but conditionally upon Radziwon signing the new notes, and the original notes being retained for enforcement should Radziwon not sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The expression of the agreement for the extension is found in the following exchange of correspondence between the representatives of the plaintiff and the principal obligors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201cJuly 29, 1963</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">Samuel Pames, Esq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-qy\">921 Bergen Avenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAM\">Jersey City, New Jersey</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">Re: Celia\u2019s Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">Dear Mr. Parn\u00e9s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">Please find enclosed 28 Promissory Notes, plus the interest at 6% from February 25, 1963, paid to the order of Nedda Parn\u00e9s, through the Trust Company of New Jersey and one note No. 29 in the sum of S116.89 under the same terms, signed by Joseph Kulakowski, President of Celia\u2019s Inc.; also Joseph Kulakowski and Mary Praskay have signed the back of each note.

I did not want to keep these notes any longer, so that on August 1, 1983 you will be in a position to process this series of notes. You may continue to hold the original series of notes, since it does contain the signatures Joseph Kulakowski, Mary Praskay and Walter Rodzowin [sic].

In the meantime and until said notes are endorsed, I will put same through for collection on the due date. I am holding the original notes as a primary obligation until such time as the aforesaid endorsement is received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">I am returning note No. 29 due December 1, 1965, in the sum of $116.89, for endorsement by Mary Praskay and Joseph Kulakowski, which you will return to me after same has been duly endorsed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">S/ SAMUEL PARNES\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">Since the inquiry is whether the <em>holder </em>expressly reserved her rights against the accommodation maker, any inconsistency between these letters as to who <em>(i. e., </em>Radziwon or a \u201csubstituted surety\u201d) was to endorse the new notes must be controlled by the letter from plaintiffs representative accepting the new notes \u201cconditionally pending the endorsement by Walter Radzowin [sic]\u201d Radziwon never signed any of the new notes; plaintiff by agreement retained the old ones, signed by him; and we are clearly of the opinion that although some of the new notes were collected, plaintiff had, in and by this exchange of letters and under the accompanying circumstances, expressly reserved her rights against defendant on the original notes which she retained, <em>cf. Oil Field Gas Co. v. International Supply Co., </em>187 <em>Okl. </em>262, 103 <em>P. 2d </em>91 (1940), even assuming the extension was otherwise an agreement binding upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>There is no difficulty with the proposition that, whatever may have formerly been the position of an accommodation maker in respect of the rule under which release is normally accorded a surety by a binding extension of time granted the obligor without the surety's consent or express reservation of rights against him, see <em>Adelman v. Franklin Washington Trust Co., </em>137 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>257, 261 <em>(Ch. </em>1945); <em>R. S. </em>7:2-120 (VI); 11 <em>Am. Jur. 2d, Bills and Notes, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 930, 942-944, <em>pp. </em>973-977, 985-989, the accommodation maker now clearly takes the same benefits in that regard as one secondarily liable, by virtue of the adoption in New Jersey of the Uniform Commercial Code. <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:3-606(1) (a); <em>Official Comment </em>1. <em>See </em>also <em>Oficiad Comment </em>7 to <em>N. J. S. </em>12A :3-118 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">It should also be noted that it was not necessary under the Code for the obligee to give notice to the accommodation maker of the express reservation of rights against him when granting the obligor a time extension. <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:3-606(2). The section is devoid of any provision for such notice. <em>Official Comment </em>4 to <em>section </em>3-606 is misleading in its allusion to a requirement of notice, referring to a supposed subsection (3). There is no subsection (3) in <em>section </em>3-606 as finally adopted by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and enacted in this State. There was such a subsection in the 1952 draft of the Code, which called for a dilligent effort by the holder to notify the party affected as to the reservation, within ten days. But that subsection (3) was omitted from the final draft of the Code section and is of no effect, notwithstanding that <em>Official Comment </em>4 was not revised concordantly. See 1 <em>Anderson\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code </em>(1961), <em>p. </em>748, <em>n. </em>10; also the 1967 <em>Cumulative Supplement </em>of the same work, \u201c\u00a7 3-606.1.
