Loftin v. Rush Nalley et al.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-7\">(See this case for the practice of this court, with reference to affirming the judgment of the court below, without regard to its merits, when the appellant has failed to file a transcript of the record, as required by law, and for the strictness of compliance with the directions of the statute exacted of the appellee in such cases.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-8\">Appeals are perfected so as to give this court jurisdiction\u2014first, by notice of appeal, entered of record; and, secondly, by giving the appeal bond (when not dispensed with) within twenty days after the adjournment of the court. Unless these two requisites have been complied with, the jurisdiction of this court does not attach. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1491, Note 583.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-10\">When the appeal is perfected, it is the duty of the appellant to file a transcript of the record in this court, as prescribed by Art. 1587 of Paschal\u2019s Dig.; and in case he fail to file the transcript as thus directed, then the appellee is authorized to file with the clerk of this court a proper certificate of the clerk of the court below, and thereupon it is the duty of this court, under Art. 1589 of Paschal\u2019s Dig., to affirm the judgment of the court below. (See Paschal\u2019s Dig., Notes 614, 616.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-12\">These proceedings are summary and <em>ex parte, </em>and therefore the party claiming the benefit of them must bring himself within the strict meaning of the law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-13\">The clerk\u2019s certificate, filed by the appellee, consisted of a copy of the judgment and of the appeal bond, with the statement that they were true copies of the judgment rendered March 31,1860, and of the appeal bond filed and approved April 20, 1860; but there was nothing in the copies or the certificate showing that the appeal was taken in term time, or that notice thereof was entered of record; nor does the clerk state \u201cat what time the appeal was perfected,\u201d or that it was ever \u201cperfected.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the certificate is defective in not complying with the directions of the statute, and that the motion based upon it to affirm the judgment, without regard to its merits, cannot be sustained.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-14\">This court will not infer that the appeal was perfected from the statement of the clerk of the court below, in his certificate, that the appeal bond was filed and approved, as above stated. To make the clerk\u2019s certificate evidence in this court at all, it must be in accordance with the statute.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-15\">Appeal from Falls. The case was tried before Hon. John Gregg, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-17\">The facts are shown in the opinion of the court. The proceeding was a motion of the appellee, in the Supreme Court, to affirm, without reference to the merits, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the 7th section, of the act of 1850, further regulating proceedings in the Supreme Court. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1589, Note 616.) The question was upon the sufficiency of the certificate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-5\">D. <em>M. Prendergast, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANA\">\u2014In this case, the appellant having given bond, &amp;c., for an appeal from the judgment of the court below, and having failed to bring up the transcript, the appellees, by attorney, move the court to affirm the judgment of the court below without reference to the merits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-6\">Fo brief for appellant furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b144-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4y\">\u2014The appellees present the certificate of the clerk of the District .Court of Falls county, and suggest that they obtained judgment against appellant on the 31st March, 1860, and he appealed to this court, and having failed to file a transcript of the record, as the law prescribes, they move the court to affirm the judgment, without reference to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Appeals are perfected so as to give this court jurisdiction\u2014first, by notice of appeal entered of record; and, secondly, by giving the appeal bond within twenty days after the adjournment of the court, in cases where bond is not dispensed with, and without these two things being done the jurisdiction of this court does not attach. (Burr v. Lewis, 6 Tex., 76.) [Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1491, Note 583.]</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">When the appeal is perfected, it is the duty of the appellant to file a transcript of the record in this court, as prescribed in Art. 1923, O. &amp; W. Dig. [Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1587, Note 614.] It is not pretended that the transcript has been filed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Art. 1925, O. <em>&amp; </em>W. Dig., provides, that in case the appellant fails to file the transcript of the record as directed by law, then the appellee shall have the right to file, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>clerk of this court, a certificate from the clerk of the district court in which the judgment may have been rendered, attested by the seal of his court, stating the \u201c <em>time </em>when the appeal was <em>perfected </em>,\u201d and it shall be the duty of this court to affirm the judgment of the court below. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1589, Note 616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">It is apparent that these proceedings are summary and <em>ex </em>parte, and the party claiming the benefit of them must bring himself within the strict meaning of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It is important, first, to determine whether the appeal has been \u201cperfected,\u201d by notice entered of record and giving the bond. The clerk\u2019s certificate consists of a copy of the judgment and appeal bond, with statement appended, that they are true copies of the judgment rendered March 31, 1860, and appeal bond filed and approved 20th April, 1860. There is nothing in the copy or certificate to show that the appeal was taken in term time or notice entered of record, nor does the clerk state <em>\u201cat what time the appeal was per</em>fected,\u201d or that it was ever <em>\u201cperfected,\u201d </em>unless it can be inferred from the statement that the appeal bond was filed and approved April 20, 1860. This inference we cannot draw from that statement. To make his statement evidence at all, it must be in accordance with the statute. If he had stated the \u201ctime when the appeal was perfected,\u201d as directed in Art. 1925, O. &amp; W. Dig., it might then become a question whether that would be sufficient evidence to this court that all had been done necessary to give this court jurisdiction of the matter: that is, that notice of appeal had been entered of record, and an appeal bond had been filed and approved properly. In this case no such presumption can be indulged, there being no such statement made by the clerk, or other evidence that notice of appeal was entered of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">This court has often decided, on motions to affirm on certificates, in cases of writs of error, that it must be made to appear to the court that the notice of the writ of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>had been served on the defendant in error; and we are of opinion it should be made to appear in appeal cases that the notice of appeal had been given as the law directs before judgment can he affirmed on certificate, without reference to the merits; and this certificate not being within the rule stated, the motion to affirm must be overruled, and \u25a0certificate dismissed at appellees\u2019 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
