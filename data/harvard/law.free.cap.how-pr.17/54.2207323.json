Ford suffered default. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The plaintiff demurred to the answer of Norman, and had judgment upon the demurrer, and entered a joint judgment against the defendants, with the costs of suit, including the costs of the demurrer. The defendant Acton P. Ford now moves the court to have the costs of the demurrer stricken out of the judgment against him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\">D. J.

R. </em>33; <em>Harrington </em>agt. <em>Higham. and </em>others, 15 <em>Barb. R. </em>524; <em>Ladue </em>agt. <em>Van Vechien, </em>8 <em>Barb. B. </em>664; <em>Crandall </em>agt. <em>Beach and others, </em>7 <em>How. P. R. </em>271; 5 <em>Sand. S. </em>C. <em>R. </em>210 ; 13 <em>How. P. R. </em>511; 11 <em>How. P. R. </em>197; 2 <em>Whittaker's Pr. </em>68 ; 3 <em>Sand. S. C. R. </em>752.) It being clear that there cannot be several judgments against the defendants, the question recurs whether the plaintiff -was right in taxing the costs of the demurrer in the judgment against A. P. Ford ? I think these costs were properly taxed against all the defendants, and such I understand to have been the practice both before and since the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The rule is so declared by Judge Bronson, in <em>Henman </em>agt. <em>Booth, </em>(20 <em>W. R. </em>666, 668,) and Justice Birdseye, in <em>Gatlin </em>agt. <em>Billings and others, </em>(13 <em>How. P. R. </em>511, 515, 516.) The principle of these cases controls the case before us. The principle is laid down in <em>2d Tidd's Practice, </em>899. The rule was held in <em>Smith </em>agt. <em>Harris, </em>(12 <em>Ill. R. </em>462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">And I do not see that it could make any difference if the contract on which the suit is brought were joint and several, when the plaintiff sues them jointly, for he is entitled to joint judgment. As the defendants have assumed a joint liability, the plaintiff is entitled to insist upon a joint judgment, and it does not lie with one of the parties to say that joint liability shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>severed by his putting in a separate defence, and if the other parties who do not wish to defend, desire to be relieved from costs, they should pay the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Suppose the summons and complaint in this case, had only been served on Norman Ford, and he had put in the same answer which he did, and the plaintiff had demurred, and judgment had been given for the plaintiff the same as it was, the plaintiff would have been obliged to take judgment against all of the defendants. <em>(Crandall </em>agt. Beach, 7 <em>How. P. R. </em>271, 272.) It is only necessary, however, to decide in this case, that when the defendants\u2019 liability is joint and but one judgment can be entered, the defendants are equally liable for the whole costs when one has suffered a default and the other has defended the action unsuccessfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">This motion must be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
