On the trial, after the case for the prosecution was closed, the prisoner\u2019s counsel objected, that no proof had been given of the existence of the alleged bank, or of the value of its notes\u2014if they had any value\u2014and that his client, on that ground, as matter of law, was entitled to an acquittal. To meet this difficulty, the district-attorney, by permission of the court, notwithstanding the summing up had been commenced, was allowed to introduce further witnesses. The prisoner excepted to the ruling; and the only question presented by the writ of error is, does the admission of fresh evidence at that stage of the trial constitute a ground for setting aside the verdict of the jury ?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>735) declares that \u201c the provisions of law in civil cases, relative to compelling the attendance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>testimony of </em>witnesses, <em>the </em>examination, <em>&amp;c., </em>shall extend to trials and other proceedings, on indictments, so far as they may be in their nature applicable, subject to the provisions contained in any statute.\u201d And further, that on such criminal trials \u201c exceptions to any decision of the court may be made by the defendant in the same cases and manner provided by law in civil cases.\u201d Whatever, therefore, may be the practice in other states, in this we have a precise statute for our guide. Trials on indictments for public offences are placed on the same footing as trials on complaints for private wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In civil actions, the plaintiff ordinarily is required to introduce all the evidence in support of his side before resting. He cannot afterward, it is said, supply omissions <em>\u201c </em>as matter of right\u201d <em>(Leland </em>agt. <em>Bennett, </em>5 Hill, 286). But this implies that he may do so as matter of favor; in other words, that it is discretionary with the judge, in view of all the circumstances, to grant the permission or to refuse it; and that no appeal, in such case, lies from his decision. But were the decision applicable, we think it was not erroneous. The judge exercised a sound discretion in allowing the testimony to be introduced. Indeed, had he arbitrarily refused the permission in such a case of mere technical oversight, his conduct would have been justly open to criticism. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
