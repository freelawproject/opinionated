The statute allows a party who is successful in the suit the fees of his witnesses. The letter of the statute justifies the allowance, and I can see nothing in its spirit to exclude it. This construction may lead to abuses, as did the early practice under the statute, before parties could be sworn in their own behalf. This was corrected by requiring an affidavit of the materiality and necessity of witnesses, and under that rule, when the affidavit was made, and it was apparent that a greater number were subpoenaed than was necessary, for the purpose of enhancing the costs, the court and its taxing officers disallowed the charges for such witnesses. The reasoning of Lord Campbell in <em>Howes </em>agt. Barker, (10 <em>E. L. &amp; Eq. Rep. </em>467,) and the rule he established, seem to me to be correct; under it all abuse may be prevented. If a party can be sworn as to the cause of action or defence, I think he is equally entitled to credit when he makes an affidavit as to his attendance as a witness. The defendant brought himself within the rule <em>of Howes, </em>agt. Barker, and had the defendant in <em>Logan </em>agt. Thomas, (11 <em>How. P. Rep. </em>160,) presented to the taxing officer the affidavits read on the appeal from the taxation, I think Mr. Justice Boweh would have adopted the same rule. The question is one which should be definitely settled by general rule of the court or at general term, and for that purpose, I shall hold that the adjustment by the clerk is correct. There is a clear distinction between the cases arising under the Code and that in 6 <em>Paige </em>Rep, 170. I have not access to 3 <em>Abbott's Reports.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The motion for re-adjustment is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
