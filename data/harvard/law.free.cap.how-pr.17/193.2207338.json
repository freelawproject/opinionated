The action for a penalty is a civil action, and so was the action of debt on statute. (Cowper, 382 ; 2 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>384, 501.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-15\">2. This class of actions, under the Code, is still for a sum o\u00ed money, which, by force of the statute, the defendant is bound to pay, and this action is for the recovery of a specific sum of money and nothing else. <em>(Vide Session Laws </em>of 1857, <em>chapter </em>628, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 22.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-16\">3. The summons is properly framed, under the 1st subdivision of section 129 of Code, and is in conformity to the decisions of the supreme court (in 2d District), and was prepared accordingly, and the order at special term should be affirmed, with costs. (8 <em>How. Pr.

Pr.

And, in the subsequent part of the pleading, that <em>\u201c </em>defendant <em>is indebted </em>to plaintiffs by force of the statute.\u201d (2 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>384, 501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">It was never classed among actions <em>ex delicto; </em>but always among those <em>ex contractu ; </em>on the ground that from an indebtedness the <em>law implies </em>a promise to pay. And at common law there was <em>no other </em>form of action for such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The Code, in abolishing <em>farms, </em>has not abolished <em>principles ; </em>and this action is still for a <em>fixed sum of money, </em>which, by force of the statute, the <em>defendant is bound to pay </em>to plaintiffs. And the action is for the recovery of money only, and for a specified sum\u2014a sum certain\u2014one penalty of $50 in each count; the two amounting to $100, as much, and as precisely as if <em>two notes </em>(of $50 each) were sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">What should the summons state ? that plaintiffs will apply to the court for the relief demanded in the complaint, when that relief is a judgment for just so much money so due. In common sense, the summons and complaint before me answer all the purposes of a summons and complaint; they contain all the information the defendant can need to apprise him of the precise cause of action, and all the facts a clerk of the court could require, to enter the judgment (in case of default), for the exact amount; and there is no reason in the cases, or out of them, why the court should be troubled with the mere farce of a special application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Besides, I see not how the case fails to come completely within \u00a7 176 of the Code; since, if there be, in the summons or complaint, error or defect (as claimed by the defence), it cannot affect \u201c <em>the substantial rights </em>\u201d of the defendants, and the court must, <em>in every stage of the </em>action, disregard <em>such </em>error or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Further, the decisions in 5 <em>Abbott, </em>384, <em>and </em>6 <em>Abbott, </em>343, are precisely in point, and I am disposed to acquiesce in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The motion to set aside the complaint must be denied, with $10 costs of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"><em>At General Term, Albany, March, </em>1859.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\"><em>Present, </em>Harris, Gould <em>and </em>Hogebooji, <em>Justices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">After argument on the appeal from the order above made at special term, said order was unanimously affirmed; and the court directed the opinion given at special term to be published as the opinion of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
