The order must be held valid, with leave to the defendant to properly amend it. 2d. The affidavit of justification was technically insufficient.

The trial was had at the Essex circuit in March, 1857, before Judge Rosekrans, and a verdict rendered against defendant, on which judgment was entered against defendant for $86.28, and a restitution of the possession of the premises awarded. Thirty days were allowed defendant by an order agreed upon in open court to appeal after notice of judgment, and also to make a case. The order, by a probable mistake, was entered as in a cause wherein <em>Daniel </em>Tarbell was defendant, instead of the defendant in this action, but it was partly drawn up by the counsel for the relator, and ordered in open court in this action. It required that the security on the appeal should be an undertaking to the amount of $250, to pay costs as in ordinary cases of appeal, also an undertaking in double the amount of the judgment, to pay the \u25a0same, if judgment should be affirmed, and a bond in the sum of $250, with a condition to pay for the use of the premises by defendant, from the time of the entry as alleged in the complaint, until they should be restored to the relator, <em>if judgment </em>should be affirmed. The undertaking and bond to be acknowledged, and the sureties, of which there should be two, to j ustify, and proceedings were in the meantime to stay. No copy of the order was ever served, but it was ordered to be entered in open court in the presence of the counsel of both parties, and was entered by the clerk as before stated, in the name of <em>Daniel Tarbell, </em>in the title of the cause as defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">Notice of the judgment was served on defendant\u2019s attorney on the 23d day of March, 1857, and on the 22d day of April, 1857, (the last day,) notice of appeal was served on the clerk and on relator\u2019s attorney, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Please to take notice, that the defendant appeals from the judgment entered in this action, to the supreme court; said judgment was entered for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>eighty-six dollars and twenty-eight cents, &amp;c., on the 20th day of March, 1857, in the clerk\u2019s office of Essex county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The notice was accompanied with copies of the undertakings entered into by defendant and two sureties, which were duly acknowledged. The sureties also justified in one undertaking to the amount of $500, double the amount therein, which was conditioned to pay for the use of the premises if judgment should be affirmed, and in the other, the sureties justified in the amount of $675, conditioned to pay the amount of judgment if it should be affirmed, and all damages, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">The attorneys for the relator, deeming the appeal and notice irregular, and not in compliance with the terms of the order, on the 24th day of April, (two days after the service of notice,) returned the notice by mail to the defendant\u2019s attorney, whose office was sixteen miles from their residence, and at the same time gave notice to defendant\u2019s attorney that they should disregard the appeal, and execute their writ of restitution on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">1. That the notice was of an appeal to the \u201c supreme court,\u201d instead of being tp the \u201c general term of the supreme court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">2. That the notice was of an appeal from that part of the judgment only which gives costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">8. That the proper undertakings on the appeal were not executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\">4. That no undertaking in a sum double the amount of the sum recovered by the relator against the defendant, had been given or executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-11\">5. That the justification of the sureties to the undertaking filed and recorded, was in too small a sum, it being in the sum of $675 only, when it should have been in the sum of $845.12.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-12\">6. That defendant had no right to appeal at all, or if he had, he having failed for all or some of the reasons to perfect his appeal, the attorneys for relator should disregard the appeal and proceed as if no order to stay proceedings had been granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-13\">- A writ of restitution was accordingly issued and served on the 25th of April, 1857, and the relator put into possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the premises. The defendant\u2019s attorney now makes a motion to set aside the writ, and that defendant be again restored to the possession of the premises, or in case that any irregularity should be deemed to exist in his appeal, that he have leave to amend and perfect it, he swearing that it was put in in good faith and not for delay.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-5\">Pond &amp; Hand, <em>for relator.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-6\">J. P. Butler, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-7\">O. L. Allen,-Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AyP\">I do not perceive that there is any force in the general objection that defendant had no right to appeal at all. The relator\u2019s attorney and counsel conceded this right when they agreed upon the order which was entered in open court, after being partly drawn up by them, and in their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The <em>first </em>specific objection is, that the notice is of an appeal to the supreme court generally, instead of being to the general term as prescribed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The act of 15th April, 1854, <em>(Session Laws of </em>1854, p. 592,) enacts that the appeal may be taken to the \u201c general term of the supreme court,\u201d and section 348 of the Code of 1852, declares that <em>\u201c </em>an appeal upon the law may be taken to the general term, from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee, or the direction of a single judge of the same court,\u201d &amp;c. And section 344 prescribes that <em>an appeal may be taken to \u201c </em>the supreme court,\u201d from a judgment rendered by a county court, &amp;c. These appeals are all heard at general term. There is no appeal from the judgment rendered by a single judge to the circuit <em>or </em>special term, although section 265 specifies certain cases, where exceptions are in the first instance to be heard at special term. Section, 327 requires that the appeal must be, made by the service of a notice in writing on the adverse party and on the clerk from whom the judgment or order appealed from is entered, stating the appeal from the same or some specified part thereof. Section 346 declares that appeals in the supreme court <em>\u201c shall be heard, at a general term.\" </em>Taking all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>these sections together, I think the notice of appeal in this case was sufficient. The relator could not have been misled by it. By the notice of appeal to the <em>supreme court, </em>he knew that it could be heard nowhere else than at <em>thq general term, </em>and that the appeal was necessarily to that term, the circuit court or special term, having no appellate <em>jurisdiction. </em>Besides, in this case, the notice was accompanied by copies of the undertakings, in one of which it was recited that the defendant had appealed to \u201c the supreme court at general term, from the judgment, &amp;c., entered on the 20th of March, 1857.\u201d The notice must be deemed sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The second objection is, that the notice is of an appeal from that part of the judgment for costs only, and that it does not affect the award of restitution. Section 827 before quoted, declares that the notice must state the appeal to be from the judgment, or <em>some specified part thereof. </em>In this case, the notice states that the appeal is \u201c from the judgment entered in this action to the supreme court; said judgment was entered for $86.28, &amp;c., on the 20th day of March, 1857, in the clerk\u2019s office of Essex county.\u201d By section 330, the supreme court \u201c may reverse, affirm or modify the judgment or order appealed from, in <em>the respect mentioned in the notice of appeal, </em>&amp;c.\u201d The counsel for the relator argues, that the notice of appeal, and <em>also the recital in the undertalcing, </em>specifies the judgment for costs as being the part appealed from, and that the award of restitution is, therefore, in no way affected by the appeal. It is true, that the recital in one of the undertakings is, that the appeal is in relation to the payment of the costs entered in the judgment. But if there is any force in this argument, it is fully answered by the recital in the other undertaking and also in the condition\u2014which is, that defendant shall pay to the relator for the use of the premises described in the proceedings in said judgment, from the 12th day of July, 1856, until the said premises <em>shall be restored, </em>&amp;c., to the relator.\u201d This shows conclusively, that defendant intended to appeal from that part of the judgment awarding restitution, as well as to that part granting costs. The appeal was <em>from the judgment entered in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the action, and then the \u25a0 notice proceeds to state that, \u201c said judgment was entered for $86.28,\u201d &amp;c., meaning probably to al-' lude to the amount of costs, &amp;c., as matter of description. The notice technically should have been, that an appeal was taken from the <em>whole </em>judgment; but the relator could not have been misled, accompanied as the notice was, by the copies of undertakings before alluded to. I think the notice was sufficient, but as defendant will have leave to amend his affidavit .of justification as hereafter specified, he may also amend his notice within the same time allowed in that particular, if he deems it advisable so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">It is objected further, that there was no stay of proceedings when the writ of possession issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>First. </em>Because there was no valid order for a stay of proceedings entered originally. The order was entered undoubtedly by mistake in inserting the name of <em>Daniel </em>Tarbell as defendant, instead of defendant in the title of the cause. Whether this was the mistake of the clerk or of either of the parties, does not appear. But as already observed, the order was intended to be in this action. It was partly drawn up by the relator\u2019s counsel, and ordered to be entered in open court in the presence of the parties, and both had regarded it as a valid order and acted under it, up to the time of service of notice of appeal, although no copy had been served on the relator\u2019s attorneys, none probably having been deemed necessary, as it was entered in the presence of the parties. It is not pretended but that the order was intended to be a valid one, and I must deem it such, granting leave to the defendant to amend it as entered, by inserting his own name in the title, instead of that of Daniel Tarbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>Second. </em>It is argued that the order, if deemed to be valid, ceased to be binding for want of the proper security, inasmuch as it required an undertaking in $250 to pay costs, and also an undertaking in a sum double the amount of the judgment conditioned to pay for the use of the premises, &amp;c. It is urged, that although defendant has joined the two undertakings in one instrument, yet that the sum of the justification is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>equal to what it should 'have been if the undertakings had been separate; that the justification is only in $675, when it should have been $845.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The judgment for costs was $86.28, which is recited in the undertaking. The condition is that defendant shall pay costs \u25a0 of appeal not exceeding $250, and \u201c all damages which shall be awarded against the appellant upon the appeal, not exceeding $175,\u201d &amp;c. Section 341 enacts that \u201can undertaking upon an appeal shall be of no effect, unless it be accompanied by the affidavit of the sureties that they are each worth double the amount specified therein. This seems to settle the question. The affidavit was in double the amount of the first sum mentioned in the condition, viz: $250, but was not in double the amount of the latter sum, $175. That sum, it is true, was more than double the amount of costs; but as the section seems to be imperative, the affidavit was technically insufficient. The defendant must have leave to amend his affidavit of justification, \"within thirty days, and serve a copy-thereof, with copy of this order, within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">As to restitution: if the appeal had been perfectly regular in all respects, I should probably have granted an order to that effect; but as I have granted defendant a favor in giving him leave to amend and perfect his appeal, and as there is no pretence or claim that the relator is insolvent or will not be able to make complete restitution of all property and rights to defendant under section 330, if the judgment shall be reversed, I shall deny that part of the defendant\u2019s motion. If defendant shall amend and perfect his appeal in the particulars required within the time granted by the order, that part of his motion is to be granted with $10 costs of opposing motion on the part of defendant, to abide the event of the appeal. Otherwise the motion is to be denied with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
