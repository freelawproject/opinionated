The effect of such motions, if entertained, it is obvious, is to present the unseemly spectacle of a single judge reviewing, and, it may be, reversing, the opinions of one of his brethren having precisely the same authority as himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It is said the Code, whether seemly or unseemly, warrants the proceeding. Section 265 declares that a motion for a new trial, <em>on </em>exceptions, must, in the first instance, be heard and decided at \u201c the circuit or special term,\u201d unless <em>the judge at the trial </em>directs them to be beard first at general term, and in the meantime suspends the judgment. A fair interpretation of this clause would seem to be, that the judge holding \u201cthe circuit or special term \u201d at which the cause was tried, and whose rulings were excepted to, might, <em>before rendering final </em>judgment, on his own first impressions, be called upon to hear furlh r argument arid to grant a new trial, if upon more mature reflection it should appear proper; or, to send the case directly without final judgment to the general term. Indeed, the 264th section expressly provides that the judge \u201c who tries the cause\u201d may, in his discretion, entertain a motion, to be made on nis minutes, to set aside a verdict and grant a new trial on exceptions; but in that case the motion can only be heard at the same term or circuit. It is the same judge and not another who rehears the objections. And this he does not after, but before judgment. Instead of permitting the clerk to \u201c enter judgment in conformity with the verdict,\u201d he directs him to enter \u201c an order that the cause be reserved for argument or further consideration,\u201d in other words, that the judgment be suspended for his own review of the exceptions prior to the review by the general term. And this interpretation is in harmony with the language of the title on appeals, which declares, that \u201c the only mode of reviewing <em>a judgment </em>or order in a civil action shall be that prescribed by this title.\u201d A motion for a new trial, after judgment, on exceptions merely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>is, in effect, an appeal upon the law; and is to all intents and purposes a mere \u201c mode of reviewing that judgment.\u201d Is it the mode prescribed by the title referred to ? An appeal upon the law, in all cases, says section 348, may be taken <em>to the general </em>term, from a <em>judgment </em>entered on the direction of a single judge of the same court; and it must be taken, says section 332, within thirty days after written notice of \u201c the judgment.\u201d As the mode prescribed, therefore, in such cases is by appeal to the general term, and as that is the only mode prescribed, any other mode of effecting a review is, in effect, prohibited. The unsuccessful party, if he desires it, after judgment at the circuit, must apply for a new trial at the general term; and that he can only do by a regular appeal taken in the mode prescribed. The general term, \u201c upon an appeal from a judgment, may, if necessary, or proper, order a new trial.\u201d (\u00a7 330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial must, consequently, be denied, for want of jurisdiction in the special term to entertain the proceeding; and also, if necessary, it may be added in the order, for want of merits in the exceptions, so that, if the general term, on appeal from this order, should be of opinion that there was jurisdiction, the whole subject, and not the point of practice alone, may be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The case cited from <em>Door's Reports </em>only goes the length of holding that, where a judgment is entered as security, a motion for a new trial on exceptions' may be entertained. Such a judgment differs from a final adjudication. It stands by agreement upon the footing of a lien merely\u2014a sort of provisional security\u2014which the party is estopped from setting up as a bar to a motion as distinguished from an appeal. It is not a final adjudication of the judge at circuit upon the whole matter including the exceptions duly entered of record. Were it so, it could only be reviewed by appeal (in the nature of a writ of error) to a higher tribunal, or to a higher branch of the same tribunal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
