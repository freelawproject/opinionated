The plaintiff was twenty-two years old at the time of the death of his father, and was thirty-three years old when this suit was commenced, to-wit: in 1871. The will was probated and letters issued to the executors, and the administration was closed, and the executors discharged, before this action was commenced. The plaintiff averred in his complaint that defendants Hardy and Moorman were the trustees appointed in the will; that the trade-mark was a part of the assets of the estate, and that the trustees had seized on the trade-mark, and had been, since the death of the testator, and then were, using the same, and that they excluded him from all profits arising from the enjoyment of it, and were appropriating to their own. use the profits arising therefrom, and that the annual profits arising from the use of the same were twenty-five thousand dollars. He asked that said defendants account to him for two nineteenths of the profits they had realized. The other defendants were heirs, and were made defendants under an allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff had requested them to join with him as plaintiffs, and they had refused.

H. Cutter, deceased, and denies the allegation that the said decedent bequeathed any interest in the trade-mark to the plaintiff. Under the terms of the will of J. H. Cutter, deceased, the plaintiff took no interest in the property capable of assertion in this action. The title to the two undivided nineteenths of the trade-mark in controversy is vested in the trustees named by the testator. Nor can there be any doubt that the trust in this respect is valid in point of law. Its duration cannot, under any circumstances, exceed the life-time of the plaintiff; and upon the happening of the contingency named in the will it may terminate sooner. Eor these reasons we think that plaintiff was correctly non-suited at the trial, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
