That the defendant became the assignee of the mortgage, and foreclosed it, and the land was sold by the Sheriff on the 11th day of September, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>1871, and the defendant became the purchaser, at seven thousand five hundred and seventy-six dollars and thirteen cents, and received the Sheriff\u2019s certificate. That afterwards, and on the 9th day of March, 1872, Hurtado and wife sold to the plaintiffs. That the plaintiffs, on the 11th day of March, 1872, went to the Sheriff and asked him how much money it required to redeem from the sale, and were informed by him that it required eight thousand four hundred and eighty-six dollars; and that the plaintiffs relied on the. Sheriff\u2019s figures, and supposed they were correct, and thereupon paid him said sum of eight thousand four hundred and eighty-six dollars, to effect a redemption. That they were informed on the 12th of March that the sum which they had paid the Sheriff was not enough to effect a redemption into ninety-six dollars, and that the Sheriff had given the defendant a deed. That they then offered to pay the defendant the ninety-six dollars and all costs and expenses he had been at, if he would give them a deed, but that he declined. That the land was worth twenty thousand dollars, and that the plaintiffs were prepared on the 11th of March to have redeemed the property, The plaintiffs offered to pay the defendant the ninety-six dollars, and all costs and expenses he had incurred, and asked that he be compelled to convey to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">The defendant demurred, and the Court overruled the demurrer.

It is well settled that a complaint claiming relief on the ground of mistake must not only distinctly aver the fact of the mistake, but also set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>forth the circumstances under which it occurred in so far as those circumstances may be necessary to present a case within the rule of equity upon which relief is granted. Tested by this rule, the complaint here is radically defective,- and the demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Judgment and order denying new trial reversed, and cause remanded, with direction to sustain the demurrer to the complaint. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
