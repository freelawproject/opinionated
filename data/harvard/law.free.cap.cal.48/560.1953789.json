The complaint failed to aver that the defendants owned, or had any interest in the lot, or that the assessment was against them; but alleged that the assessment wag against the lot. The defendants demurred to the complaint: the Court sustained the demurrer, and the plaintiff declining to amend, judgment was rendered for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-10\"><em>W. C. Burnett </em>and <em>E. F. Preston, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-11\">The complaint is drawn in conformitywith the provisions of the statute. Statute 1869-70 (Sec. 9, p. 899) providing the form of the complaint in this class of actions. Let us examine the requirements of the statute, and compare the allegations of the complaint therewith :</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-12\">\u201c In bringing an action to recover street assessments, the complaint need not show any of the proceedings prior to the issuance of the assessment diagram and certificate, but it shall be held legally sufficient if it shows the title of the Court in which the action is brought; the parties .plaintiff and defendant;\u2019\u2019 the date of the issuance of the assessment;\u201d \u201cthe date of the recording thereof;\u201d \u201cthe book and page where recorded;\u201d \u201ca general statement of the work done;\u201d \u201ca description of the lot or lots sought to be charged with the assessment;\u201d \u201cthe amount assessed thereon;\u201d \u201cthat the same remains unpaid,\u201d \u201cand the proper prayer for relief.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>Theodore H. Hittel, </em>for the Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-5\">The only ground upon which appellant relies for a reversal of the judgment is, \u201cthat .every requirement of the law is answered by the allegations of the complaint.\u201d Our reply is twofold:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-6\">1st. That the complaint is not sufficient under the statute; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-7\">2d. That if the statute authorized such a complaint it would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-8\">The law under which the suit, wa's commenced (Stats. 1869-70, 898, Sec. 9) provides that actions for the collection of delinquent street assessments shall be brought -in\u201d the name of The People of the City and County, etc., \u201cand against the owners and all persons having any interest therein;\u201d in oth\u00e9r words, it prescribes who the parties, plaintiff and defendant, are to be. It also requires the complaint, among other things, \u201cto show the parties plaintiff and defendant,\u201d\u2014that is, as we contend, to show by proper averments who are the owners and parties interested. Such, and such only, can, under the statute, be parties defendant, and such the statute expressly requires to be \u201cshown.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-9\">The complaint here professes in the caption to be against \u201cBartlett Doe and J. S. Doe <em>et al.\u201d </em>and in the body to be against \u201c defendants Bartlett Doe and J. S. Doe.\u201d There is no allegation that they or either of them own the property, or have or ever -had any interest in it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-10\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">We think that in proceedings to recover upon a street assessment, it is necessary that the complaint should allege that the defendants are the owners, or have some interest in the premises sought to be charged with the alleged lien. By the thirteenth section of the Act, it is expressly provided in terms that actions for the collection of any delinquent street assessment shall be brought * * ' * \u201cagainst the owners and all persons having any interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>therein;\u201d and unless the defendants are alleged to be persons of that character, there would appear to be no reason to implead them as defendants, and no authority to enforce the lien in the absence of the real parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
