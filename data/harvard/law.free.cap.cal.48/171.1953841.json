There was an averment that the plaintiff had paid out large\" sums of money for wages of herdsmen, and in the care of the sheep while they were in his and Hewitt\u2019s possession, and that the increase of the sheep and wool to which the plaintiff was entitled under the contract up to August 1, 1872, were of the value of eight thousand dollars.
