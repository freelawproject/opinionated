The section referred to, so far as material to the question involved, is as follows: \u00ab.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-12\">\u201cWhenever, in any year, there remains in either of the interest or sinking funds mentioned in section thirty-five or thirty-six of this Act, a surplus of one thousand dollars or more, after paying the interest in accordance with the provisions herein specified, it shall be the' duty of the Treasurer to advertise for twenty days, in one of the daily papers published in the City of Sacramento, stating the amount in each fund to be disposed of, and that he will receive sealed proposals for the surrender of bonds issued under the authority of this-Act; said proposals to be opened in the presence of the President and Clerk of the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Supervisors, five days after expiration of said published notice, and they shall accept the lowest public proposals, at rates .not exceeding par value, as may redeem the greatest amount of bonds, until the amount of cash on hand for redemption is exhausted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">It appeared that on January 20, 1874, the defendant Bellmer, as Treasurer of Sacramento County, advertised in one of the daily newspapers of the City of Sacramento that there was in the sinking and interest fund thirty-four thousand dollars to be awarded to the person or persons who would surrender the greatest amount of the funded debt of 1859, and that bids, with the bonds inclosed, would be received until a day named in the advertisement, but no bids would be received unless accompanied by the bonds. Upon opening the proposals the folloAving bid was found:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-7\">\u201cLondon and San Francisco Bank (Limited), )</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-8\">San Francisco, February 11th, 1873. j</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-9\">\u201cJohn Bellmer, Esq., Treasurer of Sacramento County: I hereby agree to deliver for redemption County Bonds of the funded debt of 1859, in any amount not less than twelve thousand dollars, nor more than thirty-tAvo thousand dollars, at the rate of nine hundred and forty-nine dollars per thousand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-10\">\u201c William L. Uhler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-11\">\u201cN. B. Tour advertisement requires the bonds to accompany the bid. These bonds are in the East, and I do not Avish to incur the risk of having them sent on unless I know they are to be redeemed. If my bid is accepted, I will telegraph for them upon notification of it, and deliver them within ten days (in p.11 probability). If required, I will get this bank to give the necessary security that they wUJ. be delivered as promised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-12\">\u201cTours, William L. Uhler.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-13\">Another bid was received from the plaintiffs, inclosing the bonds, but the bid of Uhler was more favorable for the public by some one thousand seven hundred dollars, and he subsequently appeared before the defendants by an agent, and offered to give security that the bonds would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>placed in the hands of defendant Bellmer within ten days, if the bid should be accepted. Thereupon, the defendants, except Uhler, being in doubt as to their duty in the premises, an agreed case was submitted to the District Court for its decision as to which bid should be accepted. The defendant Moore was President of the Board of Supervisors, and the defendant Upson was Clerk of the Board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">The Court rendered judgment for Uhler, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\"><em>George Cadwalader, </em>for the Appellant, argued that Uhler\u2019s bid was void because it did not conform to the notice; and cited <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Wheaton, </em>46. Mo. 363; Fry on Spec. Per. Sec. 167; that Bellmer\u2019s authority was to be so construed as to include all necessary or usual means of executing it with effect (Story on Agency, Sec. 60; Paley\u2019s Agency, 189, 208; <em>United States v. Wyngall, </em>5 Hill, 16, 19); and that the condition imposed in the advertisement being intended to get rid of straw bids, was not to be presumed unreasonable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\"><em>McKune </em>and <em>Welty., </em>for Respondent, cited the statute, and argued that the condition imposed was not binding, because not authorized by law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b142-9\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">held that the bid of Uhler was entitled to be considered, notwithstanding is was not accompanied by the. bonds therein referred to. It was of opinion that Uhler, being the most favorable bidder, his bid should have been accepted upon the express provision of the statute, and that the Treasurer had no authority to impose upon bidders conditions of the character here attempted, whereby it might occur that a bid the most favorable to the public, and made in conformity to the actual requirements of statute, would, nevertheless, be rejected, because of non-compliance with some condition imposed by the ministerial officer to whom the duty of merely advertising for bids was committed by the statute. The Court was of opinion that the power to impose the condition here attempted was not to be implied from the duty to advertise, because the condition imposed by the officer was not only not necessary to the exercise of his authority, but wholly foreign to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The judgment was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
