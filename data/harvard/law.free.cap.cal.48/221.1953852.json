The Charter of 1863 (Stats. 1863, p. 433, Sec. 52 and following) does not provide for such work being done directly by the city; but the provisions are, so far as we have noticed, that work in the improvement of streets is to be done by contract, except in certain cases where the Street Commissioner requires it to be done by the owners of the adjacent lots. If the work was being done by a contractor, or the owners of adjacent lots\u2014and in view of the provisions of the charter, the complaint must be construed as averring that the work was being done in one of tho\u00a7e modes\u2014the negligence charged in the complaint was not that of the city, but of the contractor or lot owners; and under the rule in <em>O'Hale </em>v. <em>Sacramento, ante </em>p. 212, and cases there cited, the city is not liable for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
