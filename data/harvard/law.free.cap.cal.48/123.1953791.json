The only evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was that the stolen horse was found in his possession a few hours after it was taken. <em>People </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>18 Cal. 382; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ah Ki, </em>20 Cal. 178, hold that the possession of stolen property is a circumstance to be considered by the jury, but it is not, of itself, sufficient to warrant a conviction. It is said by Greenleaf (3 Greenl. Ev. Sec. 31:) \u201cIt will be necessary for the prosecutor to add the proof of other circumstances indicative of guilt, in order,,to render the naked possession of the thing available towards a conviction.\u201d The evidence discloses no circumstances of that character. The riding of the horse several miles beyond the point where he was first seen ih possession of it, is only his continued possession of it, and is not a further circumstance indicative of guilt. The leaving of the saddle with the innkeeper does not tend to prove a larceny of the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">There may be an abundance of authority to sustain the point of the Atorney-General, that the Court erred in ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>eluding evidence as to the defendant\u2019s confession, after the preliminary evidence as to its having been voluntary; but the point does not arise on the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Neither Mr. Chief Justice Wallace nor Mr. Justice McKinstry expressed an opinion.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
