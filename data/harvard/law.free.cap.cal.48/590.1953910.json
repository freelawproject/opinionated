The defendant Stevens procured \u00bfa writ of attachment against the property of one Billings, which was placed in the hands of Watson, as Sheriff, on the 3d day of December, 1869. He attached horses and mules, and charged keeper\u2019s fees, and the expenses of feeding the animals in a stable. His bill for these services was assigned to the plaintiff, who brought this action to recover the same. No certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>was procured from the Court that the charges were reasonable. The Court below granted a nonsuit, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-6\"><em>Barstow </em>and <em>Stetson &amp; Houghton, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-7\">The right of a Sheriff to recover for his necessary fees in taking and caring for property attached in a case, at the request of plaintiff, is not a statutory right, and it is only when a new right is created by statute, and the same statute prescribes a particular remedy for its recovery, that the remedy pointed out must be strictly pursued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b607-8\">Independent of the statute, he could, as bailee, recover in a suit at law. (Story on Bailments, sec. 131; Crocker on Sheriffs, secs. 371 and 824; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Birdsall, </em>9 Johns. 327; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>The Coos Bank, </em>1 N.

Gen. Laws) the Sheriff is allowed certain designated fees, and he is also allowed \u201csuch further compensation for his trouble and expense in taking possession of property under an attachment or execution, or other process, and preserving the same as the Court from which the writ or order may issue shall certify to be just and reasonable.\u201d We think that in the absence of the required certificate, the Sheriff is entitled to nothing more than the fees enumerated in the statute, and cannot legally claim the \u201cfurther compensation\u201d sought to be recovered in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">Judgment and order affirmed*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
