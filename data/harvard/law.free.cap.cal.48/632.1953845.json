Her attorney of record, entertaining a doubt whether the judgment for costs could be maintained, and also as to the solvency of the defendant, accepted two hundred dollars by way of compromise, and caused satisfaction of the judgment to be entered. The plaintiff, on notice and affidavits, moved to vacate the entry of satisfaction and for leave to issue execution on the judgment, on the ground that her attorney had no authority to enter satisfaction, except upon full payment. The motion was denied and the plaintiff appeals. In his counter affidavit the attorney explicitly states that the plaintiff was fully informed of the terms of the proposed compromise, and that his \u201centire action in\u00ab the premises was by the full consent and knowledge of his client, the said Mrs. Fuller.\u201d On the other hand, the plaintiff deposes that she explicitly refused to accede to the compromise, and so informed the attorney. Each is somewhat corroborated in certain particulars by other witnesses; but the Court below appears to have solved the doubt as to the disputed fact in favor of the defendant,\u00bb and we cannot say that it erred in doing so. In this view of the case it. is unnecessary for us to express any opinion on the questions ,of law discussed by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Order affirmed.
