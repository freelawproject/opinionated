We will conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment entered below to the effect that Holt was not acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of his accident. Before reaching that issue of substantive law, however, it is necessary to address issues of appealability and standing which are raised by the procedural posture of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">During the latter portion of 1985, Booth operated a chain of four video rental stores under the fictitious business name of Video Depot. The stores were located in Cathedral City, Indian Wells, Indio and Palm Springs. The stores were normally open to the public from 10 o\u2019clock in the morning to 8 o\u2019clock in the evening from Monday through Saturday, and from 12 o\u2019clock noon to 6 o\u2019clock in the evening on Sundays.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">Holt was first hired by Booth to be a counter clerk in the Palm Springs store. In November 1985, Holt was promoted to the position of a \u201cmanager in training\u201d and was assigned to the Cathedral City store. As a manager in training, Holt was responsible (if not exclusively, at least in part) for housekeeping duties, staff scheduling and customer relations at the Cathedral City store. Additionally, Holt, as a manager in training, was required to attend regular biweekly managers\u2019 meetings held in Booth\u2019s central office, which office was located at the Indian Wells store.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">All managers and managers in training were required to attend these biweekly managers\u2019 meetings. The meetings were normally held on alternating Thursdays at 9 o\u2019clock in the morning. Occasionally, to accommodate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>holiday, the meeting would be held on a different day of the week. The purpose of the meetings was to discuss general business matters. Holt considered attendance at the managers\u2019 meetings to be a part of his normal employment duties and to be a part of his job description.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">On the morning of Friday, December 27, 1985, Holt was en route from his home in Palm Springs to a managers\u2019 meeting at the Indian Wells store when he negligently ran into the back of a vehicle which was being driven by one Wade Ritchie (Ritchie).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Ritchie and his wife brought an action sounding in negligence against Holt and against Booth (doing business as Video Depot) for the damages resulting from the vehicle accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For all practical purposes, Booth was named as a defendant solely under the theory of respondeat superior. Booth thereafter filed a cross-complaint against Holt for comparative indemnity and declaratory relief. Holt answered the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Following a trial on the complaint, the jury returned a special verdict, which verdict found: (1) That Holt was liable to Ritchie in the sum of $65,000; (2) that Holt was liable to Ritchie\u2019s wife in the sum of $10,000; and (3) that at the time of the accident Holt was not acting in the course and scope of his employment by Booth. Holt timely filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict with the trial court, attacking the jury\u2019s determination that his actions at the time of the accident had been outside the course and scope of his employment with Booth. The trial court denied the motion and entered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Holt filed a notice of appeal that purported to give notice of an appeal from the jury\u2019s special verdict, the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and the judgment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">On appeal, Holt contends that the facts surrounding his employment by Booth establish, as a matter of law, that he was acting within the course and scope of his employment by Booth at the time of the accident. In response, and in addition to merely offering a counterargument to Holt\u2019s position on the issue of the course and scope of employment, Booth contends that Holt lacks standing as an \u201caggrieved\u201d party to bring the within appeal. In the discussion which follows, we will conclude that: (1) It is necessary to exercise our inherent judicial power to \u201ccomplete\u201d the judgment entered below so as to produce a final judgment over which this court can exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>appellate jurisdiction; (2) Holt is an aggrieved party insofar as his appeal from the judgment entered below (as \u201ccompleted\u201d by this court) is concerned; (3) Holt is not an aggrieved party insofar as his appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is concerned; and (4) the judgment is correct and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Additional facts will be referred to, as needed, in the discussion which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">What Is Appealable, and What Is Not</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Holt purports to have appealed from the judgment entered below, from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and from the special verdict itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">We are aware of no authority which would support an appeal from a special verdict\u2014or from any other kind of verdict, for that matter. <em>(Robins </em>v. <em>Weis </em>(1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 144 [217 P.2d 156].)  Denials of motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict are expressly made appealable by section 904.1, subdivision (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014so long as the party taking the appeal is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the denial (\u00a7 902).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Finally, section 904.1, subdivision (a) authorizes appeals from final judgments (judgments that are not \u201cinterlocutory\u201d)\u2014again, so long as the party taking the appeal is aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">In this case, then, it is clear that Holt can bring his appeal before us only if the judgment entered below is (or is made) \u201cfinal,\u201d and Holt is aggrieved thereby, and/or Holt is aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Holt Is Not \u201cAggrieved\u201d by the Denial of His Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">Holt\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict was brought in the lawsuit which was filed by the Ritchies against Holt and Booth as joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>tortfeasors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In substance, the motion challenged the correctness of the jury\u2019s determination that Holt had not been acting within the course and scope of his employment by Booth at the time of the accident\u2014that is, the substance of Holt\u2019s motion was a challenge to the exoneration of Booth from a joint tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the Ritchies.  It is well settled in California, however, that the exoneration of a joint tortfeasor from liability does not \u201caggrieve\u201d the other individually liable tortfeasor(s) insofar as that word is understood to apply to a party\u2019s standing to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 675, 679 [79 Cal.Rptr. 285]: \u201cA defendant who is individually liable is not aggrieved by the exoneration, even though erroneous, of a codefendant.\u201d See also, <em>Guy F. Atkinson Co. </em>v. <em>Consani </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 342 [35 Cal.Rptr. 750].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Holt argues that he <em>is </em>aggrieved by Booth\u2019s exoneration because such exoneration deprives Holt of any indemnification he might have been entitled to from Booth pursuant to section 2802 of the Labor Code: \u201cAn employer shall indemnify his employee for all that the employee necessarily expends or loses in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties as such, or of his obedience to the directions of the employer, even though unlawful, unless the employee, at the time of obeying such directions believed them to be unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Holt\u2019s argument must fail, however, in the face of the long-established authority that an individually liable tortfeasor is not aggrieved by the exoneration of a joint tortfeasor even when that exoneration defeats what would otherwise be an actionable cause for contribution. (See, inter alia, <em>Cook </em>and <em>Guy F. Atkinson Co., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Holt has no standing as an \u201caggrieved\u201d party to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The \u201cFinality\u201d of the Judgment Appealed From</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">As noted above, section 904.1, subdivision (a) authorizes appeals only from final judgments\u2014that is, judgments which are not \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   However, \u201c[jjudgment rendered on a complaint alone, unaccompanied by judgment on a pending cross-complaint, is not a final judgment and appeal from it may be dismissed on motion.\u201d <em>(Tsarnas </em>v. <em>Bailey </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 332, 337 [3 Cal.Rptr. 629].) That appears to be the state of affairs facing this court in the instant appeal. Insofar as the record discloses, no judgment was ever entered on the cross-complaint filed by Booth against Holt for indemnification and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Notwithstanding all of the above, the <em>Tsamas </em>opinion <em>(supra) </em>provides a method whereby to \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cfinalize\u201d such judgments as the one here appealed from, thus perfecting the appeal and permitting the reviewing court to reach the merits of the matter. As stated in <em>Tsarnas </em>(at p. 337): \u201c[T]he [appellate] court may, in its discretion, where the intention of the trial court was clear, order judgment rather than send the case back for the performance of that act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Given the fact that the jury so clearly found Holt\u2019s actions to be outside the course and scope of his employment with Booth (reference, the special verdict), given the fact that the trial court so clearly expressed its decision that the jury\u2019s verdict had been correct on the matter in issue (reference, the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict), and given the fact that these determinations by the jury and trial court so clearly dispose of all issues raised by Booth\u2019s cross-complaint, we do hereby order judgment on the cross-complaint in favor of Booth and against Holt to the following effect: (1) The cause of action for indemnification is dismissed as moot in light of the determination that the sole ground asserted for Booth\u2019s liability to the Ritchies, respondeat superior, was found not to exist; and (2) Booth is declared to have no duties or obligations extending in favor of Holt and arising out of the subject matter of the Ritchie action.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Having ordered judgment on Booth\u2019s cross-complaint, the judgment before us is now \u201cfinal\u201d as that concept is understood under section 904.1, subdivision (a). Further, we deem Holt\u2019s notice of appeal to relate to the entirety of the judgment now brought before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Holt\u2019s Standing to Appeal From the \u201cFinal\u201d Judgment Entered Herein</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Holt is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the judgment entered against him on the declaratory relief cause of action of the cross-complaint brought by Booth. The judgment entered on the cross-complaint denies the existence of any duties or obligations extending in Holt\u2019s favor from Booth and arising out of the subject matter of the Ritchie action. The rule stating that an individually liable party is not aggrieved by the exoneration of jointly liable codefendants does not apply in this context\u2014because, quite simply, die judgment entered on the cross-complaint was not entered against multiple cross-defendants and did not assess any specific liability against a cross-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Given Holt\u2019s \u201caggrieved\u201d status under the judgment entered on the cross-complaint, Holt has standing to assert an appellate challenge to the determination reached below that he was not acting within the course and scope of his employment by Booth at the time of his accident with Ritchie.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The Course and Scope of Holt\u2019s Employment Sufficiency of the Evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The judgment entered below (as \u201cfinalized\u201d herein) is affirmed in full.</p>\n<p id=\"AND\">Dabney, Acting P. J., and McKinster, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">It would be an understatement to call the history of the pleadings in the Ritchie action \u201ctortuous.\u201d Notwithstanding the convoluted history of the pleadings, however, the simplified rendition herein is sufficient for our purposes on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory citations refer to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b883-16\">Section 902 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny party aggrieved may appeal in the cases prescribed in this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">In this case, the \u201cjointness\u201d of Booth\u2019s liability to that of Holt\u2019s was asserted on the basis of the employer/employee relationship which existed between Booth and Holt\u2014that is, Booth\u2019s liability to the Ritchies was asserted under the theory of respondeat superior. (See the general discussion of this theory of vicarious liability in <em>Mary M. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 208-210 [814 P.2d 1341].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">There is no question in this case of Holt\u2019s independent and individual liability to the Ritchies.
