Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Defendant James Hawkins II appeals his conviction of voluntary manslaughter after he shot a member of the Bounty Hunter gang on September 11,1983. Defendant received a 28-year sentence and raises numerous contentions. In the published portion of the opinion, we will discuss why the enhancement for a serious prior felony conviction pursuant to Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by reason of defendant\u2019s previous conviction for a violation of 18 United States Code, section 2114 was properly imposed. Because no error occurred the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>II-IV C<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">D. <em>Sentencing Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\n<em>The Enhancement for the Federal Robbery Conviction Was Properly Imposed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Defendant argues that the trial court erroneously imposed a five-year enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by reason of defendant\u2019s prior conviction for assaulting a person having custody of government property with the intent \u201cto rob, steal, or purloin\u201d the property or to rob the custodian in violation of 18 United States Code section 2114. As it was in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s November 4, 1974, federal conviction, 18 United States Code section 2114 provided: \u201cWhoever assaults any person having lawful charge, control, or custody of any mail matter or of any money or other property of the United States, with intent to rob, steal, or purloin such mail matter, money, or other property of the United States, or robs any such person of mail matter, or of any money, or other property of the United States, shall, for the first offense, be imprisoned not more than ten years; and if effecting or attempting to effect such robbery he wounds such person having custody of such mail, money, or other property of United States, or puts his life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon, or for a subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned twenty-five years.\u201d (Act of June 25, 1948, Pub.L. No. 772, 62 Stat. 797.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The information alleged that defendant had previously been convicted of \u201cRobbery of a Custodian of United States Property\u201d in violation of 18 United States Code section 2114. The court, after a jury waiver, found the prior federal conviction was a serious crime under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Defendant\u2019s contention on appeal in connection with the 1974 federal prior conviction is that: (1) 18 United States Code section 2114 is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>a specific intent crime because the terms \u201crob\u201d or \u201crobs\u201d in the federal statute do not require a specific intent to permanently deprive the victim of the mail or other federal property; (2) robbery under California law requires an intent to permanently deprive the victim of the property that is taken <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosen </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 147, 149-150 [78 P.2d 727, 116 A.L.R. 991]); (3) in order for an enhancement to apply pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), it is necessary that all of the elements of the federal statute would constitute a serious felony under California law; (4) since California law requires a specific intent, but federal law does not, no enhancement for a previous violation of 18 United States Code section 2114 may be imposed pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a) in the present case. Because we conclude, based upon federal court decisions the term \u201crob\u201d or \u201crobs\u201d in 18 United States Code section 2114 requires an intent to permanently deprive the government custodian or mail carrier of property or mail, the enhancement in the present case was properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In order for a prior conviction sustained in another jurisdiction to serve as a five-year enhancement, it is necessary that the \u201coffense committed in another jurisdiction . . . included all of the elements of any serious felony\u201d under California law. (\u00a7 667, subd. (a).) Defendant is correct given the express language of section 667, subdivision (a) that in order for the 1974 prior robbery conviction for violating 18 United States Code section 2114 to serve as a serious prior conviction, the federal crime must include within it all of the elements of any serious felony under California law. Under federal law, a violation of 18 United States Code section 2114 necessarily involves an attempt to rob or a completed robbery with the necessary element of an intention to permanently deprive the victim of the property. The purpose of the statute was originally to protect mail carriers from both an assault and robbery. (See <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1984) 469 U.S. 70, 71, 75 [83 L.Ed.2d 472, 475, 477, 105 S.Ct. 479].) A violation of the federal statute necessarily involves \u201cassault on some person of the class indicated, and intent of the assailant to rob or steal mail matter in the possession of such person.\u201d <em>(Conway </em>v. <em>United States </em>(7th Cir. 1924) 1 F.2d 274, 275.) In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lawrence </em>(5th Cir. 1983) 699 F.2d 697, 701, the Court of Appeals held that, \u201c[t]he proscribed criminal conduct requires proof of both an assault and an attempt to rob . . . .\u201d Other federal cases emphasize the fact that the crime necessarily involves an attempt to rob. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(10th Cir. 1977) 553 F.2d 1239,1241; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spears </em>(1971) 145 App.D.C. 284 [449 F.2d 946, 954]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spain </em>(E.D.fil. 1940) 32 F.Supp. 28, 30.) The face of the federal statute also proscribes a completed robbery which is accompanied by an assault. No doubt, an attempted robbery or a completed robbery would be a serious felony under California law. (\u00a7 1192.7, subds. (c)(10), (19) &amp; (27).)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Defendant argues, however, that the robbery referred to in 18 United States Code section 2114 does not require an intent to permanently deprive the victim of her or his property. Defendant cites federal authority digested by our colleagues in Division Six of this appellate district in <em>People </em>v. <em>Enriquez </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 1, 4-5 [205 Cal.Rptr. 238] for the proposition that a violation of the federal bank \u201crobbery\u201d statute in 18 United States Code section 2113<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not require such a specific intent and a prior conviction for bank \u201crobbery\u201d under that statute may not be used to support a section 667, subdivision (a) five-year enhancement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">However, unlike the federal bank \u201crobbery\u201d statute construed in <em>Enriquez, </em>the attempted robbery or robbery element of 18 United States Code section 2114 has been construed by federal courts as requiring a specific intent to permanently deprive the victim of property. In construing federal statutes which contain common law terms, the United States Supreme Court has held that such language is to be given its common law meaning. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Turley </em>(1957) 352 U.S. 407, 411 [1 L.Ed.2d 430, 433, 77 S.Ct. 397, 56 A.L.R.2d 1300].) In other situations where common law language has appeared in larceny type statutes, federal courts have held that the common law intent to deprive the victim of the property taken is an essential element of such laws. <em>(Morissette </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 246, 260-261 [96 L.Ed.288, 298-299, 72 S.Ct. 240]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thordarson </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 646 F.2d 1323, 1333; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1970) 140 App.D.C. 309 [435 F.2d 113, 115]; <em>Government of Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Carmona </em>(3d Cir. 1970) 422 F.2d 95, 98-99.) Although the statute does not define robbery, it has been held in connection with 18 United States Code section 2114, as follows: \u201c \u2018[T]he word \u201crob\u201d is used in its common law sense, that is, it involves the taking, animo furandi, and asportation of property from the person from another against his will by violence or putting him in fear.\u2019 <em>Costner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>139 F.2d 429, 431 (4th Cir. 1943) (citing <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>United States </em>163 U.S. 140 [41 L Ed 104, 16 S.Ct. 961], [] (1896).)\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(7th Cir. 1991) 925 F.2d 1049, 1052.)  The terms <em>animo </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number><em>animus furandi </em>are the common law phrases for the intent to permanently deprive a person of their property. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Northway </em>(1887) 120 U.S. 327, 335-336 [30 L.Ed. 664, 666-667, 7 S.Ct. 580]; <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>United States </em>(8th Cir. 1926) 15 F.2d 911, 912; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(C.C.N.D. Ala. 1907) 161 Fed. 1008, 1013; 67 Am.Jur.2d Robbery, \u00a7 17, pp. 70-71; 77 C.J.S., Robbery, \u00a7 22, pp. 462-463; Perkins, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) pp. 327-328; 3 Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (14th ed. 1980) \u00a7 360, p. 317.)  Since both California\u2019s robbery statute and federal court interpretations of 18 United States Code section 2114 require the person committing the robbery or assault with the intent to rob which necessarily includes an attempted robbery to possess the intent to permanently deprive the victim of her or his property, defendant\u2019s argument that the enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a) must be stricken because his 1974 prior federal conviction would not be a serious felony under California law is without merit. Accordingly, insofar as the judgment imposes such a five-year enhancement, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">V.
