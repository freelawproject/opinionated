J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajj\">In this case we confront a conundrum created by the interplay of various provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure governing the contents of complaints, the service of process, and the methods of obtaining a default judgment. Under the express statutory scheme, there is no provision for a defaulting defendant in a personal injury action who had been served by publication to be subsequently served with a statement of the damages sought by the plaintiff. The trial court found this lack of express statutory directive for such a statement to be determinative and consequently ruled that failure to serve a statement of damages did not entitle the defendant to relief from default.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In the published portion of this case, we hold that the proper service of a statement of damages or its equivalent, although not expressly required by statute under these circumstances, is compelled by due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the absence of the proper service of such a constitutionally required notice, the court lacks jurisdiction to enter a default judgment. We further conclude that a prayer in the complaint for \u201ccompensatory damages according to proof\u201d fails to give the requisite notice and hence cannot act as a substitute for a separate notice of damages. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">For purposes of the published portion of this opinion, our factual focus is narrow. In May 1987, plaintiffs Doris and Harold Parish, Jr., filed their form complaint in the superior court for personal injury, property damage, and loss of consortium allegedly resulting from a motor vehicle accident occurring 364 days earlier. The plaintiffs prayed for compensatory damages \u201caccording to proof.\u201d Almost two years later, in February 1989, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte application for an order permitting service of process by publication. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 415.50 [subsequent undesignated section references are to this code].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court issued the order, and the summons appeared in The Daily Recorder, a newspaper of general circulation for Sacramento County, on four consecutive Fridays in March 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>On August 21, 1989, the plaintiffs filed a request for a court judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 585, subd. (c).) Under the heading \u201cStatement of damages ([\u00a7] 425.11),\u201d tiie plaintiffs claimed $1,790 in special damages and $40,000 in general damages. They also sought $198 in costs. Ten days later, the plaintiffs filed an application for a default judgment, set for September 7. (\u00a7 587.) The application once again sought damages in the sum of $41,790, together with costs of $198. Attached to this application was a proof of service by mail on the defendant at an address in Rancho Cordova, California. Following a hearing at which plaintiff Doris Parish testified, the court entered a default judgment on October 17, 1989, in the amount claimed in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Although the particular vehicle by which the defendant sought relief is ultimately irrelevant, we note the defendant initially moved in January 1990 to quash the summons for failure to publish it in a newspaper most likely to give him actual notice (\u00a7 418.10), to set aside the default for lack of actual notice without inexcusable neglect or avoidance of service (\u00a7 473.5), and to set aside the default under the general relief statute (\u00a7 473). The motion appended his proposed answer. The court denied the motions. The defendant next moved to set aside the judgment (invoking \u00a7 473) on the specific ground the plaintiffs did not serve the section 425.11 statement of damages on the defendant more than 30 days before the request for a default judgment, at which point they sent one to an incorrect address. He again appended his proposed answer. The court once more denied the motion: \u201c[Defense counsel], you\u2019re asking the Court to invalidate the default judgment on the ground that no statement of damages was served. The law does not require it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendant now appeals from the default judgment and the two orders entered after judgment denying relief from judgment. He claims the judgment is void either for failure to serve a statement of damages or because service by publication was improper. He further claims the trial court abused its discretion in failing to set aside the default under section 473.5 because he did not attempt to evade service \u2022 and was not guilty of inexcusable neglect. In the published portion of this opinion, we limit our consideration to his claim that the judgment was invalid because he was not served with a statement of damages pursuant to section 425.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Defendant contends that the default judgment entered against him is void because plaintiffs failed to serve him with a statement of damages as required by section 425.11. Plaintiffs counter that such a statement is not required when service has been made by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The starting point for our analysis is section 580, which states quite simply, \u201cThe relief granted to [a] plaintiff, if there be no answer, cannot exceed that which [is] demanded in [the] complaint . . . .\u201d As the Supreme Court held without qualification in <em>Greenup </em>v. <em>Rodman </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822 [231 Cal.Rptr. 220, 726 P.2d 1295], \u201cin all default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 824.) In its overview of section 580, the high court stated the statute should be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d so that any default judgment in excess of the amount specifically demanded is void as extra-jurisdictional. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 826.) \u201cThe notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness. Surely this would be undermined if the door were opened to speculation, no matter how reasonable it might appear in a particular case that a prayer for damages according to proof provided adequate notice of a defaulting defendant\u2019s potential liability.\u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>[internal quotation marks deleted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Section 580 constitutes a statutory expression of the mandates of due process, which require \u201cformal notice of potential liability.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 826; accord, <em>Petty </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc. </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 794, 798 [156 Cal.Rptr. 622] [California has codified constitutional protection of notice].)  Those mandates also require that the form of substituted service be \u201creasonably calculated to give [the defendant] actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard. If it is, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice [citation] implicit in due process are satisfied.\u201d <em>(Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1940) 311 U.S. 457, 463 [85 L.Ed. 278, 283\u201e 61 S.Ct. 339, 132 A.L.R. 1357].) Thus, the statutes \u201cpermitting a personal judgment to be taken by constructive service of summons against a resident who cannot, after due diligence, be found within the state, or who conceals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>himself to avoid the service of summons is not violative of constitutional due process.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 779, 785-786 [16 Cal.Rptr. 36] [italics omitted].) Due process then remains the \u201cparamount concern\u201d regardless of any other policy which might be furthered if the notice requirement were to be relaxed. <em>(Greenup, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 828.) Nor does the worthiness of the defendant enter into the due process calculus: \u201cWe conclude that due process requires notice to defendants, whether they default by inaction or by wil[l]ful obstruction, of the potential consequences of [their] refusal to pursue [a] defense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In the ordinary course of events, the limitation in section 580 on the amount of the judgment in absence of an answer does not pose a problem for plaintiffs, since section 425.10 requires, if \u2018the recovery of money or damages be demanded,\u201d that \u2018the amount thereof shall be stated . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) However, in 1974 the Legislature amended the statute with respect to personal injury and wrongful death actions. It now provides that a complaint filed in superior court \u201cto recover actual or punitive damages for personal injury [shall not state] the amount thereof . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This amendment was intended to protect defendants from inflated demands resulting in adverse publicity, particularly in medical malpractice cases. <em>(Schwab </em>v. <em>Rondel Homes, Inc. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 431 [280 Cal.Rptr. 83, 808 P.2d 226].) Simultaneously, section 425.11 was added, which provides, \u201cWhen a complaint ... is filed ... for personal injury ... the plaintiff shall give notice to the defendant of the amount of special and general damages sought to be recovered . . . before a <em>default </em>may be taken . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics supplied.) The defendant is then accorded a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of time to respond (or not) to the statement of damages before the default may be entered. <em>(Schwab, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 435; <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Castillo </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1583, 1589-1590 [236 Cal.Rptr. 112].) Section 425.11 \u201cremoves the anomaly between section 580 and section 425.10.\u201d <em>(Petty, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 798.) Thus, assuming a plaintiff complies with these pleading requirements, the Legislature has made provision for the notice required by due process in all instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>However, the symmetry of this scheme is thrown asunder by a discordance in the several subdivisions of section 585, the statute which governs the procedures for obtaining a default judgment, in light of the specific wording of section 425.11 (\u201cthe plaintiff shall give notice . . . before a <em>default </em>may be taken\u201d). (Italics supplied.) Subdivision (a) of section 585 applies \u201c[i]n an action arising upon contract or judgment for the recovery of money or damages only, if the defendant has . . . been served, <em>other than by publication </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics supplied.) If so, upon written application of the plaintiff the clerk \u201cshall enter <em>the default </em>of the defendant . . . and immediately <em>thereafter </em>enter judgment. . . .\u201d <em>{Ibid, </em>[italics supplied].) Subdivision (b) of section 585 applies \u201c[i]n other actions, if the defendant has been served, <em>other than by publication </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics supplied.) Again, upon written application of the plaintiff, \u201cthe clerk . . . shall enter <em>the default </em>of the defendant. The plaintiff <em>thereafter </em>may apply to the court for the relief demanded . . . ; the court shall . . . render judgment ... for such sum ... as appears ... to be just.\u201d <em>{Ibid, </em>[italics supplied].) As can be seen, both of these subdivisions are predicated upon the entry of a default.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">However, subdivision (c) of section 585 does not require the entry of a default when service was accomplished by publication. Instead, a judgment is simply entered. Thus, under subdivision (c) of section 585, which applies \u201c[i]n all actions where the service of the summons was by publication,\u201d the plaintiff may move in writing for judgment.  \u201cThe court shall thereupon require proof . . . and may render <em>judgment . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">This leaves us with an odd conundrum. Defendants who have been served, and thus have actual notice of a personal injury complaint, must be given actual notice of the amount of damages sought before a <em>default </em>may be taken (which is then followed up by proof of damages and actual entry of judgment). On the other hand, since by its terms section 425.11 is a prerequisite only to a \u201cdefault,\u201d and not a default judgment, the defendant with no formal notice of a personal injury action other than by publication (which may be no notice at all) does not appear to be entitled by statute to have notice of the amount of damages at issue served upon him, since under section 585 a default is not a prerequisite to judgment in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>As we have recited, the trial court was untroubled by this legislative scheme, correctly noting there was no express statutory requirement for service of prejudgment notice of damages to a defendant served by publication. Were this simply a matter of statutes, we would agree. But as we noted at length in the outset of this discussion, the due process concerns enshrined in our constitutions\u2014concerns which are fundamental to all precepts of jurisprudence <em>(Burtnett v. King </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 805, 808 [205 P.2d 657, 12 A.L.R.2d 333]) and codified in section 580\u2014forbid a judgment against a defendant in excess of that demanded in the complaint without any formal notice of an increase of the amount in issue. Thus, to protect the due process rights of defendants while allowing personal injury plaintiffs to seek default judgments against runaway defendants, we must hold as a matter of constitutional law that the equivalent of a section 425.11 statement of damages be served in the same manner as a summons prior to entry of a default judgment against a defendant served by publication.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1473 [273 Cal.Rptr. 279] [where complaint precluded from stating amount of punitive damages (\u00a7 3295, subd. (e)), plaintiff must furnish notice of amount of damages before default even though no explicit statutory provision for such]; <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1257, 1263-1264 [274 Cal.Rptr. 536] [a notice analogous to statement of damages required in action for an accounting even where not required by statute].) This protection of a defendant\u2019s due process rights does not work any particular hardship on a plaintiff burdened with an absent defendant. As in <em>Plotitsa, </em>which imposed the requirement of personal service of the statement of damages, \u201cPlaintiffs have the same protection as exists with service of summons on original complaints. Sections 415.20 and 415.50 provide for substituted service and service by publication if reasonable diligence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>effecting personal service is not successful.\u201d (140 Cal.App.3d at p. 761.) Thus, service of the statement, upon proper showing, can be made by publication upon the defendant originally served by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The plaintiffs rely on <em>Candelaria </em>v. <em>Avitia </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1436 [269 Cal.Rptr. 32]. There the defendant in a personal injury action fled and was later served by publication. The defendant never appeared. Her insurance companies quibbled over whether they were obligated to cover the accident since it was the result of a \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d in the defendant\u2019s home. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs entered a default judgment against her. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1439-1440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The <em>Candelaria </em>court first held section 425.11 inapplicable. (219 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1440-1442.) As we have noted above, this is entirely correct under the express wording of the statute. However, to the extent the court\u2019s analysis in this context is being used to suggest due process does not require an <em>equivalent </em>nonstatutory notice to defendants served by publication, we decline to join it. That serving such a statement on an absent defendant might be an \u201cidle act\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3532)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> does not excuse giving the notice; otherwise, there would be no point in the initial service by publication of the original summons. Service by publication may not impart actual notice, but it is the best that due process can exact under the circumstances. Nor is it determinative that sections 425.10 and 425.11 were designed to protect a defendant from embarrassment. In the first place, absent defendants bring about the publication by their own actions; thus we should not be too concerned with their \u201cembarrassment.\u201d More importantly, as we earlier noted, the high court in <em>Greenup </em>has explicitly stated due process is the preeminent consideration, which consequently must triumph over protection from obloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The <em>Candelaria </em>court then looked to section 585\u2019s asymmetrical subdivisions in support for its conclusion that no notice of damages need be given the absent defendant. The court correctly concluded the difference in the wording must be given significance with respect to the need or not for a default prior to judgment. (219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1443.) However, we disagree that the difference in phrasing in the three subdivisions of section 585<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> evinces a legislative intent that a plaintiff is not limited to the amount claimed in the complaint where service has been by publication, and that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>can be justified because \u201cdefendant\u2019s whereabouts are unknown.\u201d (219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1443.) We cannot ascribe a meaning to the statute which would be in derogation of due process. While the <em>Candelaria </em>court states this is \u201cno less protection than that which [a defendant] receives under the outright default procedure, because the requirement of hearing permits the court to scrutinize the evidence and limit plaintiff\u2019s recovery to what the evidence permits\u201d <em>{id. </em>at pp. 1443-1444), this misconstrues the due process concern at work. It is not that we wish to ensure that the evidence supports the judgment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but rather\u2014as expressed in Greenup\u2014that we want to enable \u201ca defendant to exercise [the] right to choose\u2014at any point before trial, even after discovery has begun\u2014between (1) giving up [the] right to defend in exchange for the certainty [of liability] for . . . a known amount, and (2) exercising [the] right to defend . . . .\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 829.) Furthermore, saying the absent defendant is accorded no less protection ignores the basic distinction between the default situation and a defendant served by publication; the former does require notice to the defendant of the amount of damages before damages are adjudicated, which satisfies due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The other two rationales advanced by the <em>Candelaria </em>court (219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1444) cannot excuse giving notice to the defendant of damages. As we explain more fully in the next paragraph, the fact that section 587 requires an affidavit stating the plaintiff has served a copy of the application for default or default judgment upon the defendant at his last known address does not satisfy due process; this is not the type of service required for the section 425.11 statement of damages (or the equivalent required by due process). Finally, application of the California Constitution\u2019s standard of harmless error <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]) has no application where we are considering a judgment rendered extrajudicial for want of due process. Thus, the <em>Candelaria </em>decision is of no succor to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Turning to the case before us, it is readily apparent the plaintiffs have not satisfied the dictates of due process. Prior to requesting that judgment be entered against the defendant on a personal injury complaint which states no amount of compensatory damages, they made only service by mail to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Rancho Cordova address. As we recounted, this was neither defendant\u2019s dwelling house, his usual place of abode, nor his usual place of business. Section 587 directs in relevant part that \u201can application for judgment under subdivision (c) of Section 585 shall include an affidavit stating that a copy of the application has been mailed to the defendant\u2019s attorney of record or, if none, to the defendant at his or her last known address and the date on which the copy was mailed. If no such address of the defendant is known to the plaintiff or plaintiff\u2019s attorney the affidavit shall state that fact.\u201d The mailed application in this case, as noted in our facts, listed the total amount of damages and costs sought. This was not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In <em>Plotitsa, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.3d 755, 759, the court noted that amendments to civil complaints, which increased the amount of damages sought, must be personally served upon a \u201cnonappearing\u201d defendant before default may be entered against that defendant for the increased amount. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Engebretson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436 [178 Cal.Rptr. 77].) The <em>Plotitsa </em>court then \u201cconcluded that a \u2018statement of damages\u2019 under section 425.11 is the functional equivalent of an amendment to a complaint that increased the amount of damages sought. Accordingly, the same considerations requiring personal service must apply.\u201d (140 Cal.App.3d at p. 759; see also <em>Petty, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 798.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">By a parity of reasons, even if the application for a default judgment under section 587 could be construed as the functional equivalent of a statement of damages under section 425.11, that application would also have to be served in the same manner as a summons. (See \u00a7\u00a7 415.10-415.40.) Because no such service occurred here, we need not decide whether plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence to ascertain defendant\u2019s correct mailing address. (See <em>Slusher </em>v. <em>Durr </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 747, 755 [138 Cal.Rptr. 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Since defendant was not properly served with a statement of damages or its equivalent, plaintiffs can prevail here, if at all, only by virtue of the notice imparted by the complaint.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore turn the issue of whether the complaint in this case adequately imparted notice of the amount of damages sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">As we have just explained, neither the mailed copy of the application for default nor the fact there is a \u201cprove up\u201d hearing is sufficient to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>defendant\u2019s due process right to choose to defend. Consequently, the judgment is void to the extent it exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint. (\u00a7 580; <em>Schwab, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 433 [\u201cAs a general rule, a default judgment is thus limited to the damages of which the defendants had notice.\u201d].) We must now determine the extent to which the instant defendant has received constructive notice of damages from the complaint, which requires us to view <em>Greenup </em>through the lens of <em>Schwab.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Originally, the high court drew a bright-line rule for the requisite notice of damages: a specific amount of damages must be averred, either in the prayer or in the body of the complaint. \u201cIf no specific amount of damages is demanded [in the prayer], the prayer cannot insure adequate notice of the demands made upon the defendant. Consequently, a prayer for damages according to proof passes muster under section 580 only if a specific amount of damages is alleged in the body of the complaint.\u201d <em>(Becker </em>v. <em>S.P.V. Construction Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 [165 Cal.Rptr. 825, 612 P.2d 915] [citations omitted].) This bright line was somewhat dimmed in <em>Greenup. </em>There the plaintiff alleged causes of action for \u201cfraud and conspiracy to defraud, concealment of assets, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and intentional infliction of emotional distress,\u201d and claimed damages \u201c \u2018in a sum that exceeds the jurisdictional requirements of this court.\u2019 In her prayer, however, the only specific sum requested was $100,000 in exemplary and punitive damages: all other damages were to be \u2018subject to proof at time of trial\u2019 or \u2018as the court deems just.\u2019 \u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 825.) After determining it was improper not to give the defendant formal notice of the amount of damages sought before taking a default judgment, the court stated, \u201c[W]e conclude that the award must be amended to conform to the limitations specified in section 580. Defendants argue that because plaintiff stated no amount of damages in her prayer, she is entitled to <em>no </em>compensatory damages whatever. In <em>Becker, </em>however, we specifically held that the allegations of a complaint may cure a defective prayer for damages. [][] Each of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action, with the exception of her personal injury claim, concluded with the allegation that she suffered damage \u2018in an amount that exceeds the jurisdictional requirements of this court.\u2019 Plaintiff brought her action in the Los Angeles Superior Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction . . . [, where] the amount in controversy [must exceed] $15,000.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] By her allegations, plaintiff thus gave sufficient notice to defendant that she claimed at least $15,000 in compensatory damages. While an award in excess of $15,000 would be improper, a judgment in that amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>was within the jurisdiction of the court. The compensatory award should therefore be reduced to the extent that it exceeds $15,000. [f] . . . For the reasons given ... the award of punitive damages must be reduced to the amount of $100,000 pleaded in the complaint.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 829-830 [citations deleted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">This <em>Greenup </em>holding was recently refined in the <em>Schwab </em>case. \u201cWe determined in <em>Greenup . . </em>. that a plaintiff\u2019s complaint claiming general damages \u2018in an amount that exceeds the jurisdictional requirements of this court\u2019 provided the defendant notice that the plaintiff was seeking general damages of at least $15,000\u2014the jurisdictional minimum of the court in which she appeared. . . . H[] . . . While we did award the plaintiff the jurisdictional minimum in general damages in <em>Greenup, </em>the facts in that case differed substantially from the facts before ... us today.\u201d <em>(Schwab, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 433.) A subsequent case, <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 976 [237 Cal.Rptr. 756], \u201cinterpreted <em>Greenup </em>to hold that <em>all </em>defendants should be presumed to be on notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for general damages of at least the jurisdictional minimum regardless of the form of complaint. The case before us, however, shows the flaw in this reasoning: plaintiffs\u2019 claim for $500,000 in punitive damages in itself properly put this case before the superior court. Because plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages had already established the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction, neither a [layperson] nor an experienced attorney could be presumed to know the amount of general damages plaintiffs were seeking in this case.\u201d <em>(Schwab, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 434 [italics in original and citations omitted].) The <em>Schwab </em>court also suggested constructive notice of damages based on a court\u2019s jurisdictional floor was contrary to section 425.11\u2019s explicit requirement a defendant be given notice of general and special damages. (53 Cal.3d at p. 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">After the <em>Schwab </em>court disapproved <em>Morgan </em>(53 Cal.3d at p. 434), it considered the complaint before it. \u201cIn this case, the fact that defendants had notice of plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for statutory damages in an amount according to proof but \u2018no less than $250\u2019[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] and punitive damages in the amount of $500,000 is not sufficient to meet the requirements of section 425.11.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 435.) The court therefore held the judgment was properly vacated in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The complaint in the present action \u201cis on one of the skeletal], preprinted forms supplied by the Judicial Council, with boxes to be checked for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>appropriate allegations.\u201d <em>(Lopez </em>v. <em>Fancelli </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1305, 1308, fn. 4 [271 Cal.Rptr. 87].) In the body of the complaint, captioned \u201cPersonal Injury, Property Damage, Wrongful Death,\u201d the plaintiffs alleged, by checking the appropriate boxes, they had suffered wage loss, hospital and medical expenses, property damage, loss of use of property, general damage, loss of earning capacity and loss of consortium. No dollar amount was assigned to any of these kinds of damages. In the cause of action for loss of consortium, plaintiff Harold Parish alleged that he was deprived of the consortium of his wife, all to his damage \u201caccording to proof.\u201d The prayer of the complaint similarly failed to specify any dollar amount of damages.  Stripped of its boxes, the prayer reads: \u201cPlaintiff prays for judgment for costs of suit; for such relief as is fair, just, and equitable; and for compensatory damages (Superior Court) according to proof.\" (Capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Under <em>Greenup </em>and <em>Schwab, </em>this is insufficient to give the requisite notice of the amount of damages claimed. In order to meet the notice requirements imposed by due process, a plaintiff must either give notice of the damages claimed in a separate statement of damages or by the allegations of the complaint. To pass constitutional muster, the complaint must either allege a specific dollar amount of damages in the body or prayer or at the very least allege the boilerplate damages are \u201cin an amount that exceeds the jurisdictional requirements\u201d of the superior court. An allegation seeking damages \u201caccording to proof\u201d fails to fulfill the mandate of section 425.11 or of due process. After all, a \u201cdefendant is entitled to actual notice of the liability to which he or she may be subjected, a reasonable period of time before default may be entered.\u201d <em>(Schwab, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The fact that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also alleged that \u201c[r]elief sought in this complaint is within the jurisdiction of this court\u201d does not change this result. Such a general jurisdictional allegation does not give notice of the actual amount of damages sought by the plaintiff. Nor is it equivalent to a prayer for general damages \u201cin an amount that exceeds the jurisdictional requirements\u201d of the superior court. The <em>Greenup </em>court reasoned that by such a prayer for excess damages, \u201cplaintiff thus gave sufficient notice to defendants that she claimed at least $15,000 in compensatory damages.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 830.) Here in contrast, plaintiffs\u2019 prayer sought damages only \u201caccording to proof.\u201d This fails to provide proper notice of the amount of damages sought. <em>(Schwab, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 435.) Although the allegations of a complaint may cure a defective prayer for damages <em>(Becker, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 494), the allegation in the body of this complaint did not allege any specific amount of damages. Indeed, it did not even explicitly use the term \u201cdamage.\u201d Instead, it merely asserted that the relief sought, whatever that was, fell within the jurisdiction of the court. This nebulous assertion does not meet the minimum due process standards for notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>damages sought. To rule otherwise would be to assert that defendants are chargeable with constructive notice of the jurisdictional minimum of damages in all cases, an assertion expressly rejected by the <em>Schwab </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Because plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sought only unspecified damages, it could not serve the function of a statement of damages. <em>(Hamm </em>v. <em>Elkin </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1343, 1347 [242 Cal.Rptr. 545].) And because defendant did not receive the proper notice of the amount of damages sought, the default judgment cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The judgment is reversed.

As we shall see, this clerk\u2019s default is a superfluity in actions premised on service by publication. (3 Cal.

The request shall be served upon the plaintiff or cross-complainant, who shall serve a responsive statement as to the damages within 15 days thereafter. In the event that a response is not served, the party, on notice to the plaintiff or cross-complainant, may petition the court in which the action is pending to order the plaintiff or cross-complainant to serve a responsive statement. [5] If no request is made for such a statement setting forth the nature and amount of damages being sought, the plaintiff shall give notice to the defendant of the amount of special and general damages sought to be recovered (1) before a default may be taken; or (2) in the event an answer is filed, at least 60 days prior to the date set for trial.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\">As Witkin explains, \u201c[i]f the defendant fails to answer within the necessary time, his \u2018default\u2019 may be entered. Up to the time of such entry, he may ordinarily file his belated pleading. But the entry of default cuts off that opportunity, and, unless vacated, permanently precludes the filing of an answer. [5] After a default is entered, the case stands with an unanswered complaint, on which ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to a \u2018judgment by default\u2019 or\u2018default judgment.\u2019This judgment is distinct from the default. . . .
