Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 11351.5). Appellant admitted two Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term allegations and was sentenced to six years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Relying on our recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 680 [269 Cal.Rptr. 479], appellant contends there is no substantial evidence the cocaine he possessed was base cocaine as required by section 11351.5. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">On November 9,1989, about 1 a.m., Bakersfield Police Officers Mills and Eakin observed three men, including appellant, apparently dealing narcotics in front of Nagi\u2019s Liquor Store. The officers called for a backup unit and ordered the 3 men and 30 or 40 other individuals milling about in front of Nagi\u2019s to sit down. Appellant and his two cohorts began walking away. As the police pursued them, appellant and another man discarded two baggies containing an off-white, chunky substance described by Officer Mills as \u201crock cocaine.\u201d Criminalist Brenda Smith tested the substance in the baggies and found the first consisted of \u201cchunky material weighing 7.65 grams containing] cocaine\u201d and the second, \u201cchunky material weighing 4.79 grams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>contain[ing] cocaine.\u201d Smith was not asked and did not indicate whether the cocaine in evidence was rock cocaine or cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>Is There Substantial Evidence Appellant Possessed Cocaine Base?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, we must view the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below and presume in support of the judgment every fact which the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].) Before the judgment may be set aside for insufficiency of evidence, it must clearly be shown that upon no hypothesis whatever is there substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Redmond </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755 [79 Cal.Rptr. 529, 457 P.2d 321].) Substantial evidence is evidence that is reasonable, credible, of solid value and reasonably inspires confidence in the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 55 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In the present case, Officer Mills was called as a witness by the prosecution. He testified he had taken narcotics classes, talked to other officers about rock cocaine, and had arrested at least 150 persons for possession of rock cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Mills testified he observed appellant engaging in what appeared to be a rock cocaine transaction similar to those he had made arrests for in the past. Officer Mills further testified that after appellant discarded something, Officer Eakin retrieved two packages of \u201crock cocaine.\u201d Mills testified that \u201c[r]ock cocaine is\u2014it\u2019s cocaine base.\u201d When shown the two packages that criminalist Smith had identified as \u201cchunky material containing] [cocaine],\u201d Mills identified them as \u201c[t]he two bags of narcotics that were seized by Officer Eakin. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d 680, appellant argues the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. In <em>Adams </em>we found insubstantial evidence to support the conviction of possession of cocaine base for sale because there was no evidence that the cocaine possessed by the defendant was cocaine base. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">\u201cIt is true that Officer Clerico in his testimony used the terms \u2018cocaine base,\u2019 \u2018rock cocaine,\u2019 and \u2018crack\u2019 interchangeably and he also referred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>substance in the two baggies possessed by defendant as \u2018what I believed to be rock cocaine.\u2019 However, the officer was not qualified as an expert in the identification of cocaine or cocaine base, but rather as an expert in the possession of rock cocaine for sale. Moreover, Officer Clerico never testified regarding making any chemical tests or chemical analysis of the substance found in defendant\u2019s possession. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 687.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In <em>Adams, </em>Officer Clerico never testified definitively and no evidence was introduced that expressly showed rock cocaine was cocaine base. Unlike <em>Adams, </em>here Officer Mills testified without objection that \u201crock cocaine\u201d is \u201cbase cocaine.\u201d Accordingly, Officer Mills\u2019s testimony establishes that the substance in question was cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Appellant nonetheless argues Officer Mills\u2019s testimony may not be considered in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal because no basis was provided for Mills\u2019s conclusion that \u201crock cocaine\u201d was cocaine base. Adoption of appellant\u2019s argument would require us to construe <em>Adams </em>as holding that when inadmissible evidence is introduced without objection at trial it may not be considered in evaluating the sufficiency of evidence on appeal. We reject such a construction as contrary to well-settled rules of appellate review.  As stated in <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Chrome Crankshaft Co. </em>(1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 549, 552 [324 P.2d 70]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201cIt is settled law that incompetent testimony, such as hearsay or conclusion, if received without objection takes on the attributes of competent proof when considered upon the question of sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding. [Citations.] \u2018Evidence technically incompetent admitted without objection must be given as much weight in the reviewing court in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence as if it were competent. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Neither may Officer Mills\u2019s testimony be rejected as inherently improbable.  As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]o warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by the [trier of fact], there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 306 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Absent a resort to inferences and deductions not a part of this record, we cannot conclude it was physically impossible for the baggie to contain cocaine base. The record does not reflect the manner in which Officer Mills determined the substance in question was cocaine base. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>order to reject his testimony we would have to infer there is no legitimate basis for his opinion. Because such an inference is impermissible, Officer Mills\u2019 testimony may not be rejected as inherently improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1971) <em>4 </em>Cal.3d 231 [93 Cal.Rptr. 197, 481 P.2d 205], on which the dissent relies, clearly is distinguishable: there the record reflected affirmatively that there was no legitimate basis for the expert\u2019s opinion. In <em>Hunt, </em>the defendant was charged with possession of dangerous drugs for sale. The vials which the defendant possessed had pharmacy labels and a \u201cprescription number, defendant\u2019s name, and the physician\u2019s name . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234.) Under these circumstances, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201cIn the absence of evidence of some circumstances not to be expected in connection with a patient lawfully using the drugs as medicine, an officer\u2019s opinion that possession of lawfully prescribed drugs is for purposes of sale is worthy of little or no weight and should not constitute substantial evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction. No such special circumstances were shown here as to the methedrine in the blue and white travel case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 238.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Newman </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 48 [95 Cal.Rptr. 12, 484 P.2d 1356], the court rejected a defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence that he possessed dangerous drugs for sale. As in <em>Hunt, </em>an officer testified that \u201cthe bindles \u2018were in possession for sale,\u2019 because of the quantity found in a single container.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 52.) The court rejected the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and distinguished <em>Hunt </em>on the grounds that \u201c[i]n the instant case, there was no evidence that the drugs were in fact lawfully purchased by prescription.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 53.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Unlike <em>Hunt, </em>nothing in the present record suggests Officer Mills\u2019s testimony was not worthy of belief. The dissent\u2019s position does not rely on the proposition that the testimony that the substance was base cocaine is untrue. Rattier, the dissent\u2019s position is that there is nothing in the record that demonstrates the basis for Mills\u2019s testimony. The answer is that the concerns expressed by the dissent would have been addressed by an objection. No member of this court is capable on this evidence of concluding that a substance testing positive for cocaine cannot be then identified by its form or other physical properties to be base cocaine or that Mills did not have any basis for his testimony supporting the conclusion that it was base cocaine. This is precisely the speculation the dissent indulges in.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The reality of this case is the issue raised on appeal concerning whether this was base cocaine was not even the focus of dispute in the trial court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>that is most likely the reason there was no objection or other challenge to the evidence. The trial concerned itself with whether appellant was the perpetrator of the offense in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">A trier of fact reasonably could rely on the testimony of a trained narcotics officer received without objection that the substance possessed was rock cocaine and that rock cocaine was base cocaine. Coupled with the criminalist\u2019s testimony that the substance tested positive for cocaine, we conclude the evidence is substantial and supports the verdict. Although the evidence might have been inadmissible on a proper showing of insufficient foundation or hearsay, etc., no such challenge was made. Appellant would have us make his objection for him, sustain it and then refuse to consider the evidence in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence. To do so would violate the rule of Evidence Code section 353, that a verdict or finding may not be set aside by reason of the erroneous admission of evidence unless there is an objection at trial. \u201c[A] contrary rule would deprive the party offering the evidence of any opportunity to cure the defect at trial and would permit the nonobjecting party to gamble that the error will provide grounds for reversal of the matter.

Moreover, <em>Adams </em>does not stand for the proposition that otherwise inadmissible evidence introduced without objection may not be considered in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. Officer Mills\u2019s testimony, introduced without objection, that appellant possessed rock cocaine and that rock cocaine is cocaine base\u2014combined with the criminalist\u2019s testimony that the substance in question tested positive for cocaine\u2014is sufficient to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\"><em>Whether the Trial Court\u2019s Failure to Give CALJIC No. 2.71 (Admissions) Sua Sponte was </em>Error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A35\">Thaxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-13\">All statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\"><em>Newman </em>was disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 857, 862 [122 Cal.Rptr. 872, 537 P.2d 1232].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 459.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>BEST, P.

[Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 55 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 680 [269 Cal.Rptr. 479], Adams was convicted of possession of rock cocaine for sale in violation of Health and Safety Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 11351.5. <em>(Adams, supra, </em>at p.683.) The evidence presented at trial showed that during a search when Officer Clerico pulled on the waistband of Adams\u2019s shorts a baggie of what the officer believed to be rock cocaine fell to the sidewalk. Six \u201crocks\u201d were in the baggie. Officer Clerico was ruled to be qualified as an expert on possession of rock cocaine for sale. He gave his expert opinion that the cocaine was possessed for sale based on, among other things, the size and number of rocks. Criminalist Brenda Smith testified the contents of the baggie weighed 1.01 grams and contained some cocaine. Smith was not asked and did not indicate whether the cocaine was cocaine base or rock cocaine. Officer Clerico referred to the substance as rock cocaine throughout his testimony and was conversant in the distinction between cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride, but he did not indicate whether a chemical analysis had been performed to determine if the cocaine was cocaine base. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 684.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We concluded there was no substantial evidence that proved the cocaine possessed by Adams was cocaine base as required by the statute under which he was convicted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 688.) We reasoned that the statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 11351.5, 11054, subd. (f)(1) and 11055, subd. (b)(6)) distinguish \u201ccocaine base\u201d from \u201ccocaine.\u201d In addition, the Legislature regards cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride as different drugs and they are treated as such. The penalty for possession for sale of cocaine base (three, four, and five years in prison) is higher than for possession for sale of all other forms of cocaine (two, three, and four years in prison). Finally, there is a chemical difference between cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 686-687; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Howell </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 254, 260-261 [276 Cal.Rptr. 454].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We rejected the argument that the evidence was sufficient to show Adams possessed rock cocaine based on the uncontradicted testimony of Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Clerico distinguishing \u201crock\u201d or \u201cbase\u201d cocaine from \u201cpowder\u201d or cocaine hydrochloride, the packaging and appearance of the material and the criminalist\u2019s chemical analysis which proved the material contained cocaine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 687.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">While the officer referred to the substance in the two baggies possessed by Adams as \u201cwhat I believed to be rock cocaine,\u201d he was not qualified as an expert in the identification of cocaine or cocaine base, but rather as an expert in the possession of rock cocaine for sale. Moreover, neither the officer nor any other expert witness testified that a substance containing \u201ccocaine base\u201d as opposed to a substance containing \u201ccocaine\u201d as those terms are used in sections 11054, subdivision (f)(1) and 11055, subdivision (b)(6) could be identified by physical appearance alone. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 687-688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In order to prove defendant was in violation of section 11351.5, it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the substance possessed for sale was \u201ccocaine base\u201d and not \u201crock cocaine.\u201d Thus, even if, as the Attorney General submits, Officer Mills\u2019s testimony, based on his established expertise, identified the substance as \u201crock cocaine,\u201d the substance itself was admitted as an exhibit at trial, and there was circumstantial evidence that \u201crock cocaine\u201d was being sold and smoked in the area where defendant was selling, there was insufficient evidence that defendant possessed \u201ccocaine base\u201d for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Officer Mills obviously was familiar with rock cocaine. He had taken narcotics classes, talked to other officers about rock cocaine, arrested at least 150 persons for possession of rock cocaine. He testified that rock cocaine is cocaine base, a \u201cconcentrated form\u201d of cocaine. Cocaine powder is made into a solid substance and instead of inhaling it, a user smokes rock cocaine through a pipe, sometimes known as a \u201cstraight shooter.\u201d He also testified that defendant appeared to be engaging in drug transactions similar to those he had made arrests for in the past in connection with rock cocaine. Finally, he testified, after defendant appeared to discard something, Officer Eakin retrieved two packages of \u201crock cocaine.\u201d However, when shown the two packages that criminalist Smith had identified as \u201cchunky material containing] cocaine,\u201d Mills identified them as \u201c[t]he two bags of narcotics that were seized by Officer Eakin . . . .\u201d Despite the Attorney General\u2019s statements to the contrary, Officer Mills merely referred to the substance as \u201crock cocaine.\u201d He did not give an opinion\u2014lay or expert\u2014that the material was cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Moreover, Mills was never asked to identify the substance in the baggies, nor was he asked if he had identified cocaine base before or if cocaine base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>was identifiable by appearance. Further, he did not relate anything he knew about cocaine base specifically to the substance in evidence. We cannot infer from his testimony that Mills was able to identify cocaine base by sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Although the nature of a substance may be proved by circumstantial evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sonleitner </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 364, 369 [228 Cal.Rptr. 96]), the cases cited for that proposition are distinguishable from this case. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sonleitner, supra, </em>defendant was found guilty of possession of cocaine based on police testimony even though none of the substance defendant possessed was recovered for analysis. The evidence showed that a codefendant went to meet his connection at the Cedar Street house. He was observed until he returned with a plastic baggie subsequently analyzed to contain approximately two and one-half ounces of cocaine. He stated he was delivering half of the agreed upon five ounces and would be going back for the other half. He was then arrested and police officers went to the Cedar Street residence. When the officers arrived, someone in the house yelled, \u201csheriffs are coming.\u201d Officers saw defendant running to the bathroom with a two-ounce bottle in his hand. Defendant emptied the white crystalline powder contents of the bottle into the toilet, threw the bottle in and flushed. The bottle was recovered but without any powder or residue. The court concluded that the evidence strongly suggested that the substance destroyed by defendant was the other half of the cocaine partially delivered by the codefendant. (183 Cal.App.3d at pp. 367-369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Sonleitner </em>is distinguishable because there, the officer-witness testified the substance he saw had a white crystalline character resembling cocaine, and an analysis of the portion of the five ounces actually delivered showed it to be cocaine. (Also see, <em>People </em>v. <em>Marinos </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 735, 738-739 [67 Cal.Rptr. 452]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 179, 186 [337 P.2d 163]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tipton </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 213, 217 [268 P.2d 196].) Testimony of that kind is absent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The circumstantial evidence here is too tenuous to support the inference that defendant possessed cocaine base beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant\u2019s transaction conduct, the money he possessed and his act of discarding the drugs just before he was apprehended could apply to any drug transaction. Further, the fact that one person was going to Nagi\u2019s to purchase rock cocaine and that a straight shooter was found in the area is not dispositive in light of the officer\u2019s testimony that Nagi\u2019s was known as a place to find narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Finally, since defendant was charged with a chemically specific violation, possession of cocaine base for sale, the prosecution cannot rely on circumstantial evidence of the nature of the substance unless the record discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that cocaine base can be identified by its physical appearance when chemical analysis only reveals the substance contains cocaine. (See, e.g., <em>Cook </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1966) 362 F.2d 548, 549 [court took judicial notice that whether a substance is a narcotic cannot be determined by mere inspection of its outward appearance].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that Officer Mills\u2019s testimony, \u201cwithout objection that \u2018rock cocaine\u2019 is \u2018base cocaine\u2019 \u201d \u201cestablishes that the substance in question was cocaine base\u201d begs the question of whether that testimony constitutes substantial evidence that defendant possessed cocaine base. Not all evidence is substantial evidence. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 231 [93 Cal.Rptr. 197, 481 P.2d 205], the defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a restricted dangerous drug, methedrine. (former \u00a7 11911, now \u00a7 11378.) Officer Owens and several other officers went into the bedroom of tide apartment of Alan Hall. Owens saw the defendant (Hunt) seated on a chair with a hypodermic needle in his arm. At Hunt\u2019s feet was an open blue and white travel case containing four 30-cc. vials of methedrine each bearing a pharmacy label with a prescription number, Hunt\u2019s name and the physician\u2019s name, Dr. Smith. Officer Owens, who had \u201cextensive training, education, and experience relating to the possession of and trafficking in dangerous drugs,\u201d testified \u201cthat based upon his experience it was his opinion that the methedrine found in the blue and white travel case . . . was possessed for sale. He said that his opinion was due \u2018to the quantity involved, the over-all street value, the normal use by an individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 234-235.) In holding the evidence insufficient to sustain Hunt\u2019s conviction, the California Supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cAlthough the officer testified that in his opinion the methedrine was possessed for sale, his testimony in the circumstances of this case may not be held to be substantial evidence to support the conviction, [f] In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>69 Cal.2d 122, 141 . . . , Justice Mosk, speaking for a unanimous court, stated: \u2018 \u201cThe chief value of an expert\u2019s testimony in this field, as in all other fields, rests upon the <em>material </em>from which his opinion is fashioned and the <em>reasoning </em>by which he progresses from his material to his conclusion ... it does not lie in his mere expression of conclusion.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 252 F.2d 608, 617 . . . .) In short, \u201cExpert evidence is really an argument of an expert to the court, and is valuable only in regard to the proof of <em>the facts </em>and the validity of the <em>reasons </em>advanced for the conclusions.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 581, 584 . . . ; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 598, 611 . . . .)\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 231, 237.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As pointed out earlier, in the case at hand, Officer Mills was not qualified as an expert in the identification of controlled substances, was never specifically asked his opinion as to whether the substance possessed by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>was cocaine base or contained cocaine base, and never actually expressed an opinion in that regard. Even if we assume, as does the majority, that the totality of Officer Mills\u2019s testimony amounted to an opinion that the substance possessed by defendant contained cocaine base, there is a complete absence of \u201cthe <em>material </em>from which his opinion is fashioned and the <em>reasoning </em>by which he progresses from his material to his conclusion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 231, 237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The majority seems to equate \u201cinadmissible evidence introduced without objection\u201d to \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d without discussion of the quality or probative value of the evidence introduced. The majority concludes that Officer Mills\u2019s testimony \u201cintroduced without objection, that appellant possessed rock cocaine and that rock cocaine is cocaine base\u2014combined with the criminalist\u2019s testimony that the substance in question tested positive for cocaine\u201d (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 465), constituted substantial evidence to support the verdict. Does the majority mean that standing alone Officer Mills\u2019s testimony would not constitute substantial evidence that defendant possessed cocaine base? In my view, rather than lending weight to the officer\u2019s testimony, the criminalist\u2019s testimony that the substance in question merely contained cocaine actually lessens the weight to be given to the prosecution evidence. The criminalist\u2019s failure to testify the substance contained cocaine base would logically lead to one of two reasonable inferences: that the criminalist tested for both cocaine and cocaine base and found the presence of cocaine only or, that the criminalist tested only for cocaine. It is not reasonable to infer, as the majority apparently does, that the criminalist found the substance to contain cocaine base but omitted to so testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Since there is no substantial evidence that defendant possessed cocaine base, the judgment should be reversed and the trial court directed to dismiss the information with prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d 680, 691.) The Attorney General\u2019s contention that possession for sale of cocaine except cocaine base (\u00a7 11350) is a lesser included offense of possession for sale of cocaine base (\u00a7 11351.5) was rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>at pages 690-691.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 18, 1991, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 20, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">All statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
