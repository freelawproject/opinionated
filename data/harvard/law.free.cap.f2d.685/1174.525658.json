We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-24\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-25\">On October 12, 1979, Olivares and her husband, both natives and citizens of Mexico, were charged with violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2): Olivares for overstaying her non-immigrant visit and her husband for entering the United States without inspection. At their deportation hearing on November 21, 1979, both admitted deportability under \u00a7 1251(a) and requested voluntary departure. In addition, Olivares applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>a discretionary adjustment of status to that of a lawfully admitted permanent resident, as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on a fifth-preference visa petition filed in her behalf by her sister, a citizen of the United States, and approved by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1 (1981). Her priority date for purposes of receiving an immigrant visa was October 27, 1978, the date the visa petition was filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">To qualify for an adjustment of status, Olivares was required to show that an immigrant visa was immediately available to her. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(3). In accordance with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the immigration judge consulted the most recent Department of State Visa Office Bulletin on Availability of Immigrant Visa Numbers, which indicated that no visas were then available to fifth-preference Mexican applicants. The immigration judge thus denied Olivares\u2019s application on the ground of statutory ineligibility. Consequently, he found both Olivares and her husband deportable and granted them a three month period for voluntary departure. Olivares\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the BIA, and this petition for review followed. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgL\">Olivares contends that the Visa Office Bulletin was \u201cclearly wrong\u201d in indicating that no visas were available to fifth-preference Mexican applicants at the date of her hearing, and that the immigration judge therefore abused his discretion in denying her application on that basis. According to Olivares, visa distribution to Mexico in FY 1979 should have been made pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152(e) which would have required the State Department to make visas available to fifth-preference Mexican applicants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">The allocation of immigrant visas, both worldwide and within an individual country is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 \u2014 1156. The maximum number of visas to be issued worldwide in any one fiscal year is set by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(a). For example, in FY 1979, the worldwide quota was set at 290,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These visas are distributed among eight preference categories of applicants by fixed percentages set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a), each category being based on some factor such as familial relationship with a United States citizen, professional skill, or refugee status.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, 20 percent of the worldwide quota is reserved for first-preference applicants, 26 percent for second-preference applicants, 10 percent for third, fourth and sixth-preference applicants respectively, and 24 percent for fifth-preference applicants. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a). In FY 1979, therefore, the State Department was required to make available worldwide 58,000 visas to first-preference applicants, 75,400 to second-preference applicants, and so on until the quota of 290,000 was filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">The maximum number of visas that can be made available in a fiscal year to the citizens of any one country is 20,000. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152(a). Within that overall limitation, however, there is no restriction as to the number of visas that can be allocated to any one preference category within a single country. Rather, a country\u2019s entire allotment of 20,000 visas can be distributed to applicants from the highest preference categories if the worldwide demand in these categories is light. As a result, in countries such as Mexico where the demand is heavy in the higher preference categories, there often are no visas available for applicants in the lower categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">In order to alleviate this disparity, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152(e) provides that \u201c[wjhenever the maximum number of visas have been made available under this section to natives of any single foreign state ... in any fiscal year,\u201d in the following fiscal year that country\u2019s allotment of 20,000 visas is to be distributed by percentage allocation among seven preference categories that correspond to those in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a). Thus, when \u00a7 1152(e) applies to a particular country, only 20 percent (4,000) of the visas alloted to that country may be issued to first-preference applicants, 26 percent (5,200) to second-preference applicants, 10 percent (2,000) to third, fourth and sixth-preference applicants respectively, and 24 percent (4,800) to fifth-preference applicants. By thus restricting the number of visas that may be issued to the higher preference applicants with the individual country, \u00a7 1152(e) assures visa availability to the lower preference applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">The State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have consistently interpreted the term \u201cmaximum number of visas\u201d as used in \u00a7 1152(e) to refer to the individual country\u2019s maximum annual allotment of 20,000 visas. Under this interpretation, distribution of visas in a country is governed by \u00a7 1152(e) only when the statutory maximum of 20,000 visas was made available to that country in the preceding fiscal year. Since 20,000 visas were not made available to Mexico in FY 1978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>visa distribution to Mexico in FY 1979 was not governed by \u00a7 1152(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">Olivares contends that the State Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1152(e) is clearly wrong. She argues that the maximum number of visas \u201care made available\u201d to a country within the meaning of that section whenever the demand for visas in that country exceeds the number of visas that are in fact made available to that country in a fiscal year, even if that number is less than 20,000. According to this argument, since demand in Mexico in FY 1978 was greater than the number of visas in fact made available, the State Department was required in FY 1979 to distribute visas under \u00a7 1152(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">This identical issue was addressed recently in <em>Angco v. Haig, </em>514 F.Supp. 1328 (E.D.Pa.1981), which upheld the State Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1152(e). The court first noted that judicial review of this issue is a narrow one. <em>Id. </em>at 1333-34. The interpretation of a statute by the agency or department charged with its administration is entitled to great deference and should be accepted unless demonstrably irrational or clearly contrary to the plain and sensible meaning of the statute. <em>See Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 565, 100 S.Ct. 790, 796, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980); <em>Horizon Mutual Savings Bank v. Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., </em>674 F.2d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir. 1982). Applying this standard, the court thoroughly reviewed the language, legislative history and underlying purpose of \u00a7 1152(e), and concluded that the State Department\u2019s interpretation was fully consistent with all three and was thus a reasonable construction of the statute. <em>Angco v. Haig, supra, </em>514 F.Supp. at 1334-35. We find the court\u2019s analysis persuasive and agree with its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">First, the State Department\u2019s interpretation is fully consistent with the language of \u00a7 1152(e). By its express terms, \u00a7 1152(e) is invoked \u201c[w]henever the maximum number of visas have been made available <em>under this section </em>to natives of any single foreign state ... in any fiscal year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152(e) (emphasis added). The phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d obviously refers to \u00a7 1152,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the maximum number of visas to be made available under \u00a7 1152 to the citizens of any one country in a fiscal year is 20,000. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152(a). Thus, the language of \u00a7 1152(e) clearly supports the incorporation of the statutory maximum of 20,000 set out in \u00a7 1152(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">Second, the legislative history of \u00a7 1152(e), although quite sparse, indicates that Congress intended the application of that section to be triggered when a country had used its full quota of 20,000 visas in the preceding fiscal year. The House Report recommending passage of the amendments which enacted \u00a7 1152(e) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-12\">The section also adds a new Section 202(e) which provides that whenever the maximum number of visas or conditional entries has been made available to natives of a foreign state (20,000) or dependent area (600) in any fiscal year, in the following fiscal year visas or conditional entries will be made available and allocated to that foreign state or dependent area according to the priorities and percentages set forth in the preference system, as modified by this legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">H.R.Rep.No. 94-1553, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 14, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Cong. &amp; Adm. News 6073, 6085-86. Moreover, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and International Law described the operation of proposed section 202(e) to the full House as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-14\">[T]he bill would propose a formula which would provide that visas be distributed throughout the preference categories in those cases where a country has reached its 20,000 limit for visa issuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-15\">122 Cong.Rec. 33633 (1976). Olivares has not cited to any legislative history evidencing a contrary intent, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>Finally, we cannot say that the State Department\u2019s interpretation so clearly dis-serves the purpose underlying \u00a7 1152(e) as to be demonstrably irrational. As stated by the court in Angco:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-4\">By tying the applicability of section 202(e) into a country\u2019s reaching its annual allotment of 20,000 visas, Congress sought to assure that the ameliorative provisions of that statute will normally control visa distribution in those countries most in need of them, i.e., those in which the number of visas annually made available reaches the statutory maximum. For me to adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 [proffered] interpretation simply because it arguably better furthers these purposes would be tantamount to an amendment of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">514 F.Supp. at 1335-36. Moreover, it is open to question whether Olivares\u2019s interpretation would better serve the objectives of \u00a7 1152(e). Were we to accept her interpretation, distribution of visas to chronically over-subscribed countries such as Mexico would be controlled by \u00a7 1152(e) every year, since the demand would almost invariably exceed availability. We do not believe that Congress intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">We conclude that the interpretation of \u00a7 1152(e) adopted by the State Department and the INS is a reasonable one and thus valid. Accordingly, the immigration judge did not err in denying Olivares\u2019s application for adjustment of status on the basis of the Visa Office Bulletin. The order of deportation is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1264-26\">. Although both Mr. and Mrs. Olivares are designated as petitioners, this petition for review pertains only to Mrs. Olivares, as did the appeal before the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-7\">\u201cThe status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9J\">Because Olivares had been served with an order to show cause, her application for adjustment of status was required to be made and considered at her deportation hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a) (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">. Since demand for immigrant visas normally exceeds availability, applicants are assigned priority dates and placed on a waiting list. An immigrant visa is considered \u201cavailable\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) when the applicant has a priority date on the waiting list that is no later than the date shown in the Department of State Visa Office Bulletin on Availability of Immigrant Visa Numbers. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1) (1981). The priority date of an applicant seeking an immigrant visa under a fifth-preference visa petition is the date on .which the petition was filed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1) reads in pertinent part: (1) <em>Availability of immigrant visas under section 245. </em>An alien is ineligible for the benefits of section 245 of the Act unless an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time the application is filed. If the applicant is a preference or nonpreference alien, the current Department of State Visa Office Bulletin on Availability of Immigrant Visa Numbers will be consulted to determine whether an immigrant visa is immediately available. An immigrant visa is considered available for accepting and processing the application Form 1-485 if the preference or nonpreference category applicant has a priority date on the waiting list which is no later than the date shown in the Bulletin or the Bulletin shows that numbers for visa applicants in his category are current.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">. The INS argues that, while we have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1105a(a) to review the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Olivares\u2019s application for adjustment of status, the scope of our review is limited to whether the judge acted correctly in relying on the Visa Office Bulletin. According to the INS, neither the immigration judge nor the BIA had the authority to question the validity of the State Department\u2019s visa allocations. Thus, the agency argues that consideration of the central issue raised on this appeal, i.e., whether the State Department was correct in deciding to allocate visas to Mexico in FY 1979 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a) rather than \u00a7 1152(e), is outside the scope of our review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">Olivares\u2019s application for adjustment of status was denied because it was determined that no visa numbers were immediately available to fifth-preference Mexican applicants such as herself. No visa numbers were immediately available because allocation for FY 1979 was made pursuant to \u00a7 1153(a) rather than \u00a7 1152(e). Our power under \u00a7 1105a(a) to review the propriety of the denial of her application for adjustment of status necessarily includes power to review the propriety of the underlying determinations upon which that denial was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">Nor do we agree with the INS that the Secretary of State is an indispensable party to this appeal. If we find in favor of Olivares, we may grant full relief by vacating the order of deportation and remanding to the immigration judge with instructions to determine whether an immigrant visa number would have been available to Olivares at the time of her original application had visa distribution to Mexico in FY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>1979 been governed by \u00a7 1152(e). While it may be that the immigration judge had no discretion to look beyond the Visa Office Bulletin in the first instance, we are confident that, if ordered by this court, he could conduct the necessary investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">. At present, the worldwide quota is set at 270,000. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">.
