The two plaintiffs asserted five causes of action in their complaint. In response to a motion by the defendant, the district court dismissed all claims of the mother after concluding that they were barred by the applicable Virginia statute of limitations. Va.Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B). The court also dismissed two of the five causes of action of the daughter. The mother appealed her dismissal, while the daughter\u2019s case continued through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">While the district court\u2019s order appears to end the mother\u2019s litigation, the court failed to make \u201can express determination that there is no just reason for delay and ... an express direction for the entry of judgment,\u201d as provided for in Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 54(b). Because the district court\u2019s order adjudicated \u201cfewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties\u201d, the order was still subject to revision by the district court and would be appealable only upon an express Rule 54(b) certification. E.g., <em>Schnur &amp; Co. v. McDonald, </em>328 F.2d 103 (4th Cir. 1964); Wright &amp; Miller, 10 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2660 (1973). Without such certification, this court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">We express no opinion as to whether or not the appeal should be certified under FRCP 54(b) should the appellant make proper application to the district court following the dismissal of her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Accordingly, the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
