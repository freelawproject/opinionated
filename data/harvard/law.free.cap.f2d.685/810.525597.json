Ten states, plaintiffs below, appeal from judgments entered on a jury verdict in their actions for treble damages alleging a nationwide price-fixing conspiracy in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. The defendants did not offer any evidence at trial, but rested at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case; the jury then found in favor of all defendants. On appeal, the plaintiffs assert numerous procedural errors, generally contending that the district court unduly limited their opportunity to develop and present their ease. We are not persuaded that the district court either abused its discretion or erred in its selec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>tion, interpretation, or application of the controlling legal precepts, and therefore we will affirm its judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">This case has a complicated procedural history, owing in part to the number of parties. Named as defendants were manufacturers and merchants of \u201cfine paper,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the states buy in large quantity. Some of the merchants are owned by the mills themselves and some are independent. Beginning in 1977, following the initiation of ultimately inconclusive investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, several states and private plaintiffs brought a total of 37 individual actions alleging that the mills and merchants had participated in a nationwide price-fixing conspiracy. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated pre-trial proceedings, assigned to Judge Joseph L. McGlynn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litigation, </em>446 F.Supp. 759 (Jud.Pan.Mult.Lit.1978) (per curiam); 453 F.Supp. 118 (Jud.Pan.Mult.Lit. 1978) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The district court divided the plaintiffs into three groups: a class of private plaintiffs, \u201cminority states,\u201d and \u201cmajority states.\u201d The minority states alleged only a horizontal conspiracy among the mill defendants; the majority states, the present appellants, alleged both a horizontal conspiracy among the mill defendants and vertical conspiracies involving mills and merchants. In addition to certifying a class of private plaintiffs, the court certified each minority state and its respective government entities as a separate plaintiff class,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it refused to do the same for the majority states because the added factor of vertical conspiracy made those actions less susceptible to generalized proof. <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litigation, </em>82 F.R.D. 143 (E.D.Pa.1979). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Following a pre-trial conference on March 7, 1979, the court established discovery deadlines and set a tentative trial date of January 2, 1980. The next few months were occupied with discovery and related motions. On September 27, 1979, plaintiffs asked for an extension of the trial date because of the number of depositions they wished to take, but the court expressed reluctance to deviate from its schedule. At a conference on December 4, 1979, the court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 proposal that trial not begin until October 1980, but it rescheduled the trial for the \u201ccertified plaintiffs\u201d (the private plaintiffs and the minority states) to September 22, 1980, barring a \u201cnuclear holocaust.\u201d The court did not fix a trial date for the majority states, but it established July 3, 1980, as the discovery cut-off date in all of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">On January 15, 1980, the court decided it could resolve the litigation more efficiently if trial on the majority states\u2019 claims were conducted in advance of the certified plaintiffs\u2019 trial. It then set for the majority states a trial date of June 16, 1980, and a revised discovery deadline of May 30. Appellants vehemently protested that they still had 300,000 documents to review and more than 100 depositions to take, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the court\u2019s revised schedule left inadequate time for discovery and trial preparation. The court denied their motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On January 17,1980, the court entered an order that all parties would be deemed to have consented to venue and to have waived objections to trial in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unless they filed written objections. The majority states opposed the proposed transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In early June 1980, in contemplation of a June 16 trial, the majority states submitted a 200-page pre-trial memorandum. Defendants moved to dismiss, contending that the memorandum was unacceptable because it presented only conclusory allegations rather than the specific enumeration of facts the court had required. The court did not grant defendants\u2019 motion, but it ordered plaintiffs to prepare a memorandum by July 25 \u201cwhich outlines the case chapter and verse as to each defendant.\u201d App. at 2064-65. Plaintiffs moved for a continuance, again complaining that they had not been allowed enough time for discovery. The court stated that the majority states\u2019 actions would be tried with or after the certified plaintiffs\u2019 trial. It did not modify the discovery schedule, but it did allow some additional depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The certified plaintiffs settled their cases shortly before trial. On September 25, 1980, the court announced that the majority states\u2019 trial would begin on October 6, 1980 \u2014nine months after the tentative trial date and four months after the trial date set on January 15, 1980. Although they had been on notice since January 17, 1980, that the court wished to try the cases itself, the plaintiffs objected that they would have insufficient time to set up a Philadelphia office and to transport their files across the country. The court considered these arguments but concluded that October 6 was a realistic date.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">On September 29, 1980, over plaintiffs\u2019 objections, the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), formally transferred all of the majority states\u2019 cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for trial, which began on October 6, 1980. Following plaintiffs\u2019 four-week presentation, which consisted primarily of reading depositions to the jury, the defendants rested without offering any evidence. The jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants on December 2, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Appellants present several challenges to the district court\u2019s conduct of the trial and the pre-trial proceedings. They argue that the trial court abused its discretion in scheduling the discovery cut-off and trial dates; that it improperly transferred the actions to itself for trial under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a); that it erred by refusing to admit conditionally the out-of-court statements of alleged co-conspirators; that it erred in entering a partial directed verdict for defendants on claims arising from purchases from independent merchants; that it erred in denying class certification to each of the majority states; that in imposing a discovery sanction it erred in excluding evidence submitted by the state of Arkansas; and that it erred both in ruling that fine paper purchases by state colleges and universities were not state purchases and thereafter in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaints to add those institutions as parties. We consider these contentions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Appellants\u2019 primary argument is that they were afforded too little time for discovery and trial preparation. Appellants have a heavy burden to bear, however, as matters of docket control and conduct of discovery are committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>Business Ass\u2019n of University City v. Landrieu, </em>660 F.2d 867, 877 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Borden Co. v. Sylk, </em>410 F.2d 843, 845 (3d Cir. 1969). We will not interfere with a trial court\u2019s control of its docket \u201cexcept upon the clearest showing that the procedures have resulted in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant.\u201d <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Generix Drug Sales, Inc., </em>460 F.2d 1096, 1105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>(5th Cir. 1972). Similarly, we will not upset a district court\u2019s conduct of discovery procedures absent \u201ca demonstration that the <em>court\u2019s </em>action made it impossible to obtain crucial evidence, and implicit in such a showing is proof that more diligent discovery was impossible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We find no abuse of discretion by the district judge in his scheduling of discovery or of the trial. After considering all of appellants\u2019 contentions and examining the 16-volume appendix that they have supplied to this court, we are not persuaded that the pre-trial rulings of the district court prejudiced the preparation or presentation of their case. The trial of their antitrust claims followed fifteen months of discovery, including approximately 270 depositions and production of.nearly two million documents. The trial commenced four months after conclusion of discovery and one month after the date appellants had earlier set as the date on which they would be ready for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">When discovery ended on May 30, 1980, the majority states sought a continuance and further discovery. The court allowed them to depose some additional witnesses and, relying on their representation that they would need until September 1 to prepare for trial, advised them that their trial would commence with or after the certified plaintiffs\u2019 trial, scheduled for September 22, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Upon settlement of the certified plaintiffs\u2019 cases, the court on September 25, 1980, notified appellants that their trial would commence on October 6. Appellants again requested a continuance, but the district court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">Every time I set a deadline I get the same problem arising from the Majority States. They\u2019re never ready. They can\u2019t go to trial, the case is going to be prejudiced. The same thing happened in June, the same thing when I asked you to file answers to these interrogatories and you didn\u2019t have the time. The same thing happened when I asked you to file your pretrial memorandum. You said you didn\u2019t have the time, you needed more time, you wanted to supplement. I gave you time to supplement. It hasn\u2019t even been supplemented yet, except for a couple of states. It\u2019s just constant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">App. at 3970-71. Having reviewed the record, we consider the district court\u2019s observations to be accurate. Moreover, we do not share the view expressed by appellants\u2019 counsel at oral argument that antitrust cases involving price fixing are generieally complex. It has been our experience that the legendary complexity is due largely to the parties\u2019 inability or unwillingness to simplify their presentations. Our independent review of the record persuades us that the trial court in this ease was firm but fair. It deferred the trial date from January 2 to June 16 to October 6,1980, and it accommodated appellants\u2019 requests whenever feasible. The appellants have not shown that \u201cthe court\u2019s action made it impossible to obtain crucial evidence\u201d; nor have they made a clear showing that the court\u2019s conduct \u201cresulted in actual and substantial prejudice.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Appellants also argue that the district court improperly transferred the cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) and that it should have sent the cases back to the states\u2019 home districts, or alternatively to the Northern District of California, the plaintiffs\u2019 preferred forum, for trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1404(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>states: \u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d The gravamen of appellants\u2019 contention is that at the time the states\u2019 complaints were filed, venue in the Eastern District would have been improper with respect to some of the defendants. At the time of the transfer, however, those particular defendants had settled and were no longer in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Relying on <em>Hoffman v. Blaski, </em>363 U.S. 335, 80 S.Ct. 1084, 4 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1960), appellants read \u00a7 1404(a)\u2019s phrase, \u201cwhere it might have been brought,\u201d to preclude a transfer notwithstanding the pri- or settlement of all parties as to whom venue in the transferee district would have been improper. Assuming that plaintiffs have sustained the prejudice necessary to assert this venue argument, we do not read <em>Hoffman </em>and \u00a7 1404(a) to be so grudging. In <em>Hoffman </em>the defendants themselves requested the transfer, consenting to proceed in a district in which they could have objected to venue at the outset. The Supreme Court held that the power to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) does not depend \u201cupon the wish or waiver of the defendant.\u201d 363 U.S. at 343, 80 S.Ct. at 1089. <em>Hoffman </em>thus precludes transfer over a plaintiff\u2019s objections to a district in which venue would be improper as to a defendant who remained a party to the action. In this case, by contrast, the defendants as to whom venue in the Eastern District would have been improper were no longer parties at the time of transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We agree with the district court that it was not required to confine its venue consideration to the facts as they existed at the time of the complaint. Just as venue defects as to a party whose portion of the action has been severed do not bar transfer of the remainder of the action, <em>Wyndham Associates v. Bintliff, </em>398 F.2d 614, 618-19 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 444, 21 L.Ed.2d 438 (1968), a party\u2019s settlement of his portion of the action cures any objection to venue in the transferee district with respect to that party. <em>Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. v. UOP, Inc., </em>447 F.Supp. 381 (N.D.Okla.1978). <em>See also </em>15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3845 (1976). At the time of the transfer to the Eastern District, the action \u201cmight have been brought\u201d in the Eastern District as to all of the parties remaining in the case. Appellants would have us hold that even if the trial below were otherwise error free, a new trial would be warranted because some of their earlier adversaries \u2014 who were no longer parties to the suit at the time trial began\u2014 could have objected to venue in the Eastern District had transfer been attempted prior to their settlements. Their reading of \u00a7 1404(a) and <em>Hoffman </em>reflects adherence to the tradition of mechanical jurisprudence \u2014 following \u201ca maxim or a definition with relentless disregard of consequences to \u2018a dryly logical extreme,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hynes v. New York Cent. R. Co., </em>231 N.Y. 229, 235, 131 N.E. 898, 900 (1921) (Cardozo, J.). We are disinclined to accept appellants\u2019 interpretation, and we hold that the district court did not err.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Nor do we conclude that in transferring the actions to itself for trial the district court abused its discretion. Although the district court did not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>quantify the interest in plaintiffs\u2019 convenience, it concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 convenience was outweighed by the comparative economy of trying one action in the Eastern District rather than several actions in the states\u2019 home districts. Given the complexity of the proceedings, we consider this conclusion to be reasonable. Moreover, we also believe that in an appropriate case the court may properly consider whether judicial efficiency would be served by enabling the judge who has presided over the pre-trial phase of a multi-district proceeding, and thereby has become familiar with the parties and the issues, to try the actions himself rather than to return them to one or more district judges who must acquaint themselves with the cases\u2019 complexities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court neither erred in its interpretation of the law, applicable to transfers under \u00a7 1404(a) nor abused its discretion in transferring to itself for trial the proceeding over which it had presided in the pre-trial stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Appellants argue next that the district court abused its discretion in not admitting evidence of certain declarations of co-conspirators made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Appellants appear to present a two-tiered argument relying on Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), <em>United States v. Continental Group, </em>603 F.2d 444 (3d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1032, 100 S.Ct. 703, 62 L.Ed.2d 668 (1980), and <em>United States v. Trowery, </em>542 F.2d 623 (3d Cir. 1976) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1104, 97 S.Ct. 1132, 51 L.Ed.2d 555 (1977). Although the elements of their argument are blurred, they appear to contend that the district court was obligated to determine the competency of the proffered evidence by considering whether plaintiffs had made a sufficient showing that a joint undertaking existed at the time of the statements; and alternatively that even absent such a determination, the court nevertheless was required to admit the evidence conditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Evidence of extra-judicial statements made by alleged co-conspirators may be admitted upon the court\u2019s finding that there is a sufficient showing of a common enterprise by means of evidence independent of the proffered declaration. <em>Trowery, </em>542 F.2d at 626-27. Alternatively, the court may admit the hearsay evidence subject to later connection. <em>Continental Group, </em>603 F.2d at 457. We believe that in this case the district court\u2019s refusal to admit the extra-judicial statements included an implicit determination that plaintiffs had not met their burden under <em>Trowery. Cf. Continental Group, </em>603 F.2d at 457 (finding that government had met its burden under <em>Trowery </em>was implicit in court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion to strike). Significantly, appellants do not direct our attention to any independent evidence on which the court might have based a determination of competency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, appellants must rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>on their argument that the district court was required to admit the evidence conditionally. In this regard we believe appellants misread <em>Continental Group. </em>In that decision we held that a trial court in its discretion may \u2014 not must \u2014 admit alleged co-conspirators\u2019 declarations under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) subject to later connection. We expressed our concern for the possible prejudice to conspiracy defendants that could result from conditional admission where the competency of the evidence is not thereafter demonstrated, and we stated that conditional admission should be used sparingly. As Chief Judge Seitz wrote for the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">This court has recognized that there is a real danger in a conspiracy trial involving numerous defendants that the jury may find a particular defendant guilty merely because of his association with the other defendants. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>[433 F.2d 174, 195 (3d Cir. 1970)]. One aspect of this danger is that the trial judge, after admitting hearsay declarations of alleged co-conspirators subject to later connection, may find at the close of all the evidence that the government has not borne its burden of proving by independent evidence that those declarations were made during the course and in furtherance of a conspiracy joined in by both the defendant and the declarant. Cautionary instructions to the jury might not suffice,to cure the resulting prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">603 F.2d at 456. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the out-of-court declarations of alleged co-conspirators in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Prior to submitting the ease to the jury, the trial court granted in part defendants\u2019 motion for directed verdict. Finding no proof of a single nationwide conspiracy involving both the mills and the independent merchants, the court barred claims against the mills based on plaintiffs\u2019 purchases from independent merchants<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and permitted only proof relating to the mill and mill-owned merchant defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 primary concern seems not to be the exclusion of their claims based on purchases from the independent merchants, however, but that certain evidence which they argue was probative of their conspiracy claims against the mills and the mill-owned merchants was thereby \u201cexcised.\u201d Thus, appellants\u2019 challenge of the directed verdict has two dimensions: that the directed verdict itself was improperly granted, and that their case against the mills and mill-owned merchants was unfairly prejudiced by their inability to use evidence relating to the independent merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">They argue first that, notwithstanding the district court\u2019s finding, there was a sufficient quantum of evidence relevant to the involvement of the independent merchants to enable a jury to grant relief. They fault the district court for examining each piece of evidence in isolation rather than viewing the evidence in its totality. This, they charge, was \u201ccompartmentalizing the proof,\u201d in violation of the teachings of <em>Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corp., </em>370 U.S. 690, 698-99, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 1409-10, 8 L.Ed.2d 777 (1962). In <em>Edward J. Sweeney &amp; Sons v. Texaco, Inc., </em>637 F.2d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68 L.Ed.2d 300 (1981), we stated the scope of appellate review applicable to directed verdicts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-13\">The appellate court must consider the record as a whole and in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences to support its contentions. If no reasonable resolution of the conflicting evidence and inferences therefrom could result in a judgment for the non-moving party, the appellate court must affirm the lower court\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Applying this stringent standard of review, we have examined the record and are persuaded that the district court did not err. Plaintiffs alleged a nationwide conspiracy between mills and independent merchants. Viewed in the light most favorable to appellants, the evidence upon which they rely in their challenge to the directed verdict involves only communication among merchants relating to retail prices. Like the district court, we will not permit a jury to infer from communication at a lower level the existence of a conspiracy at a higher level as alleged in the complaints. Submission of this evidence to the jury would have required the jurors to resort to guesswork and conjecture, allowing \u201cmere speculation ... to do duty for probative facts.\u201d <em>Edward J. Sweeney &amp; Sons v. Texaco, Inc., </em>637 F.2d at 115 (quoting <em>Galloway v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 372, 395, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1089, 87 L.Ed. 1458 (1943)). <em>Continental Ore </em>does not assist appellants. The \u201ccompartmentalizing\u201d condemned by the Supreme Court consisted of a seriatim examination of the claims against each of five conspiracy defendants as if they were separate lawsuits, thereby overlooking the conspiracy claim itself. <em>See </em>370 U.S. at 698-99, 82 S.Ct. at 1409-10. In the instant case the court refused to submit to the jury evidence which at best was probative of an alleged conspiracy unrelated to the conspiracy whose existence was in issue. We conclude that the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Nor can we conclude that appellants were prejudiced by the exclusion of evidence relating to the independent merchants. Notably, appellants do not contest appellees\u2019 observations that all of the excluded evidence deals with retail prices and that appellants purchased paper not at retail but only on the basis of bids. We do not perceive any prejudice resulting from the entry of the directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Because of the view we take regarding the contentions discussed above, appellants\u2019 remaining arguments require only brief consideration. Again we find no error or abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Noting that the district court certified classes of government entities for each of the minority states, appellants argue that the district court erred in denying similar certification to the majority states. They contend that the only difference between the two groups of plaintiff states was the majority states\u2019 allegations of vertical conspiracies among mills and independent merchants, and they argue that this distinction was an insufficient basis for denial of certification. We have said that a decision on class status is normally within the discretion of the trial court, <em>Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>559 F.2d 209, 212 (3d Cir. 1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>437 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2451, 57 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978), and we now conclude that the district court in this case acted wholly within the bounds of its discretion. One prerequisite to class certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) is a determination that common questions of fact or law predominate over questions affecting only individual members. The common issue here, whether there was a horizontal conspiracy among the mill defendants, easily could be overwhelmed by the separate proof required to establish that each individual independent merchant had participated with the mills in an individual vertical conspiracy. Proof as to vertical conspiracy would vary among the class members, depending on the identity of the merchants from whom the respective government entities purchased their paper. Given that appellants sought to include in their classes not only entities which purchased from the named defendants but also those who purchased from an unspecified number of alleged co-conspirators, the likely factual variations among the alleged vertical conspiracies seems to us a reasonable basis for denying certification under Rule 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Appellants also charge that the district court abused its discretion when, as a sanction for failure to comply with a discovery order, it precluded plaintiff Arkansas from introducing evidence of its purchases of fine paper. Some of the defendants had served interrogatories and requests for production of documents on the states, seeking information about the states\u2019 purchases of fine paper. The states did not produce the requested information, but, relying on Fed.R.Civ.P. 33(c),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> responded that the documents containing the relevant information already had been produced and that the defendants could find the information in those documents as easily as plaintiffs could. The court granted defendants\u2019 motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a) to compel answers. Plaintiffs continued to oppose discovery, and the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions but deferred imposition. Subsequently reminded at trial that Arkansas had not completed the interrogatories, the court prohibited Arkansas from introducing evidence relating to its purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We have indicated our deference to the trial court\u2019s determination of the relative burdens of sifting through documents under Rule 33(c), <em>Al Barnett &amp; Son v. Outboard Marine Corp., </em>611 F.2d 32 (3d Cir. 1979), and we note that the rule appears to have been drafted in contemplation of the tactic attempted by plaintiffs. By its own terms the rule is unavailable unless \u201cthe burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 33(c) (as amended 1980). The Advisory Committee on the Rules has noted, \u201cThe Committee is advised that parties upon whom interrogatories are served occasionally responded by directing the interrogating party to a mass of business records . . . justifying the response by the option provided by this subdivision. Such practices are an abuse of the option.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Notes of Advisory Committee). Appellants have not persuaded us that the district court abused its discretion in applying these precepts. Similarly, we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in selecting and imposing a sanction. In a proper case the court may dismiss entirely the claim of a party who will not cooperate in discovery. <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, </em>427 U.S. 639, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976). Given the nature of Arkansas\u2019 violation, the sanction imposed was appropriate: the evidence excluded bears a direct relation to the evidence sought under the discovery order. <em>Cf. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>651 F.2d 877, 885 (3d Cir. 1981), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de </em>Guinea, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 502, 72 L.Ed.2d 377 (1982) (defendants\u2019 failure to respond to requests for information relevant to personal jurisdiction over defendants warrants court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction as a Rule 37(b)(2)(A) sanction). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s handling of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Appellants\u2019 final argument relates to purchase of fine paper by the state colleges and universities of seven of the plaintiff states. Late in the evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>phase of plaintiffs\u2019 trial presentation, the district court ruled that evidence of fine paper purchases by the colleges and universities would not be admitted because there had been no showing that the institutions were state agencies whose claims could be asserted by the state. The states subsequently sought to amend their complaints to add the institutions as parties plaintiff, but the court denied their motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Based on our examination of the record, we find no abuse of discretion. The states had provided no evidence from which the court could conclude that the educational institutions\u2019 purchases were effectively purchases by the states. Moreover, in view of our disposition of this appeal, even if we were to accept appellants\u2019 argument that the institutions are state agencies under relevant state law, failure to allow the damages claims was at worst harmless. As to the court\u2019s denial of the states\u2019 motion to amend, the complexity of the litigation and the late point in the proceedings at which the motion was presented lead us to find no abuse of discretion in refusing to add more parties to an already complicated proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">We have considered all of the contentions presented by the appellants and conclude that there was no abuse of discretion or reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">.

Appellants argue alternatively that at the filing of the complaint, venue would have been improper in the Eastern District as to defendant Butler Paper, a company that did not settle and is one of the present appellees. The district court addressed this contention, however, and specifically found that the case against Butler could have been brought in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The court did not state with particularity the reasons underlying its conclusion, but there was evidence in the form of an affidavit from an official of defendant Weyerhaeuser Co. that Butler purchased a large amount of paper from a Weyerhaeuser mill in Eastern Pennsylvania, constituting \u2022 transaction of business sufficient to establish venue in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22. We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in determining that the transfer was proper as to Butler.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">. The second circuit considered a similar problem of multi-district litigation in <em>Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, </em>447 F.2d 122 (2d Cir. 1971) (per curiam). A district judge who had conducted the pre-trial proceedings while sitting by designation in the Southern District of New York, decided to transfer the actions to his own District of Minnesota for trial. Defendants opposing the transfer petitioned for a writ of mandamus. The court of appeals denied the petition and noted that the judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">indicated that he felt that because of the complexity of these cases the interests of judicial efficiency made it highly desirable that the judge who conducted the pretrial proceedings continue as the trial judge, and that it would be impossible for him to remain in the Southern District of New York for the length of time that these trials were expected to take. While the convenience of the judge is, of course, not normally a factor to be weighed in considering a section 1404(a) motion, in the unusual circumstances of this case we' do not feel that it was an abuse of discretion to give some consideration to this problem in balancing the various interests. In any litigation of this type it would, of course, be impossible to find any forum that was totally convenient to all those involved. Judge Lord\u2019s solution appears fully justified under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b910-12\">.
