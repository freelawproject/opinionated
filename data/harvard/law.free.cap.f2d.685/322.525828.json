He was convicted on two counts of vehicular manslaughter, under former Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 13-456{3)(a) (current version at Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 13-1102 (1978)), and sentenced to' consecutive prison terms. Gentry filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, asserting that the Arizona legislature did not authorize consecutive sentences for multiple deaths caused by a single act of drunk driving, and that such sentences violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. The district court denied Gentry\u2019s petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">It is settled law that without legislative authorization a court may not constitutionally impose consecutive sentences. <em>See Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 689, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1436, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). In this case, however, consecutive sentences were authorized under \u00a7 13-456. In <em>State v. Miranda, </em>3 Ariz.App. 550, 416 P.2d 444 (1966), the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed consecutive sentences imposed under \u00a7 13-456 on three counts of manslaughter arising from one act of drunk driving. The Arizona court reasoned that, by defining manslaughter under \u00a7 13 \u2014 455 as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being without malice,\u201d the Arizona legislature intended to authorize punishment under \u00a7 13-456<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for each human being killed, not simply for each unlawful act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 416 P.2d at 452; <em>see also Arizona v. Gunter, </em>132 Ariz. 64, 643 P.2d 1034 (App.1982). Absent extraordinary circumstances, which do not obtain in this case, a federal court is bound by a state court\u2019s construction of the laws of that state. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 690-91, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 1885-86, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). We thus hold that the consecutive sentences imposed in this case were authorized by the Arizona legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">Gentry next contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the legislature from authorizing consecutive sentences for a single unintentional act. The argument is meritless. \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment double jeopardy guarantee serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors. The legislature remains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define crimes and fix punishments. .. . \u201d <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); <em>see generally </em>Note, <em>Twice in Jeopardy, </em>75 Yale L.J. 262, 302-11 (1965). The legislative authority to fix punishment is not without constitutional limitations, but those limits derive from the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 82-83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 621-622, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955); <em>see generally Enmund v. Florida, </em>- U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 3371, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982). Appellant makes no claim that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\">.

Gentry argues, without supporting authority, that a legislature is constitutionally required to use specific statutory language in imposing multiple sentences for a single unintentional act. We know of no such requirement and reject Gentry\u2019s argument as meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
