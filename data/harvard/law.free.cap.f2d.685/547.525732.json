EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A25\">Federal employees have long been forbidden from striking against their employer, the federal government, and thereby denying their services to the public at large.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States Code presently prohibits a person who \u201cparticipates in a strike . . . against the Government of the United States\u201d from accepting or holding a position in the federal government, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7311(2) (1976), and violation of this section is a criminal offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1918(3) (1976). Newly hired federal employees are required to execute an affidavit attesting that they have not struck and will not strike against the government, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3333(a) (1976). In addition, since the inception of formal collective bargaining between federal employee unions and the federal government, unions have been required to disavow the strike as an economic weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since 1969, striking has been expressly designated a union unfair labor practice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>In 1978, Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act, Title VII of which provides the first statutory basis for collective bargaining between the federal government and employee unions. Title VII in no way reduced the existing legal proscriptions against strikes by federal employees and unions representing employees in the federal service. Rather, the Act added a new provision applicable to federal employee unions that strike against the government. Under section 7120(f) of Title VII, Congress provided that the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d or \u201cAuthority\u201d) shall \u201crevoke the exclusive recognition status\u201d of a recognized union, or \u201ctake any other appropriate disciplinary action\u201d against any labor organization, where it is found that the union has called, participated in or condoned a strike, work stoppage or slowdown against a federal agency in a labor-management dispute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7120(f) (Supp. IV 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">In this case we review the first application of section 7120(f) by the FLRA. After the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (\u201cPATCO\u201d) called a nationwide strike of air traffic controllers against the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) in the summer of 1981, the Authority revoked PATCO\u2019s status as exclusive bargaining representative for the controllers. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AZO\">A. <em>The PATCO Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization has been the recognized exclusive bargaining representative for air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration since the early 1970s. Faced with the expiration of an existing collective bargaining agreement, PATCO and the FAA began negotiations for a new contract in early 1981. A tentative agreement was reached in June, but was overwhelmingly rejected by the PATCO rank and file. Following this rejection, negotiations began again in late July. PATCO announced a strike deadline of Monday, August 3, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Failing to reach a satisfactory accord, PATCO struck the FAA on the morning of August 3. Over seventy percent of the nation\u2019s federally employed air traffic controllers walked off the job, significantly reducing the number of private and commercial flights in the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">In prompt response to the PATCO job actions, the Government obtained restraining orders against the strike,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and then civil and criminal contempt citations when the restraining orders were not heeded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Government also fired some 11,000 striking air traffic controllers who did not return to work by 11:00 a. m. on August 5, 1981.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, on August 3, 1981, the FAA filed an unfair labor practice charge against PATCO with the Federal Labor Relations Authority. On that same day, an FLRA Regional Director issued a complaint on the unfair labor practice charge, alleging strike activity prohibited by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7) (Supp. IV 1980) and seeking revocation of PATCO\u2019s certification under the Civil Service Reform Act. The complaint noticed a hearing for one week later, August 10,1981. Complaint and Notice of Hearing, Jt. App. 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">B. <em>Federal Labor Relations Authority Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">John H. Fenton, Chief Administrative Law Judge of the FLRA, conducted hearings on the unfair labor practice charge on the afternoon of August 10. The General Counsel of the FLRA presented testimony establishing that on the morning of August 3 pickets assembled at entrances to Air Traffic Control Centers in Leesburg, Virginia, Chicago, Illinois, Ronkonkomo, New York, and Longmont, Colorado, and at the Airport Tower in Atlanta, Georgia. In each instance, the picketers carried signs that informed the public that they were air traffic controllers belonging to a particular PATCO Local and that PATCO was on strike. Attendance records presented by FAA witnesses indicated that only 2,308 of the 9,304 air traffic controllers scheduled to work nationwide on August 3 actually reported. <em>ALJ </em>at 3. FAA officials from the various facilities also identified striking air traffic controllers, including PATCO Local officers, in photographs of the picketing outside of the Air Traffic Control Centers. In several cases the persons identified, including the PATCO Local officers, were scheduled for work at the times the photographs were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">In addition to this evidence, an FAA official identified PATCO National President Robert E. Poli in two videotaped news conferences. In one videotape Mr. Poli was recorded as stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">If we have not received a settlement proposal which our negotiating team determines should be offered to the membership, I will order the count to begin. After the tallying has been completed and following verification of the necessary support, the strike will begin on the day shift of Monday, August the 3rd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfM\">In the second videotape, apparently made after the strike had begun and after a temporary restraining order had issued, Mr. Poli was recorded as saying: \u201cThe question is will the strike continue. The answer is yes.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">In response, PATCO offered no evidence to suggest that a strike had not occurred, to substantiate its assertion that the FLRA\u2019s evidence only demonstrated a number of separate strikes by PATCO Locals, or to establish that PATCO had made any efforts to prevent or stop the strike. Based on this record, and taking official notice of <em>United States v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>107 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 3210 (D.D.C.1981) (holding PATCO and Robert Poli in civil contempt for failing to comply with a temporary restraining order against the strike), Chief A.L.J. Fenton found that PATCO called and participated in a strike, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>a violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(A) (Supp. IV 1980), and that PATCO condoned the strike by failing to take action to prevent or stop it, a violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(B) (Supp. IV 1980). <em>ALJ </em>at 2-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">At the proceedings before Chief A.L.J. Fenton, PATCO complained of insufficient time to prepare a defense, particularly with regard to matters potentially in mitigation of the remedy to be imposed by the FLRA. PATCO suggested, but did not promise,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that if granted a continuance it might offer evidence in support of a claim of mitigation by attempting to show that the working conditions for PATCO members were unsafe, that the FAA had committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain in good faith,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the strike had been caused by anti-union animus in the FAA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Fenton recessed the hearing overnight to allow PATCO to decide whether to pursue a defense against the unfair labor practice charge, including a possible proffer with respect to mitigating circumstances. When the hearing reconvened on August 11, PATCO counsel declined to proceed with any specific defense on behalf of the union.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, union counsel merely suggested that unsafe working conditions and the FAA\u2019s refusal to bargain should be considered in mitigation; however, no testimony or other evidence was offered on these matters. Judge Fenton allowed PATCO to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>include arguments regarding mitigation based on these alleged \u201cproffers\u201d in its closing brief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">On August 14, PATCO filed its post-hearing brief; the ALJ Decision issued on the same day. In his recommended decision, Chief A.L.J. Fenton concluded that PAT-CO\u2019s arguments in mitigation could have no effect on the appropriate penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMk\">[PATCO\u2019s] contentions regarding mitigating circumstances, however real and serious they may be, find no echo in either the Statute or the legislative history. Congress gave only one example of the kind of circumstances in which the lesser remedy would be appropriate, and it goes to the nature and seriousness of the violation rather than to sorrounding [sic] events which arguably constitute serious provocation or other miltigating [sic] circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>ALJ </em>at 8. For this reason, and because PATCO produced no evidence that it had in any way attempted to comply with the statutory ban on strikes, Judge Fenton recommended that the FLRA revoke PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status and that PAT-CO \u201cimmediately cease to be legally entitled and obligated to represent employees in the unit.\u201d <em>ALJ </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The FLRA General Counsel, the FAA and PATCO all filed exceptions to the A.L. J.\u2019s recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law. The FLRA General Counsel and the FAA both excepted to the ALJ Decision to the extent that it failed to recommend a <em>permanent </em>revocation of PAT-CO\u2019s status as a labor organization under Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act. PATCO excepted to the ALJ Decision on three principal grounds: (1) that the expedited hearing schedule had afforded PAT-CO inadequate time to prepare its defense; (2) that the FLRA General Counsel and the FAA had failed to produce sufficient evidence at the hearing to establish that PAT-CO had called, participated in, or condoned a strike in violation of Title VII; and (3) that Judge Fenton had unfairly precluded PATCO from introducing relevant evidence in mitigation of the remedy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The FLRA heard oral argument from PATCO, the FLRA General Counsel and the FAA on September 16, 1981.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In seriatim opinions issued on October 22, 1981, the FLRA Members rejected the exceptions filed by the parties and affirmed the ALJ Decision. All three Members of the Authority agreed that the expedited proceedings had not violated PATCO\u2019s due process rights, any statute or agency regulation.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><footnotemark>16</footnotemark> All three agreed that the FLRA General Counsel had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that PATCO had committed unfair labor practices by striking against the FAA. Similarly, all three agreed that it was unnecessary to determine whether, at some time in the future, PATCO might again meet Title VII\u2019s definition of a labor organization; they thus declined to decide whether PATCO\u2019s revocation was permanent. The FLRA Members disagreed, however, over the extent of discretion granted to the Authority by section 7120(f) of the Civil Service Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">FLRA Member Frazier took a limited view of the discretion afforded the Authority under section 7120(f). He concluded, upon reading the relevant legislative history, that \u201c[t]he only circumstances which the Authority may take into account in assessing a lesser remedy than revocation for a willful and intentional violation of section 7116(b)(7) are those instances in which the union made efforts to prevent or stop the illegal activity.\u201d <em>PATCO </em>at 22. Since there was no such evidence, Member Frazier decided that \u201cthe facts of this case permit[ ] nothing less than revocation of PAT-CO\u2019s exclusive recognition status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Member Applewhaite concurred in Member Frazier\u2019s disposition of the case. He disagreed, however, with Member Frazier's limited view of the Authority\u2019s remedial discretion. He interpreted the language of section 7120(f) to vest the FLRA with broad discretion, but held that the only appropriate exercise of that discretion in this case was to revoke PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status. <em>PATCO </em>at 31.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Chairman Haughton, like Member Applewhaite, interpreted the statutory language of section 7120(f) and its legislative history as vesting the Authority with broad remedial discretion. Chairman Haughton thus expressed concern about the completeness of the record compiled by the A.L.J. In particular, he opined that the A.L.J.\u2019s denial of a continuance for PATCO to gather evidence of mitigating circumstances potentially relevant to the remedy was erroneous because it may have deprived the Authority of evidence relevant to its decision. <em>PAT-CO </em>at 35. Nonetheless, Chairman Haughton found one fact of overriding importance: PATCO had made no attempt to end the strike. He therefore concluded that unless PATCO ended the strike within five days of the issuance of the FLRA Decision, and unless PATCO represented to the Authority that it intended to abide by the no-strike provisions of Title VII, any additional evidence could have no mitigating effect on the remedy. Pending PATCO\u2019s response, Chairman Haughton conditionally dissented from the decision of Members Frazier and Applewhaite to revoke PAT-CO\u2019s exclusive recognition status. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">In an attempt to comply with Chairman Haughton\u2019s condition on his dissent, the PATCO Executive Board issued a statement on October 27, 1981. The statement averred that PATCO was then unable to end the strike because its members had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>been locked out by the FAA and were therefore unable to return to work. The statement further represented that \u201cwhen the FAA ends its lock-out, PATCO would immediately order <em>all </em>of its members to return to work.\u201d Statement of the PATCO Executive Board (October 27, 1981), Jt.App. 334 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On November 8, Chairman Haughton issued a supplemental opinion retracting his dissent and concurring in the FLRA Decision to revoke PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status. Chairman Haughton noted that PATCO had not disavowed the strike and had made no attempt to end it. Moreover, he noted that his dissent had not provided for the type of strike termination offered by PAT-CO, conditioned as it was on certain actions by the FAA. <em>Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>7 F.L.R.A.No. 10 (Nov. 3, 1981) (Supplemental Opinion of Chairman Haughton); Jt.App. 335-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">On the same day that the Federal Labor Relations Authority issued its decision, PATCO petitioned for review in this court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Concurrently, PATCO moved for an emergency stay of the FLRA Decision. A temporary administrative stay was granted by the court, and the FLRA was directed to submit a prompt response. <em>Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. FLRA, </em>No. 81-2135 (D.C.Cir. Oct. 23, 1981) (order granting temporary stay). Upon receiving and considering the FLRA\u2019s response, the court dissolved the temporary stay and denied PATCO\u2019s motion for a stay pending a decision on the merits. In recognition of the urgency of the case and the public interest in a prompt disposition, the court ordered <em>sua sponte </em>expedited briefing and oral argument. <em>Id. </em>(D.C.Cir. Oct. 27, 1981) (order dissolving temporary stay, denying motion for stay pending review, and ordering expedited briefing and oral argument). The court also granted motions by the American Federation of Government Employees and by Anthony J. Skirlick, Jr. to file briefs as amicus curiae. On December 3, 1981, the court heard oral arguments by petitioner PATCO, respondent FLRA, intervenor FAA and amicus Skirlick.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">II. EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS DURING THE FLRA PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">Unfortunately, allegations of improprieties during the FLRA\u2019s consideration of this case forced us to delay our review on the merits. Only a day before oral argument, the Department of Justice, which represents the FAA in this review, informed the court that the Department of Justice Criminal Division and the FBI had investigated allegations of an improper contact between a \u201cwell-known labor leader\u201d and FLRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Member Applewhaite during the pendency of the PATCO case. We were understandably concerned about the suggestion that attempts had been made to influence the Authority improperly and about the possible inference that the Authority\u2019s decision might have been affected by these attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Because our concerns extended beyond the presence or absence of criminal wrongdoing to the protection of the integrity of the administrative and judicial decisionmaking processes, we were not prepared to rely solely on the decision of the Criminal Division to close its investigation as proof that no improper influence had been exercised. Instead, we invoked a procedure that this court has occasionally employed in like situations in the past.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Without assuming that anything improper had in fact occurred or had affected the FLRA Decision in this case, we ord\u00e9red the FLRA \u201cto hold, with the aid of a specially-appointed administrative law judge, an evidentiary hearing to determine the nature, extent, source and effect of any and all ex parte communications and other approaches that may have been made to any member or members of the FLRA while the PATCO case was pending before it.\u201d <em>Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. FLRA, </em>672 F.2d 109, 113 (D.C.Cir.1982) (per curiam) (order directing special evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Following our remand on the ex parte communications issue, John M. Vittone, an Administrative Law Judge with the Civil Aeronautics Board, was appointed to preside over an evidentiary proceeding. Subsequently, Judge Vittone conducted a hearing from March 4 to March 17. Pursuant to the order of this court, the parties to this review, the FLRA Members, and all persons alleged to have contacted any Authority Member during the pendency of the PAT-CO case were allowed to participate fully in the hearing. A.L.J. Vittone made extensive findings regarding all possibly relevant approaches to and communications with FLRA Members. After the record of the hearing and A.L.J. Vittone\u2019s recommended findings were filed with the court, the parties submitted briefs on the recommended findings and on the appropriate remedial action. On April 13, 1982, the court heard further oral argument, limited to the issue of ex parte contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">A. <em>A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s inquiry led to the disclosure of a number of communications with FLRA Members that were at least arguably related to the Authority\u2019s consideration of the PATCO case. We find the vast majority of these communications unobjectionable. <em>See </em>notes 38-41 <em>infra. </em>Three occurrences, however, are somewhat more troubling and require our careful review and discussion. We first summarize A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s findings regarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">1. <em>The Meeting Between Member Applewhaite and FLRA General Counsel Gordon </em><footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">On August 10, 1981 (one week after the unfair labor practice complaint against PATCO was filed), H. Stephan Gordon, the FLRA General Counsel, was in Member Applewhaite\u2019s office discussing administrative matters unrelated to the PATCO case. During Gordon\u2019s discussion with Member Applewhaite, Ms. Ellen Stern, an attorney with the FLRA Solicitor\u2019s office, entered Member Applewhaite\u2019s office to deliver a copy of a memorandum entitled \u201cDecertification of Labor Organization Participating in the Conduct of a Strike in Violation of Section 7116(b)(7) of the Statute.\u201d Ms. Stern had prepared the memo at the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>quest of Member Frazier.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> With General Counsel Gordon present, Ms. Stern proceeded to discuss her memorandum, which dealt with whether the Civil Service Reform Act makes revocation of a striking union\u2019s exclusive recognition status mandatory or discretionary and, assuming it is discretionary, what other disciplinary actions might be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">During Ms. Stern\u2019s discussion, both Member Applewhaite and General Counsel Gordon asked her general questions (e.g., re.garding the availability of other remedies and whether she had researched the relevant legislative history). General Counsel Gordon did not ask Member Applewhaite any questions or express any views on the issues discussed in the memorandum. Nor did Member Applewhaite express any opinion on the correct statutory interpretation. While the conversation at least implicitly focused on the PATCO case, the facts of the case and the appropriate disposition were not discussed. The discussion ended after ten or fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">A. L. J. Vittone concluded that \u201c[t]he conversation had no effect or impact on Member Applewhaite\u2019s ultimate decision in the PATCO case.\u201d <em>Findings </em>at 7, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">2. <em>Secretary Lewis\u2019 Telephone Calls to Members Frazier and </em>Applewhaite<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVS\">During the morning of August 13, 1981, Secretary of Transportation Andrew L. Lewis, Jr. telephoned Member Frazier. Secretary Lewis stated that he was not calling about the substance of the PATCO case, but wanted Member Frazier to know that, contrary to some news reports, no meaningful efforts to settle the strike were underway. Secretary Lewis also stated that the Department of Transportation would appreciate expeditious handling of the case. Not wanting to discuss the PAT-CO case with Secretary Lewis, Member Frazier replied, \u201cI understand your position perfectly, Mr. Secretary.\u201d Secretary Lewis then inquired whether Member Applewhaite was in Washington, D.C. at that time. Member Frazier replied that he was, but that Chairman Haughton was out of town. Although Member Frazier offered to convey the Secretary\u2019s message to Member Applewhaite, Secretary Lewis stated that he would call personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Member Frazier discussed Secretary Lewis\u2019 call with FLRA Solicitor Robert Freehling, describing it as relating to status and settlement. Solicitor Freehling advised Member Frazier that the communication did not fall within the ex parte prohibitions of the FLRA Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Member Frazier also advised Member Applewhaite of Secretary Lewis\u2019 telephone call. In anticipation of a call, Member Applewhaite located the FLRA Rules regarding the time limits for processing an appeal from an A. L. J. decision in an unfair labor practice case. When Secretary Lewis telephoned and stated his concern that the case not be delayed, Member Applewhaite interrupted the Secretary to inform him that if he wished to obtain expedited handling of the case,, he would have to comply with the FLRA Rules and file a written motion. Secretary Lewis stated that he was unaware that papers had to be filed and that he would contact his General Counsel immediately. The conversation ended without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">During the afternoon of August 13, the FAA filed a Motion to Modify Time Limits for Filing Exceptions, requesting that the time limit be reduced from the usual twenty-five days to seven days. On August 14, the FLRA General Counsel filed a similar motion. On August 17, PATCO filed an opposition to these motions and a motion to extend the time for filing exceptions to sixty days. On August 18, 1981, the FLRA Members considered the three pending motions, denied all three, and decided instead to reduce the usual twenty-five day period for filing exceptions to nineteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Upon considering this evidence, Judge Vittone concluded that: (1) the FAA\u2019s filing of a motion to expedite may have been in response to Secretary Lewis\u2019 conversation with Member Applewhaite, <em>Findings </em>at 12, \u00b6 34; (2) Chairman Haughton was unaware of Secretary Lewis\u2019 telephone calls when he considered the motions on August 18, <em>id. </em>at 12, \u00b6 33; (3) \u201cSecretary Lewis\u2019 call had an undetermined effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s and Member Frazier\u2019s decision to reduce the time period for filing exceptions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, \u00b6 35; and (4) the telephone calls \u201chad no effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s or Member Frazier\u2019s ultimate decision on the merits of the PATCO case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">3. <em>Member Applewhaite\u2019s Dinner with Albert </em>Shanker<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Since 1974 Albert Shanker has been President of the American Federation of Teachers, a large public-sector labor union, and a member of the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Since 1964 Mr. Shanker has been President of the AFT\u2019s New York City Local, the United Federation of Teachers. Before joining the FLRA, Member Applewhaite had been associated with the New York Public Employment Relations Board. Through their contacts in New York, Mr. Shanker and Member Applewhaite had become professional and social friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\"><em>The Applewhaite/Shanker Dinner. </em>During the week of September 20, 1981, Mr. Shanker was in Washington, D. C. on business. On September 21, Mr. Shanker made arrangements to have dinner with Member Applewhaite that evening. Although he did not inform Member Applewhaite of his intentions when he made the arrangements, Mr. Shanker candidly admitted that he wanted to have dinner with Member Applewhaite because he felt strongly about the PATCO case and wanted to communicate directly to Member Applewhaite his sentiments, previously expressed in public statements, that PATCO should not be severely punished for its strike. In particular, Mr. Shanker believed that revocation of PAT-CO\u2019s exclusive recognition status would be an excessive punishment. After accepting the invitation, Member Applewhaite informed Member Frazier and Chairman Haughton that he was having dinner with Mr. Shanker.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Member Applewhaite and Mr. Shanker talked for about an hour and a half during their dinner on September 21. Most of the discussion concerned the preceding Saturday\u2019s Solidarity Day Rally, an upcoming tuition tax credit referendum in the District of Columbia, and mutual friends from New York. Near the end of the dinner, however, the conversation turned to labor law matters-relevant to the PATCO case. The two men discussed various approaches to public employee strikes in New York, Pennsylvania and the federal government. Mr. Shanker expressed his view that the punishment of a striking union should fit the crime and that revocation of certification as a punishment for an illegal strike was tantamount to \u201ckilling a union.\u201d The record is clear that Mr. Shanker made no threats or promises to Member Applewhaite; likewise, the evidence also indicates that Member Applewhaite never revealed his position regarding the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Near the end of their conversation, Member Applewhaite commented that because the PATCO case was hotly contested, he would be viewed with disfavor by whichever side he voted against. Member Applewhaite also observed that he was concerned about his prospects for reappointment to the FLRA in July 1982. Mr. Shanker, in turn, responded that Member Applewhaite had no commitments from anyone and urged him to vote without regard to personal considerations. The dinner concluded and the two men departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\"><em>The FLRA Decisional Process. </em>On the afternoon of September 21, before the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner, the FLRA Mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>bers had had their first formal conference on the PATCO case, which had been argued to them five days earlier. Members Frazier and Applewhaite both favored revocation of PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status and took the position that PATCO would no longer be a labor organization within the meaning of the Civil Service Reform Act. Member Frazier favored an indefinite revocation; Member Applewhaite favored a revocation for a fixed period of one to three years. Chairman Haughton agreed that an illegal strike had occurred, but favored suspension, not revocation, of PATCO\u2019s collective bargaining status.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">After September 21, Member Applewhaite considered other remedies, short of revocation, to deal with the PATCO strike. For over two weeks Member Applewhaite sought to find common ground with Chairman Haughton. Those efforts to agree on an alternative solution failed and, on October 9, Member Applewhaite finally decided to vote with Member Frazier for revocation. (Member Applewhaite apparently was concerned that the FLRA have a majority favoring one remedy, rather than render three opinions favoring three different dispositions.) All three Members drafted their final opinions by October 19. The drafts were exchanged and responses inserted. With some polishing, but no substantive change of positions, the opinions issued on October 22, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>The Members\u2019 Responses to the Applewhaite/Shanker Dinner. </em>While these negotiations within the Authority were going on, Member Frazier became concerned that Mr. Shanker might have influenced Member Applewhaite\u2019s position in the case. On September 22, Member Frazier visited Member Applewhaite to inquire about his dinner with Mr. Shanker. Member Frazier understood Member Applewhaite to say that Shanker had said that if Member Applewhaite voted against PATCO, then Applewhaite would be unable to get work as an arbitrator when he left the FLRA. Member Frazier also understood Member Applewhaite to say that he was then leaning against voting for revocation. (A. L. J. Vittone found that Shanker had made no such threats during the dinner, and concluded that Member Frazier reached this conclusion based on some miscommunication or misunderstanding.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">On September 22 and again on September 28, Member Frazier advised Member Applewhaite to talk to Solicitor Freehling about his dinner with Mr. Shanker. Member Applewhaite did so on September 28, and they concluded that no promises of benefits or threats had occurred and, therefore, that no crime had been committed. Solicitor Freehling also advised Member Applewhaite of the FLRA Rules on ex parte contacts. Member Applewhaite then told Chairman Haughton that he had discussed the dinner meeting with Solicitor Freehling and that there were no problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Member Frazier later asked Solicitor Freehling if Member Applewhaite had discussed his dinner with Mr. Shanker. Solicitor Freehling told Member Frazier that they had talked and that Member Applewhaite had concluded that there were no problems involved. Despite these assurances, Member Frazier contacted his personal attorney. Sometime in early October, Member Frazier\u2019s attorney contacted the FBI. The FBI interviewed Member Frazier on October 17 and then other FLRA Members and staff. FBI agents interviewed Member Applewhaite on October 22, the day the FLRA Decision issued. (Member Applewhaite was thus unaware of the FBI investigation until after he reached his final decision in the PATCO ease.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\"><em>The A. L. J. \u2019s Conclusions. </em>A. L. J. Vittone concluded: \u201cThe Shanker-Applewhaite dinner had no effect on the ultimate decision of Mr. Applewhaite in the PATCO case. Member Applewhaite\u2019s final decision in the PATCO case was substantially the same as the position he discussed at the September 21 meeting of the members.\u201d <em>Findings </em>at 28, 151. Later in his recommended findings, A. L. J. Vittone commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">It is clear that Mr. Shanker\u2019s message to Mr. Applewhaite was that revocation of certification was a drastic remedy out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>proportion to the violation. However, as I stated in my findings, I do not believe tht [sic] the dinner had any effect on the final decision of the FLRA in the PATCO case. At the very most, the effect was transitory in nature, and occurred from September 21 to October 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">B. <em>The Parties\u2019 Positions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Each of the FLRA Members argue that their individual contacts with persons outside of the Authority were not improper. In addition, each of the Members supports A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s findings that the various contacts, their own and their colleagues\u2019, had no effect on the ultimate decision of the PATCO case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Member Applewhaite alone disputes A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s finding that his dinner with Mr. Shanker may have had a transitory effect on his consideration of the case. Mr. Shanker also argues that his dinner with Member Applewhaite was not inappropriate and that it had no effect on the decision. In addition to the individual Members and Mr. Shanker, the FLRA (represented by its Acting Solicitor) and the FAA agree with the finding of no effect on the decision in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">PATCO, amicus Skirlick, and amici McClure, Hough and Tierney are less sanguine about the implications of Judge Vittone\u2019s findings. Each of them argue that the disclosed communications were improper and require remedial action. The amici contend that, due to the ex parte contacts, the Authority had an irrational sense of urgency about the case. This, they argue, prejudiced their ability to participate in the unfair labor practice proceeding and to protect the interests of nonstriking controllers. PATCO contends that the contacts with Authority Members by General Counsel Gordon and Secretary Lewis require a remand with instructions that the FLRA General Counsel and the FAA be required to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Based on their agreement with A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s finding of no effect on the ultimate outcome, the FLRA, the FAA, Chairman Haughton and Member Applewhaite all argue that no further action regarding ex parte contacts need be taken and that the court may now consider the PATCO decision on the merits. In his brief to this court, Member Frazier urged that the FLRA Decision be vacated and the case remanded to the Authority for proceedings anew. Member Frazier\u2019s position was premised on the assumption that Member Applewhaite had acted pursuant to a personal bias, thereby denying the parties an impartial tribunal. Member Frazier therefore initially urged reconsideration with Member Applewhaite disqualified from participation. However, at the oral argument held before this court on April 13, 1982, counsel for Member Frazier conceded that, since a full hearing already had been held on the matter of ex parte communications, it was not essential that the ease be remanded. Member Frazier thus now appears to.argue that, so long as the sanctity of the administrative and judicial processes is preserved, the court may properly consider the PATCO decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">C. <em>Applicable Legal Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">1. <em>The Statutory Prohibition of Ex Parte Contacts and the FLRA Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">The Civil Service Reform Act requires that FLRA unfair labor practice hearings, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118(a)(6) (Supp. IV 1980). Since FLRA unfair labor practice hearings are formal adjudications within the meaning of the APA, <em>see 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 551(7) (1976), section 557(d) governs ex parte communications. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 557(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">Section 557(d) was enacted by Congress as part of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub.L.No. 94-409, \u00a7 4(a), 90 Stat. 1241, 1246 (1976). The section prohibits ex parte communications \u201crelevant to the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the proceeding\u201d between an \u201cinterested person\u201d and an agency decisionmaker, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(d)(1)(A), (B) (1976), requires the agency decisionmaker to place any prohibited communications on the public record, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 557(d)(1)(C), grants the agency the authority to require an infringing party \u201cto show cause why his claim or interest should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of [a] violation,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 557(d)(1)(D), and defines the time period during which the statutory prohibitions are applicable, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 557(d)(1)(E).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The FLRA has adopted rules that, with minor variations, parallel the requirements of section 557(d). <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. pt. 2414 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Three features of the prohibition on ex parte communications in agency adjudications are particularly relevant to the contacts here at issue. First, by its terms, section 557(d) applies only to ex parte communications to or from an \u201cinterested person.\u201d Congress did not intend, however, that the prohibition on ex parte communications would therefore have only a limited application. A House Report explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-12\">The term \u201cinterested person\u201d is intended to be a wide, inclusive term covering any individual or other person with an interest in the agency proceeding that is greater than the general interest the public as a whole may have. The interest need not be monetary, nor need a person to [sic] be a party to, or intervenor in, the agency proceeding to come under this section. The term includes, but is not limited to, parties, competitors, public officials, and nonprofit or public interest organizations and associations with a special interest in the matter regulated. The term does not include a member of the public at large who makes a casual or general expression of opinion about a pending proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">H.R.Rep.No. 880, Pt. I, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 19-20 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1976, p. 2183, 2201, <em>reprinted in </em>Senate Comm. on Government Operations &amp; House Comm. on Government Operations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>94th Cong., 2d Sess., Government in the Sunshine Act\u2014S. 5 (Public Law 94-409): Source Book: Legislative History, Texts, and Other Documents 530-31 (Jt.

ICC, </em>625 F.2d 258 (9th Cir. 1980). Nevertheless, the legislative history of the Act cautions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">A request for a status report or a background discussion may in effect amount to an indirect or subtle effort to influence the substantive outcome of the proceedings. The judgment will have to be made whether a particular communication could affect the agency\u2019s decision on the merits. In doubtful cases the agency official should treat the communication as ex parte so as to protect the integrity of the decision making process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">S.Rep.No. 354, <em>supra, </em>at 37, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 232. <em>Accord, </em>H.R.Rep.No. 880, Pt. I, <em>supra, </em>at 20-21, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 531-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Third, and in direct contrast to status reports, section 557(d) explicitly prohibits communications \u201crelevant to the merits of the proceeding.\u201d The congressional reports state that the phrase should \u201cbe construed broadly and . . . include more than the phrase \u2018fact in issue\u2019 currently used in [section 554(d)(1) of] the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d S.Rep.No. 354, <em>supra, </em>at 36, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 231; H.R. Rep.No. 880, Pt. I, <em>supra, </em>at 20, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 2202, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 531. While the phrase must be interpreted to effectuate the dual purposes of the Government in the Sunshine Act, i.e., of giving notice of improper contacts and of providing all interested parties an opportunity to respond to illegal communications, <em>see </em>S.Rep.No. 354, <em>supra, </em>at 37, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 232, the scope of this provision is not unlimited. Congress explicitly noted that the statute does not prohibit procedural inquiries, <em>see id. </em>at 36, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 231, or other communications \u201cnot relevant to the merits,\u201d S.Rep.No. 1178, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1976) (Conference Report), Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">In sum, Congress sought to establish common-sense guidelines to govern ex parte contacts in administrative hearings, rather than rigidly defined and woodenly applied rules. The disclosure of ex parte communications serves two distinct interests. Disclosure is important in its own right to prevent the appearance of impropriety from secret communications in a proceeding that is required to be decided on the record. Disclosure is also important as an instrument of fair decisionmaking; only if a party knows the arguments presented to a decisionmaker can the party respond effectively and ensure that its position is fairly considered. When these interests of openness and opportunity for response are threatened by an ex parte communication, the communication must be disclosed. It matters not whether the communication comes from someone other than a formal party or if the communication is clothed in the guise of a procedural inquiry. If, however, the communication is truly not relevant to the merits of an adjudication and, therefore, does not threaten the interests of openness and effective response, disclosure is unnecessary. Congress did not intend to erect meaningless procedural barriers to ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>fective agency action. It is thus with these interests in mind that the statutory prohibition on ex parte communications must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">2. <em>Remedies for Ex Parte Communications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Section 557(d) contains two possible administrative remedies for improper ex parte communications. The first is disclosure of the communication and its content. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(d)(1)(C) (1976). The second requires the violating party to \u201cshow cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of [the] violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 557(d)(1)(D); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 556(d). Congress did not intend, however, that an agency would require a party to \u201cshow cause\u201d after every violation or that an agency would dismiss a party\u2019s interest more than rarely. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 354, <em>supra, </em>at 37-39, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 232-34. Indeed, the statutory language clearly states that a party\u2019s interest in the proceeding may be adversely affected only \u201cto the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(d)(1)(D) (1976).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The Government in the Sunshine Act contains no specific provisions for judicial remedy of improper ex parte communications. However, we may infer from approving citations in the House and Senate Reports that Congress did not intend to alter the existing case law regarding ex parte communications and the legal effect of such contacts on agency decisions. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 354, <em>supra, </em>at 3, 35, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 198, 230; H.R.Rep.No. 880, Pt. I, <em>supra, </em>at 4, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 515 (citing <em>Jacksonville Broadcasting Corp. v. FCC, </em>348 F.2d 75 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 893, 86 S.Ct. 186, 15 L.Ed.2d 150 (1965), and <em>Sangamon Valley Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>269 F.2d 221 (D.C.Cir.1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Under the case law in this Circuit, improper ex parte communications, even when undisclosed during agency proceedings, do not necessarily void an agency decision. Rather, agency proceedings that have been blemished by ex parte communications have been held to be <em>voidable. See, e.g., Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 9, 58 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 829, 98 S.Ct. 111, 54 L.Ed.2d 89 (1977); <em>United Air Lines v. CAB, </em>309 F.2d 238, 240-41 (D.C.Cir.1962); <em>WORZ, Inc. v. FCC, </em>268 F.2d 889, 890 (D.C.Cir.1959).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In enforcing this standard, a court must consider whether, as a result of improper ex parte communications, the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process was irrevocably tainted so as to make the ultimate judgment of the agency unfair, either to an innocent party or to the public interest that the agency was obliged to protect.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In making this determination, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>number of considerations may be relevant: the gravity of the ex parte communications; <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> whether the contacts may have influenced the agency\u2019s ultimate decision;<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> whether the party making the improper contacts benefited from the agency\u2019s ultimate decision;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> whether the contents of the communications were unknown to opposing parties, who therefore had no opportunity to respond;<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and whether vacation of the agency\u2019s decision and remand for new proceedings would serve a useful purpose.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Since the principal concerns of the court are the integrity of the process and the fairness of the result, mechanical rules have little place in a judicial decision whether to vacate a voidable agency proceeding. Instead, any such decision must of necessity be an exercise of equitable discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">D. <em>Analysis of the Alleged Ex Parte Communications with FLRA Members</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">With the foregoing considerations in mind, we have analyzed A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s findings thoroughly and given careful thought to the positions urged by the parties. As we noted earlier, the vast majority of the reported contacts between FLRA Members and persons outside the Authority are not troubling. They relate to inquiries about the expected date of issuance of the FLRA\u2019s opinion <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> information from a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>party regarding settlement efforts,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> statements regarding the running of PATCO\u2019s time to respond to Chairman Haughton\u2019s conditional dissent,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and other communications unrelated to the merits of the case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">After extensive review of the three troubling incidents that we describe in Part II.A. <em>supra, </em>we believe that they too provide insufficient reason to vacate the FLRA Decision or to remand this case for further proceedings before the Authority. The special evidentiary hearing before Judge Vittone was ordered by this court not because we assumed that the A. L. J. would find serious wrongs or improprieties, but because the allegations of misconduct were serious enough to require full exploration. Public officials are held to high standards of behavior, and only through a special inquiry could we clear the air of any doubt that the FLRA Decision in this case was not unfairly influenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">After unavoidable time, effort and expense, both by the parties and by the individual FLRA Members, A. L. J. Vittone formulated his findings. Except as otherwise noted below, we accept them. We conclude that at least one and possibly two of the contacts documented by the A. L. J. probably infringed the statutory prohibitions on ex parte communications. The incidents reported by the A. L. J. also included some evident, albeit unintended, indiscretions in a highly charged and widely publicized case. Nevertheless, we agree with A. L. J. Vittone that the ex parte contacts here at issue had no effect on the ultimate decision of the FLRA. Moreover, we conclude that the statutory infringements and other indiscretions are not so serious as to require us to vacate the FLRA Decision or to remand the case to the Authority. On the facts of this case, we believe that to vacate and remand would be a gesture of futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">1. <em>The Meeting Between Member Applewhaite and FLRA General Counsel Gordon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">When General Counsel Gordon met with Member Applewhaite on August 10, the General Counsel\u2019s office was prosecuting the unfair labor practice complaint against PATCO before Chief A. L. J. Fenton. Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>eral Counsel Gordon was therefore a \u201cperson outside the agency\u201d within the meaning of section 557(d) and the FLRA Rules. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.3(a) (1981). Still, the undisputed purpose of the meeting was to discuss budgetary and administrative matters. It was therefore entirely appropriate. The shared concerns of the Authority are not put on hold whenever the General Counsel prosecutes an unfair labor practice complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The discussion relevant to the PATCO case arose only when Ms. Stern delivered a copy of her memorandum regarding decertification of striking unions to Member Applewhaite. Thus, the ex parte contact, such as it was, was entirely inadvertent.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> More important, the contents of the discussion were entirely innocuous. Neither the General Counsel nor Member Applewhaite expressed any view on the correct statutory interpretation, the General Counsel made no arguments to Member Applewhaite, and the facts of the PATCO case were not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Some occasional and inadvertent contacts between the prosecuting and adjudicating arms of a small agency like the FLRA may be inevitable. While we cannot countenance any contacts or overlap in functions that threaten to bias administrative adjudications, accidental or passing references to a pending case do not <em>per se </em>deprive a party of a fair proceeding. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(d)(C) (1976); <em>cf. FTC v. Cinderella Career &amp; Finishing Schools, </em>404 F.2d 1308, 1315 (D.C.Cir.1968) (some mixing of adjudicatory and prosecutorial functions is not a denial of due process). Indeed, it is likely that the content of the brief discussion between Member Applewhaite, General Counsel Gordon and Ms. Stern was less relevant to the merits of the PATCO case than was the information conveyed to the FLRA Members by the General Counsel when he sought their approval to seek an injunction against the strike pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(d) (Supp. IV 1980). <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. ch. XIV, app. B (1981); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2414.6(f).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Yet, such discussions regarding the initiation of proceedings and the filing of charges violate neither the Administrative Procedure Act nor due process of law. <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 56-57, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 1469, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In hindsight, it may have been preferable if Member Applewhaite had postponed even this general conversation with Ms. Stern or if General Counsel Gordon had temporarily excused himself from Member Applewhaite\u2019s office.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we do not believe that this contact tainted the proceeding or unfairly advantaged the General Counsel in the prosecution of the case. Thus, we conclude that the conversation at issue here, even though possibly indiscreet and undesirable, does not void the FLRA Decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>2. <em>Secretary Lewis\u2019 Telephone Calls to Members Frazier and Applewhaite</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amx\">Transportation Secretary Lewis was undoubtedly an \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning of section 557(d) and the FLRA Rules when he called Members Frazier and Applewhaite on August 13. Secretary Lewis\u2019 call clearly would have been an improper ex parte communication if he had sought to discuss the merits of the PATCO case. The Secretary explicitly avoided the merits, however, and mentioned only his view on the possibility of settlement and his desire for a speedy decision. On this basis, Solicitor Freehling and Member Frazier concluded the call was not improper. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.6(b), (d) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We are less certain that Secretary Lewis\u2019 call was permissible. Although Secretary Lewis did not in fact discuss the merits of the case, even a procedural inquiry may be a subtle effort to influence an agency decision. <em>See </em>text at note 29 <em>supra. </em>We do not doubt that Member Frazier and Solicitor Freehling concluded in good faith that the communications were not improper, but it would have been preferable for them to heed Congress\u2019 warning, to assume that close cases like these are improper, and to report them on the public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We need not decide, however, whether Secretary Lewis\u2019 contacts were in fact improper. Even if they were, the contacts did not taint the proceedings or prejudice PAT-CO. Secretary Lewis\u2019 central concern in his conversations with Member Frazier and Member Applewhaite was that the case be handled expeditiously.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Member Applewhaite explicitly told Secretary Lewis that if he wanted the case handled more quickly than the normal course of FLRA business, then the FAA would have to file a written request. If, as A.L.J. Vittone found likely, Member Applewhaite\u2019s comments led to the FAA\u2019s Motion to Modify Time Limits, <em>that was exactly the desired result. </em>Once the FAA filed a motion, PATCO filed its own responsive motions, and the FLRA was able to decide the timing issue based on the pleadings before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">We believe that the Authority did exactly that. Chairman Haughton was cognizant only of the motions that had been filed. Member Applewhaite had quickly terminated his conversation with Secretary Lewis, and Member Frazier\u2019s conversation with Secretary Lewis was at most brief. During the Members\u2019 hour-long consideration of the motions, they did not mention Secretary Lewis\u2019 calls. In the end, the FLRA denied all of the motions and only reduced the time for filing exceptions from twenty-five days to nineteen days. In these circumstances, and given A.L.J. Vittone\u2019s inability to find any effect of the calls on the Members\u2019 decision, <em>see Findings </em>at 12, H 35, we cannot find that the disposition of the motions was improperly influenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Finally, PATCO cannot claim that it was prejudiced. The failure of the Authority to notice Secretary Lewis\u2019 calls on the public record did not deprive PATCO of an opportunity to comment: PATCO filed responsive motions. (Surely PATCO cannot argue that fairness requires two opportunities to respond rather than one.) Nor has PATCO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>suggested how it was ultimately injured by the six-day change in the time for filing exceptions.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In these circumstances we conclude that Secretary Lewis\u2019 telephone calls do not void the FLRA Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">3. <em>Member Applewhaite\u2019s Dinner with Albert Shanker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Of course, the most troublesome ex parte communication in this case occurred during the September 21 dinner meeting between Member Applewhaite and American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shank-er \u2014 the \u201cwell-known labor leader\u201d mentioned in Assistant Attorney General McGrath\u2019s affidavit. <em>See Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. FLRA, </em>672 F.2d 109, 113-15 app. (D.C.Cir.1982). Because allegations arising from this dinner occasioned our order of an evidentiary hearing, A.L.J. Vittone and the participants in the hearing before him centered much of their attention on this incident. We, too, have carefully focused on the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner in our review of the ex parte contacts. We agree \u2014 as do all the parties before us \u2014 with A.L.J. Vittone\u2019s finding that the dinner had no effect on the FLRA Decision in the case. After thorough consideration, we further conclude that the incident does not require a remand to the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">At the outset, we are faced with the question whether Mr. Shanker was an \u201cinterested person\u201d to the proceeding under section 557(d) and the FLRA Rules. Mr. Shanker argues that he was not. He suggests that his only connection with the unfair labor practice case was his membership on the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO which, unbeknownst to him, had participated as amicus curiae in the oral argument of the PATCO case before the FLRA. This relationship to the proceeding, Mr. Shanker contends, is too tenuous to qualify him as an \u201cinterested person\u201d forbidden to make ex parte communications to the Authority Members.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">As noted above, Congress did not intend such a narrow construction of the term \u201cinterested person.\u201d <em>See </em>text after note 28 <em>supra. </em>The Senate Committee on Government Operations deleted a provision in the original bill that exempted ex parte communications involving persons who were neither parties, intervenors nor government officials. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.354, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1975), Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 206. The House and Senate Reports agreed that the term covers \u201cany individual or other person with an interest in the agency proceeding that is greater than the general interest the public as a whole may have. The interest need not be monetary, nor need a person be a party to, or intervenor in, the agency proceeding . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 231. <em>Accord, </em>H.R.Rep.No.880, Pt. I, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 2201, Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">We believe that Mr. Shanker falls within the intended scope of the term \u201cinterested person.\u201d Mr. Shanker was (and is) the President of a major public-sector labor union. As such, he has a special and well-known interest in the union movement and the developing law of labor relations in the public sector. The PATCO strike, of course, was the subject of extensive media coverage and public comment. Some union leaders undoubtedly felt that the hard line taken against PATCO by the Administration might have an adverse effect on other unions, both in the federal and in state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>local government sectors. Mr. Shanker apparently shared this concern. From August 3, 1981 to September 21, 1981, Mr. Shanker and his union made a series of widely publicized statements in support of PATCO. Mr. Shanker urged repeatedly in public statements that disproportionately severe punishment not be inflicted on PATCO. He spoke frequently on this subject, was interviewed about the PATCO strike on a nationally televised news program, and published a number of columns in the <em>New York Times </em>discussing the PATCO situation. <em>Findings </em>at 14-15, K113-6. Thus, Mr. Shanker\u2019s actions, as well as his union office, belie his implicit claim that he had no greater interest in the case than a member of the general public. Regardless of the amicus status of the AFL-CIO, and Mr. Shanker\u2019s lack of knowledge thereof, he was an \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(d) (1976)<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Even if we were to adopt Mr. Shanker\u2019s position that he was not an interested person, we are astonished at his claim that he did nothing wrong. Mr. Shanker frankly concedes that he \u201cdesired to have dinner with Member Applewhaite because he felt strongly about the PATCO case and he wished to communicate directly to Member Applewhaite sentiments he had previously expressed in public.\u201d Shanker\u2019s Brief at 8; <em>see Findings </em>at 15, H 9. While we appreciate Mr. Shanker\u2019s forthright admission, we must wonder whether it is a product of candor or a failure to comprehend that his conduct was improper. In case any doubt still lingers, we take the opportunity to make one thing clear: <em>It is simply unacceptable behavior for any person directly to attempt to influence the decision of a judicial officer in a pending case outside of the formal, public proceedings. </em>This is true for the general public, for \u201cinterested persons,\u201d and for the formal parties to the case.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This rule applies to administrative adjudications as well as to cases in Article III courts.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We think it a mockery of justice to even suggest that judges or other decisionmakers may be properly approached on the merits of a ease during the pendency of an adjudication. Administrative and judicial adjudications are viable only so long as the integrity of the decisionmaking processes remains inviolate. There would be no way to protect the sanctity of adjudicatory processes if we were to condone direct attempts to influence decisionmakers through ex parte contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">We do not hold, however, that Member Applewhaite committed an impropriety when he accepted Mr. Shanker\u2019s dinner invitation. Member Applewhaite and Mr. Shanker were professional and social friends. We recognize, of course, that a judge \u201cmust have neighbors, friends and acquaintances, business and social relations, and be a part of his day and generation.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Local Union 542, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>388 F.Supp. 155, 159 (E.D.Pa.1974) (quoting <em>Ex Parte N. K. Fairbank Co., </em>194 F. 978, 989 (M.D.Ala.1912)). Similarly, Member Applewhaite was not required to renounce his friendships, either personal or professional, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>when he was appointed to the FLRA. When Mr. Shanker called Member Applewhaite on September 21, Member Applewhaite was unaware of Mr. Shanker\u2019s purpose in arranging the dinner. He therefore had no reason to reject the invitation.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The majority of the dinner conversation was unrelated to the PATCO case. Only in the last fifteen minutes of the dinner did the discussion become relevant to the PAT-CO dispute, apparently when Mr. Shanker raised the topic of local approaches to public employee strikes in New York and Pennsylvania. <em>See Findings </em>at 16-17, KK 11-14. At this point, and as the conversation turned to the discipline appropriate for a striking union like PATCO, Member Applewhaite should have promptly terminated the discussion. Had Mr. Shanker persisted in discussing his views of the PATCO case, Member Applewhaite should have informed him in no uncertain terms that such behavior was inappropriate. Unfortunately, he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">This indiscretion, this failure to steer the conversation away from the PATCO case, eventually led to the special evidentiary hearing in this case. The hearing has filled in much of the \u201cfactual picture\u201d left incomplete by the McGrath affidavit and the FBI reports. <em>See Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization </em>v. <em>FLRA, </em>672 F.2d 109, 113 (D.C.Cir.1982) (per curiam). We now know that Mr. Shanker did <em>not </em>in any way threaten Member Applewhaite during their dinner. Mr. Shanker did <em>not </em>tell Member Applewhaite that if he voted to decertify PATCO he would be unable to get cases as an arbitrator if and when he left the FLRA. Mr. Shanker did <em>not </em>say that he was speaking \u201cfor top AFL-CIO officials\u201d or that Member Applewhaite would need labor support to secure reappointment. Moreover, Mr. Shanker did <em>not </em>make any promises of any kind to Member Applewhaite, and Member Applewhaite did <em>not </em>reveal how he intended to vote in the PAT-CO case. <em>Findings </em>at 17-18, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">In these circumstances, we do not believe that it is necessary to vacate the FLRA Decision and remand the case. First, while Mr. Shanker\u2019s purpose and conduct were improper, and while Member Applewhaite should not have entertained Mr. Shanker\u2019s views on the desirability of decertifying a striking union, no threats or promises were made. Though plainly inappropriate, the ex parte communication, was limited to a ten or fifteen minute discussion, often couched in general terms, of the appropriate discipline for a striking public employee union. This behavior falls short of the \u201ccorrupt tampering with the adjudicatory process\u201d found by this court in <em>WKAT, Inc. v. FCC, </em>296 F.2d 375, 383 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 841, 82 S.Ct. 63, 7 L.Ed.2d 40 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Second, A. L. J. Vittone found that the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner had no effect on the ultimate decision of Member Applewhaite or of the FLRA as a whole in the PATCO case. None of the parties have' disputed this finding. Indeed, even Member Frazier, who initiated the FBI investigation of the dinner, testified that \u201cin his opinion the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner did not have an effect on Member Applewhaite ultimate decision in the PATCO case.\u201d <em>Findings </em>at 28, K 50.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Third, no party benefited from the improper contact. The ultimate decision was adverse to PATCO, the party whose interests were most closely aligned with Mr. Shanker\u2019s position. The final decision also rejected the position taken by the AFL-CIO as amicus curiae and by Mr. Shanker in his dinner conversation with Member Applewhaite.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Finally, we cannot say that the parties were unfairly deprived of an opportunity to refute the arguments propounded in the ex parte communication. PATCO has not identified any manner in which it was denied a reasonable opportunity to respond or any new arguments which it would present to the FLRA if given an opportunity.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Understandably, the FAA does not complain that its interests were injured. Moreover, Mr. Shanker\u2019s arguments regarding the severity of decertification paralleled PATCO\u2019s own arguments before the FLRA. The FAA and the FLRA General Counsel had a full opportunity to refute these arguments before the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">We in no way condone Mr. Shanker\u2019s behavior in this case. Nor do we approve Member Applewhaite\u2019s failure to avoid discussion of a case pending before the Authority. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>detailed in A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s findings, irrevocably tainted the Authority\u2019s decision-making process or resulted in a decision unfair either to the parties or to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">E. <em>Member Applewhaite\u2019s Alleged \u201cPersonal Interest\u201d in the PATCO Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">As we have noted, the special evidentiary hearing ordered in this case has filled in much of the factual picture left incomplete by the McGrath affidavit and the FBI reports. One feature of the picture revealed by the inquiry is the contents of Member Applewhaite\u2019s and Mr. Shanker\u2019s dinner conversation. A. L. J. Vittone found that near the end of their conversation Member Applewhaite observed that \u201che was concerned about his prospects for reappointment in July 1982.\u201d He also commented that, \u201cbecause the PATCO case was hotly contested, he would be viewed with disfavor by whichever side he voted against.\u201d In response, \u201cMr. Shanker urged Applewhaite to vote without regard to personal considerations.\u201d <em>Findings </em>at 17, f 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Based essentially on this brief conversation, Member Frazier now proposes that Member Applewhaite had a personal interest in the outcome of the PATCO case. Member Frazier contends that the record shows that Member Applewhaite was concerned that if he voted in favor of PATCO, he would not be reappointed by the Administration, and that if he voted against PAT-CO (and was not reappointed), his career in labor law would suffer from organized labor\u2019s reaction to his vote. Because of these alleged personal interests in the outcome, Member Frazier argues that Member Applewhaite was disqualified from hearing the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">We do not read as much into this conversation as does Member Frazier. It is not surprising that an agency member appointed by the President might be concerned about his prospects for reappointment. We are not so naive as to believe that such thoughts do not cross a member\u2019s mind.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Nor would we assume that an Authority Member would believe that his decisions are irrelevant to the President\u2019s determination whether to reappoint him. Similarly, it is hardly surprising for Member Applewhaite to recognize that his decision in a hotly contested case would not receive universal approbation. The appropriate question here is not whether Member Applewhaite recognized that his decision might not be universally approved; rather, the correct inquiry is whether Member Applewhaite\u2019s concerns rendered him incapable of reaching a fair decision on the merits of the case before him.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">The cited brief conversation between Member Applewhaite and Mr. Shanker does not demonstrate an inability to fairly decide the case. Courts have long recognized \u201ca presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators.\u201d <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 1464, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975). <em>Accord, NLRB v. Donnelly Garment Co., </em>330 U.S. 219, 229, 67 S.Ct. 756, 761, 91 L.Ed. 854 (1947); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 421, 61 S.Ct. 999, 1004, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941). Absent a strong showing to the contrary, an agency adjudicator is presumed to act in good faith and to be capable of ignoring considerations not on the record. <em>See, e.g., FTC v. Cement Institute, </em>333 U.S. 683, 700-03, 68 S.Ct. 793, 803-04, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948); <em>Lead Industries Association v. EPA, </em>647 F.2d 1130, 1178 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1042, 101 S.Ct. 621, 66 L.Ed.2d 503 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Member Frazier argues that there is a strong showing in this case because here we have an open admission of Member Applewhaite\u2019s concerns. Such a verbalization of an agency adjudicator\u2019s thoughts on the public record, argues Member Frazier, is rare. While it may indeed be rare, we think that is the result of the rarity of evidentiary hearings such as we have ordered here, and not the product of an especially strong personal concern by Member Applewhaite.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Indeed, any doubts we might otherwise have about the source of Member Applewhaite\u2019s ultimate decision in this case have been dispelled by the evidentiary hearing and the A. L. J.\u2019s findings. Member Applewhaite did believe that he would be viewed with disfavor by whichever side he voted against.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> But Member Applewhaite explained that this was no different from any arbitration case in which he had ruled \u2014 one party wins and the other loses. He testified: \u201cI have always faced that problem[,] so I just have to call it like it is and . . . take my chances.\u201d Tr. 744. We have no reason to doubt this testimony. Furthermore, A. L. J. Vittone\u2019s findings reveal that the PATCO case was never mentioned in Member Applewhaite\u2019s contacts with Administration officials. <em>Findings </em>at 32, UK 4-6; at 34-35, UK 8-10, 12. A. L. J. Vittone found that Member Applewhaite never \u201cheld out his vote in PATCO as deserving consideration by the Administration with respect to his possible reappointment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 35, 113, and that his conversations with Administration officials \u201cdid not affect in any manner Applewhaite\u2019s decision in the PATCO case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 35, H14. In these circumstances, Member Frazier\u2019s concerns about Member Applewhaite\u2019s bias are simply inapposite.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Thus, we believe that the evidentiary hearing has refuted \u201ceven the probability of unfairness.\u201d <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 625, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955). A remand on the basis of personal interest is therefore unnecessary.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">F. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Our review of the record of the special evidentiary hearing, and of the findings of Judge Vittone, leads us to a simple conclusion: There is no reason to vacate the FLRA decision or to remand the case to the FLRA for any further proceedings. We have not found any ex parte communications that irrevocably tainted the Authority\u2019s decision. Nor have the proceedings effected procedural unfairness on any of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">This is not to say that the Authority\u2019s handling of the case has been a paragon of administrative procedure. It certainly has not. Because \u201cthe suggestion of behind-the-scenes machinations [was] intolerable,\u201d <em>Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. FLRA, </em>672 F.2d 109, 113 (D.C.Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>1982) (per curiam), we ordered an extensive inquiry and gave all participants an opportunity to demonstrate why (if they so believed) the proceedings should be extended or begun anew. We have carefully examined the alleged indiscretions and improprieties. Although we have found one (or possibly two) statutory infringements, we conclude that no parties have been prejudiced by the flaws in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Of course, we recognize that it would be possible to vacate the FLRA Decision and to remand for reconsideration. Although that might produce a new record free from procedural defects, it would serve no other useful purpose. We, and all the parties, know the positions of each Authority Member. We know also that those positions are not the misbegotten offspring of improper influences. All of the Members have testified that they would reach identical conclusions upon reconsideration, and we have no reason to doubt their sworn testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Moreover, the <em>facts </em>of this case are free from any arguable taint. The extensive inquiry revealed no improper attempts to influence Chief A. L. J. Fenton or his fact-finding. The FLRA did not alter his factual conclusions. The principal issues decided by the Authority, therefore, are legal. We, of course, will independently review those legal issues. Any arguable taint that may remain will therefore be cured. <em>See, e.g., Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>FPC, </em>563 F.2d 588, 612 (3d Cir. 1977) (\u201cJudicial review is fully capable of correcting bias as to legal questions\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1062, 98 S.Ct. 1235, 55 L.Ed.2d 762 (1978); <em>Marquette Cement Manufacturing Co. v. FTC, </em>147 F.2d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1945), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. FTC v. Cement Institute, </em>333 U.S. 683, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We have already extended the appellate consideration of an important case. The criminal investigation by the FBI and the special procedures that we have employed should put to rest any doubts about the legitimacy of the Authority decision. Because remand would therefore be a futile gesture, we proceed to the consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">III. PATCO\u2019S VIOLATION OF THE BAN ON FEDERAL EMPLOYEE STRIKES</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">On the merits of this case, PATCO presents the court with two questions for review. The first question, which is addressed in this Part III., is whether the FLRA\u2019s finding that PATCO called, participated in, and condoned a strike is supported by substantial evidence. The second question, which is addressed <em>infra </em>in Part IV., is whether the FLRA properly exercised its discretion under the Act in revoking the exclusive recognition status of PATCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">A. <em>The Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Section 7123(c) of the Civil Service Reform Act declares that \u201c[t]he findings of the Authority with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c) (Supp. IV 1980). This language is identical to that governing judicial review of the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1976), and Congress clearly intended the scope of review of FLRA factual findings to be identical to that of NLRB findings.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Thus, although this is one of the first occasions that this court has had to apply the substantial evidence rule in connection with disputed findings in an unfair labor practice hearing before the FLRA, the scope of our review is well-settled. <em>See, e.g., Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>UAW v. NLRB, </em>392 F.2d 801, 805 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 906, 88 S.Ct. 2058, 20 L.Ed.2d 1364 (1968). The judicial function is merely to review the substantiality of the evidence underlying the agency decision, not to \u201cdisplace the [agency\u2019s] choice between two fairly conflicting views.\u201d That test of substantiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>is met when the record before the court does not \u201cpreclude[ ] the [agency\u2019s] decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of the witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\u201d <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 488, 490, 71 S.Ct. at 464, 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">B. <em>Violation of Section 7116(b)(7)(A)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In this case it fully appears that the record before the FLRA provided a rational justification for its finding that PATCO \u201ccall[ed], or participate^] in, a strike,\u201d an unfair labor practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(A) (Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As described above, the record contained evidence of simultaneous picketing by striking air traffic controllers at five separate PAA facilities. In each case the picketers carried signs indicating that they were on strike and that they belonged to a particular PAT-CO Local. In several cases FAA officials, viewing photographs taken during the strike, identified individual picketers as air traffic controllers (including certain PAT-CO Local officers); many of the persons identified were controllers who were scheduled for work at the times when the photographs were taken. In addition, FAA records also established massive absenteeism on August 3 and thereafter by air traffic controllers nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">PATCO objects to the adequacy of this evidence, contending that it establishes only that strikes were conducted by certain PATCO Local unions, while the Respondent before the FLRA was the PATCO National union. Whatever weight PATCO\u2019s contention might otherwise have is seriously diminished by the evidence of the <em>simultaneous </em>picketing at numerous work locations and by the evidence of the <em>nationwide </em>scope of absenteeism by controllers on and after August 3. However the evidence is interpreted, it certainly cannot be characterized as \u201ca wildcat strike on the part of one of [PATCO\u2019s] Locals.\u201d PATCO Reply Brief at 12. The weight of PATCO\u2019s contention is even further diminished by the fact that the PATCO National union was the exclusive bargaining agent for all bargaining unit members. For several months prior to August 3, the PATCO National union, and not the Locals, had engaged in collective bargaining with the FAA for a national agreement. The FLRA was entitled to draw a reasonable inference from the national bargaining unit and from the nationwide picketing and <em>absenteeism </em>\u2014 viz., that the PATCO National union, and not merely a collection of PATCO Locals, was on strike.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">Moreover, the FAA introduced into evidence two videotapes of PATCO National union President Robert Poli making statements regarding the strike at news conferences.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In the first videotape, Poli is recorded as announcing that the strike would begin on the morning of August 3 if no satisfactory settlement proposal was reached and if tallying of a strike vote revealed the necessary support. PATCO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>notes that this statement was not an actual strike call, but at most a prediction or a suggestion of conditions precedent to a strike. While what PATCO notes is indeed true, the statement nonetheless carries significant weight in light of the fact that Poli\u2019s \u201cpredicted\u201d time of the strike exactly coincided with the extensive picketing and massive absenteeism. In the second videotape, Poli was recorded as making the simple statement: \u201cThe question is will the strike continue. The answer is yes.\u201d PAT-CO again contends that the statement is \u201cno more than a prediction \u2014 a speculation about future events.\u201d PATCO Brief at 22-23. While the characterization given Poli\u2019s statement by PATCO is not totally inaccurate, it does not undercut the FLRA\u2019s finding. Poli\u2019s acknowledgement of the strike and his quite certain \u201cprediction\u201d that it would continue negate any attempt by PATCO to disassociate the PATCO National union from the widespread and simultaneous strike activity by PATCO members nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In these circumstances \u2014 simultaneous and widespread absenteeism by union members, picketing announcing various union locals as being on strike, and accurate statements by the union president that a strike would take place under certain conditions and then that that strike would continue\u2014 we have no difficulty concluding that the FLRA\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Our conclusion is made more certain by the total absence of record evidence offered by PAT-CO in refutation. Thus, we affirm the FLRA\u2019s finding that PATCO \u201ccall[ed], or participate!/!] in, a strike\u201d in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(A) (Supp. IV 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">C. <em>Violation of Section 7116(b)(7)(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ag0\">PATCO also objects to the conclusion of the FLRA that PATCO committed a separate unfair practice of condoning a strike \u201cby failing to take action to prevent or stop such activity,\u201d a violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(B) (Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> After finding that the evidence presented was sufficient to establish the prima facie existence of a strike, Chief A.L.J. Fenton ruled that the burden shifted to PATCO to produce evidence showing that it had taken some action to prevent or to stop the strike.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> PATCO offered no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">PATCO does not now object to the legal principle followed by Judge Fenton regarding the shifting of the burden; instead, PATCO contends that there was insufficient evidence to shift the burden in this case. PATCO argues that the FLRA General Counsel failed to prove that the PAT-CO National union was aware of the strike at any time during which it could have taken action to stop it; hence, it argues that the General Counsel failed to establish that National union had any obligation under section 7116(b)(7)(B) to attempt to stop the strike.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Given our affirmance of the unfair labor practice finding under section 7116(b)(7)(A), it necessarily follows that the FLRA could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>conclude that the PATCO National union was aware of the strike and, as a consequence, had a statutory obligation to attempt to stop the strike activity. In addition, we believe that the FLRA was fully justified in taking official notice of proceedings in the District Court for the District of Columbia. During the early morning of August 3, 1981, the District Court issued a restraining order against the PATCO strike. During the evening of that same day, the District Court found both the PATCO National union and its President, Robert Poli, in civil contempt for violation of the restraining order. <em>United States v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>107 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 3210 (D.D.C.1981). In these circumstances, PATCO certainly cannot claim lack of knowledge of the strike. On these bases, and because PATCO offered no evidence to indicate that it even attempted to end the strike, we also affirm the FLRA\u2019s unfair labor practice finding under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(B) (Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">IV. REVOCATION OF PATCO\u2019S EXCLUSIVE RECOGNITION STATUS</p>\n<p id=\"AC1\">Having determined that the FLRA properly found PATCO in violation of the no-strike provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, we turn to the second question presented for our review: whether the FLRA properly exercised its discretion under the Act to revoke the exclusive recognition status of PATCO. This inquiry requires us to ascertain: (1) what degree of discretion Congress granted to the FLRA when it enacted section 7120(f); (2) whether the FLRA\u2019s exercise of its discretion in this case was proper; and (3) whether the FLRA improperly excluded evidence in this case that was relevant to the exercise of its discretion. We address these issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">A. <em>The FLRA\u2019s Discretion Under Section 7120(f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-sp\">This case presents the first occasion for review of the FLRA\u2019s revocation of a union\u2019s exclusive recognition status pursuant to section 7120(f). Accordingly, we discuss in some detail the scope of the FLRA\u2019s discretion under that section. The scope of the FLRA\u2019s discretion was the source of some disagreement within the Authority;<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> that disagreement has been renewed before this court.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Because the issue is not subject to a ready resolution, we must analyze <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>not only the words of the statute, but also its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">1. <em>The Statutory Basis of the FLRA\u2019s Revocation Power</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Of course, the starting point for the interpretation of any statute is the language Congress employed to express its meaning. <em>E.g., Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1382, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1151 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982). Section 7120(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">In the case of any labor organization which by omission or commission has willfully and intentionally, with regard to any strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, violated section 7116(b)(7) of this title, the Authority shall, upon an appropriate finding by the Authority of such violation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">(1) revoke the exclusive recognition status of the labor organization, which shall then immediately cease to be legally entitled and obligated to represent employees in the unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">(2) take any other appropriate disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7120(f) (Supp. IV 1980). The language of this section clearly requires the FLRA to take some disciplinary action when it finds that a union has violated section 7116(b)(7). Section 7120(f)(2) just as clearly announces that the FLRA has some discretion to revoke or not to revoke the exclusive recognition status of a union that, like PATCO, is found to have committed an unfair labor practice by calling, participating in or condoning a strike against the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">The inference that the FLRA has some degree of discretion in the enforcement of section 7120(f) is supported by another section of the Act that generally deals with remedies for unfair labor practices, of which union strikes are only a single example. This provision, found in section 7118(a)(7), grants the FLRA the power to issue an order requiring a party found to be guilty of an unfair labor practice (1) to cease and desist from the practice, (2) to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement, (3) to reinstate an employee with backpay, or (4) to take \u201csuch other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118(a)(7) (Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">At the same time, yet another provision in the same Act, found in section 7103(a)(4), suggests that the FLRA is without discretion in its choice of remedy once it finds that a union has violated the Act\u2019s no-strike provisions. In defining \u201clabor organization\u201d under the Act, section 7103(a)(4) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-18\">(4) \u201clabor organization\u201d means an organization composed in whole or in part of employees, in which employees participate and pay dues, and which has as a purpose the dealing with an agency concerning grievances and conditions of employment, but does not include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-19\">(D) an organization which participates in the conduct of a strike against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the Government or any agency thereof or imposes a duty or obligation to conduct, assist, or participate in such a strike ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(4)(D) (Supp. IV 1980)<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Broadly construed, this definitional section at least implies that a labor organization found to have violated the Act\u2019s no-strike proscriptions may no longer be treated as a \u201clabor organization\u201d under the Act, and hence may not be accorded exclusive recognition status.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We hesitate to read so much into a definitional section of a statute, particularly where, as here, that broad reading would contradict a separate section of the same statute that describes the power given to an agency to determine the substantive rights of parties before it.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Nevertheless, section 7103(a)(4)(D) arguably clouds the interpretation of section 7120(f). Moreover, even without reference to the statutory definition of a labor organization, section 7120(f) does not plainly declare the <em>extent </em>of the Authority\u2019s discretion to revoke a union\u2019s exclusive recognition status. Therefore, because the plain words of the statute cannot resolve our inquiry, we must turn to the statute\u2019s legislative history for further guidance as to Congress\u2019 meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">2. <em>The Legislative History of the FLRA\u2019s Revocation Power</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Prior to the enactment of Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, labor-management relations in the federal sector were governed by Executive Order 11,491. Exec. Order No. 11,491, 34 Fed.Reg. 17,605 (1969), <em>reprinted as amended in </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301 note (1976 &amp; Supp. I 1977). Executive Order 11,491 contained no provision comparable to the revocation provision of the Civil Service Reform Act. The Executive Order did, however, declare strikes by federal sector unions to be unfair labor practices, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 19(b)(4), and excluded a union that engaged in a strike from the Order\u2019s definition of a labor organization, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2(e)(2).<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">The inclusion in Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of a provision like that found in the predecessor Executive Order, excluding a striking union from the definition of a labor organization, stemmed primarily from an amendment offered on the floor of the House of Representatives. The addition of a section providing for the revocation of a striking union\u2019s exclusive recognition status, however, resulted from an amendment offered on the floor of the Senate. In order to more fully understand Congress\u2019 intent in enacting sections 7103(a)(4)(D) and 7120(f) of the Act, we must examine these passages of the legislative history and the Conference Report on the final bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The vehicle for enactment of Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act in the House of Representatives was an amendment offered by Congressman Udall as a substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>for the bill reported by the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> As originally proposed, the Udall substitute contained neither a provision for revoking a striking union\u2019s exclusive recognition status nor an exclusion of a striking union from the statutory definition of a labor organization. On the floor of the House, Congressman Erlenborn offered an amendment to the Udall substitute that added the definitional exclusion. The Erlenborn amendment provided that a labor organization would not include \u201can organization which participates in the conduct of a strike against the Government of the United States or any agency thereof or imposes a duty or obligation to conduct, assist, or participate in such a strike.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 29,194 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History, <em>supra </em>note 10, at 946. The only explanation in the legislative history of this definitional exclusion, which eventually became section 7103(a)(4)(D) of the Civil Service Reform Act, is found in the following colloquy on the Erlenborn amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">Mr. FORD of Michigan....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the gentleman this question: It is [sic] the understanding of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ERLENBORN) that it would still be up to the labor authority to determine whether or not this provision applies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">Mr. ERLENBORN. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, yes, that is correct. <em>This would leave the discretion in the FLRA as to whether or not the decertification should be applied. It will not happen automatically.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 29,194, Legislative History at 947 (emphasis added). Following this brief exchange, the Erlenborn amendment to the Udall substitute was agreed to by voice vote. Subsequently, the House of Representatives adopted the Udall substitute as the House version of Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 29,202-03, 29,220-21, Legislative History at 962-63, 964-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Thus, as initially passed by the House, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act did <em>not </em>provide for the revocation of the exclusive recognition status of a union that struck against the government, but <em>did </em>exclude striking unions from the definition of the term \u201clabor organization.\u201d As the sponsor of that language made clear on the House floor, however, the definitional exclusion was intended to \u201cleave the discretion in the FLRA\u201d whether or not to apply the exclusion and thereby remove a union from the protections of the statute. No expression of the scope of the FLRA\u2019s discretion or guidance for its application was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Before the House of Representatives adopted its version of Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, the Senate completed action on the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), <em>reported in </em>S.Rep.No.969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 271-320 (1978), Legislative History at 499-548. The Senate Committee bill closely resembled Executive Order 11,491,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and thus excluded striking unions from the definition of labor organizations, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7202(a)(3)(B), S.Rep.No. 969, <em>supra, </em>at 273-74, Legislative History at 501-02.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> However, like the original House bill, the Senate bill did not explicitly pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>vide for the revocation of the exclusive recognition status of a union that struck against the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">During Senate debate on the bill, Senator Hatch offered an amendment that, among other things, added section 7217(e) to the bill. That section, the predecessor to section 7120(f) of the Civil Service Reform Act, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">Any labor organization which by omission or commission has willfully and intentionally violated section 7216(b)(4)(B)<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> shall upon an appropriate finding by the Authority, of such violation, have its exclusive recognition status revoked and it shall cease immediately to be legally entitled and obligated to represent employees in the unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 7217(e) (1978), Legislative History at 588 (version passed by the Senate). Debate between Senator Hatch and Senators Javits and Metzenbaum made clear that the only decisionmaking authority granted to the FLRA under the proposed section was the power to decide whether or not a charged union had committed an unfair labor practice by striking or illegally picketing, or condoning such action, against the federal government. If that decision was made contrary to the union, revocation of the union\u2019s exclusive recognition status was to be mandatory. <em>See </em>124 Cong.Rec. 27,579-80, 27,584-85 (1978), Legislative History at 1021-22, 1028-30 (debate on Hatch amendment). The Senate adopted the Hatch amendment, <em>id. </em>at 27,588, Legislative History at 1035, and ultimately passed its version of the Civil Service Reform Act, <em>id. </em>at 27,593, Legislative History at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Thus, as initially passed by the Senate, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act included a section that explicitly provided for the revocation of the exclusive recognition status of a union that struck against the government. Revocation pursuant to the section was not discretionary, but was mandatory whenever the FLRA found that a union had committed an unfair labor practice by striking against the government, by picketing an agency and interfering with agency operations, or by condoning either forbidden picketing or work stoppage.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The House and Senate conferees settled upon a bill that, at least with respect to Title VII, closely tracked the House version. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 152-59 (1978) (Conference Report), Legislative History at 820-27; 124 Cong.Rec. 38,713 (1978), Legislative History at 990 (statement of Rep. Ford). The houses were not in conflict over the language excluding striking unions from the definition of labor organizations, which was identical in both bills, and the conference did not alter that provision. The conferees did, however, make significant liberalizing changes in section 7217(e) of the Senate bill. The conferees eliminated picketing as a possible basis for its application, thereby limiting its reach to \u201cany strike, work stoppage, or slow-down.\u201d More important for our present purposes, the conferees made revocation of exclusive recognition status discretionary with the Federal Labor Relations Authority. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7120(f) (Supp. IV 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The Conference Report devoted only a single paragraph to discussion of section 7217(e) from the Senate bill and its transformation into the final section 7120(f). It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">The conference report adopts the Senate wording with an amendment. As agreed to by the conferees the provision will not apply to instances where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>organization was involved in picketing activities. The amendment also specifies that the Authority may impose disciplinary action other than decertification. This is to allow for instances, such as a wildcat strike, where decertification would not be appropriate. In cases where the Authority finds a person has violated this provision, disciplinary action of some kind must be taken. The authority may take into account the extent to which the organization 'made efforts to prevent or stop the illegal activity in deciding whether the organization should be decertified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">H.R.Rep.No.1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 156 (1978), Legislative History at 824. Both houses passed the conference version of the Civil Service Reform Act after only brief debates which did not touch upon section 7120(f). <em>See </em>124 Cong.Rec. 33,388-90 (1978), Legislative History at 1039-41 (Senate passage); <em>id. </em>at 34,098-105 (1978), Legislative History at 985-89 (House passage).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">As we read this statement from the Conference Report and consider as well the language and history of the Civil Service Reform Act, we conclude that Congress intended to grant the Federal Labor Relations Authority discretion to determine the appropriate disciplinary action for unions that commit unfair labor practices in violation of section 7116(b)(7). There are several important considerations that militate in favor of this conclusion. First, the Conference Report states that \u201cdisciplinary action other than decertification\u201d may be appropriate in \u201cinstances, such as a wildcat strike.\u201d By referring to \u201cinstances\u201d and citing a wildcat strike as but a single example, the conferees apparently did not intend that example to be the only instance in which revocation would not follow. Had Congress intended wildcat strikes to be the <em>only </em>type of strike allowing a less severe penalty, the Conference Report and the section itself could have expressly so stated. They do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Second, if disciplinary action short of revocation applied only to wildcat strikes, the discretion expressly granted in subsection 7120(f)(2) would rarely, if ever, be exercised. If a strike or work slowdown was a wildcat action, then the union would not be in violation of section 7116(b)(7)(A) because, by definition, it had not called or participated in the strike. Further, if the union attempted to end the wildcat strike, then it would not be guilty of \u201cfailing to take action to prevent or stop\u201d the strike and hence would not be in violation of section 7116(b)(7)(B). In that case, <em>no discipline </em>could be taken against the union, since the union would have committed no unfair labor practice.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Thus, providing for disciplinary measures short of revocation only in the case of wildcat strikes would often be meaningless. Courts, of course, are reluctant to adopt an interpretation of a statute that makes a portion superfluous. <em>See, e.g., D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons v. Popkin, </em>285 U.S. 204, 208, 52 S.Ct. 322, 323, 76 L.Ed. 521 (1932); <em>Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association v. EPA, </em>627 F.2d 1095, 1107-08 (D.C.Cir.1979), cer<em>t. denied, </em>446 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 2917, 64 L.Ed.2d 808 (1980). We, too, are loathe to embrace such a construction and, therefore, do not read the Conference Report to limit the Authority\u2019s discretion only to eases of wildcat strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Third, an interpretation of section 7120(f) limiting the Authority\u2019s discretion to an inquiry into whether the union made efforts to prevent or stop the strike must also be rejected. The final sentence of the quoted paragraph of the Conference Report clearly allows the Authority to consider this factor, but the sentence is phrased in permissive (i.e., <em>\u201cmay </em>take into account\u201d) terms. Moreover, nothing in the sentence suggests that this factor, while likely to be highly relevant in many cases, must be the Authority\u2019s only concern. Indeed, the structure of section 7120(f) suggests just the opposite. Were \u201cefforts to prevent or stop the illegal activity\u201d the only relevant factor, Congress could have explicitly made revocation turn upon whether a union had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>violated section 7116(b)(7)(B) or, alternatively, upon whether it had violated both sections 7116(b)(7)(A) and 7116(b)(7)(B). Congress wrote neither of these simple formulations into law, but instead granted the FLRA the more general power to \u201ctake any . . . appropriate disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Finally, we note that our interpretation of the scope of the FLRA\u2019s discretion under section 7120(f) is wholly consistent with the other sections of the Act viewed in light of the legislative history. The general remedial authority of the FLRA under section 7118(a)(7) includes the power to order \u201csuch ... action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118(a)(7)(D) (Supp. IV 1980). The Supreme Court has interpreted similar language in the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (1976), as granting the National Labor Relations Board broad remedial discretion in effectuating the purposes of that Act. <em>See, e.g., Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. </em>NLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 215-16, 85 S.Ct. 398, 405, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964); <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S.Ct. 845, 852, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941); <em>accord, United Steelworkers of America v. NLRB, </em>646 F.2d 616, 629-30 (D.C.Cir.1981). The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act strongly suggests that Congress intended to grant similar discretion to the FLRA to remedy unfair labor practices, including union strikes, in the federal sector. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.R.Rep.No.1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 53 (1978), Legislative History at 699; 124 Cong.Rec. 38,714 (1978), Legislative History at 992-93 (statement of Rep. Ford).<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The legislative history also reveals that the discretion granted to the FLRA in section 7120(f) is not inconsistent with the exclusion of unions that participate in strikes from the definition of \u201clabor organization\u201d in section 7103(a)(4)(D). The brief House debate on the Erlenborn amendment \u2014 the only debate on or legislative elucidation of this subsection \u2014 clearly announces that the FLRA is vested with discretion in its application. <em>See </em>124 Cong. Rec. 29,194 (1978), Legislative History at 946-47 (quoted at page 71 supra). Therefore, contrary to first impressions from reading the definitional section, section 7103(a)(4)(D) reinforces, rather than detracts from, the conclusion that section 7120(f) vests the FLRA with discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Thus, we conclude that section 7120(f) entrusts the Federal Labor Relations Authority with extensive authority to remedy illegal strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by federal employee unions. The section clearly permits the FLRA to employ the extreme measure of revoking a union\u2019s exclusive recognition status \u2014 -a remedy unknown to private sector labor law \u2014 if the union commits or condones any of these unfair labor practices. The Senate and House conferees\u2019 rejection of the Senate\u2019s section 7217(e), however, establishes that revocation is not intended to be mandatory. Further, we reject an interpretation of the Conference Report that would limit the FLRA\u2019s inquiry to a single issue or its discretion to a single type of violation. Rather, we hold that the FLRA has discretion under section 7120(f) to choose an appropriate remedy for any given violation of section 7116(b)(7) of the Civil Service Reform Act.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>B. <em>The FLRA\u2019s Exercise of Its Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">We have concluded that the FLRA has substantial discretion under section 7120(f) to decide whether or not to revoke the exclusive recognition status of a union found guilty by the FLRA of striking or condoning a strike against the government. A concomitant of this conclusion is that the courts have only a limited role in reviewing the FLRA\u2019s exercise of its remedial discretion. Section 7123(c) of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c) (Supp. IV 1980), directs the court to review the Authority\u2019s orders in accordance with section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976). For our present purposes, therefore, we must determine whether the FLRA\u2019s revocation of PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status was \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(A). Under this standard, our review is highly deferential and we need satisfy ourselves only that \u201cthe agency has exercised a reasoned discretion, with reasons that do not deviate from or ignore the ascertainable legislative intent.\u201d <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 850 (D.C.Cir.1970) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971); <em>see Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, </em>541 F.2d 1, 33-37 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 941, 96 S.Ct. 2663, 49 L.Ed.2d 394 (1976). As with judicial review of remedial orders of the NLRB, we will uphold the remedial orders of the FLRA \u201cunless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>319 U.S. 533, 540, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 1218, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">We have little trouble deciding that the FLRA did not abuse its discretion in this case. First, the FLRA could take official notice that PATCO has repeatedly violated legal prohibitions against striking and other job actions. In 1970, PATCO called a \u201csickout\u201d of the air traffic controllers subject to its exclusive representation. \u201cExtensive disruptions in air service resulted as approximately one quarter of the nation\u2019s air controllers reported in sick- each day between March 24 and April 14 ... . \u201d <em>Miller v. Bond, </em>641 F.2d 997, 999 (D.C.Cir.1981) (per curiam).<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> In 1978, PATCO threatened a nationwide air traffic slowdown. Based on a stipulated record, the union was held in contempt for its actions. <em>Air Transport Association v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>453 F.Supp. 1287 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>594 F.2d 851 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 944, 99 S.Ct. 2163, 60 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1979). In 1980, PAT-CO controllers engaged in a work slowdown at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport. <em>United States v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>653 F.2d 1134, 1136 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1083, 102 S.Ct. 639, 70 L.Ed.2d 617 (1981). In August 1981, PATCO called the nationwide strike that gives rise to the present action. <em>See </em>text at notes 4\u20147 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Second, all of PATCO\u2019s job actions after 1970 occurred while the union was subject to an injunction resulting from its 1970 strike that prohibited such actions. <em>See Air Transport Association v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>453 F.Supp. 1287 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>594 F.2d 851 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 944, 99 S.Ct. 2163, 60 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1979). Nor could PATCO have had any doubt about the continued validity of that injunction before it commenced its 1981 strike. After the effective date of the Civil Service Reform Act, PATCO petitioned the District Court for the Eastern District of New York for vacatur of its 1970 injunction on the ground that Title VII of the Act had deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to enjoin federal employee strikes. In June 1981, before the most recent strike began, the District Court reaffirmed the validity of its 1970 injunction and denied PATCO\u2019s motion. <em>Air Transport Association v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, </em>516 F.Supp. 1108 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>667 F.2d 316 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Third, after PATCO struck on August 3, 1981, additional restraining orders and injunctions directed only at this strike issued. <em>See </em>notes 5-6 <em>supra. </em>PATCO openly defied these injunctions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Finally, PATCO\u2019s actions before and after August 3, 1981, can only be characterized as defiant. The union threatened its strike, then willfully and intentionally called and participated in it. After the strike commenced, PATCO made no attempt to end it; indeed, PATCO condoned and encouraged it. Even after the striking controllers had been terminated and a majority of the Authority had ordered revocation of its exclusive recognition status, PATCO failed to satisfy Chairman Haughton\u2019s request that it end the strike and promise to abide by the no-strike provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In these circumstances the FLRA\u2019s decision to revoke PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status was not an abuse of discretion. The union is a repeat offender that has willfully ignored statutory proscriptions and judicial injunctions. It has shown little or no likelihood of abiding by the legal requirements of labor-management relations in the federal sector. If the extreme remedy that Congress enacted cannot properly be applied to this case, we doubt that it could ever properly be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">C. <em>Evidence of Mitigating Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">PATCO argues on appeal that the FLRA\u2019s revocation order must be rejected because the A.L.J. and the Authority failed to grant PATCO a continuance to enable the union to gather and prepare evidence in mitigation of the requested remedy. In the hearings before the A.L.J., PATCO suggested that, if given time, it might produce evidence<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> regarding its claims that the FAA had refused to bargain in good faith, that working conditions for PATCO members were unsafe, and that antiunion animus existed within the FAA. PATCO contends that it was not given the opportunity to prepare this evidence and, as a consequence, it was improperly prevented from presenting and substantiating mitigating factors that were relevant to the exercise of the FLRA\u2019s remedial discretion. PATCO claims further that, because of the denial of the requested continuance, the record before the Authority was incomplete, and, therefore, the Authority\u2019s decision cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">At the outset, we note that whatever evidence PATCO might have offered could serve only in mitigation of the FLRA\u2019s ordered remedy and not as justification of PATCO\u2019s actions. Even if mitigating evidence was improperly excluded, it would not affect the conclusion that PATCO committed unfair labor practices in violation of sections 7116(b)(7)(A) and 7116(b)(7)(B).<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>In addition, we note that the Civil Service Reform Act, unlike some state public employee relations acts, does not specifically provide for consideration of the types of mitigating circumstances pointed to by PATCO in this case.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Despite the absence of any clear statutory provision for the consideration of the mitigating evidence suggested by PATCO, we do not suggest that such evidence could never be relevant to the exercise of the FLRA\u2019s discretion under section 7120(f). Given the Authority\u2019s broad discretion, in a particular case evidence of prolonged unsafe working conditions, extreme agency provocation or agency intransigence might affect the Authority\u2019s determination of the appropriate remedy under section 7120(f), even though it could not justify a strike in any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In the present case, however, we do not believe that the FLRA abused its discretion by excluding potentially probative evidence of mitigating circumstances. First, based on the record before us we do not find that PATCO made any satisfactory proffer of evidence in mitigation. The A.L.J. repeatedly tried to discern what evidence PATCO intended to offer in response to the case presented by the FLRA General Counsel. PATCO indicated that it might or might not introduce evidence, and that <em>if </em>it did, that evidence would be in an attempt to mitigate the remedy. PATCO made several suggestions of the type of mitigating evidence it might bring forward, but failed to describe in any detail the nature, content or scope of the evidence.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> PATCO was required, however, to do more than this in order to make an offer of proof. An offer of proof must consist of specific evidence that the party proposes to introduce, rather than mere argument and conclusory allegations. <em>See, e.g., Duncan Foundry &amp; Machine Works v. NLRB, </em>458 F.2d 933, 937 (7th Cir. 1972); <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. NLRB, </em>424 F.2d 818, 827-28 (D.C.Cir.1970).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In its only proffer that approached this standard, PATCO suggested that it would call certain FAA officials to establish the nature of the air traffic controllers\u2019 working conditions, but it did not identify the officials or request subpoenas from the A.L.J. Nor did PATCO identify the testimony it intended to elicit from these adverse, potentially hostile, witnesses. Therefore, this attempt to make an offer of proof also lacked substance. <em>See UAW v. NLRB, </em>231 F.2d 237, 242-43 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 908, 77 S.Ct. 146, 1 L.Ed.2d 117 (1956). PATCO\u2019s other suggestions of mitigating evidence were even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>more vague and conclusory; thus, they also failed to constitute valid offers of proof.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Second, given the nature of the evidence PATCO indicated it might produce, we do not believe that the A.L.J. erred in denying PATCO a continuance to develop its case in mitigation of the remedy. \u201cIt is well established that the grant or denial of a continuance is within the discretion of the ALJ and will not be overturned absent a clear showing of abuse.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Pan Scape Corp., </em>607 F.2d 198, 201 (7th Cir. 1979). In reaching this decision, the A.L.J. may properly consider the length of the delay requested, the potential adverse effects of that delay, the possible prejudice to the moving party if denied the delay, and the importance of the testimony that may be adduced if the delay is granted. <em>See Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 226, 59 S.Ct. 206, 215, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938); <em>NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, </em>432 F.2d 854, 860 (2d Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 915, 91 S.Ct. 1375, 28 L.Ed.2d 661 (1971); <em>NLRB v. Sagamore Shirt Co., </em>401 F.2d 925, 928 (D.C.Cir.1968) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In this case, PATCO requested a thirty-day continuance. At the time of the hearings before the A.L.J., however, the PATCO strike was of some moment. The strike was arguably the most serious unfair labor practice in the federal sector since the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act. The FLRA General Counsel\u2019s prosecution of the unfair labor practice charges was part of a government-wide response to PATCO\u2019s national strike. If prompt legal response were impossible in these circumstances, it is likely that Congress\u2019 carefully legislated scheme of sanctions in the Civil Service Reform Act would lose much of its credibility, both with federal employee unions and with the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Nor can we conclude that PATCO was unfairly prejudiced by the necessarily expeditious treatment given to this case. On at least two occasions during the hearings before the A.L.J., PATCO counsel noted that he could not guarantee that PATCO would present any evidence in mitigation of the remedy even \u201cif given a year\u201d to prepare its case.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> These predictions now appear close to being accurate. PATCO did not identify in any greater detail its mitigating evidence in its briefs before the FLRA, submitted three weeks after the A.L.J. proceedings. Neither has PATCO identified in its briefs before this court, filed over three and six months after the A.L.J. proceedings, the specific evidence that it would have offered in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In addition, PATCO can hardly claim surprise at the unfair labor practice charges or suggest a lack of opportunity to prepare for the FLRA proceedings. PATCO had been negotiating with the FAA over a new contract for several months. Certainly, the issues that PATCO sought to raise in mitigation of the remedy \u2014 the safety of its members\u2019 working conditions and the alleged antiunion animus of the FAA during bargaining \u2014 were raised or perceived dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ing those negotiations. PATCO concurrently filed an unfair labor practice charge against the FAA stemming from those same negotiations; therefore, whatever factual basis the union had for those charges could not have required an additional thirty days of preparation before it could be presented to the A.L.J., at least by way of proffer. <em>Cf. NLRB </em>v. <em>Interboro Contractors, </em>432 F.2d 854, 860 (2d Cir. 1970) (whatever evidence Respondent sought to introduce was already within its control), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 915, 91 S.Ct. 1375, 28 L.Ed.2d 661 (1971). Moreover, \u201cPATCO had been threatening to strike for several months prior to the actual strike. Accordingly, PATCO clearly had ample notice of the need for and opportunity to gather evidence with respect to such allegedly mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>PATCO </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Finally, we believe that the Authority could decide that the evidence PATCO indicated it might offer in mitigation would not be sufficiently exculpatory to justify a prolonged delay. As noted above, it does not appear from the record that PATCO had specific mitigating evidence in mind when it requested a continuance from the A.L.J. Furthermore, despite the relevance of the mitigating factors suggested by PATCO, the Authority could reasonably conclude that in this case the factors would be overridden by the extreme nature of PATCO\u2019s violation. As Chairman Haughton stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9E4\">Despite my concern that all relevant evidence going to the remedy is not before us at this time, one overriding fact is clear \u2014 PATCO has not made any attempt to end the strike. Unless it ends the strike forthwith, and immediately represents to the Authority that it intends to abide by the no-strike provisions of the Statute, I would view any additional evidence as having no mitigating effect on the penalty to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\"><em>PATCO </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">All things considered, we do not believe that the actions of the FLRA are subject to any serious challenge. For the reasons cited above, we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the FLRA to deny PAT-CO\u2019s requested continuance and to reach its decision based on the evidence before it and upon the arguments in mitigation presented in PATCO\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">V. ARGUMENTS OF THE AMICI CURIAE</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">A. <em>Arguments of the American Federation of Government Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The American Federation of Government Employees (\u201cAFGE\u201d) is a federal employee union with approximately 300,000 members. AFGE Brief at 1. The AFGE participated as amicus curiae before the FLRA, and it has filed a brief in that capacity with this court as well. For the most part, AFGE\u2019s arguments parallel those raised by PATCO which have already been dealt with in the preceding sections of this opinion. The AFGE does, however, offer two arguments not heretofore addressed. While we find little merit to these additional contentions, we address them briefly in order to dispose of all material points in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>First, the AFGE contends that the Authority may not delegate to an Administrative Law Judge its power under section 7120(f) to revoke a union\u2019s exclusive recognition status. The AFGE notes that section 7105(e)(2) of the Act allows the FLRA to delegate its power to decide unfair labor practices under section 7118, but makes no mention of the FLRA\u2019s revocation power under section 7120(f). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(e)(2) (Supp. IV 1980). We find this argument wholly unpersuasive. In this case, the A.L.J. held a hearing on the underlying unfair labor practice complaint against PATCO and <em>recommended </em>findings of fact and an appropriate remedy to the FLRA. The FLRA reviewed the A.L.J.\u2019s recommendations, adopted them as its own factual findings, and decided on its own authority to revoke PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status. The plain language of section 7120(f) requires no more. See <em>PATCO </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Second, the AFGE argues that the Authority may not invoke section 7120(f) at all in the instant proceeding. In support of this argument, the AFGE notes that section 7120 as a whole is entitled \u201cStandards of conduct for labor organizations\u201d and that section 7120(d) empowers the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor Management Relations, and not the FLRA, to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the section and to accept complaints of violations. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7120(d) (Supp. IV 1980). Thus, according to the AFGE, the FLRA lacks the statutory authority to revoke a striking union\u2019s exclusive recognition status under section 7120(f). We cannot accept the AFGE\u2019s exaggerated reasoning. The AFGE\u2019s argument totally ignores the plain language of section 7120(f), which empowers the <em>Authority </em>to revoke a union\u2019s exclusive recognition status, and the legislative history behind the subsection. <em>See </em>text at note 77 <em>supra. </em>The heading of the section of a statute and the placement of a particular subsection cannot cast doubt upon an otherwise unambiguous congressional grant of authority. <em>Habib v. Raytheon Co., </em>616 F.2d 1204, 1210 n.8 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">B. <em>Argument of Anthony J. Skirlick, Jr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Mr. Skirlick is a PATCO member and a nonstriking air traffic controller. He correctly points out that his appearance before this court is the first appearance of a nonstriking controller in this or any other proceeding stemming from PATCO\u2019s 1981 strike. Mr. Skirlick contends that these legal proceedings have failed to consider the effects of the revocation remedy on the nonstriking controllers, many of whom, according to Mr. Skirlick, are members of a less militant, minority faction within PAT-CO.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Essentially, Mr. Skirlick argues that when the striking PATCO members left their jobs on August 3, they violated federal law. No later than August 5, when President Reagan terminated the striking air traffic controllers, they ceased to be federal employees. Since the strikers were no longer air traffic controllers, Mr. Skirlick argues, they also ceased to be PATCO members. Therefore, when the FLRA revoked PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status, it decertified a union composed entirely of nonstriking controllers. That union, so composed, had committed no unfair labor practices and therefore could not properly be decertified.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Mr. Skirlick\u2019s argument obviously depends on his contention that the striking air traffic controllers <em>automatically </em>lost their union membership when their employment was terminated. The record before the FLRA and therefore before this court, however, contains no such finding. The record does not contain a copy of the PATCO Constitution and By-Laws, and we thus cannot confirm Mr. Skirlick\u2019s necessary premise. <em>Cf. Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973) (per curiam) (in absence of statutory <em>de novo </em>review, court may not create new evidentiary record on appeal from agency decision). Furthermore, Mr. Skirlick conveniently fails to indicate whether internal union procedures may exist by which a PATCO member can contest his dismissal from the union. Moreover, terminated air traffic con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>trailers may challenge their dismissals from federal employment. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511-7513, 7701 (Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> In that case, a striking air traffic controller\u2019s removal from PATCO might be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal of his termination or rescinded if his appeal were ultimately successful. Because Mr. Skirlick cannot support his assertion that PATCO is now \u201cofficially\u201d composed only of nonstriking air traffic controllers, we cannot accept his argument that the revocation of PAT-CO\u2019s exclusive recognition status was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Furthermore, insofar as the revocation remedy is concerned, we think Mr. Skirlick\u2019s argument must fail even if it is true that PATCO is now \u201cofficially\u201d composed only of nonstriking air traffic controllers. PAT-CO\u2019s status as exclusive representative has been revoked because the duly authorized leaders of the National union called, participated in and condoned an unlawful strike. When the strike action commenced, the union leaders were in their positions of authority. When the air traffic controllers walked out, they were at that time still government employees. (Indeed, they could not have been on \u201cstrike\u201d or \u201cfired\u201d unless they were government employees.) Therefore, it does not matter that these employees were subsequently fired and then, as a consequence, ceased to be union members. What does matter is that there was an unlawful strike, authorized by the leadership of PATCO and engaged in by a vast majority of the PATCO membership. In these circumstances, the FLRA could properly act to revoke the exclusive representative status of the union.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Thus, Mr. Skirlick\u2019s argument is novel but specious. The harms that he alleges will accrue to the nonstriking air traffic controllers are a necessary consequence of majority rule. The principle of exclusive representation by the majority union is well established in American labor law, <em>see </em>R. Gorman, Basic Text on Labor Law 374-81 (1976), and we cannot ignore it merely because its implications are occasionally troubling. <em>Cf. Emporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization, </em>420 U.S. 50, 95 S.Ct. 977, 43 L.Ed.2d 12 (1975) (principle of majority rule renders attempts by a racial minority to protest an employer\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practices outside of the collectively bargained grievance machinery unprotected activities). As intriguing as it may be, Mr. Skirlick\u2019s contention is wholly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Finally, we note that we perceive nothing that prevents the presently employed air traffic controllers from attempting to form a new labor organization. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7111 (Supp. IV 1980); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2422.-3(a), (d)(3) (1981). If a majority of Mr. Skirlick\u2019s co-workers share his view that union representation is desirable, they may acquire the rights and obligations of union representation in the federal sector through the appropriate statutory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the conclusion of the Federal Labor Relations Authority that PATCO committed unfair labor practices by striking in violation of sections 7116(b)(7)(A) and 7116(b)(7)(B) of the Civil Service Reform Act is supported by substantial evidence. We also hold that the Federal Labor Relations Authority did not abuse its discretion in denying PATCO a continuance to prepare evidence in potential mitigation of remedy, or in revoking PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status pursuant to section 7120(f). As a result, we deny PATCO\u2019s petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>view and affirm the Decision and Order of the Federal Labor Relations Authority.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-30\">. The first codification of the long-standing prohibition of federal employee strikes was in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, ch. 120, \u00a7 305, 61 Stat. 136, 160. (Prior to 1947, federal employees were expressly prohibited from striking by various appropriation acts that prohibited the expenditure of appropriated funds to pay the salaries of any striking employees. <em>See, e.g., </em>Third Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act of 1946, ch. 425, \u00a7 201, 60 Stat. 262, 268.) Congress repealed \u00a7 305 of the Labor Management Relations Act in 1955, replacing it with the predecessors to the current Code provisions.

On August 25 the Regional Director declined to issue a complaint based on PATCO\u2019s charges, concluding that the FAA had met and negotiated with the union from July 31 to August 3 and that the FAA\u2019s duty to bargain with PATCO was suspended on August 3, 1981, when the union began engaging in an unlawful strike. Jt.App. 344-47. PATCO appealed the Regional Director\u2019s decision not to issue a complaint to the FLRA General Counsel, Jt.App. 348-59, who denied the union\u2019s appeal on September 21.

It is questionable whether PATCO did, in any formal sense, make an offer of proof during the proceedings before the A.L.J. <em>See </em>note 12 <em>supra. </em>PATCO certainly did not specify the potential witnesses it sought or the testimony it would have attempted to elicit from them. Indeed, on at least two occasions during the proceeding, PATCO counsel stressed the lack of any assurance that PATCO would present any evidence in mitigation even if granted its requested continuance. See Jt.App. 174-75; note 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. PATCO further excepted to the ALJ Decision on three additional grounds: (a) that the A.L.J. erred in not consolidating the hearing with PATCO\u2019s unfair labor practice charges against the FAA; (b) that the A.L.J. failed to give reasoned consideration to PATCO\u2019s brief; and (c) that the A.L.J. may have had ex parte contacts with the FAA or with the FLRA General Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">By the time the FLRA Decision was issued, the FLRA General Counsel had decided not to issue a complaint on PATCO\u2019s refusal to bargain charges against the FAA; ground (a) was therefore effectively mooted. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>supra. </em>The FLRA also rejected arguments (b) and (c), respectively, because the ALJ Decision did address the arguments raised in PATCO\u2019s brief (despite a period of only four hours between the filing of PATCO\u2019s brief and the issuance of the ALJ Decision), and because the allegation of ex parte contacts was based only on speculation arising from the FAA and the FLRA General Counsel filing motions to limit the time for taking exceptions before the ALJ Decision had even issued.

PATCO argues that the General Counsel need not, and should not, convey information relevant to the merits of a case to the Authority Members when he seeks their approval under \u00a7 7123(d) to pursue temporary relief against an unfair labor practice. PATCO\u2019s argument misses the mark. The likelihood of success on the merits is a relevant judicial concern in granting temporary injunctive relief. In addition, the Civil Service Reform Act allows a court to order temporary relief only if the Authority establishes \u201cprobable cause that an unfair labor practice is being committed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(d) (Supp. IV 1980).

Secretary Lewis\u2019 comments on the possibility of settlement were apparently intended to remove a possible barrier to a speedy resolution of the unfair labor practice complaint. The FLRA favors the amicable settlement of labor disputes, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(a)(1)(C) (Supp. IV 1980), and Secretary Lewis may have felt that the Authority would postpone its decision if it believed the news reports that meaningful settlement negotiations were ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">PATCO argues that Secretary Lewis\u2019 statements regarding settlement possibilities are improper (i) because his statements do not fall within the exception in the FLRA Rules for \u201ccommunications proposing settlement,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.6(d) (1981), and (ii) because, even if his statements fall within the exception, the exception is in conflict with \u00a7 557(d) and therefore invalid. We need not pass upon the scope of the exception in the FLRA Rules for settlement communications or upon its validity. <em>But cf. NLRB v. Sanford Home for Adults, </em>669 F.2d 35, 37 (2d Cir. 1981) (applying identical NLRB exemption for ex parte communications regarding settlement). Like Secretary Lewis\u2019 comments relating directly to speedy consideration of the case, these comments did not taint the proceedings or prejudice PATCO. A.L.J.

Because Secretary Lewis\u2019 comments related only to the desired speed of the FLRA\u2019s disposition rather than to the merits of the case, PAT-CO is required to make a stronger showing of prejudice from that contact and any consequent acceleration of the case before the proceeding may be voided. See <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v.

Fenton\u2019s denial of a request to continue the hearing on the unfair labor practice complaint. This argument is entirely separate from any concern with the six-day difference in time to file exceptions to Chief A.L.J. Fenton\u2019s recommended decision. PATCO\u2019s principal argument on timeliness is addressed in Part 1V.C. <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b660-5\">. Mr. Shanker suggests that \u201c[s]ince there is no sanction available against <em>amici, </em>it is reasonable to assume that the <em>ex parte </em>rules are not intended to apply in these circumstances.\u201d Shanker\u2019s Brief at 14. This argument is simply a non sequitur. The principal purpose of the ex parte rules is not to punish violators, but to preserve the integrity of the administrative process. Even when a nonparty is the source of an ex parte communication, a proceeding may be voided if the decision is irrevocably tainted. In such a case, the principal purpose of the statute would be served, even though a direct sanction against the violator might be unavailable. <em>Cf. </em>S.Rep.No.354, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1975), Sunshine Act Sourcebook at 234 (inadvertent ex parte contact not a basis for sanction against a party, but nonetheless voids an irrevocably tainted proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\">.

By itself, it was not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. Member Applewhaite did not attempt to hide his dinner with Mr. Shanker from Member Frazier and Chairman Haughton or from Authority officials. Although the conversation should have been disclosed on the public record, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(d)(1)(C) (1976); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.8 (1981), Member Applewhaite was advised by Solicitor Freehling about the FLRA Rules and then concluded that public disclosure was unnecessary. <em>Findings </em>at 25-26, \u00b6\u00b6 38-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b661-13\">. In concluding that the dinner had no ultimate effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s decision, A.L.J. Vittone did not dismiss the possibility that it may have had some temporary impact. A.L.J. Vittone commented: \u201cAt the very most, the effect was transitory in nature, and occurred from September 21 to October 9.\u201d <em>Findings </em>at 49. We do not read A.L.J. Vittone\u2019s statement as a finding that there <em>was </em>a transitory effect, but only as a suggestion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>there <em>might </em>have been such an effect and as a statement that he could not confirm or deny its existence. Our independent review of the record leaves us even more dubious of a temporary impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">First, we believe that A. L.J. Vittone (who is not himself a labor lawyer) may have misunderstood the severity of the position Member Applewhaite took at the September 21 meeting of the FLRA Members. Member Applewhaite favored a revocation of PATCO\u2019s exclusive recognition status for a fixed period of one to three years. Member Frazier, on the other hand, favored an indefinite revocation. A.L.J. Vittone concluded that Member Applewhaite\u2019s position was more severe. <em>See Findings </em>at 19, 1)21. That, however, was not necessarily the case. Depending on the standards for and the likelihood of vacating an indefinite revocation, a fixed-term revocation might be either more or less severe. If indeed Member Applewhaite\u2019s position before the September 21 dinner was less severe than Member Frazier\u2019s, then Member Applewhaite\u2019s negotiations with Chairman Haughton after the dinner may not represent any fundamental change in position.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Second, A.L.J. Vittone failed to make any findings regarding a telephone conversation between FLRA Chief Counsel Klein and Member Applewhaite after the September 21 meeting and <em>before the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner. </em>According to uncontroverted testimony by both Chief Counsel Klein and Member Applewhaite, Member Applewhaite expressed some concern that he had been perceived as unduly harsh in the earlier meeting. They made arrangements to meet the next day to further discuss Member Applewhaite\u2019s position. Tr. 813-15, 1883-85. This conversation (which we have no reason to believe did not occur) suggests that Member Applewhaite\u2019s position was flexible <em>before </em>he had dinner with Mr. Shanker. Therefore, we cannot conclude that any perceived change in position after the dinner necessarily resulted from'it.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Finally, we believe that A.L.J. Vittone\u2019s failure to dismiss the possibility of a transitory effect resulted in part from his failure to credit some of Member Applewhaite\u2019s testimony when it conflicted with Member Frazier\u2019s. A.L.J. Vittone credited Member Frazier\u2019s testimony even though he did not permit an inquiry into Member Frazier\u2019s motives in commencing the FBI investigation. Under the circumstances \u2014 Member Frazier\u2019s two-week delay in initiating the investigation, Member Frazier\u2019s failure to report the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner on the public record, and Member Frazier\u2019s failure to suggest that Member Applewhaite disqualify himself \u2014 reasonable questions might have been raised about Member Frazier\u2019s motives. The answers to these questions might well have reflected on Member Frazier\u2019s credibility. While we do not conclude that Member Frazier acted improperly, we believe that A.L.J. Vittone lacked all the information relevant to his credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">In sum, we are unable to say whether the Applewhaite/Shanker dinner had even a transitory influence on Member Applewhaite\u2019s position. We cannot conclude that there was no effect, but the record evidence clearly precludes us from finding that there was such an effect either. We believe that this strengthens A.L.J. Vittone\u2019s conclusion that the dinner had no effect on the FLRA\u2019s ultimate decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\">. During oral argument, counsel for PATCO suggested that Mr. Shanker\u2019s reference to the PATCO \u201cstrike\u201d may have undercut his argument that the FLRA General Counsel had failed to prove the existence of a strike by a PATCO National union. <em>See </em>Part III.B. <em>infra. </em>We hardly believe that Mr. Shanker\u2019s single statement to Member Applewhaite in a sea of media attention to the \u201cPATCO strike\u201d prejudiced PATCO\u2019s argument. We are reinforced in this belief by our review of the evidence of a strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. As A.L.J. Vittone commented: \u201cI think we all understand that people who are appointed to these jobs are interested in being reappointed.\u201d Tr. 1554. The hearing revealed, not surprisingly, that Member Frazier had discussed the prospects for his own reappointment in 1980 with his colleagues. Tr. 1553-54, 1557-58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">. We, too, sit as judges in \u201chotly contested\u201d cases. Inevitably, our decisions are found unsatisfying to some parties and scholarly commentators. Our recognition of that fact, however, does not mean that we \u201cplay to the gallery.\u201d Rather, we apply our understanding of the law to the best of our ability. Although (to paraphrase Justice Jackson) we are neither final nor infallible, our fallibility \u2014 and the criticism that accompanies it \u2014 does not mean that we are biased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b664-5\">. Member Frazier understandably does not argue that the mere recognition of concern about reappointment is cause for disqualification. If that were the case, then all agency members (other than those who have no desire to be reappointed) would be subject to disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Member Frazier\u2019s argument that a public expression of concern about reappointment demonstrates a strong personal interest requiring disqualification might be persuasive in another context. But it is not here, where a private remark to a personal friend became public only through a special hearing ordered for entirely different reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. Similarly, whichever way he voted might affect his chances for reappointment. If he voted \u201cfor\u201d PATCO, he might be viewed harshly by the Administration; if he voted \u201cagainst\u201d PATCO, he might not receive support from organized labor that might be important to his reappointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b664-13\">. Indeed, Member Frazier\u2019s position before this court is contradicted to some extent by his statement before A.L.J. Vittone. Member Frazier testified that \u201cany discussion Member Applewhaite may have had about seeking a reappointment commitment from the Administration, if there was such a discussion, had no impact or effect upon Member Applewhaite\u2019s decision in the PATCO case.\u201d <em>Findings </em>at 34\u2014 35, U 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b664-14\">. <em>Cf. </em>Comment, <em>Administrative Bias: An Update, </em>82 Dick.L.Rev. 671, 673 (1978) (suggesting that the \u201cappearance of bias\u201d test for disqualification, instead of actual bias, is in part the result of courts\u2019 reluctance to inquire into the mental processes of decisionmakers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>124 Cong.Rec. 25,722 (1978) (remarks of Rep.

Were the section interpreted differently, it would require the General Counsel to prove a negative \u2014 that the respondent union did <em>not </em>try to prevent or stop a strike\u2014 and would also require the General Counsel to prove facts peculiarly within the control of the opposing party \u2014 what actions the respondent union did or did not take. Common sense and established principles of evidence disfavor unnecessarily placing such difficult, perhaps impossible, burdens on a party. <em>See, e.g., Allstate Fin. Corp. v. Zimmerman, </em>330 F.2d 740, 744 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b667-13\">. Because we find that PATCO was in fact aware of this strike, and thus had an affirmative obligation under the statute to attempt to stop it, we express no view as to what knowledge about members\u2019 actions may be presumed or even required. Suffice it to say that we do not believe that a veil of ignorance should be an easily assumed shield from unfair labor practice charges having to do with strike activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\">. PATCO also argues that after the mass firings of striking air traffic controllers on August 5, <em>see </em>note 7 <em>supra, </em>it was legally disabled from ending the work stoppage and hence could not be found in violation of \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(B). PAT-CO relies primarily upon <em>United States v. Professional Air Traffic Controllers Org., </em>524 F.Supp. 160 (D.D.C.1981), in which the District Court held that PATCO could not be held in contempt of its no-strike order after compliance was made impossible by the August 5 firings. We, of course, express no view at this time on the District Court decision, but even if we accept the logic of its holding, it does not avail PATCO. Even if PATCO was unable to violate \u00a7 7116(b)(7)(B) after August 5, that does not deny or rescind PATCO\u2019s violation of the section by failing to take action to prevent the strike before August 3 and by failing to take action to stop the strike between August 3 and August 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. As noted in Part I.B. <em>supra, </em>Chief A.L.J. Fenton and Member Frazier both believed that \u00a7 7120(f) granted the Authority relatively little discretion in deciding -whether to revoke a striking union\u2019s exclusive recognition status. They thought that the exercise of the Authority\u2019s discretion turned exclusively on the culpability of the union in calling the strike and the efforts of the union to end the strike once it began. Chairman Haughton and Member Applewhaite, however, took a broader view of the Authority\u2019s discretion. Haughton and Applewhaite did not enumerate all of the factors that they though relevant to deciding if revocation would be warranted, but interpreted Congress\u2019 action as leaving that decision to the Authority on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\">. PATCO, of course, would interpret \u00a7 7120(f) as granting the FLRA broad discretion to consider any number of factors in making its revocation decision. The FAA, on the other hand, suggests that Member Frazier\u2019s limited view of the Authority\u2019s discretion is preferable. The FLRA Solicitor, forced to defend a unanimous FLRA Decision stemming from divergent views of the FLRA Members, understandably avoids taking a firm stance regarding the scope of the Authority\u2019s discretion. The FLRA Solicitor nevertheless argues, in effect, that whatever the scope of the statutorily granted discretion, the FLRA properly exercised it in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\">.

In <em>Catholic Medical Center, </em>detailed evidence was accepted and findings made, but these were then excluded from consideration in the agency\u2019s decision. 589 F.2d at 1169-70.

Thus, the facts of these cases differ significantly from PATCO\u2019s general, conclusory and conditional offer of evidence in mitigation here. Finally, <em>Donnelly Garment </em>has at best limited precedential value. In the decision PATCO cites, the Eighth Circuit denied enforcement of an NLRB order.

We also note that the denial of PATCO\u2019s requested continuance did not eliminate other procedures available to PATCO to vindicate its asserted injuries. As provided for by the Civil Service Reform Act, PATCO filed unfair labor practice charges with the FLRA General Counsel alleging that the FAA had refused to bargain in good faith. See note 10 <em>supra. </em>Had the General Counsel issued a complaint against the FAA, the results of that proceeding could have been considered in mitigation of the remedy directed by the FLRA at PATCO. PATCO\u2019s charges against the FAA, however, were ultimately rejected by the General Counsel. Thus, PATCO\u2019s argument that the FAA refused to bargain in good faith was considered in full accordance with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">In addition, PATCO never sought relief for its asserted injuries before the Federal Services Impasses Panel. To the extent that PATCO\u2019s safety complaints were unresolved due to a negotiation impasse with the FAA, and to the extent that its refusal to bargain charge against the FAA stemmed from the same negotiation impasse, PATCO could have resorted to the Impasses Panel.

If we accepted Mr. Skirlick\u2019s argument, then \u00a7 7120(f) could never be applied to any union with a constitutional provision that makes continued federal employment a condition of membership.

As noted in Part II. of this opinion, we also .hold that there is no reason to vacate the FLRA Decision or to remand the case for any further proceedings due to any ex parte communications. First, we have found no ex parte communications that irrevocably tainted the Authority\u2019s decision. Second, we have concluded that the proceedings before the FLRA did not effect any procedural unfairness on any of the parties. Finally, because the ex parte contacts issue already has been fully and adequately addressed during the special evidentiary hearing before Judge Vittone, and because the <em>facts </em>of this case are free from any arguable taint, we have concluded that a remand of this case would be a futile gesture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b682-5\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvO\">concurring in part, and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">I join my colleagues in their construction of the relevant provisions of Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in their application of those statutory sections to the action of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) in this case. I also agree, on review of the extensive record compiled and the careful findings proposed by Administrative Law Judge Vittone,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the ex parte communications which sullied FLRA\u2019s handling of the case did not affect its members\u2019 ultimate decision, and therefore do not call for a remand. I thus concur in Parts I, III and IV of the court\u2019s opinion. I cannot, however, subscribe to Part II. The treatment there accorded the most conspicuous contacts and the tone pervading the discussion tend, I fear, to minify the gravity of the improprieties that occurred, and to understate the culpability of those who initiated and those who received ex parte pleas and approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">From the special hearing emerges an appalling chronicle of attorneys, high government officials,' and interested outsiders apparently without compunction about intervening in the course of FLRA\u2019s decision-making by means of private communications with those charged with resolving the case on the merits. We have an even more distressing picture of agency decisionmakers \u2014 whose role in this formal adjudication concededly approximated that of judges\u2014 seemingly ignorant of the substance of the ex parte rules, insensitive to the compromising potentialities of certain official and social contacts, and unwilling to silence peremptorily and firmly improper discussions that did transpire. Although the special hearing disclosed no such taint on the agency\u2019s ultimate decision as would require additional corrective proceedings, I feel compelled to review several of these incidents, for in my view the court\u2019s opinion administers a mild chiding where a ringing condemnation is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">I. THE APPLEWHAITE-GORDON INCIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">FLRA General Counsel H. Stephen Gordon was seated in Member Applewhaite\u2019s office discussing budgetary and other administrative matters when Ellen Stern, an attorney from the agency\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s office, brought Applewhaite a memorandum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This document, which had been prepared for the members at the request of Member Frazier, explored the scope of FLRA\u2019s discretion in imposing sanctions on a striking union of federal employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Applewhaite, Stern, and Gordon then proceeded to engage in a 15-minute conversation about the substance of this memorandum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Stern outlined her view on the statutory interpretation question and explained the conclusion she had reached.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applewhaite asked about penalties other than decertification and suggested that Stern research analogous laws in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gordon also questioned Stern about remedial alternatives,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> remarking that he \u201cwould have to make some recommendations\u201d if other remedies were possible,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and inquired whether her research had included a review of the legislative history.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Eventually, Applewhaite turned to Gordon and asked, \u201cHow do you feel about this?\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Gordon\u2019s response was a noncommittal remark that he was a lawyer and \u201ccan take any side my client wants me to take.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the time of this incident, the complaint had issued against PATCO, and Gordon\u2019s office was prosecuting the unfair labor practice charge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both Applewhaite and Gordon knew that Stern\u2019s memorandum related specifically to the PATCO case,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the remedial problem examined in that memorandum was one of the pivotal legal questions in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">There is no dispute about these facts. Nor is there any dispute that, with respect to ex parte discussions \u201crelevant to the merits\u201d of the PATCO case, Gordon\u2019s status was that of an \u201cinterested person outside the agency.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act, then, Gordon\u2019s participation in the discussion of Stern\u2019s memorandum was improper. Given this, I think it perilous too readily to dismiss the incident as \u201cinnocuous\u201d and \u201cinadvertent.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">As basis for the first characterization, the court accurately notes that (1) Gordon neither argued to nor asked questions directly of Applewhaite; (2) Applewhaite did not reveal his position; and (3) the facts of the PATCO case were not discussed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, these factors hardly reduce a prohibited ex parte contact to an indiscreet peccadillo. Patent advocacy is not the <em>sine qua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>non </em>of ex parte influence. As any experienced trial attorney well knows, a skillful disputant ofttimes can accomplish as much by artfully posing questions as by openly propounding argument. And the potential for effecting a point by subtle indirection clearly is not diminished simply because the questioner directs his queries to a third party in the room. Of no greater meliorating value is the fact that Applewhaite did not actually announce a view on the problem being discussed. Perhaps we ought take comfort that the impropriety was not as great as it might have been; still, it was great enough. The party permitted to witness an internal discussion during which the legal analysis of the decisionmaker on a key issue is evolving enjoys an obvious advantage even if he cannot discern exactly how the decisionmaker ultimately will vote. Able to observe the questions asked, the concerns expressed, and the suggestions made by the decisionmaker, the party can tailor his subsequent presentations accordingly, and so enhance their effectiveness. The third point, the apparent absence of any reference to the specific facts of the PATCO case, is the least palliative of all. Gordon testified unequivocally that he knew that the context of the discussion was the PATCO litigation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, Applewhaite\u2019s testimony reveals he was well aware that PATCO was the impetus for the memorandum.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Of what conceivable mitigation is it that the two did not make explicit what both implicitly understood?</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">This incident thus was fraught with opportunities for the kind of ex parte influence that Section 557(d) of the APA was designed to forestall. That those opportunities may not have been seized upon in this particular instance does not lessen the gravity of the departure from the statutorily-prescribed code of conduct. Nor can I accept the suggestion that Applewhaite\u2019s and Gordon\u2019s failure to observe the ex parte rules can be excused as \u201centirely inadvertent.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court\u2019s observation that \u201caccidental or passing references to a pending case do not <em>per se </em>deprive a party of a fair proceeding\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> undoubtedly is accurate as a general statement of the law. I think, however, it provides little assistance in determining whether the Applewhaite-Gordon episode irrevocably tainted FLRA\u2019s deliberations. A 15-minute discussion of the substance of a legal memorandum prepared for agency members on a critical legal issue of the case is not a mere \u201cpassing reference.\u201d And although Gordon\u2019s presence at the Stern-Applewhaite interchange may initially have been inadvertent, his remaining for and actively participating in the discussion were hardly \u201caccidental.\u201d Surely we do not mean to suggest that so long as an interested party does not <em>deliberately </em>place himself in a position to have an ex parte contact he is relieved of all responsibility promptly to terminate his involvement if circumstances take an unexpectedly improper turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">It is one of the facts of administrative life that agencies such as FLRA fulfill, often simultaneously, the several roles of investigator, prosecutor, adjudicator, and policy formulator. Undoubtedly, this commingling of functions makes it more difficult to maintain a strict separation between those personnel who, on any given case, are cast in the role of advocate from those who occupy the position of judge in the matter. Once the agency is engaged in formal adjudication, however, such a separation is mandated by the APA,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and is essential to the integrity of the administrative process. The perils of laxness on this point are well illustrated by the Applewhaite-Gordon incident. The prosecutor in an important and controversial case is permitted access to the substance of an internal legal memorandum on a pivotal issue. He hears and participates in discussion of the analysis being formulated on the question. At one point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the decisionmaker, apparently without any conception of the seriousness of what he is about to do, turns to the prosecutor and asks for the latter\u2019s opinion on the problem. Although we have accepted Judge Vittone\u2019s findings that this incident had no effect on Applewhaite\u2019s ultimate decision<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u2014 and therefore does not compel a remand \u2014 surely we ought not even intimate that we condone what happened. The conversation was not merely indiscreet or undesirable; it was, purely and simply, a prohibited ex parte contact that should never have occurred. Gordon had no business remaining in the room once he realized that PATCO was the object of discussion. Applewhaite had no business permitting him to remain, and certainly was grossly at fault in soliciting Gordon\u2019s opinion on the issue.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The ease with which prosecutors can communicate with adjudicators in the administrative setting demands a heightened degree of vigilance \u2014 a particularly keen scrupulousness \u2014 on the part of agency personnel. If administrators engaged in formal adjudicatory proceedings will not abide by this standard of care on their own initiative, then courts have no choice save to force them to adhere to it. Brushing aside departures from the standard on grounds that the lapses were the fruit of heedlessness rather than willfulness does no service to the agency or to its processes. The purity of administrative adjudication can be preserved only if the agency is made to see that such thoughtlessness is a problem, not an excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">II. SECRETARY.LEWIS\u2019 CALLS TO MEMBERS FRAZIER AND APPLEWHAITE</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">One day before Administrative Law Judge Fenton issued his decision on the merits of the unfair labor practice complaint against PATCO, Secretary of Transportation Lewis personally telephoned Member Frazier.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Secretary stated that he was not calling about the \u201csubstance\u201d of the PATCO case;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> rather, according to Frazier, Secretary Lewis said he wanted to make \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that no meaningful efforts to settle the strike were taking place.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He also expressed the desire of the Department of Transportation for expeditious handling of the matter.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Frazier responded, \u201cI understand your position perfectly, Mr. Secretary.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Hearing that Secretary Lewis intended to call Member Applewhaite as well, Frazier offered to convey the message to his colleague. The Secretary responded, however, that he would make the call himself.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Frazier then alert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ed Applewhaite of the Secretary\u2019s imminent communication.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Frazier also notified the agency\u2019s Solicitor of the call he had received; <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> after discussion, these two concluded that the contact fell within the status request<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and settlement proposal exceptions <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> to FLRA\u2019s ex parte rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">On being informed that the Secretary of Transportation might telephone to express an interest in expedition, Applewhaite asked his executive assistant to find the FLRA regulation governing briefing schedules and time limits in the appeals process.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Secretary Lewis did indeed call Applewhaite. The Secretary stated his awareness that FLRA had a backlog of cases, emphasized that PATCO was a very important case, and reiterated that \u201cwe do not want to delay it in its decision.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Applewhaite, who by this time had been given the pertinent regulation, explained that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would have to file a written request in order to obtain expeditious treatment.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Secretary Lewis said he was unaware of that requirement and made known his intent to contact FAA\u2019s General Counsel immediately.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Within hours,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> FAA moved to reduce the time for filing exceptions to the administrative law judge\u2019s decision from the usual 25 days to seven days. Ultimately, FLRA\u2019s members voted to reduce the period to 19 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">The testimony of Frazier and Applewhaite confirms that Secretary Lewis\u2019 calls were highly unusual. Both stated that they had never before been contacted by a Cabinet member on a pending case.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Applewhaite also explained that persons seeking status information normally contact the staff in lieu of discussing such matters directly with the members.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Judge Vittone obviously gave careful scrutiny to the incident but was unable to determine exactly what part the Secretary\u2019s calls played in Frazier\u2019s and Applewhaite\u2019s votes to reduce the filing periods in this case.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">I find these calls exceedingly troubling; equally disturbing is the lingering uncertainty as to how much influence they exert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ed on the voting to expedite the case.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> I concur, however, in the court\u2019s conclusion that a remand is unnecessary. PATCO has not shown that it was prejudiced by FLRA\u2019s decision to shorten the normal response period by six days. It has failed to disclose, either to the agency or to this court, any evidence it would have adduced or any arguments it would have tendered that could not have been brought forth in the time provided. Accordingly, it has not shown any purpose that would be served by a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">That, in my view, is not quite the end of the matter, however. Serious questions remain about the propriety of the Secretary\u2019s actions. The legislative history of the Government in the Sunshine Act makes clear that Congress, in defining the contacts proscribed in adjudicative proceedings, consciously chose the phrase \u201ccommunication relevant to the merits\u201d to denote a concept broader than simply a communication bearing on \u201cfact[s] in issue.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> With respect to FAA\u2019s attempt to have the PATCO matter handled more expeditiously than normal, the Secretary\u2019s insistence that the case was very important to the Government, and therefore needed to be dealt with rapidly, was a communication on the merits of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Agencies, like courts, promulgate rules of practice to assist outsiders in communicating in proper fashion with decisionmakers. These channels are quite adequate to accommodate any information that legitimately could be sought from or provided to those who will judge the case.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> For a high government officer to bypass established procedures and approach, directly and privately, members of an independent decisionmaking body about a case in which he has an official interest and on which they will be called to rule suggests, at the minimum, a deplorable indifference toward safeguarding the purity of the formal adjudicatory process. Regardless of the officer\u2019s actual intent, such a call could be felt by the recipient as political pressure; regardless of its actual effect, such a call could be perceived by the public as political pressure. Either way, the integrity of the process is dealt a sore blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">III. THE LOVELL-HAUGHTON INCIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The special hearing revealed another contact which, though admittedly brief, presents, to my mind, improprieties similar to those latent in Secretary Lewis\u2019 calls. Malcolm Lovell is the Undersecretary of Labor. One or two days before FLRA announced its decision, Lovell called Chairman Haughton, whom he knows socially and professionally, and enquired when the decision would issue.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> After Haughton replied that he hoped the opinion would be forthcoming very soon, Lovell said, \u201cI hope there won\u2019t be anything embarrassing in it.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Haughton responded, \u201cWell, I may be dissenting.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Because of Lovell\u2019s final remark, his call cannot be relegated to the realm of the inoffensive status inquiry. The legislative history of the Government in the Sunshine Act warns against purported status requests that \u201cin effect amount to an indirect or subtle effort to influence the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>outcome of the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Not even indirect or subtle is a statement by the Undersecretary of Labor informing the Chairman of FLRA that he is anxious not only about when the agency\u2019s decision will issue but also about whether it will contain anything \u201cembarrassing.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> While 30 years\u2019 acquaintance<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> readily explains why Haughton took the call, it hardly affords license for the impropriety that ensued. I accept Judge Vittone\u2019s finding that this incident had no influence on the vote ultimately cast,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> especially in view of the evidence indicating that Haughton\u2019s position had essentially solidified before he spoke with Lovell.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> If, however, executive officials indeed have no more respect for the inviolability of the formal adjudicatory functions of independent agencies than has been exhibited in this case, then the designation \u201cindependent\u201d is in grave danger of becoming an empty title.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">IV. THE APPLEWHAITE-SHANKER DINNER</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On September 21 \u2014 when the administrative law judge\u2019s decertification recommendation was under submission to FLRA, and the members were intensely engaged in attempting resolution of the important and difficult questions presented \u2014 Albert Shanker extended, and Member Applewhaite accepted, an invitation to dinner. Shanker is the President of the American Federation of Teachers and a member of the Executive Board of amicus curiae AFL-CIO; his strong opposition to decertification of PATCO had been well-publicized.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The last 15 minutes of their dinner were deliberately utilized by Shanker as the opportunity to advocate his view of the merits of the PATCO case in an effort to persuade Applewhaite to vote favorably to Shanker\u2019s position.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> At no time did Applewhaite attempt to put a stop to Shanker\u2019s ex parte inducements.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">I pause only briefly over Shanker\u2019s conduct. His deliberate crusade to sway through private importunity the decision of one acting as judge in a pending case is so far beyond the pale of legally tolerable activity that even the most caustic criticism could not overstate the magnitude of the impropriety. Suffice it to say, I join in the court\u2019s conclusion that Shanker was, beyond cavil, an interested party, and in its condemnation of his behavior as an egregious violation of the APA. Far more necessitous of extended comment, in my view, is the conduct of Member Applewhaite. This court should not hesitate to allocate blame squarely where it belongs: at the doorstep of one acting as a judicial officer who, with a solemn responsibility to preserve both the fact and appearance of complete impartiality, first subjected himself to a palpable risk of contamination, and then made no effort to arrest forbidden advocacy when it came.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">I cannot accede to the assertion that, by itself, a private dinner engagement between Applewhaite and Shanker was not improper.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> I would have thought it unnecessary this late in the day to defend the precept that one who judges should avoid even the appearance of impropriety.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Shanker was a prominent labor official who had been vocal in his partisanship of PAT-CO\u2019s cause;<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> moreover, the powerful labor organization on whose Executive Board he sat was amicus curiae in the case. Can the public really be expected to believe in the fairness and neutrality of the agency\u2019s formal adjudicatory processes when one of its decisionmakers permits an outspoken, highly visible official of a participating union to wine and dine him during deliberations on the ease?<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">My brethren find justification for Applewhaite\u2019s assent to Shanker\u2019s invitation by observing that a judge must have friends.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> It seems to me that gratification of personal inclination is a sorry reason for one acting in a quasi-judicial capacity to place himself in a position where his conduct could spark adverse public comment. One given the power to render decisions in formal adjudicatory proceedings is accorded the highest of honors and dealt the gravest of responsibilities; those who take on this judicial role may no longer participate in the daily intercourse of life as freely as do others. They have a duty to the judicial system in which they have accepted membership fastidiously to safeguard their integrity \u2014 at the expense, if need be, of \u201cneighbors, friends and acquaintances, business and social relations.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> This <em>is </em>their \u201cpart\u201d in their \u201cday and generation,\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> and one who is unwilling to make the sacrifice is unsuited to the office.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Going beyond questions about the propriety of Applewhaite\u2019s agreement to dine privately with Shanker during the critical deliberative phase of the case, there can be no doubt that their after-dinner discussion of the merits of decertifying PATCO violated the express prohibition of Section 557(d) of the APA. Applewhaite\u2019s failure to \u201csteer the conversation away from PATCO\u201d thus was far more than a mere \u201cindiscretion.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The moment that Shanker broached the topic of public employee strikes, Applewhaite should have enjoined conversation on that score. While it might be possible to attribute Applewhaite\u2019s actions in placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>himself in a compromising position to thoughtless imprudence, his unprotesting submission to blatant ex parte advocacy on the merits of a case then pending before the members defies explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Judge Vittone determined,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and all parties substantially agree, that the Shanker dinner had no impact on Applewhaite\u2019s ultimate vote.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court concludes, and I agree, that a remand is unnecessary. This cannot obscure the fact, however, that Applewhaite disregarded his statutory obligation to abjure discussions on the merits of the PATCO case with an interested party.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Such remissness on the part of a powerful and highly-placed administrator deserves, by my estimate, a harsher verdict from this court than \u201cunfortunate.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We are unanimous in our acceptance of Judge Vittone\u2019s several determinations that none of the above-described contacts tainted FLRA\u2019s final decision.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> I fear, however, that in announcing that we find no reason to send this case back, the court\u2019s opinion comes perilously close to intimating that we discover nothing seriously wrong. Such suggestion, in my view, would be a gross mischaracterization. The record before us may be free of instances of sensational wrongdoing, but it is filled with a pattern of insidious lapses. The casualness with which interested persons privately approached decisionmakers engaged in formal adjudication; the thoughtlessness with which the decisionmakers exposed themselves to such approaches and permitted them to proceed unchecked; the ignorance of, and unconcern for, the principles that underlie the ex parte rules \u2014 all these things signal something fundamentally awry.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">The laxness with which FLRA protected the integrity of its adjudicatory processes in this case ought be a matter of deep concern for this court, which routinely is asked to accord substantial deference to the decisions rendered by the agency on questions of considerable import to federal employees. It ought be a matter of even deeper concern to the agency itself. FLRA will have the respect of the public only when its person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>nel have sufficient respect for their especial mission to rebuff any attempt to influence or corrupt it. Ultimately, an agency must be the guardian of its own honor. If it permits interested persons to show contempt for its formal adjudicatory processes by the subversion of ex parte pleas and approaches, then those processes will indeed become contemptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">RECOMMENDED FINDINGS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE JOHN M. VITTONE</p>\n<p id=\"AMr\">On February 16, 1982, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the nature, extent, source, and effect of any and all ex <em>parte </em>contacts and other approaches that may have been made to any member or members of the Authority while the appeal from the decision of the Administrative Law Judge in Case No. 3-CO-105 was pending before the Authority. The Court\u2019s action was caused by the filing of a Declaration with the Court by J. Paul McGrath, Assistant Attorney General, on December 2, 1981, which described an inquiry by the Department of Justice into the FLRA PAT-CO proceeding. Further, the Court of Appeals ordered the Authority to obtain through the Office of Personnel Management an administrative law judge from a neutral agency to conduct the evidentiary hearing. The Court also ordered the administrative law judge to permit all parties to Case No. 3-CO-105, the Authority and any member thereof, all persons alleged to have contacted any member of the Authority while Case No. 3-CO-105 was pending, and any other person the administrative law judge considers to have an interest in the matter, to participate fully in the hearing, to present evidence, and to recommend findings. Finally, the Court ordered the administrative law judge to transmit to the Court on or before March 19, 1982, the entire file, including the record of the proceeding, the participants\u2019 recommended findings, and the recommended findings of the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">On February 19, 1982, the undersigned administrative law judge was selected by the Office of Personnel Management to preside over the hearing ordered by the Court of Appeals. A prehearing conference was scheduled for and held on February 26, 1982. Appearances were entered for FLRA Chairman Ronald Haughton, FLRA Member Henry B. Frazier, III, FLRA Member Leon Applewhaite, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), Anthony Skirlick <em>pro se </em>(a working controller), and a group of working controllers.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">After hearing argument from all parties, it was decided that the latter three participants lacked sufficient interest in the subject matter of this proceeding to justify full party status. However, AFGE, Mr. Skirlick, and the group of working controllers were granted <em>amicus </em>status, and were given the opportunity to submit recommended findings at the close of the hearings before the administrative law judge. (Transcript, hereinafter Tr. 37-39)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">During the conference, it was also decided that the documents under seal with the Court of Appeals were necessary for a full and complete airing of the ex <em>parte </em>issues and the FAA was ordered to request the Court of Appeals to unseal those documents. On February 26, the Court of Appeals unsealed eight documents and these documents were transmitted to all parties.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Various requests for evidence and witnesses submitted by PATCO were also discussed, and the parties were granted the opportunity to file objections to those requests by March 1. Responses to PATCO\u2019s requests were submitted by Chairman Haughton, Members Applewhaite and Frazier, the FLRA, the FAA and Robert J. Freehling. The PATCO requests were ruled upon in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the undersigned\u2019s order of March 2, 1982 and at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The hearing in this proceeding commenced on March 4, 1982. At the outset of the hearing, Mr. Albert Shanker, through counsel, moved to intervene in this proceeding and this request was granted. At that time, the group of working controllers renewed its motion to fully participate as a party to the proceeding and this request was again denied. (Tr. 191-192) <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Hearings were held from March 4 through March 17. The focus of the hearings was on the period August 3 to November 3, 1981, the period of time that the PATCO case was pending at the FLRA. During this time testimony was received from the following individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">FLRA Member Henry B. Frazier, III;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">Anthony J.

On March 11, the undersigned filed a request, on behalf of all the parties, that the March 19 date be extended until March 26. The Court of Appeals granted this request on March 16, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-22\">At the close of the hearing on March 17, 1982, a procedural schedule was established which required that the parties and the <em>amicus </em>parties submit their recommended findings by the close of business on March 25. Pursuant to that order findings were submitted by Chairman Haughton, Members Applewhaite and Frazier, Albert Shanker, PATCO, the FLRA and the FAA. The undersigned\u2019s recommended findings now follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-23\">I BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b692-24\">1. The Federal Labor Relations Authority is composed of three presidentially appointed Members, and administers the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104, 7105 (Supp. Ill 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-25\">2. The case of <em>Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) and Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, </em>FLRA Case No. 3-CO-105 [hereinafter <em>PATCO], </em>was instituted on August 3, 1981, when FAA filed with the General Counsel of the Authority (who has independent investigatory and prosecutorial authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(f) (Supp. Ill 1979), an unfair labor practice charge, alleging that PATCO was engaging in a strike in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7) (Supp. Ill 1979). (Tr. 1639-40)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-26\">3. The Authority\u2019s General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint against PATCO, based upon the charge filed by FAA, on August 3. The case was heard before an Administrative Law Judge of the FLRA on August 10 and 11, 1981. The judge issued his decision on August 14, 1981, and the case was thereupon transmitted to the Authority. (Tr. 222, 1639-41, 2047-48)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-27\">4. The oral argument held by the Members of the Authority in the <em>PATCO </em>case on September 16, 1981, was the first oral argument ever held by the Members in an unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>labor practice case, and was the second oral argument ever held by the Members since the establishment of the Authority. (Tr. 232, 282)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">II MEETING BETWEEN MEMBER AP-PLEWHAITE AND H. STEPHAN GORDON, FLRA GENERAL COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">1. Mr. H. Stephan Gordon was at all relevant times the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The FLRA General Counsel was responsible for the prosecution of the unfair labor practice complaint which was issued on August 3, 1981. (Tr. 2333; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104) Under the FLRA regulations concerning <em>ex parte </em>communications, the General Counsel is deemed to be an interested person outside the agency in an unfair labor practice proceeding. (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.3)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">2. On or about August 10, 1981, Mr. Gordon and Member Applewhaite were in Member Applewhaite\u2019s office discussing administrative issues unrelated to the PATCO case. (Tr. 809, 812, 836, 837, 1575, 2345) During that discussion, Ms. Ellen Stern, an attorney with the FLRA Solicitor\u2019s office, entered Member Applewhaite\u2019s office and delivered a memorandum entitled \u201cDecertification of Labor Organization Participating in the Conduct of a Strike in Violation of Section 7116(b)(7) of the Statute\u201d which was prepared at the request of Member Frazier. (Tr. 607-608, 809, 836-38, 1575, 2344; Frazier Exh. 16)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">3. The Solicitor\u2019s office is the general legal advisor of the FLRA, including the Members. In addition, the Solicitor represents the Authority and the General Counsel in various kinds of court actions. (Tr. 662-64, 837)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">4. Ms. Stern proceeded to discuss her memorandum, which dealt with whether decertification of a labor organization participating in a strike is mandatory or discretionary under the statute, and assuming it is discretionary, what other appropriate disciplinary action may be taken. (Tr. 809-811; Frazier Exh. 16)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">5. Mr. Gordon remained in Member Applewhaite\u2019s office during the discussion. (Tr. 809, 811)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">6. Member Applewhaite admitted in his testimony that he probably should have asked Mr. Gordon to leave when Ms. Stern came in to discuss the memorandum. (Tr. 838)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">7. Mr. Gordon asked Ms. Stern whether other remedies were available and whether she had looked at the legislative history. (Tr. 838, 2345)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">8. Mr. Gordon did not ask Member Applewhaite any questions. (Tr. 811, 838, 1576-1577, 2344-46)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">9. Member Applewhaite suggested that Ms. Stern do research on the availability of other remedies, and she agreed. (Tr. 809-10, 838)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">10. Mr. Gordon did not suggest to Member Applewhaite how Applewhaite should decide the PATCO case or make any argument to Member Applewhaite or Ms. Stern. (Tr. 811, 839)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">11. The discussion lasted 10-15 minutes. (Tr. 839, 2345)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">12. The discussion concerned the interpretation of the statute, and neither Ms. Stern nor Member Applewhaite indicated any opinion on this subject. (Tr. 2344)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">13. This discussion was within the context of the PATCO case. (Tr. 2346)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">14. When Member Applewhaite asked Mr. Gordon for his opinion, Gordon replied: \u201cI am a lawyer and I can take any side my client wants me to take. I don\u2019t know which side anybody is on on this\u201d and that was the end of the conversation. (Tr. 2346)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">15. The conversation had no effect or impact on Member Applewhaite\u2019s ultimate decision in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-21\">16. Because of the General Counsel\u2019s position in the PATCO case, this conversation may have violated section 2414.2 of the FLRA\u2019s regulations concerning <em>ex parte </em>communications. (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.2)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-22\">III ANDREW L. LEWIS, JR.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-23\">1. Andrew L. Lewis, Jr. is the Secretary of Transportation. (Tr. 258)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>2. On August 13, 1981, at 9:15 a.m., Secretary Lewis telephoned Member Frazier. (Tr. 258, see PATCO Exh. 3, entry for August 13, 1981)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">3. Secretary Lewis stated to Member Frazier that he was not calling about the substance of the PATCO case. (Tr. 258)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">4. Secretary Lewis said he wanted the position of the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration on the rumors concerning possible settlement efforts of the PATCO strike in the press or the media made clear. (Tr. 258-59) Secretary Lewis wanted Member Frazier to understand that there was no meaningful settlement effort taking place, as far as he was concerned, to settle the strike. (Id.) Secretary Lewis said that the reports one might hear on television or on the radio or read in the newspapers to the contrary, as far as he was concerned, were not true. (Id.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">5. Member Frazier was aware of those reports. (Tr. 331)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">6. Secretary Lewis also stated that the Department of Transportation would appreciate expeditious processing of the case in accordance with the rules of the FLRA when the administrative law judge had issued his recommended decision and order. (Tr. 259)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">7. Member Frazier replied, \u201cI understand your position perfectly, Mr. Secretary,\u201d because his response was intended to be short. He did not wish to discuss the PATCO case or its merits with Secretary Lewis. (Tr. 259, 413-14)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">8. Member Frazier did not understand Secretary Lewis\u2019 call to ask that the case be handled faster than the rules permit. (Tr. 600)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">9. Secretary Lewis indicated that he had been advised by his staff to call Member Applewhaite also, whom he understood was available in Washington, D. C., at that time. (Tr. 259) Member Frazier confirmed that Member Applewhaite was available in Washington and that as far as Member Frazier knew the Chairman was not available in Washington on that date. (Id; <em>see </em>346)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">10. Member Frazier asked Secretary Lewis if the Secretary wanted Member Frazier to convey the Secretary\u2019s message to Member Applewhaite or whether he wanted to call Member Applewhaite himself. Secretary Lewis stated that he would call Member Applewhaite himself. (Tr. 259)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">11. The conversation between Secretary Lewis and Member Frazier lasted two or three minutes. (Tr. 347, 409)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">12. Member Frazier had never received a call from a Cabinet level official prior to Secretary Lewis\u2019s call, and he perceived such contact as unusual. (Tr. 330)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">13. Member Frazier discussed Secretary Lewis\u2019 telephone call with FLRA Solicitor Robert Freehling. (Tr. 449) Member Frazier described the Secretary\u2019s call to Solicitor Freehling as relating to status and settlement. (Tr. 674) Solicitor Freehling advised Member Frazier that the communication from Secretary Lewis did not fall with the <em>ex parte </em>prohibitions in the FLRA regulations. (Tr. 676)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">14. Member Frazier has never met Secretary Lewis. (Tr. 348)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">15. Member Frazier did not believe that Secretary Lewis was trying to put pressure on him (Tr. 261) .</p>\n<p id=\"b694-19\">16. On August 13,1981, soon after Member Frazier\u2019s conversation with Secretary Lewis, Member Applewhaite was advised upon arriving at his office by Frazier that Lewis had called Frazier. (Tr. 727)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-20\">17. Member Frazier told Member Applewhaite that he had given Secretary Lewis Member Applewhaite\u2019s telephone number and described the conversation he had had with Secretary Lewis. (Tr. 727)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">18. Member Applewhaite then advised his executive assistant, Pamela Johnson, that he was expecting a call from Secretary Lewis and requested that she locate the FLRA regulation regarding time limits for processing an appeal from an administrative law judge\u2019s decision. (Tr. 728)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-22\">19. Ms. Johnson found the provision pri- or to Secretary Lewis calling. (Tr. 728)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>20. Secretary Lewis called Member Applewhaite shortly thereafter. (Tr. 729)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">21. Secretary Lewis began the telephone conversation by saying that he was aware that the FLRA had a backlog of cases, but that the PATCO case was very important and stated his concern that the decision not be delayed. (Tr. 729).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">22. At that point in the conversation, Member Applewhaite interrupted the Secretary to inform him that if he wished to obtain expedited handling of the case, he must comply with the FLRA\u2019s Rules and Regulations. Member Applewhaite then cited the applicable section of the FLRA Rules which require a written request for such action. (Tr. 729)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">23. Secretary Lewis stated that he was unaware that papers had to be filed on this matter. (Tr. 729) Member Applewhaite told Secretary Lewis that if papers were not filed, the matter would be handled in its normal course. (I'd) Secretary Lewis stated he would contact his General Counsel right away. (Id)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">24. Member Applewhaite and Secretary Lewis did not discuss any other procedural matters or subjects. (Tr. 729, 874-75,1021)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">25. The conversation lasted 1-2 minutes. (Tr. 730)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">26. Member Applewhaite had never received a call from a Cabinet level official prior to Mr. Lewis\u2019 call and he perceived such contact as unusual. (Tr. 860)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">27. On August 13,1981, at 2:19 p.m., the FAA filed a Motion to Modify Time Limits for Filing Exceptions which requested that the time limit be reduced to seven days from the usual 25 days. (Tr. 1719, PATCO Exh. 4(b))</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">28. On the afternoon of August 13,1981, FLRA Chief Counsel Paul Klein received a telephone call from FLRA Solicitor Robert Freehling indicating that he had received the FAA\u2019s Motion to Modify, and that he wanted Mr. Klein to review a proposed draft order concerning time limits for filing exceptions. (Tr. 2046, 2050, 2061)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">29. Mr. Klein received copies of the draft order prepared by Mr. Freehling that same afternoon. (Tr. 1906-1908; PATCO Exhs. 9, 10)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">30. On August 14, 1981, the FLRA General Counsel filed a Motion to Modify Time Limits for Filing Exceptions which requested the time limit be reduced to no more than seven days. (PATCO Exh. 4(c))</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">31. On August 17,1981, PATCO filed an Opposition to Motions to Limit Exceptions Filing Time and Motion to Extend Such Time which requested that the time limit be extended to 60 days. (PATCO Exh. 4(d); <em>see </em>PATCO Exh. 4(a))</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">32. At a meeting held on August 18, 1981, in Member Frazier\u2019s office, the Members considered the three pending motions, denied all three motions, and decided instead to reduce the 25-day time period prescribed by the FLRA\u2019s Rules of Practice to 19 days. (Tr. 1642-43; <em>see </em>PATCO Exh. 4(a))</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">33. At the time of the vote on August 18, modifying the time for filing exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision, Chairman Haughton did not know that Secretary Lewis had communicated with either of the two other Members. (Tr. 1673 I-J)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">34. Secretary Lewis\u2019 call to Member Applewhaite may have led to the FAA\u2019s filing of a motion to reduce the time period for filing exceptions to the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-22\">35. Secretary Lewis\u2019 call had an undetermined effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s and Member Frazier\u2019s decision to reduce the time period for filing exceptions to the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">36. Secretary Lewis\u2019 call had no effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s or Member Frazier\u2019s ultimate decision on the merits of the PATCO ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-24\">IY THE SHANKER-APPLEWHAITE DINNER AND THE FLRA DECISIONAL PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"ApA\">In the McGrath Declaration, it is reported that Member Applewhaite had dinner with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>a well-known labor leader during the pend-ency of the PATCO case before the FLRA. At this dinner, it was alleged, the labor leader told Member Applewhaite that if he voted to revoke PATCO\u2019s certification, Applewhaite would be unable to obtain employment in the labor field when his FLRA appointment expires. After this dinner, it was alleged that Member Applewhaite\u2019s position on revoking PATCO\u2019s certification began to change. (McGrath Declaration at 4, <em>see </em>also ALJ Ex. 7) The following findings concern the Applewhaite dinner with the labor leader and the changes in Member Applewhaite\u2019s position following the dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">A. THE SHANKER-APPLEWHAITE DINNER</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">1. Albert Shanker has served since 1974 as President of the American Federation of Teachers (\u201cAFT\u201d), AFL-CIO, and since 1964, as President of the AFT\u2019s New York City local, the United Federation of Teachers. (Tr. 1387) As President of the AFT, Mr. Shanker is also a member of the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO. (Tr. 1418)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">2. Through various contacts, Mr. Shank-er and Member Applewhaite have become professional and social friends. (Tr. 1419-20, 735) For example, while Mr. Applewhaite was associated with the New York Public Employment Relations Board, he served as a mediator in disputes involving affiliates of the AFT. (Tr. 1391-92) In addition, both men have attended and met at a number of labor-management relations conferences. (Tr. 1391)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">3. From August 3, 1981 through September 21, 1981, Mr. Shanker and his union made a series of widely publicized public statements in support of PATCO. (Tr. 1397-1403) The AFT urged the public not to fly and directed its own staff not to fly except in cases of emergency. The AFT also contributed money to a PATCO fund. (Tr. 1398)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">4. Mr. Shanker urged repeatedly in public statements that disproportionately severe punishment not be inflicted on PATCO for engaging in its strike. (Tr. 1399-1400) Mr. Shanker spoke to various groups \u2014 including a PATCO rally and an address to teachers \u2014 on this subject almost every day. (Tr. 1399) He was interviewed about the PATCO strike on a nationally televised news program. (Tr. 1401) Throughout this period, Mr. Shanker reiterated the view that punishment for illegal strikes by public employees should be designed to bring about settlements or deter future illegal activities, but should not destroy the union or the collective bargaining process. (Tr. 1399-1400)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">5. Beginning in 1969, Mr. Shanker has authored an opinion column that appears every Sunday in <em>The New York Times </em>in space purchased by the AFT. (Tr. 1401) Since August 3, 1981, Mr. Shanker has published a number of columns discussing the PATCO situation. (Frazier Exhibits 18A-18E)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">6. On August 16,1981, Mr. Shanker published a column in <em>The New York Times </em>discussing the federal government\u2019s reaction to the PATCO strike. (Shanker Exhibit 3, <em>see </em>also Frazier Exh. 18(a) through (e)) In this column Mr. Shanker reported that the federal government was refusing to negotiate with PATCO; that heavy fines had been levied against PATCO; and that the government was taking legal action to have PATCO\u2019s status as an exclusive bargaining agent revoked. In the column Mr. Shanker expressed the view that revocation of PAT-CO\u2019s status would be an exceptionally severe punishment. (Tr. 1403)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">7. On September 16, 1981, the Authority heard oral argument on PATCO\u2019s appeal from the adverse decision of an administrative law judge. The AFL-CIO appeared as <em>amicus curiae. </em>Mr. Shanker was not aware of the AFL-CIO\u2019s participation as <em>amicus curiae </em>in the PATCO proceeding. (Tr. 1418-19) Mr. Applewhaite was aware of the AFL-CIO\u2019s participation in the PATCO case and of Mr. Shanker\u2019s position with the AFL-CIO. (Tr. 909)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">8. Mr. Shanker was in Washington, D. C. on September 19, 1981, to participate in the Solidarity Day rally. (Tr. 1388; Frazier Exhibit 18A) Mr. Shanker remained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Washington, D. C. during the week of September 20, 1981 in order to attend to a number of business matters. (Tr. 1388-89) Around mid-day on September 21, Mr. Shanker asked his secretary to arrange a dinner appointment with Member Applewhaite that evening. (Tr. 1389-90)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">9. Mr. Shanker wanted to have dinner with Member Applewhaite because he felt very strongly about the PATCO case, and very much desired that a settlement be reached between the parties. He wanted to communicate directly to Member Applewhaite sentiments he had previously expressed in public statements. (Tr. 1421; <em>see </em>Shanker Ex. 3; <em>see </em>also Frazier Ex. 18a through e)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">10. On the afternoon of September' 21, arrangements were concluded for Mr. Shanker to meet Member Applewhaite for dinner at Harvey\u2019s, a restaurant in the District of Columbia selected by Member Applewhaite. (Tr. 1338, 1393) On that same afternoon, September 21, the members of the Authority met to discuss their positions on the PATCO case. (Tr. 229) Member Applewhaite informed Chairman Haughton and Mr. Frazier that Mr. Shanker had called and that Shanker and Applewhaite would be meeting for dinner. (Tr. 736, 1650)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">11. Member Applewhaite and Mr. Shanker met at Harvey\u2019s about 6:30 p. m. (Tr. 1393, 739) They talked for about an hour and a half. (Tr. 1394, 739) Mr. Shank-er paid for the dinner. (Tr. 1394) Most of the dinner conversation concerned general topics, such as the Solidarity Day rally and the tuition tax credit referendum to be held in the District of Columbia. (Tr. 1394-96, 741)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">12. Near the end of the dinner, Member Applewhaite and Mr. Shanker discussed public employee strikes and the PATCO strike for about fifteen minutes. (Tr. 1396, 1406) At no time during the conversation did Member Applewhaite indicate in any way that he believed it improper for him to discuss the issues surrounding the PATCO case with Mr. Shanker. (Tr. 1459)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">13. The two men discussed various local approaches to strikes by public employees, including the requirements of the Pennsylvania and New York laws concerning strikes by government employees. (Tr. 1403-04, 742, 908) Mr. Shanker said that he had visited England after a strike of firefighters and was surprised that the strike had generated little resentment toward unions. (Tr. 1404)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">14. Mr. Shanker said that he understood that illegal strikes had to be punished, but he stated his view that the punishment should fit the crime. (Tr. 1405, 1423) He also expressed the view that the revocation of certification as punishment for an illegal strike would be tantamount to \u201ckilling a union.\u201d (Tr. 906-07) Mr. Shanker\u2019s comment was a repetition of views that Member Applewhaite had heard in the media and that Applewhaite knew to be the position of organized labor. (Tr. 1036, 1038)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">15. Member Applewhaite observed, in closing the conversation, that he was concerned about his prospects for reappointment in July 1982. (Tr. 1407, 744) Mr. Shanker testified that he jokingly said that he could not help secure reappointment because he had no contacts in the White House. (Tr. 1407) Member Applewhaite said that because the PATCO case was hotly contested, he would be viewed with disfavor by whichever side he voted against. (Tr. 1407,1414) Mr. Shanker then said that Applewhaite had no commitments from anyone. (Tr. 1408, 1427, 1460, 744, 904, 1040) Mr. Shanker urged Applewhaite to vote without regard to personal considerations. (Tr. 1408, 1427, 1460) After these remarks the conversation ended, the two men left the restaurant, and parted. (Tr. 1408)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">16. Mr. Shanker did not say to Member Applewhaite, in words or substance, \u201cIf you vote to revoke the certification of PATCO, you won\u2019t be able to get cases as an arbitrator if and when you leave your position in the federal government.\u201d (Tr. 1408, 1409, 744 \u2014 45) Mr. Shanker did not tell Applewhaite, in words or substance, that Mr. Shanker was speaking \u201cfor top AFL-CIO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>officials.\u201d (Tr. 1409, 745) Mr. Shanker did not tell Member Applewhaite that Applewhaite would need labor support in order to be reappointed. (Tr. 1450) Mr. Shanker did not in any way threaten Member Applewhaite during their meeting of September 21. (Tr. 1409, 744-45, 754, 758) Mr. Shank-er did not make any promises of any kind to Member Applewhaite during their dinner of September 21. (Tr. 1409, 754, 758)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">17. Mr. Shanker did not offer Member Applewhaite anything of value during the dinner of September 21. (Tr. 1409-10) When Mr. Shanker left Member Applewhaite on September 21, Mr. Shanker did not know how Applewhaite would vote. (Tr. 1427)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">18. During the period from August 3, 1981 through November 3,1981, Mr. Shank-er did not discuss the PATCO case with either Chairman Haughton or Member Frazier. (Tr. 1432, 1450)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">B. THE- SEPTEMBER 21 MEETING OF THE MEMBERS</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">19. Prior to the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner on the evening of September 21, the members of the FLRA met for the first time that day to express formally their respective positions on the PATCO case. The meeting took place in Member Frazier\u2019s office at approximately 2:30 p. m. In addition to the members, Robert Freehling, FLRA Solicitor, and Paul Klein, Chief Counsel of the FLRA, attended the meeting. (Tr. 223, 228, 798, 1646, 1882-83)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">20. Messrs. Haughton, Applewhaite and Frazier were in agreement that they should find that PATCO had engaged in a strike and thereby had committed an unfair labor practice (Tr. 228-230, 1954-56, 907, 1646-47) As to the remedy on the case, Frazier took the position that the exclusive recognition of PATCO should be revoked (Tr. 229, 1646); that PATCO would no longer be a labor organization within the meaning of the statute (Tr. 229, 1647); and that it was unnecessary at that time to pass on the question of whether at some future time PATCO could qualify as a labor organization. (Tr. 229)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">21. Member Applewhaite also took the position in the meeting on September 21 that the exclusive recognition of PATCO should be revoked, (Tr. 229-30, 1647, 1955-1956; Frazier Exhibit 17;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Frazier Exhibit 26) Member Applewhaite also took the position that PATCO would no longer be a labor organization within the meaning of the Statute. (Tr. 229, 1647) However, Member Applewhaite did not believe that revocation was a severe enough penalty, and suggested that PATCO be barred for a specified period of time (1 to 3 years) from seeking to requalify as a labor organization and therefore seeking to reacquire exclusive recognition for that period of time. (Tr. 229-30, 1647, 1955-56, 813)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">22. Mr. Haughton agreed with the other members that an unfair labor practice had been committed and that PATCO was not a labor organization at that time. However, he favored a suspension, not revocation, of PATCO\u2019s collective bargaining status. (Tr. 1647-48)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">C. CHANGES IN APPLEWHAITE\u2019S POSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">23. About 10:00 or 10:30 p. m., on September 21, Chairman Haughton was awakened by a telephone call from Member Applewhaite, who immediately began discussing PATCO. He discussed an approach which was designed to achieve reinstatement of the fired air traffic controllers. It was Haughton\u2019s understanding that Applewhaite was considering taking the position that he described over the phone. (Tr. 1651, 1742-44, 1824)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>24. On that same night, Mr. Applewhaite telephoned Chief Counsel Klein. Applewhaite mentioned the dinner with Shanker. In addition, Applewhaite and Klein discussed possible remedies in the PATCO case, including reinstatement of the controllers, suspension of PATCO\u2019s dues checkoff, and imposition of a trusteeship. These remedies were not discussed at the earlier meeting of the members on September 21. The conversation lasted approximately 40 to 45 minutes. (Tr. 819, 1885, 1888, 1970-72) From the afternoon before the dinner to the evening after the dinner, Member Applewhaite had moved from his stated position of revocation with a time ban to consideration of a position designed to reinstate the striking controllers with the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">25. On the morning of September 22, Member Frazier went to Member Applewhaite\u2019s office to inquire how the dinner with Mr. Shanker went. Member Frazier testified that Member Applewhaite said to him, \u201cHank, I can\u2019t vote to revoke the certification of PATCO.\u201d This change surprised Member Frazier. (Tr. 237) Member Frazier testified further that Applewhaite said that the dinner with Mr. Shanker had been a pleasant social occasion for at least the first hour and twenty minutes. During the last ten minutes of the dinner, the conversation turned to PATCO. <em>(Id.) </em>According to Member Frazier, Member Applewhaite reported that Mr. Shanker had said to Applewhaite that if he voted to revoke the certification of PATCO, he would not be able to work as an arbitrator when he left the government, and that Mr. Shanker was speaking for top officials in organized labor. (Tr. 237-238) Further, Member Applewhaite allegedly stated that his conclusion regarding his PATCO vote was tentative, but that he was leaning against revocation at that time. (Tr. 239)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">26. Member Applewhaite denies that he made the above described comments to Member Frazier on September 22 or any other time. (Tr. 747-752) However, whether through miscommunication on the part of both parties, misunderstanding by Mr. Frazier, or misstatement by Member Applewhaite, Member Frazier left that meeting with a clear belief that the discussion at the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner had caused Member Applewhaite at least to consider less stringent remedies than he had raised at the September 21 meeting of the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">27. Member Frazier then contacted Paul Klein, Chief Counsel of the FLRA, and asked him to prepare a draft concurring and dissenting opinion for him, in addition to preparing a lead decision that Frazier had requested earlier. Frazier told Klein that the request was made because Member Applewhaite might switch his vote in the case. (Tr. 239)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">28. Member Frazier also informed his executive assistant, Holly Hemphill, about Member Applewhaite\u2019s tentative decision not to join Frazier. Mrs. Hemphill was instructed to begin working on a concurring and dissenting opinion. (Tr. 2888-90; Frazier Ex. 33)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">29. Between September 22nd and October 9th, Member Applewhaite and Chairman Haughton exchanged draft proposals and talked both in person and over the telephone regarding the appropriate remedy in this case. For over two weeks, Member Applewhaite was trying to reach an agreement with the Chairman that involved a penalty other than revocation, either personally or through his representative, Mr. Klein. (Tr. 1655-56, 1834, 1836, 1902-03, 825-28, 1847-49, 1878-81, 1964-68; Frazier Exhibits 19, 28, 29, 30, 31)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">30. The Chairman received from Member Applewhaite a draft of a proposed opinion on or about October 5. (Frazier Ex. 19; <em>see </em>also Frazier Exhibits 28, 29, 30, and 31; Tr. 1655) The Chairman also discussed remedies with Paul Klein, Applewhaite\u2019s principal draftsman and representative when Applewhaite was out of town. The discussions and proposed drafts were attempts by Member Applewhaite to reach an agreement with Chairman Haughton on a position that did not involve revocation of PATCO\u2019s certification. (Tr. 1655-57)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>31. When Chairman Haughton reviewed Member Applewhaite\u2019s draft he revisited an issue that he had decided earlier, mainly whether suspension amounted to revocation. He discussed the matter with Klein on at least October 5 and 6. (Tr. 1657, 1834) Although discussions between Applewhaite, Haughton, and Klein involved seeking an accommodation on remedies, Haughton concluded on October 6th or 7th that he could not accept Member Applewhaite\u2019s concept of suspension. Chairman Haughton had determined that suspension amounted to a revocation of certification, and he therefore rejected this approach for the same reasons he stated at the September 22 meeting. At that point, Chairman Haughton assumed that he would have to be prepared to dissent from a majority decision in favor of revocation. (Tr. 1657-58)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">32. October 6, Member Applewhaite told Mrs. Hemphill, Frazier\u2019s assistant, that he was having trouble getting together with Chairman Haughton on a decision. Mrs. Hemphill testified that she responded, in a joking manner, that she would be happy to have him join them. He replied, well, maybe so. (Tr. 2891)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">33. When Mrs. Hemphill realized that Member Applewhaite was serious, she asked him whether he might want to talk with Member Frazier directly. Member Applewhaite responded that he would. Mrs. Hemphill then made arrangements for Frazier to telephone Applewhaite in New York City, for which he was leaving that day. (Tr. 2892; Frazier Ex. 34) Mrs. Hemphill informed Member Frazier of Member Applewhaite\u2019s request for a telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">34. Member Frazier made the telephone call to New York on October 7. (Tr. 249; Frazier Ex. 36) During the telephone call Member Applewhaite indicated to Member Frazier that it did not appear that Applewhaite and Chairman Haughton would be able to get together. It looked like Member Applewhaite would have to come back to a position in favor of revocation of certification. (Tr. 249) The conversation lasted 12 minutes (Frazier, Ex. 36, p. 4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">35. Member Frazier informed Mrs. Hemphill of Member Applewhaite\u2019s change in position on October 7. (Tr. 2894)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">36. On the 8th and 9th of October, Member Applewhaite made his last attempts to reach an agreement with Chairman Haughton. The first was a telephone call on October 8th in which they again discussed a range of penalties other than revocation. (Tr. 1009-10) The second was on October 9th, in a private meeting in the afternoon among Member Applewhaite, Chairman Haughton and Chief Counsel Klein, at which they once again discussed a range of penalties other than revocation. A suspension of PATCO\u2019s recognition for a certain period was the central element in all of Member Applewhaite\u2019s proposals, but Chairman Haughton could not agree to that remedy. (Tr. 825-828, 1878-81) Their negotiations broke down in the late afternoon on October 9th.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">37. Member Applewhaite told Mrs. Hemphill on October 9 that he would indeed return to a position in favor of revocation. (Tr. 2894, 828)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">D. APPLEWHAITE-FREEHLING DISCUSSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">38. On September 22 and September 28 Member Frazier advised Member Applewhaite that he should discuss with Solicitor Robert Freehling the implications of the dinner with Mr. Shanker. (Tr. 239, 242, 534, 666-668) Member Applewhaite dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>cussed the Shanker dinner with Solicitor Freehling on September 28. (Tr. 756)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">39. Member Applewhaite sought from Mr. Freehling his advice as to the legal ramifications of a hypothetical ease where a labor leader from New York, who had been a close friend socially and professionally over a period of years met socially with Member Applewhaite and made mention of the PATCO matter. (Tr. 668-72, 756-759)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">40. Mr. Freehling advised Member Applewhaite that if there were promises of benefit or threats at the dinner meeting, a crime had occurred, and report must be made to the Office of Professional Responsibility in the Justice Department. (Tr. 669, 698-99) Mr. Freehling advised Member Applewhaite on the FLRA rules on <em>ex parte </em>contacts, explaining precisely what the rules say, what an ex <em>parte </em>contact is, what the exceptions are and what is required if there is an ex <em>parte </em>contact. (Tr. 669-670)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">41. Mr. Applewhaite did not disclose the details of the conversation between Applewhaite and Shanker concerning PATCO. (Tr. 668-672) Mr. Freehling never asked Member Applewhaite if his position in the PATCO case had changed as a result of the Applewhaite-Shanker dinner. (Tr. 695)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">42. Mr. Freehling did not advise Member Applewhaite as to whether the Applewhaite-Shanker dinner was a problem. Mr. Freehling did suggest that Mr. Applewhaite discuss the matter with the other members. (Tr. 697)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">43. On September 28, Member Applewhaite told Chairman Haughton that he had discussed the Shanker dinner with Mr. Freehling and that Mr. Freehling had advised that there was no problem concerning the conversation with Mr. Shanker regarding the PATCO ease. Mr. Applewhaite did not discuss with Chairman Haughton the possibility of disclosing the PATCO discussion at the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner in the final PATCO decision of the FLRA. (Tr. 1682, 1729)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">44. Member Frazier was not present during this conversation between Member Applewhaite and Chairman Haughton. (Tr. 1653-54, 1730-31, 1832-33) Chairman Haughton had no conversations with Member Frazier or Mr. Freehling about the Applewhaite-Shanker dinner meeting. <em>(Id.) </em>Chairman Haughton does not recall any conversation with Member Applewhaite, at which Member Frazier was present, concerning the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">45. Member Frazier later asked Mr. Freehling whether Member Applewhaite had discussed the Shanker dinner conversation with him. Mr. Freehling advised that he had and that Member Applewhaite had concluded that there were no problems involved. (Tr. 244)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">E. THE ISSUANCE OF THE DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">46. By October 19, all three members had drafted their final opinion for the PAT-CO case. Drafts were exchanged among the three members. Each wrote responses to the arguments of the others. Each polished his own draft. (Tr. 250-51, 2904)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">47. The final opinions of the members were issued on October 22, 1981. In that decision, the members found that PATCO had committed an unfair labor practice in violation of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101) Members Frazier and Applewhaite found that the violation required the revocation of PATCO\u2019s exclusively recognized representation of the air traffic controllers as a nationwide collective bargaining unit. Chairman Haughton dissented from the remedy. He found the record to be incomplete with respect to the evidence bearing on the remedy, and stated that he was unable to determine what remedy was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">48. Member Applewhaite was interviewed by FBI agents Larry Knisley and John Paulisick on October 22 at about noon. (Tr. 851, 2415) Member Applewhaite told the FBI.agents basically the substance reported in their FBI report about the interview. (ALJ Ex. 1) Despite Member Applewhaite\u2019s testimony to the contrary, he did in fact tell agents Knisley and Paulisick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>that he considered the Shanker dinner an <em>ex parte </em>contact; that it was his policy to advise the other two authority members about ex parte contacts; that he never changed his position following the dinner; that he never opposed decertification of PATCO; that his position regarding PAT-CO fell between the two extremes of the other two members; that he desired a three-year suspension for PATCO, which he reduced to a suspension of one year; and that the other two Authority members lied to him about their positions regarding PAT-CO. (Tr. 2427-29, 2435-36, 2817)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">49. Following the FBI interviews, Member Applewhaite reported to Chairman Haughton that the agents had praised him for his courage regarding the Shanker dinner and the PATCO case. (Tr. 1855-56, 2437) In fact the FBI agents did not praise Member Applewhaite for his conduct regarding the PATCO matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">50. Member Frazier testified, that in his opinion the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner did not have an effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s ultimate decision in the PATCO case. (Tr. 586)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">51. The Shanker-Applewhaite dinner had no effect on the ultimate decision of Mr. Applewhaite in the PATCO case. Member Applewhaite\u2019s final decision in the PATCO case was substantially the same as the position he discussed at the September 21 meeting of the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">52. Mr. Shanker is associated with the AFL-CIO which was an <em>amicus curiae </em>party in the PATCO proceeding. Counsel for the AFL-CIO participated in the oral argument before the FLRA on September 16, 1981. <em>(See </em>FLRA decision of October 22, 1981, at 3.) Therefore, Mr. Shanker may be an interested person within the meaning of the FLRA regulations (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.2 and \u00a7 2414.3) concerning ex <em>parte </em>communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">53. The Shanker-Applewhaite dinner may have been a prohibited ex <em>parte </em>communication. (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.2)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">V APPLEWHAITE\u2019S DISCUSSION OF PATCO AT A POLITICAL FUNDRAISER</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">In the McGrath Declaration, it is reported that Member Frazier stated that Member Applewhaite discussed the PATCO case with individuals at a Republican fundraising function in New York City on October 6, 1981. Further, Member Frazier stated that Member Applewhaite had been assured by one or more persons at the fundraiser that if he alienated labor by his vote, he could find many opportunities available to him in the private practice of law in New York. (McGrath Declaration at 4, ALJ Ex. 7 at 3). The following findings concern the events of the Republican fundraiser:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">1. On October 6, 1981, Member Applewhaite attended a Republican fundraising dinner called \u201cRepublican Follies\u201d at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. The purpose of the dinner was to introduce gubernatorial candidates. Approximately 200-300 people were present. Member Applewhaite knew at least 50-75 people at the dinner with whom he spoke. (Tr. 763; PATCO Ex. 12)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">2. Member Applewhaite has no knowledge that anybody from the Executive Branch attended. (Tr. 921)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">3. Upon learning of Applewhaite\u2019s status as a Member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority and its jurisdiction, persons expressed differing views with regard to the PATCO revocation matter, such as \u201cthey ought to be decertified\u201d and \u201cI think the President is wrong.\u201d (Tr. 764)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">4. Member Applewhaite responded by making statements such as \u201cWell, there are legal ramifications to both and they have to be studied and decided.\u201d (Tr. 764)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">5. People would comment to Member Applewhaite that he has \u201cgot to make a tough decision.\u201d (Tr. 764-65)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">6. Member Applewhaite testified that at the Republican Fundraising dinner he did not discuss the substance of the case, and no promises were made to him relating to the decision he might make on the PATCO case. (Tr. 765-66)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>7. During Member Frazier\u2019s telephone conversation with Member Applewhaite on October 7, Member Applewhaite stated that he had gone to New York for a political fundraiser. At the event, according to Mr. Frazier, Applewhaite said that he had spoken with acquaintances about PATCO and the personal ramifications of this vote. One of the individuals at the fundraiser told Applewhaite that because he was a member of the New York Bar, he could always practice law in New York if he was not reappointed to the FLRA. (Tr. 250, 2430-32; ALJ Ex. 1, ALJ Ex. 7)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">8. This call lasted 12 minutes. Member Applewhaite does not recall any details of the phone call, but does recall that he told Frazier why he was in New York. (Tr. 1082, 1257, Frazier Ex. 36)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">9. There is no evidence of record that any promises were made to Member Applewhaite by any persons at the fundraiser to the effect that if he voted for decertification he would have a substantial attorney position available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">10. There is no evidence of record that any conversation Member Applewhaite had at the \u201cRepublican Follies\u201d had any impact on his decision in the PATCO case. (Tr. 765, 767) Even Member Frazier testified that in his judgment the conversations Member Applewhaite may have had at the fundraiser on October 6 had no impact on Member Applewhaite\u2019s decision in the PAT-CO case. (Tr. 584-85)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">VI APPLEWHAITE\u2019S REAPPOINTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">In the McGrath Declaration, the Court was advised that Member Frazier claimed to have been told by Member Applewhaite that, as a result of the dilemma weighing on his consideration of the PATCO case, Member Applewhaite made an inquiry into whether his reappointment to the FLRA was likely, but learned that no commitment for reappointment could be secured. (McGrath Declaration at 4) Frazier advised the FBI that Applewhaite told him that he (Applewhaite) had made an effort to obtain from \u201can unknown administration official a commitment for reappointment to the FLRA when Applewhaite\u2019s term expired in July of 1982.\u201d Further, Frazier told the FBI that Applewhaite acknowledged that he could not obtain the commitment. The following recommended findings concern Member Applewhaite\u2019s efforts concerning his reappointment to the FLRA, his desire to become Chairman of the FLRA, and his contacts with Administration officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">A. <em>Contact with Ed Allison</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">1. On August 6, 1981, pursuant to prior arrangements made in early or mid-July 1981, Member Applewhaite met with Mr. Ed Allison, Administrative Aide to Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Member Applewhaite\u2019s qualifications and the fact that a Republican had not been named as Chairman of the Authority. (Tr. 724, 1096)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">2. This meeting took place at Mr. Allison\u2019s office in the Russell Senate Office Building and lasted approximately 15 minutes. (Tr. 724-725, Frazier Ex. 4)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">3. At the August 6 meeting, Mr. Allison and Member Applewhaite discussed the latter\u2019s experience in the labor relations field and his administrative background. Mr. Allison requested a copy of Member Applewhaite\u2019s biography. Allison concluded the meeting by informing Applewhaite that he would advise Senator Laxalt of Applewhaite\u2019s credentials and that, if appropriate, further contact would be made with the White House concerning Applewhaite\u2019s appointment to the chairmanship of the FLRA. (Tr. 725)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">4. During the August 6 meeting, there was no discussion of Member Applewhaite\u2019s reappointment for another term on the FLRA nor did the two men discuss the PATCO case. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-17\">5. On or about August 13, 1981, Member Applewhaite stopped by Mr. Allison\u2019s office to deliver the promised biographical sketch. He was in the office for no more than 3 minutes and delivered the material to Mr. Allison\u2019s secretary. The PATCO case was not mentioned in this second visit to Mr. Allison (Tr. 725-6, 1096-97, Frazier Ex. 4)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>6. There is no evidence of record or indication of any kind that the meeting and conversation between Member Applewhaite and Mr. Allison had any effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s deliberations or decision in the PATCO proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">B. <em>Contact with Robert Bonitati</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">1. Robert F. Bonitati serves as Special Assistant to the President for Public Liaison. In that position, Mr. Bonitati serves as liaison to organized labor. (Tr. 2072-2073) Member Applewhaite was aware of Mr. Bonitati\u2019s duties. (Tr. 1134)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">2. In July 1981 and on August 4, 1981, Member Applewhaite telephoned Robert F. Bonitati to advise Mr. Bonitati that the services of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) were available as a possible vehicle for settlement of the PATCO labor dispute. (Tr. 2080-2081, 2084-2086)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">3. Both conversations were very brief and concerned only the Federal Service Impasses Panel <em>(Id.) </em>The August 4 conversation lasted one or two minutes. (Tr. 2086) Mr. Bonitati was aware of the availability of the FSIP before Member Applewhaite called. (Tr. 2085) Member Applewhaite and Mr. Bonitati did not discuss the merits of the PATCO labor dispute during the July or August 4 telephone conversations. (Tr. 2081, 2086)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">4. On October 9, 1981, Mr. Bonitati\u2019s secretary placed a telephone call to Member Applewhaite at 10:55 A.M. The purpose of the call was to inquire when the PATCO decision would be announced because the FLRA had announced previous decision dates that had proved to be incorrect. The call was not completed and Mr. Bonitati did not talk with Applewhaite. (Tr. 2088-2089; Tr. 2142, 2159, 2173, FAA Ex. 2)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">5. Later that same day, October 9, Mr. Bonitati and Member Applewhaite met at a reception following the swearing in of Mr. Malcolm Lovell as Undersecretary of Labor. This meeting was the first time that both men had met in person and the meeting lasted only a few minutes. (Tr. 20-21, 2090-91, 2156, 2158)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">6. At the Lovell reception, Mr. Bonitati told Member Applewhaite that he had tried to reach him that morning and that he wanted to know why the FLRA kept putting out the story that it was going to announce its decision within the next week. Member Applewhaite responded that the decision would be out the following Thursday or Friday at the very latest. Member Applewhaite also indicated that there were some problems with Members on leave and that everybody was not at the Authority at the same time to do all the necessary paperwork.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Tr. 2091-92, 2100, 2142-45)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">7. Member Applewhaite\u2019s prediction as to the timing of the PATCO decision proved to be incorrect. (Tr. 2092) Member Applewhaite and Mr. Bonitati did not discuss the merits of the PATCO revocation case during their conversation on October 9, 1981 (Tr. 2093, 720) Member Applewhaite did not tell Mr. Bonitati anything concerning the substantive positions then being taken by any of the members. (Tr. 2093)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">8. Mr. Bonitati did not attempt to obtain any information about the substance or merits of the PATCO proceeding pending at the FLRA during any conversation with Member Applewhaite. (Tr. 2186) Mr. Bonitati did not attempt to influence the FLRA decision in his contacts with Member Applewhaite, or express a preference as to how the decision should come out. (Tr. 2186)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">9. About mid-November 1981 and after the PATCO decision had been issued, Applewhaite and Bonitati met for lunch. During this luncheon meeting, there was no discussion of PATCO, the PATCO proceeding, or Member Applewhaite\u2019s reappointment. (Tr. 2133-2136, 719-720)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">10. During the pendency of the PATCO case before the FLRA, Mr. Bonitati did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>discuss with Member Applewhaite the latter\u2019s reappointment to the FLRA or Member Applewhaite\u2019s chances of becoming Chairman of the agency. (Tr. 2095-97, 2137). The only time that Member Applewhaite\u2019s possible reappointment was raised with Mr. Bonitati was in a brief comment at the close of a meeting between both individuals on January 6, 1982. (Tr. 2097-98)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">11. Member Frazier testified that any discussion Member Applewhaite may have had about seeking a reappointment commitment from the Administration, if there was such a discussion, had no impact or effect upon Member Applewhaite\u2019s decision in the PATCO case. (Tr. 583-586)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">12. There is no evidence of record that Member Applewhaite\u2019s possible reappointment was discussed by him with anyone associated with or representing the Administration prior to November 3, 1981. (Tr. 2096)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">13. There is no evidence of record that Member Applewhaite held out his vote in PATCO as deserving consideration by the Administration with respect to his possible reapportionment or designation as Chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">14. Member Applewhaite\u2019s contacts and conversation with Mr. Bonitati did not affect in any manner Applewhaite\u2019s decision in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">VII OTHER CONTACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">A. KENNETH BLAYLOCK</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">1. Kenneth Blaylock is President of the American Federation of Government Employees. (Tr. 262) Mr. Blaylock sits on the Executive Council and on the Public Employees Department of the AFL-CIO. (Tr. 576, 1411)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">2. Between August 3, 1981 and October 22, 1981, Chairman Haughton had three contacts with Kenneth Blaylock. (Tr. 1673 D-E)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">3. Chairman Haughton has known Kenneth Blaylock for a number of years in a professional capacity. (Tr. 1670-71)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">4. During August or early September, the time Chairman Haughton was at Martha\u2019s Vineyard, he had a telephone conversation with Kenneth Blaylock. Mr. Blaylock reported on his efforts to get the PAT-CO case settled. He mentioned that he had talked with Secretary Lewis, Donald Devine, of the Office of Personnel Management, and Robert Poli, President of PAT-CO. (Tr. 1673-D)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">5. Chairman Haughton, on his way home from work one evening, met Mr. Blaylock for a drink at the International Inn during the time the PATCO case was before the members. Mr. Blaylock reported on settlement efforts. He did not inquire about what the authority was doing with the ease, nor did he suggest what ought to be done. (Tr. 1673-E)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">6. Mr. Blaylock telephoned Chairman Haughton a day or two prior to October 22, 1981. Mr. Blaylock inquired as to the status of the PATCO case, telling Chairman Haughton he did not care which way the decision went, but that the decision ought to be issued. Chairman Haughton replied that he hoped the decision would be issued soon. (Tr. 1673E)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">7. The contacts between Mr. Blaylock and Chairman Haughton had no effect on Chairman Haughton\u2019s decision in the PAT-CO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">8. On or about September 3, 1981, Mr. Blaylock called Member Applewhaite and stated that he was trying to reach the Members and said that he realized that Member Applewhaite was the only one of the three Members in the office at that time. (Tr. 731, 890)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-19\">9. Mr. Blaylock stated during the telephone conversation that he was trying to reach the three authority members to advise them that settlement discussions were taking place in the PATCO strike situation. Member Applewhaite stated that he assumed there were ongoing settlement efforts, but that such discussions had no bearing on the case before the authority. Mr. Blaylock agreed and stated that he understood Mr. Applewhaite\u2019s position. Blaylock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>then inquired as to the status of the PAT-CO case. Mr. Applewhaite responded that there were several motions pending including a motion for oral argument. He indicated that oral argument was a possibility, but no decision had been made with respect to granting oral argument as of that date. Blaylock concluded the conversation by stating that he would be talking to the other two Authority members. (Tr. 731, 732, 735, 890)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">10. Member Applewhaite had no other conversations with Mr. Blaylock, in person or by telephone, during the pendency of the PATCO matter. (Tr. 735)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">11. Mr. Blaylock\u2019s conversation with Member Applewhaite had no effect on Member Applewhaite\u2019s decision in the PAT-CO case. (Tr. 735)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">12. Member Frazier had at least three telephone conversations and one personal meeting with Mr. Blaylock during the pend-ency of the PATCO case. (Tr. 262)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">13. During an August 17, 1981, telephone conversation initiated by Mr. Blaylock, Mr. Blaylock asked Member Frazier if they could meet so that he could brief Member Frazier on his efforts to settle the PAT-CO case. Mr. Blaylock and Member Frazier agreed to meet later that afternoon. (Tr. 262-263)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">14. At the meeting, Mr. Blaylock asked about the status of the PATCO case and Member Frazier told him that the FLRA had just gotten the case from the judge on the preceding Friday (August 14). (Tr. 263)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">15. Mr. Blaylock told Member Frazier that the President of the AFL-CIO had asked him to serve as an intermediary mediator to try to get the parties together to settle the case. (Tr. 263, 603)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">16. Mr. Blaylock told Member Frazier that in his efforts to seek a settlement of the FAA/PATCO matter it was his intention to meet with Mr. Poli of PATCO, Secretary Lewis and other officials of DOT and FAA, the General Counsel of the FLRA, and possibly Mr. Donald Devine, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. (Tr. 263, 603)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">17. Mr. Blaylock asked Member Frazier what he thought of what Mr. Blaylock had outlined. (Tr. 264)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">18. Member Frazier told Mr. Blaylock that it was the policy of the Federal Labor Relations Authority to encourage informal settlements among the parties of unfair labor practice cases, but that meant settlement by all the parties. Member Frazier also said that the settlement would have to be submitted to the Members of the Federal Labor Relations Authority for approval. Member Frazier advised he would do his best to promote the policy to encourage settlements of unfair labor practices so long as the settlement was consistent with the purposes and policies of the statute. (Tr. \u25a0 264, 603)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">19. Member Frazier reported the contents of his conversation with Mr. Blaylock to Mr. Freehling, the Solicitor of the FLRA. (Tr. 265; <em>see </em>Tr. 673)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">20. Mr. Freehling and Member Frazier agreed that the conversation involved an inquiry concerning the status of the case and an inquiry concerning settlement of the case and, therefore, it was permitted under the Authority\u2019s rules. (Tr. 265, PATCO Exh. 2, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414.6(b), (d))</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">21. On two or three other occasions, Mr. Blaylock telephoned Member Frazier to give him a status report on Mr. Blaylock\u2019s efforts to settle the PATCO matter. (Tr. 265-66, 603-04)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">22. In each of those conversations, Mr. Blaylock told Member Frazier whom he had spoken with or whom he was attempting to speak with., Mr. Blaylock also asked in each of the conversations the status of the case, and whether the Authority was about to issue its decision at any time in the near future. (Tr. 266, 604)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">23. Member Frazier responded to Mr. Blaylock\u2019s inquiries about the time the decision might issue by telling him that the matter was under active consideration and that the Members were working hard to reach a decision. (Tr. 266)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-19\">24. The only topics Mr. Blaylock raised with Member Frazier were requests con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cerning the status of the case and reports to Member Frazier concerning the nature of Mr. Blaylock\u2019s negotiations as an intermediary in an attempt to find a settlement in the case. (Tr. 417)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">25. Member Frazier did not believe that Mr. Blaylock was trying to influence his decision in the PATCO case. (Tr. 267)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">26. Mr. Blaylock\u2019s conversations with Member Frazier had no effect on Member Frazier\u2019s decision in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">27. Member Frazier did not report to Solicitor Freehling concerning conversations with Mr. Blaylock other than the first conversation because, in Member Frazier\u2019s judgment, the substance of the conversations was the same and Solicitor Freehling\u2019s advice concerning the first conversation would apply equally to the later conversations. (Tr. 268)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">B. MALCOLM LOVELL</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">28. Malcolm Lovell is the Undersecretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">29.

On October 9, 1981, Chairman Haughton attended the swearing-in of Mr. Malcolm Lovell as Undersecretary of Labor and the reception following. (Tr. 1673-B) Several comments, such as \u201cyou got a tough case,\u201d were made to Chairman Haughton by people at the reception regarding PATCO, but there was no discussion of the merits. (Tr. 1673-C)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">31. A few days or a week after the swearing-in of Mr. Lovell, Chairman Haughton had lunch with Mr. Lovell in the latter\u2019s office. There was a discussion of the PATCO case. Mr. Lovell described it as a \u201chot case\u201d. Chairman Haughton commented that it was a good case for the Department of Labor to stay out of and that, according to the newspapers, Administration decisions are being made at the highest levels. (Tr. 1673-C) Chairman Haughton testified that that luncheon had no effect on his decision in the PATCO ease. (Tr. 1760)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">32. A day or two before the PATCO decision issued, Mr. Lovell called Chairman Haughton inquiring when the decision would issue. The Chairman replied that he hoped it would issue soon. Lovell commented that he hoped there would not be anything embarrassing in it. Chairman Haughton replied he might be dissenting. (Tr. 1673-C and D)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">33. None of the conversations and meetings between Chairman Haughton and Malcolm Lovell had any effect on Chairman Haughton\u2019s decision in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">C. JOHN LEYDEN</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">34. John Leyden is the Executive Vice President of the Public Employee Department of the AFL-CIO. (Tr. 1669-70)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">35.

Chairman Haughton received a phone call from John Leyden a \u201cday or so before October 22\u201d inquiring when \u201cthe case was coming out.\u201d Chairman Haughton indicated he hoped it would be soon. This conversation took about 30 seconds. (Tr. 1671-72)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-19\">37. On October 27, 1981, five days after the FLRA\u2019s decision in the PATCO case was issued, Chairman Haughton attended a \u201cbrown bag lunch\u201d at which John Leyden spoke. John Leyden stated to Chairman Haughton that \u201cI understand you will be hearing from PATCO on your dissent.\u201d The Chairman replied \u201cthey had better hurry up because today is the fifth day.\u201d (Tr. 1672)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">38. None of Chairman Haughton\u2019s conversations with Mr. Leyden had any effect on Chairman Haughton\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">D. RICHARD LEIGHTON</p>\n<p id=\"b707-22\">39. On October 22, 1981, Chairman Haughton issued a \u201cconditional dissent,\u201d which stated that he would support revocation if PATCO did not satisfy certain conditions within 5 days. On October 27, 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Chairman Haughton\u2019s executive assistant, Steven Schwartz, was called by unidentified PATCO officials as to their response to the decision, advising that PATCO\u2019s Board of Directors would be meeting that day. (Tr. 1662-3, 1673F, 1752)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">40. At approximately 5:00 p. m. on October 27, 1981 Richard Leighton, Counsel for PATCO, spoke with Chairman Haughton. Because Chairman Haughton knew that Mr. Leighton was calling about PATCO\u2019s response to the five-day time period set forth in Chairman Haughton\u2019s October 22, 1981 opinion, he transferred the Leighton call to Schwartz. (Tr. 1673F)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">41. Chairman Haughton received that same afternoon, by hand delivery, a letter addressed to him by Mr. Leighton, indicating that copies of the letter were being sent to Members Applewhaite and Frazier. The letter advised Chairman Haughton that PATCO took the legal position that it had until October 29, 1981, not October 27, 1981, to file a response to Chairman Haughton\u2019s October 22, 1981 decision, under its interpretation of the FLRA\u2019s regulations. (Tr. 1673F, G, 1753-54; Haughton Exh. 6)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">42. The letter did not indicate that PATCO served it on opposing counsel, nor was Chairman Haughton aware of any such service. (Haughton Exh. 6, Tr. 1754-55)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">43. The PATCO-Leighton contacts had no effect on Chairman Haughton\u2019s November 3, 1981 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">E. DOLPH SAND</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">44. Dolph Sand is an attorney with the Federal Aviation Administration who was the FAA\u2019s representative in the PATCO revocation proceeding before the FLRA. (Tr. 2195-96; ALJ Exh. 3)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">45. Member Frazier telephoned Mr. Dolph Sand on October 28, 1981. (Tr. 459)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">46. On October 28, 1981, the FLRA and Department of Justice, representing FAA, were working together to defend the October 22 decision of the FLRA which had been appealed to the Court of Appeals. (Tr. 459 \u2014 460)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">47. The purpose of the call to Mr. Sand was to tell him that a document in the PATCO matter had been served in person on Member Frazier and to ask Mr. Sand whether he would like to pick up a copy since it was being served by mail on FAA. (Tr. 459)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">48. Member Frazier did not discuss the underlying merits of the FAA/PATCO case with Mr. Sand when he came by the office to pick up a copy of the document. Mr. Sand picked up the document and left. (Tr. 460)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">49. Member Frazier did not ask Mr. Freehling about the propriety of contact with- Mr. Sand because Member Frazier\u2019s final decision had issued .and it was being defended in Court by FLRA and DOJ. (Tr. 460)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">50. On October 29, Mr. Sand telephoned Member Frazier to say that FAA did not intend to do anything in response to the document. (Tr. 460)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">51. Harold Kessler serves as Deputy Executive Director of the FLRA. (Tr. 2190)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">52. Mr. Kessler is privy to the decisional process in many eases before the FLRA. (Tr. 2228) He frequently provides the members with recommendations as to the outcome of a case and points out problems that may arise with respect to a case. (Tr. 2193)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">53. Harold Kessler received many calls from people inquiring as to when the PAT-CO decision would be issued. (Tr. 2196\u2014 2200)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-19\">54. He had two or three conversations with Dolph Sand, in which Mr. Sand inquired as to when a decision would be issued. (Tr. 2197)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-20\">55. Mr. Kessler has had a professional relationship with Mr. Sand for seven or eight years. (Tr. 2195)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-21\">56. Approximately one or two weeks before the PATCO decision was issued by the Authority, Mr. Sand called Mr. Kessler and expressed a sense of urgency that the FAA needed the decision to be issued. (Tr. 2196-2197)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>57. Mr. Kessler told Mr. Sand that Kessler would make sure that Mr. Sand\u2019s sense of urgency was conveyed to the members. (Tr. 2197) There is no evidence that Mr. Kessler actually conveyed this message to the members nor that Mr. Sand\u2019s call had any effect on the decisional process in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">58. Mr. Kessler saw nothing improper in Mr. Sand\u2019s calls to him. (Tr. 2198)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">59. No other party to the PATCO proceeding contacted Mr. Kessler. (Tr. 2250)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">F. CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE JOHN FENTON</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">60. On August 4,1981, Members Applewhaite and Frazier met Chief Administrative Law Judge John Fenton for lunch. (Tr. 327, 722)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">61. During that meeting, they discussed procedural aspects of the PATCO matter, but did not discuss the merits of the case. (Tr. 723)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">62. ' Members Frazier and Applewhaite urged Judge Fenton to assign a capable judge to the case and, if possible, to assign the case to himself. (Tr. 327)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">63. The FAA/PATCO matter was not before Judge Fenton at the time of the meeting. (Tr. 327)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">64. Member Frazier talked to Judge Fenton on several occasions from August 3 through August 14. (Tr. 326-328; PATCO Exh. 3)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">65. Members Frazier and Applewhaite never discussed the merits of the FAA/PATCO matter with Judge Fenton. (Tr. 326, 723)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">66. Member Applewhaite had no other contacts with Judge Fenton during the pendency of the PATCO case. (Tr. 723)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">67. The contacts between Members Frazier and Applewhaite with Judge Fenton had no effect on the decisional process in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">G. MATTHEW SHANNON-ANTHONY SKIRLICK</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">68. Anthony Joseph Skirlick, Jr., is a radar air traffic controller for the Federal Aviation Administration at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palpville, California. (Tr. 351)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">69. Mr. Skirlick is a member of the PATCO. (Tr. 351)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-21\">70. On or about October 1, 1981, Mr. Skirlick filed a motion to intervene in the PATCO unfair labor practice proceeding pending before the FLRA. (Tr. 354)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-22\">71. Matthew D. Shannon was an attorney adviser on the operations staff of the FLRA during the period August 3, 1981, through November 3, 1981. (Tr. 367)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-23\">72. In that capacity, it was Mr. Shannon\u2019s major responsibility to review documents filed with the FLRA to ensure that they had been served on all parties and to determine whether the document required immediate attention. This was Mr. Shannon\u2019s major responsibility with respect to the PATCO case. (Tr. 367-68)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-24\">73. Mr. Shannon had no personal contact with anyone in a decision-making capacity with respect to the PATCO case while it was pending with the FLRA. (Tr. 369)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-25\">74.

Mr. Shannon informed Mr. Skirlick during that telephone conversation that the motion for intervention had been denied. (Tr. 375, 378-79; <em>see </em>PATCO Exh. 6, p. 2, lines 5-9)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-29\">78. Mr. Shannon did not tell Mr. Skirlick that the Administration was bringing pressure on the FLRA to issue a decision quickly. (Tr. 371-72)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-30\">79. No one inside or outside the FLRA ever indicated to Mr. Shannon that the Administration was bringing pressure on the FLRA to issue a decision quickly. (Tr. 371)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>80. Mr. Shannon has no personal knowledge of any pressure by the Department of Transportation or the Federal Aviation Administration on anyone in a decision-making capacity at the FLRA. (Tr. 373)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">VIII DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In my recommended findings, I have made certain findings which may require some additional explanation. Accordingly, the following discussion is provided to put those findings in perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">I have found that the telephone calls on August 13, 1981 from Secretary Lewis to Members Frazier and Applewhaite may have had some undetermined effect on their decision to limit the time for filing exceptions to the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. Both members testified that the calls had no effect on their August 18, 1981 decision. However, the Secretary told Member Frazier that he wanted expeditious processing of the case within the FLRA\u2019s rules and he stated his concern to Member Applewhaite that the case not be delayed. Both members described the Secretary\u2019s call as unusual. Later that same day, August 13, the FAA filed a motion to limit the time for filing exceptions from 25 to 7 days. It is quite likely that the FAA motion was filed in accordance with the advice concerning the FLRA regulations given to Mr. Lewis by Member Applewhaite.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The evidence of record does not permit an evaluation of how much of an effect the calls had on the two members, but I believe that the Secretary\u2019s phone call did play at least some minimal part in their decision to reduce the prescribed 25 day period to 19 days. However, it should be noted that I do not believe that the Secretary\u2019s calls had any effect on the merits of final decision in the PATCO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">In my findings, I find that the meeting between Member Applewhaite, General Counsel Gordon, and Ellen Stern on August 10, 1981 may have been a prohibited <em>ex parte </em>communication. It is clear that the Stern memorandum concerned the PATCO case. There was no other case pending at the FLRA at that time to which the memorandum could have been related. Mr. Gordon testified that the discussion took place within the context of the PATCO case. As noted, Mr. Gordon is the FLRA General Counsel. The General Counsel is defined as a \u201cperson outside this agency\u201d when his representative is prosecuting an unfair labor practice proceeding. The General Counsel was responsible for the prosecution of the PATCO case before the administrative law judge. In fact the PATCO case was being heard before the judge on August 10. Even Member Applewhaite testified at that time that he expected exceptions to be filed to the judge\u2019s decision. (Tr. 944) In view of all of the above, and even though Applewhaite and Gordon described the discussion as abstract, the discussion may have been a prohibited <em>ex parte </em>communication. However, the discussion was very short, general in nature, and very early in the processing of the PATCO case. Accordingly, I do not believe that it had any effect upon Member Applewhaite\u2019s deliberations and final decision in the PAT-CO case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">On August 4, 1981, Members Frazier and Applewhaite met with Chief Administrative Law Judge John Fenton at lunch to discuss the procedural aspects of the PATCO case. During that discussion, it was suggested that Judge Fenton appoint a capable judge, preferably himself, to hear the PATCO case. No party has argued in its recommended findings that this luncheon meeting was improper. Further, I do not believe that it had any impact or effect on the FLRA\u2019s decision in the PATCO case. However, that finding does not mean that such practices should be condoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">It is clearly possible that the special selection or assignment of a judge to a particular case could raise substantial problems. There is no evidence that Judge Fenton\u2019s assignment of the PATCO case to himself raises any problems in this proceeding. However, the practice of agency heads suggesting that a particular judge be assigned to conduct a particular case should be avoided at the FLRA and all other federal agencies. Such a practice may conflict with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and may raise questions of administrative fairness in those agencies which may attempt to influence the selection of a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Mr. Shanker is closely associated with the AFL-CIO. He is president of one of the AFL-CIO\u2019s affiliated unions and sits on the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO. The AFL-CIO was an <em>amicus curiae </em>party to the proceeding and participated in the oral argument before the FLRA. The AFL-CIO is clearly an interested party in the PATCO proceeding. Therefore Mr. Shank-er may also be an interested party outside the FLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">It is for those reasons that the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner may have been an unauthorized communication in violation of the FLRA <em>ex parte </em>communications regulations (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2414). The discussion does not fall within the exceptions contained in 5 C.F.R. 2414.6(d). It is clear that Mr. Shank-er\u2019s message to Mr. Applewhaite was that revocation of certification was a drastic remedy out of proportion to the violation. However, as stated in my findings, I do not believe that the dinner had any effect on the final decision of the FLRA in the PAT-CO case. At the very most, the effect was transitory in nature, and occurred from September 21 to October 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The most troubling part of this proceeding has been the conflict between the testimony of Members Frazier and Applewhaite with respect to the Shanker-Applewhaite dinner. On the whole, I find Mr. Shanker\u2019s testimony regarding that dinner to be credible. There is no direct evidence that Mr. Shanker told Member Applewhaite that Applewhaite would not be able to obtain arbitration cases after leaving the FLRA if he voted for PATCO\u2019s decertification. Nor is there any direct evidence that Shanker made any promises or threats to Applewhaite.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Accepting Mr. Shanker\u2019s (and Member Applewhaite\u2019s) version of the dinner events does not resolve the conflict between Member Frazier and Member Applewhaite\u2019s testimony concerning their meeting of September 22, 1981. As stated in my findings, I believe that Member Frazier was troubled by Member Applewhaite\u2019s statements at the September 22 meeting and left that meeting with the impression that the events at the dinner has caused Applewhaite to change his position from revocation to suspension of PATCO\u2019s certification. Whether Mr. Frazier\u2019s impression was the result of a miscommunication between both men, a misstatement by Member Applewhaite, or a misinterpretation by Mr. Frazier, I cannot determine on this record. However, I do believe that Mr. Frazier\u2019s actions following the September 22 meeting was based on an honest concern for the decision-making process at the FLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">On the whole, I have found Mr. Frazier\u2019s and Mr. Haughton\u2019s testimony to be credible. On the other hand, Member Applewhaite\u2019s testimony, in substantial parts, was confusing, contradictory, and in some respects, incredible. A review of Member Applewhaite\u2019s testimony demonstrates his sometimes confusing and contradictory testimony. This tendency toward confusion was noted by two witnesses examined by Mr. Applewhaite\u2019s counsel. <em>(See </em>Mr. Shanker\u2019s testimony, Tr. 1433-36, and Agent Knisley\u2019s testimony 2773-74)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">With respect to credibility, there are a number of statements by Member Applewhaite which I find difficult to accept. Member Applewhaite disputed many of the statements attributed to him in the FBI report. (ALJ, Ex. 1) However, it is difficult to believe that the report could be so inaccurate. In fact, both agents who interviewed Member Applewhaite testified credibly that it was an accurate reflection of the interview. Member Applewhaite testified that he never thought about reappointment until last December or January, 1982 (Tr. 896, 1176). Yet he discussed the question of reappointment with Chairman Haughton and Member Frazier, and raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the subject with Mr. Shanker on September 21. (Tr. 1407, 1681-82, 1246-50) Further, he discussed the possibility of becoming Chairman with Senator Laxalt\u2019s Administrative Aide on August 6, 1981. (Tr. 724-25, 1096-97) Member Applewhaite could not remember the names of friends he spoke with or visited before the FBI interview on October 22. (Tr. 1347-48) Further, Member Applewhaite could not recall any of the details of his 12 minute phone call with Mr. Frazier on October 7. (Tr. 1082) Finally, Member Applewhaite testified that the FBI agents appeared to understand his situation and told him they did not see any problem. (Tr. 1501) In fact, Member Applewhaite told Chairman Haughton that the agents praised him and told him he had courage. (Tr. 1855-56) Agent Knisley denied making any such statements, and it is extremely doubtful that FBI agents praise the people they are investigating.

This testimony is consistent with the fact that Stern\u2019s memorandum, submitted as Frazier Exhibit 16, not only set out the problem and surveyed the relevant statutory language and legislative history but also reached a specific conclusion: The Authority possessed discretion to impose a lesser penalty than decertification only when the union had not actively encouraged and participated in illegal strike activity.

As we have not in this case defined precisely the latitude of permissible contacts between an agency\u2019s general counsel and its members at those early points in proceedings when decisions regarding the pursuit of emergency injunctive relief must be made, we have had no occasion to assess the legitimacy of Gordon\u2019s communications with the members in that regard. Furthermore, irrespective of whether those prior discussions were proper, the stage in the PATCO case where such contacts were necessary had passed at the time the Applewhaite-Gordon-Stern incident occurred. By August 10, the roles of Gordon as prosecutor and Applewhaite as adjudicator were firmly solidified; on that very day, the case was being heard on the merits before one of the agency\u2019s administrative law judges. Gordon\u2019s continued presence at and participation in Stem\u2019s briefing of Applewhaite was hardly less serious or more defensible than would have been the presence and participation of FLRA\u2019s counsel-on-appeal in a conference between a judge on this panel and his law clerk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b685-12\">.

His relationship with Shank-er was not such that an invitation to dinner was a matter of course; Applewhaite testified that he had never before dined privately with Shanker. Tr. at 903. Member Frazier testified that when Applewhaite mentioned his dinner plans, the two speculated about Shanker\u2019s purpose, see Tr. at 233-234, 493-499, and the PAT-CO case was mentioned at least in passing, see <em>id. </em>at 234, 497, 507. In any event, Applewhaite well knew Shanker\u2019s position in the labor field; more specifically, he knew that Shanker was on the Executive Board of an organization that was appearing as amicus curiae in the PATCO case. ALJ Findings at 15, \u00b6 7.

I agree that Applewhaite\u2019s concern did not constitute, in the circumstances, a \u201cpersonal interest\u201d in the outcome such as would require disqualification, but I would not be so quick to validate it by suggesting it was quite understandable. There seems little question that Applewhaite felt keenly the career ramifications of his vote. Perhaps this sensitivity was not atypically acute, although I do not detect the basis for the court\u2019s conclusion on this point, see Maj.Op. at 574. Perhaps it is an inescapable product of creating such positions as political term appointments. However, concern for the personal consequences of an impending decision is neither a desirable nor a proper element in the judicial calculus.

I take no view on whether the Shanker dinner had a transitory effect on Applewhaite\u2019s position. As the court points out, the absence of a recommended finding .on the September 21 afternoon telephone call from Applewhaite to Klein makes it difficult for us to assess Judge Vittone\u2019s conclusion that there may have been a period when Applewhaite was swayed by Shanker\u2019s arguments. See Maj.Op. at 571-572 n.52. On the one hand, Judge Vittone may simply have overlooked that call in sorting through the mountain of evidence presented; on the other hand, he may have considered Applewhaite\u2019s action in calling Haughton and Klein to propose a compromise position immediately after returning home from the dinner, see ALJ Findings at 20, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, as an indication that Shanker\u2019s exhortation was a contributing \u2014 even if not the sole \u2014 factor in Applewhaite\u2019s search for a moderate solution. If we needed to resolve the point, which we do not, the appropriate course would be to remand to the administrative law judge for additional findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">.

It is my understanding that we are not remanding because no one has demonstrated that a remand is necessary. The hearing held at our behest was a thorough exploration of the nature, extent, and impact of all ex parte pleas and approaches undertaken in the relevant time period. All interested parties have had an opportunity to comment on what was revealed. Although prohibited contacts did occur, we have discerned no prejudicial effect on the agency\u2019s final decision. In sum, we were not shown any extant problem requiring a remand to correct. If by \u201cfutility\u201d the court means simply this, then I am in agreement.

Applewhaite and Bonitati\u2019s testimony conflict as to where their conversation took place. Applewhaite testified that it occurred during a telephone call (Tr. 720) Bonitati testified that the call was not completed and the discussion took place during a chance meeting at the Lovell reception. (Tr. 2090-91) In all other respects concerning this conversation, the testimony of both men is essentially similar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">.

While the immediate strike was against the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) it was really against the United States, and the principal victims were the citizens of the United States. Such was clearly the intention of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers\u2019 Organization (PATCO and Union). The scheme of the strike was that the convenience of the nation\u2019s 265 million citizens would be held hostage to the Union\u2019s demands. This is an essential characteristic of most strikes against the government of the United States. The strikers attempt to use the monopoly position that government occupies in various fields as a stranglehold to extort their demands. PATCO obviously believed that its strike would effectively bring the nation to its knees and force the government to give in to its demands. It was a flagrant attempt to misuse the exclusive control over the nation\u2019s airways that government has established to serve its citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">2. The Union contends that it did not have adequate time to prepare its factual and legal defense to the unfair labor practice charges. If this claim is valid it demonstrates the irresponsibility of the Union. PATCO had been <em>threatening </em>a nationwide strike for a long time. If it was serious in this threat, and its subsequent actions indicate that it was, PATCO should have had the complete substantiation for its position ready, and <em>immediately available, </em>to defend such a monstrous attempt to paralyze the entire nation\u2019s principal means of transporting its citizens and its mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">3. The number of <em>ex parte </em>contacts that were disclosed at the remand hearing is appalling, as are the statements by counsel that such contacts were nothing more than what is normal and usual in administrative agencies and even in courts of law. That statement is categorically denied insofar as our courts are concerned. If that ever turns out to be true some very severe penalties are going to be meted out. The conduct of Shanker, as described above, was the most serious, but the telephone calls by the Secretary of Transportation were also objectionable. Union and cabinet officers, and all citizens, will have to realize that officials of the administrative agencies engaged in adjudicating rights and interests are <em>not </em>their hand maidens. In deciding such cases the government officials act in a quasi-judicial capacity and <em>ex parte </em>contacts that attempt to \u201cback door\u201d the adjudicative process, with respect to the merits or discipline, are highly improper and illegal. In this connection 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 should be noted. This section of the Criminal Code provides that it is an offense if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>one \u201ccorruptly ... <em>endeavors to influence, </em>obstruct or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which [a] proceeding is being had before [an] ... agency of the United States ...\u201d (emphasis added). Private contacts with agency officials, with respect to pending adjudicatory matters, by interested parties or their agents, that endeavor to affect the decisional process, however subtle such contract may be, are <em>corrupt </em>endeavors to influence the \u201cdue and proper administration of the law\u201d and those who so attempt may be indicted. The authorized punishment is imprisonment for not more than five years, or a $5,000 fine, or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">4. Shanker argues that his dinner with member Applewhaite \u201chad no effect on the decision\u201d and hence is of no moment. That is like the man charged with attempted murder asserting the indictment should be dismissed because his shot missed the intended victim. In my opinion Shanker and his Teacher\u2019s Union were both \u201cinterested parties\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (1976) of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">5. As to the remedy here, it is my opinion that Congress indicated by the terminology it used, and in the applicable legislative history, that \u201crevocation\u201d of the union\u2019s certification was the <em>preferred remedy </em>for unlawful strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The Federal Labor Management Relations Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">\u00a7 7116(b) .... [I]t shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">(7)(A) to call, or participate in, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, or picketing of an agency in a labor-management dispute if such picketing interferes with an agency\u2019s operations, or (B) to condone any activity described in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph by failing to take action to prevent or stop such activity . ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Labor organizations that violate this section of the Act by willfully engaging in prohibited strikes, and strike related activity, are subject to the penalties imposed' by Congress in \u00a7 7120(f). This section of the statute is clear and distinct. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-14\">(f) In the case of any labor organization which by omission or commission has willfully and intentionally with regard to any strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, violated section 7116(b)(7) of this title, the [Federal Labor Relations] Authority <em>shall, </em>upon an appropriate finding by the Authority of such violation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-15\">(1) <em>revoke the exclusive recognition status of the labor organization, </em>which shall then immediately cease to be legally entitled and obligated to represent employees in the unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-16\">(2) take any other appropriate disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7120(f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">PATCO was in clear violation of \u00a7 7116(b)(7) and the Authority so found. With such finding, revocation of PATCO\u2019s \u201cexclusive recognition status\u201d was almost automatic and that was the penalty imposed. Its prior misconduct (see 16, infra) was further justification for the decision of the Authority. The Union attacks this revocation of its exclusive recognition status as being too harsh and contends that subsection (f)(2) confers a broad discretion in the Authority to impose some lesser punishment. Be that as it may, the Authority\u2019s decision was clearly appropriate. When Congress wrote the statute it clearly indicated, by placing decertification in the forefront of the remedy section, that revocation was to be preferred. The reference to other appropriate disciplinary action was added for completeness. There is no indication that Congress intended <em>other </em>disciplinary action to be taken where the violation was clear. Subsection (2) seems to be addressed more to situations where the responsibility for a strike might be diffused, unclear, or not properly chargeable to the Union as would be the case with a wildcat strike, or a strike by a limited number of union members, or locals, that the union leadership were making every valid effort to stop, or where the strike might have resulted from an improper lock out, or in any other instance of diminished Union responsibility. The argument that subsection (2) vests a <em>broad discretion </em>is directed at <em>reducing </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>disciplinary action, and this case is not an appropriate one for any lesser discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">6. It is also important to remember that subject strike by PATCO violated a prior injunction obtained in 1970 in New York. The union knew this and had previously attempted to have the court vacate that 1970 injunction. Then, having failed to have the injunction set aside, they struck against the government and in violation of the injunction. PATCO is a repeat offender.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
