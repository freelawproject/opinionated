Ward, Judge, 534 F.Supp. 980, granting the petition of state prisoner Pedro Arroyo for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the state trial judge\u2019s supplemental jury charge, that \u201cpeople are presumed to intend the natural, probable and logical consequence of their acts,\u201d unconstitutionally deprived Arroyo of the presumption of innocence, in violation of <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979). We modify and affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Arroyo was convicted in 1973, after a jury trial in New York State Supreme Court, of one count of attempted murder, three counts of assault, and one count of possessing a weapon. Two versions of the events leading to the charges against Arroyo emerged at the trial. According to the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, on April 13, 1972, Arroyo was apprehended by two New York City police officers shortly after leaving the scene of a robbery. He was being returned to the scene of the robbery when he broke free from the officers and ran. He was quickly pursued by a third officer, Raymond Bernard, who attempted to tackle him. Arroyo dodged the tackle, drew a revolver, and fired at Bernard. Bernard had drawn his own handgun and extended his right arm into a firing position. Arroyo\u2019s shot, from five feet away, struck and shattered the grip of Bernard\u2019s gun, and the spent bullet pierced Bernard\u2019s police jacket but not his chest. Bernard returned fire; Arroyo leaped over a car hood and fired at Bernard twice more, missing both times. The police officers eventually wounded Arroyo, who thereupon surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Arroyo testified that his memory of the events was sketchy because of the injuries he had sustained. He recalled having been accosted by a gun-wielding stranger who had a second gun in his waistband. He stated that he had immediately pushed aside and held the man\u2019s gun hand, grabbed the other gun from the man\u2019s belt, struck him with that gun, and fled. As he ran, he was shot and wounded. Arroyo testified that he had no recollection of ever firing a gun. Two other defense witnesses also testified that Arroyo had not fired a gun and that all of the shooting had been done by the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">When the trial judge instructed the jury, before discussing any of the charges specifically, she instructed the jury that the prosecution bore the burden of proving every element of every alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. As to the attempted murder count, the judge stated that the \u201cintent to cause the death of Raymond Bernard\u201d was an essential element of the crime, and defined intent without using any language that could have been interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>as shifting the burden of proof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The same unobjectionable instruction as to intent was given twice more with respect to other counts. These initial instructions are unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Several times during the course of its deliberations, the jury made inquiries of the trial judge. First, it asked to have the testimony of Officer Bernard reread. The second request, made approximately four hours after the deliberations had begun, was for \u201cthe law and the interpretation of the [attempted murder] charge.\u201d The trial judge repeated, in large part, her initial instructions concerning that count, including the proper instructions on intent. After deliberating for another two hours, the jury returned to ask, \u201c[d]oes shooting at a policeman necessarily constitute attempted] murder?\u201d The trial judge responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">[T]he law which defines murder and attempt mentions only persons as to the elements of that crime, it applies to all persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">Attempted murder is defined in the law, a person is guilty of attempted murder[,] and I am combining the statute on attempt as well as murder[,] when with intent to cause the death of another person he attempts to cause the death of such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">(Tr. 808.) The jury returned to the jury room, but returned twelve minutes later, some six and one-half hours after it had begun deliberations, with another inquiry, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">We have reached agreements on four charges and divided on the fifth one, to assist us with the latter, we would seek further classification <em>[sic] </em>of the words conscious intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">(Tr. 810.) The parties are in accord that the charge on which the jury had not reached agreement was that of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The trial judge conferred with the prosecutor and defense counsel before responding. The prosecutor suggested that the jury be instructed that \u201cpeople are presumed to intend the natural, probable and logical consequence of their acts.\u201d Arroyo\u2019s lawyer stated that he had no objection. The trial court then gave the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">Now, Members of the Jury, a person acts intentionally with respect to attempting to cause death or injury to another person, when the alleged perpetrator\u2019s conscious objective is to cause such death or injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-15\">Intention is a subjective thing and depends on the operation of the individual\u2019s mind, nonetheless, it is possible to make' a finding of intention based on the objective actions of the individual].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-16\">The Penal Law defines intentionally as follows: a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or conduct described by a statute to finding [sic] an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-17\">\n<em>By agreement, I can tell you that people are presumed to intend the natural, probable and logical consequence of their acts.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>(Id.; </em>emphasis added.) Twenty-five minutes later the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Arroyo perfected his appeal to the Appellate Division in 1977. He argued that, although the portion of the supplemental charge italicized above represented a correct statement of New York law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the presumption language denied him due process of law by nullifying the prosecution\u2019s duty to prove intent and shifting to him the burden of proof on that issue on the attempted murder count. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed Arroyo\u2019s conviction for attempted murder; it dismissed the remaining four counts because they had merged with the attempted murder count. Leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In October 1979, a few months after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39, Arroyo pursued his due process claim in New York State Supreme Court by moving pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction. The State opposed the motion on the ground that Arroyo\u2019s failure to object at trial to the presumption instruction constituted a forfeiture of the claim. The court rejected this argument, but denied the motion on its merits, on the ground that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aae\">in the totality of the entire charge and the detailed instructions to the jury in this case [the presumption language] did not have the same potential for impermissible burden shifting as the instruction struck down by the Supreme Court in <em>[Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">(Opinion of May 19, 1980 at 14). Leave to appeal to the Appellate Division was denied, thus exhausting Arroyo\u2019s state court remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Arroyo then commenced the present proceeding in the district court, seeking a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an opinion dated February 11, 1982, the district court ruled that, under <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, supra, </em>the inclusion of the presumption language in the supplemental instruction on intent denied Arroyo due process. The court granted the writ, ordering that the State either release Arroyo from custody or retry him within sixty days. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">In <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>which has been the subject of considerable recent discussion in this Court, <em>see, e.g., Ramirez </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>683 F.2d 712 (2d Cir. 1982); <em>Rivera v. Coombe, </em>683 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1982); <em>Mancuso v. Harris, </em>677 F.2d 206 (2d Cir. 1982); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>672 F.2d 266 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 2301, 73 L.Ed.2d 1304 (1982); <em>Washington v. Harris, </em>650 F.2d 447 (2d Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1455, 71 L.Ed.2d 666 (1982), the United States Supreme Court ruled that a jury instruction that \u201c[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,\u201d violates the defendant\u2019s right to due process because it tends to shift the burden of proof on the issue of intent to the defendant and to deprive the defendant of the presumption of innocence. In the present case the State does not seriously contend that the portion of the supplemental instruction challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>by Arroyo \u2014 \u201cpeople are presumed to intend the natural, probable and logical consequences of their acts\u201d \u2014 is not the same type of instruction found invalid in Sandstrom.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, it contends principally that, when read in light of the charge as a whole, as is required by <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973), the presumption language did not have the effect of shifting the burden on intent to Arroyo and did not deprive him of the presumption of innocence. We reject the State\u2019s argument. In light of the special prominence of the presumption language by reason of its presence in a supplemental instruction, see <em>Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946), and the series of questions from the jury that preceded it, we cannot conclude that the offending language was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In <em>Nelson v. Scully, supra, </em>we discussed thoroughly the need, in reviewing trial court instructions, not to view the improper language in isolation and to evaluate the charge as a whole, in order to determine whether the improper language \u201c \u2018so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u2019 \u201d 672 F.2d at 272 (quoting <em>Cupp v. Naughten, supra, </em>414 U.S. at 147, 94 S.Ct. at 400). <em>Nelson </em>and the other cases heretofore considered by this Court in the wake of <em>Sandstrom </em>have dealt with offending language in the body of the court\u2019s principal (or only) charge, rather than in a supplemental charge such as that confronting us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">A supplemental charge must be viewed in a special light. It will enjoy special prominence in the minds of the jurors for several reasons. First, it will have been the most recent, or among the most recent, bit of instruction they will have heard, and will thus be freshest in their minds. Moreover, it will have been isolated from the other instructions they have heard, thus bringing it into the foreground of their thoughts. Because supplemental instructions are generally brief and are given during a break in the jury\u2019s deliberations, they will be received by the jurors with heightened alertness rather than with the normal attentiveness which may well flag from time to time during a lengthy initial charge. And most importantly, the supplemental charge will normally be accorded special emphasis by the jury because it will generally have been given in response to a question from the jury. The particularly telling impact of a supplemental instruction \u2014 and especially the last such instruction \u2014 upon a jury was recognized in <em>Bollenbach v. United States, supra, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">The Government suggests that the judge\u2019s misconceived \u201cpresumption\u201d was \u201cjust what it appears to be \u2014 a quite cursory, last minute, instruction on the question of the necessity of knowledge as to the stolen character of the - notes \u2014 and nothing more.\u201d But precisely because it was a \u201clast minute instruction\u201d the duty of special care was indicated in replying to a written request for further light on a vital issue by a jury whose foreman reported that they were \u201chopelessly deadlocked\u201d after they had been out seven hours.... Particularly in a criminal trial, the judge\u2019s last word is apt to be the decisive word. If it is a specific ruling on a vital issue and misleading, the error is not cured by a prior unexceptionable and unilluminating abstract charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">326 U.S. at 611-12, 66 S.Ct. at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">On the record before us there is every reason to believe that the court\u2019s presumption language made a special impression on the jurors. It was the last sentence they heard before returning for their final minutes of deliberation. It was a brief and pointed statement. And, most importantly, it gave them a way to decide the issue that had caused them, first, to ask for an interpretation of the original instructions on attempted murder, second, to ask if a shot at a police officer necessarily evinced an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tempt to murder, and third, to ask for \u201cfurther clarification of the words \u2018conscious intent\u2019.\u201d In light of this repeated questioning over the first six and one-half hours of deliberations, and in light of the jury\u2019s decision on the attempt count less than one-half hour after having heard the improper charge, it seems highly likely that the supplemental charge was in the forefront in the jurors\u2019 minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In these circumstances, we do not believe the trial court\u2019s initial unobjectionable charge on intent can be deemed to have cured the defective language in the supplemental charge. Since the initial instructions did not mention any presumption as to intent they did not give the jury any assistance in how to apply a presumption\u2014 whether they were free to disregard it, whether it was merely something they might infer, or whether the defendant had to overcome it. More importantly, the initial instructions cannot be deemed to have disinfected the later presumption language because the jury\u2019s questions reveal that the initial charge simply was not understood. In short, it is all very well as a general matter for the State to urge us to evaluate the effect of presumption language in light of the charge as a whole. But when the jurors have so little comprehended the unobjectionable initial charge that they have found it necessary to ask three times for clarification, it would be decidedly dense of us to assume that the unobjectionable initial charge, as to which enlightenment was requested, itself enlightened the jury as to the real meaning of the improper enlightenment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We find no merit in the State\u2019s argument that the supplemental charge was not important because intent was not a hotly debated issue at trial. It is true that intent has been a more prominent issue in cases such as <em>Sandstrom, </em>in which the defendant admitted killing the deceased but pleaded lack of intent due to a mental disorder aggravated by alcohol consumption. Although subtler here, the issue as to intent to murder was highlighted by Arroyo\u2019s testimony that he had merely tried to protect himself by knocking Bernard aside and fleeing, and that he did not remember firing a gun. Thus the trial testimony raised a question as to intent, and the jury\u2019s inquiries during its deliberations reveal that it had substantial uncertainty as to whether the State had proven intent to murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Nor do we find any of the State\u2019s other arguments more persuasive. For example, in contending that as a practical matter the presumption language probably had little effect, the State states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">[b]y the time the jurors heard this supplemental charge, they had already reached verdicts of guilty on four counts, and on three of those counts they had been required to find that Arroyo acted with a specific intent. Arroyo\u2019s theory that the jurors, who had three times properly found intent from the evidence without resort to a presumption, could have understood the supplemental charge as a direction <em>to ignore the evidence </em>about intent in reaching a verdict on the final count, is simply incredible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">(State\u2019s Reply Brief at 5; emphasis added.) This argument is wide of the mark, for what the sequence of events leads us to infer is not that the presumption language caused the jurors to \u201cignore the evidence about intent,\u201d but rather that it may have led them to <em>ignore their doubts </em>about that evidence. This argument by the State really amounts to a contention that the jury would not have resorted to the presumption because there was adequate evidence from which it could have found the requisite intent proven. The question, however, is not whether the jury <em>could </em>have convicted on the basis of the evidence without resort to the presumption, but whether we can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that this is what it did. <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, supra, </em>442 U.S. at 526, 99 S.Ct. at 2460. Obviously, in light of the jury\u2019s repeated requests for clarification and the relative speed of its decision after receiving the presumption language, \u201c[i]t would indeed be a long jump at guessing to be confident that the jury did not rely on the erroneous \u2018presumption\u2019 given them as a guide.\u201d <em>Bollenbach v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>United States, supra, </em>326 U.S. at 614, 66 S.Ct. at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In sum, we agree with the conclusion of the district court that the presumption language of the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that the petition for habeas corpus should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">As noted above, the New York Appellate Division, on affirming Arroyo\u2019s conviction for attempted murder, set aside the convictions on the other four charges because they were lesser-included offenses which merged with the attempted murder conviction. The district court\u2019s decision granting habeas corpus was silent as to its effect on these extinguished lesser counts. Although we affirm the decision requiring the State to release or retry Arroyo for attempted murder within sixty days, we modify the order to permit the State to seek in state court the revival of the convictions on any of the four extinguished counts. As thus modified, the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">. The trial judge\u2019s instruction on intent was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">What is intent; under our law, a person acts intentionally with respect to attempting to cause the death of another person when the alleged perpetrator\u2019s conscious objective is to cause such death. This portion of my charge is concerned itself only with the attempt to commit the crime of murder based on the intention to cause the death of a victim, of course, we all recognize that an intention is a subjective matter and it depends on the operation of an individual\u2019s mind none the less it is possible to make a finding of intention based on objective actions of the alleged perpetrator; in fact, this is the only method that we can use in determining intention since we cannot get into the mind of the alleged perpetrator. Therefore, in your deliberation, you may use the defendant\u2019s objective action as a determining factor in deciding whether or not he acted intentionally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-19\">You may also refer to all the other evidence which may indicate intent or not indicate intent. The Penal Law of the State of New York defines intentionally as follows: a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct. \u25a0</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"><em>.
