Under EPA\u2019s current, bubble concept regulation, effective October 14, 1981,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> source means an entire plant. Under the regulation previously in force,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an individual piece of process equipment within the plant ranked as a source. EPA changed its definition of source expressly to cut back substantially the coverage of nonattainment area new source review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In ruling upon EPA\u2019s regulatory change, we do not write on a clean slate. Our course is marked by two prior decisions in which panels of this court determined the applicability <em>vel non </em>of the bubble concept to distinct Clean Air Act programs. In <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, </em>636 F.2d 323 (D.C.Cir.1979), the court held EPA <em>must </em>employ the concept in the Act\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) regime, a scheme designed to <em>maintain </em>air quality in clean air areas; in <em>ASARCO, Inc. </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>578 F.2d 319 (D.C.Cir.1978), the court <em>ruled out </em>application of the concept to national new source performance standards (\u201cNSPSs\u201d) which the Act directs EPA to set with a view to <em>enhancing </em>air quality. In each case the court focused on the purpose Congress envisioned for the particular program at issue. <em>ASARCO </em>declared the bubble concept impermissible when the congressional objective was improvement, rather than simply preservation, of existing air quality. <em>See </em>578 F.2d at 327-29; <em>see also id. </em>at 330 (Leventhal, J., concurring) (challenged regulations Would contravene congressional policy contemplating that modification of a facility would bring about air quality improvement). <em>Alabama Power </em>held the concept \u201cprecisely suited\u201d to the congressional design when the intent was \u201cto preserve [existing] air quality,\u201d rather than to improve it. 636 F.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Congress, EPA does not dispute, intended the new source review requirements to operate not simply as a quality-maintaining scheme but specifically to promote the cleanup of nonattainment areas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are therefore impelled by the force of our precedent in <em>Alabama Power </em>and <em>ASARCO </em>to hold that EPA\u2019s regulatory change, its employment of the bubble concept to shrink to relatively small size mandatory new source review in nonattainment areas, is impermissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">A. <em>The Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Congress substantially redesigned the Clean Air Act in 1970 amendments <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>to better \u201c \u2018protect and enhance the quality of the Nation\u2019s air resources.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The amendments established a comprehensive federal-state program to control existing and new sources of air pollution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Central to the new design, Congress charged EPA to prescribe national ambient air quality standards (\u201cNAAQSs\u201d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and required all states to adopt, and submit to EPA for approval, State Implementation Plans (\u201cSIPs\u201d) that provide for the timely attainment of the NAAQSs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">By 1976, it was clear that many regions of the country had failed to attain the primary NAAQSs within the statutory deadline, and remained distant from those national standards. In light of this shortfall, EPA endeavored to clarify, in an interpretive rule, the circumstances in which new sources of pollution would be permitted in areas where an ambient standard had not been achieved. EPA Interpretative Ruling of December 21, 1976 (\u201cOffset Ruling\u201d), 41 Fed.Reg. 55524 (1976); see S.Rep. No.127, <em>supra </em>note 12, at 55.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Congress, however, \u201c[b]eliev[ed] that a statutory clarification of the question [was] needed,\u201d <em>id., </em>and therefore added to its 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Part D to Title I of the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Part D required states with nonattainment areas to submit revised SIPs not later than January 1, 1979. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502 note (Supp. IV 1980). These revised SIPs must demonstrate that the primary NAAQSs will be attained \u201cas expeditiously as practicable,\u201d but not later than December 31, 1982, or \u201cif the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator ... that such attainment is not possible in an area with respect to either [ozone or carbon monoxide (or both) ], ... not later than December 31, 1987.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7502(a). The SIPs must also \u201cprovide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures as expeditiously as practicable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7502(b)(2). Until the NAAQSs are attained, \u201creasonable further progress\u201d towards the standards must occur in each intervening year. Id. \u00a7 7502(b)(3).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">At the heart of the present dispute are two features of Congress\u2019 1977 alterations: the Part D permit program, id. \u00a7 7502(b)(6), and the prohibition of major new construction in nonattainment areas lacking a SIP that meets the Part D requirements (\u201cconstruction moratorium\u201d), id. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(I). Part D mandates that SIPs establish a permit program \u201cfor the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary sources\u201d in nonattainment areas. Id. \u00a7 7502(b)(6).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> States may issue a permit for construction or modification <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of a major <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> source only if four conditions are met. First, the increased emissions from the proposed source must not exceed the allowance for growth identified and quantified in the SIP pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(b)(5) or, alternatively, the applicant must obtain sufficient reductions in emissions in the nonattainment area to offset the increased emissions from the proposed source. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7503(1). Second, the proposed source must comply with the \u201clowest achievable emission rate (LAER).\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7503(2). Third, the applicant must demonstrate that all other major sources in the state under its control are in compliance (or are on a schedule for compliance) with applicable emissions limitations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7503(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Finally, no permit may be issued unless the state is carrying out the applicable implementation plan for the nonattainment area in which the proposed source is to be located. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7503(4). If the nonattainment area lacks an EPA-approved SIP that meets Part D\u2019s requirements, the \u201cconstruction moratorium\u201d becomes operative and \u201cno major stationary source [that would emit the nonattainment pollutants) ] shall be constructed or modified in [the] area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7410(a)(2)(I).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>B. <em>EPA\u2019s Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Part D, dense as it is, does not explicitly define what Congress envisioned as a \u201cstationary source\u201d to which the permit process and construction moratorium should apply. Nor is the issue squarely addressed in the legislative history. By regulation, EPA has twice attempted to provide a clear-cut answer. The response it gave on August 7, 1980, rested on the notion that Congress intended new source review to be \u201can important tool in the drive towards attainment of ambient air quality standards,\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. 52676, 52697 (1980) (\u201c1980 Regulations\u201d); EPA therefore designed its definition to subject to review more new construction projects in areas with unhealthy air than in areas where the legislative objective was simply to prevent significant deterioration of healthy air. On October 14, 1981, EPA, upon reconsideration, dramatically altered its \u201csource\u201d definition. This time, the agency focused on the \u201cregulatory burdens and complexities\u201d the 1980 definition entailed, 46 Fed.Reg. 16280, 16281 (1981), and on a \u201cstate flexibility\u201d concern. 46 Fed.Reg. 50766, 50767 (1981) (\u201c1981 Regulations\u201d). To reduce the reach of the permit and moratorium requirements, EPA conformed the nonattainment area definition of source to the definition applicable, under the PSD program, in clean air areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">1. <em>The 1980 Regulations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">In its August 7, 1980, nonattainment program implementing regulations, 45 Fed. Reg. 52676 (1980), EPA defined as a \u201cstationary source,\u201d \u201cany building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52746.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The regulations further defined \u201cbuilding, structure, [and] facility\u201d to mean, essentially, an entire plant. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cInstallation,\u201d however, was defined as \u201can identifiable piece of process equipment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defining \u201csource\u201d as both a plant and an individual piece of equipment at a plant (a \u201csource\u201d within a \u201csource\u201d) is commonly termed the \u201cdual definition.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 52696, 52697.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">EPA gave two imbricated reasons for adopting the dual definition to implement 'Part D of the Act. First, EPA inferred from the purpose, detail, and history of Part D that Congress intended application of new source review \u201cto the greatest extent possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52697. \u201cThe dual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>definition, by defining individual units as a \u2018source,\u2019 will bring more units in for review in areas with unhealthy air,\u201d EPA stated, therefore \u201cuse of [this] definition clearly is more consistent with Congressional intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, EPA observed that \u201cthe purpose of the nonattainment provisions is to \u2018positively reduce emissions,\u2019 not merely to hold emissions constant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u25a0 EPA therefore concluded that the dual definition \u201ccomports with the purposes of Part D,\u201d while \u201cuse of a plantwide definition to avoid new source review would appear to be inappropriate in nonattainment areas.\u201d<footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The August 7,1980, regulations contained a further provision at issue here. EPA ruled that \u201creconstructed facilities\u201d at a plant would be treated as new sources rather than modifications of existing sources. <em>Id. </em>at 52744. \u201cReconstruction\u201d would be presumed whenever \u201cthe fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost of a comparable entirely new stationary source.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">2. <em>The 1981 Regulations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">On October 14, 1981, the EPA repealed the dual definition trigger for new source review in nonattainment areas and adopted a plantwide definition of \u201cstationary source.\u201d 46 Fed.Reg. 50766 (1981).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Two concerns, EPA asserted, motivated this volte-face. First, regulatory complexity would be reduced for now the same definition of \u201csource\u201d would apply to both the PSD and nonattainment programs. <em>Id. </em>at 50767. Second, \u201cand more important,\u201d EPA said, the action is faithful to Congress\u2019 mandate that states \u201cplay the primary role in pollution control,\u201d for the plantwide definition of source \u201callow[s] states much greater flexibility in developing their nonattainment ... programs.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">EPA also deleted the requirement that reconstructed facilities, as defined in the August 7, 1980, regulations, be treated as new sources; the agency explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5fC\">Adoption of the plantwide definition means that the reconstruction requirement applies only to entire plants which are rebuilt. Since few if any such reconstructions are anticipated, there is little reason to retain this requirement. In addition, deletion of the requirement makes the PSD and nonattainment rules the same in this respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">On November 18, 1981, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., Citizens for a Better Environment, Inc., and Northwestern Ohio Lung Association, Inc. (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) filed the instant petition for review of EPA\u2019s October 14, 1981, regulations. Various members of the industrial community intervened in support of the altered regulations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AxI\">A. <em>The Bubble Concept</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">As stated at the outset, the central issue confronting us is whether EPA\u2019s discretion under the Clean Air Act is sufficiently broad to allow it to apply the bubble concept to the nonattainment program. Our decision, we earlier observed, is controlled by two recent adjudications of this court determining the propriety of the bubble concept as applied to two other Clean Air Act programs. We now turn to a closer examination of those prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In <em>Alabama Power </em>this court concluded that EPA, to act consistently with the purposes of the PSD program (Part C of Title I of the Act),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> must apply the bubble concept to that regulatory scheme. 636 F.2d at 401-02. In reaching this conclusion the court reviewed, in light of Part C\u2019s language and its legislative history, definitions EPA had issued for the PSD program.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">First, the court stated that in the absence of contrary congressional intent, the word \u201csource\u201d is to be defined consistently throughout the Act, as Congress defined it explicitly in Section 111(a)(3), to \u201cmean[] any building, structure, facility, or installation . ...\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Finding no contrary legislative intent with respect to the PSD program, the court held that the Section 111(a)(3) definition governed all PSD provisions. 636 F.2d at 396. Therefore, the court ruled, EPA exceeded its authority when it augmented the components of \u201csource,\u201d for Part C definitional purposes, to embrace \u201cany structure, building, facility, <em>equipment, </em>installation, <em>or operation (or combination thereof) </em>.... \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 395 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">However, the court further ruled that EPA has discretion to define, by regulation, the four components of the word \u201csource\u201d (building, structure, facility, and installation) \u201cto carry out the expressed purposes\u201d of the program at issue. <em>See id. </em>at 396. In sum, the court recognized that EPA might adopt for one Clean Air Act program regulations defining \u201cthe component terms of \u2018source\u2019 that are different in scope from\u201d regulations employed in another program \u201cdue to differences in the purpose and structure of the two programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Applying this analysis, the court declared the bubble concept \u201cprecisely suited\u201d to the goals of the PSD program, <em>\u201cpreservpng] </em>air quality within a framework that allows cost-efficient, flexible planning for industrial expansion and improvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A point-specific definition of source, in the <em>Alabama Power </em>panel\u2019s view, would be \u201ccontrary to the expressed purposes of the PSD provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The panel regarded its decision as entirely in harmony with this court\u2019s decision less than two years earlier in <em>ASARCO, Inc. v. EPA, </em>for <em>\u201cASARCO . . . </em>dealt with a significantly different regulation and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402; <em>cf. infra </em>note 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">In <em>ASARCO </em>the court \"rejected <em>in toto </em>\u201d EPA\u2019s application of the bubble concept<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> to the NSPS program.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> 578 F.2d at 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>326-27. In addition to finding the bubble regulations inconsistent with the plain language of the Act,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the court found them contrary to the basic purpose of the NSPS program, to <em>\u201cimprove </em>[ ] air quality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327 (emphasis in original). \u201cThe bubble concept in the challenged regulations would undercut [the NSPS program] by allowing operators to avoid installing the best pollution control technology on an altered facility as long as the emissions from the entire plant do not increase.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 327-28.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">These decisions, particularly the <em>Alabama Power </em>panel\u2019s reconciliation of its holding with <em>ASARCO, see supra </em>note 37, establish as the law of this Circuit a bright line test for determining the propriety of EPA\u2019s resort to a bubble concept. The bubble concept, <em>Alabama Power </em>declares, is mandatory for Clean Air Act programs designed merely to maintain existing air quality; it is inappropriate, both <em>ASARCO </em>and <em>Alabama Power </em>plainly signal, in programs enacted to improve the quality of the ambient air.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Applying the <em>Alabama Power-ASARCO </em>test to the nonattainment provisions of the Act, we must conclude that the bubble concept may not be employed in that scheme.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The nonattainment program\u2019s <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>is to ameliorate the air\u2019s quality in nonattainment areas sufficiently to achieve expeditious compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>NAAQSs.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>note 6 and accompanying text. This purpose comfortably places Part D on the \u201cimproving\u201d side of the line drawn by <em>Alabama Power </em>and <em>ASARCO </em>and thus rules out application of the bubble concept to the nonattainment program.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">EPA argues that we have misperceived the purpose and nature of the nonattainment program. The agency asserts that a fundamental purpose of the nonattainment scheme is to afford the states flexibility in designing revised SIPs which will attain compliance with the NAAQSs. <em>See </em>EPA Brief at 20-23 (quoting H.R.Rep.No.294, <em>supra </em>note 38, at 211). The bubble concept, EPA argues, would further this statutory purpose by leaving the states with considerable authority to define source as they believe best-advised: they might adopt the bubble concept or, if necessary for timely attainment, a more stringent standard. Regardless of the method chosen, EPA maintains, the states remain under an obligation to submit and comply with a revised SIP that assures improved air quality. Fulfillment of the other prime purposes of the nonattainment program, timely compliance with the NAAQSs and reasonable further progress toward that goal, EPA asserts, is thereby assured. Thus, EPA concludes, application of the bubble concept to the nonattainment scheme fits neatly within the \u201cpurpose\u201d language of <em>Alabama Power. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">As we recently pointed out, <em>see Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>684 F.2d 111, 118 &amp; n.36 (D.C.Cir.1982), the legal significance of a word or phrase must be gleaned from the context in which it is used. In the <em>Alabama Power-ASARCO </em>context, \u201cpurpose\u201d clearly means goal, objective. The goal of the nonattainment program is undoubtedly to improve air quality in regions lagging behind in meeting the NAAQSs. Offering flexibility to the states may be a method of attaining that objective, but it is not an independent goal of the nonattainment scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">We further note that the permit and moratorium provisions of Part D are wholly federal requirements imposed on the states. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7503 (Supp. IV 1980).

In promulgating the August 7, 1980, regulations, EPA clearly expressed its belief that the dual definition, by \u201cbringpng] in more sources or modifications for review than would the plant-wide definition\u201d was \u201cmore consistent with Congressional intent\u201d to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and require better pollution control technology in nonattainment areas. 1980 Regulations, 45 Fed.Reg. at 52697-98. In explaining its October 14, 1981, revisions, EPA suggested just the opposite: the dual definition may in fact retard improvement in air quality by discouraging replacement of older processes or equipment with newer, cleaner varieties. 1981 Regulations, 46 Fed.Reg. at 50768; <em>see also </em>Notice, 46 Fed.Reg. at 16281.
