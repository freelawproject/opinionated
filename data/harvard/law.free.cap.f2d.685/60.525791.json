Cannella, J., affirming a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services terminating Rutherford\u2019s entitlement to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits on the ground he was not disabled within the meaning of \u00a7 1614(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">In 1975, plaintiff, a forty-four-year-old male, applied for disability benefits, and his application was processed under both Sub-chapter II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-431, and Subchapter XVI, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383. The definitions of disability under both Subchapters are substantially the same. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>623 F.2d 212, 216 n.4 (2 Cir. 1980). Plaintiffs claim under Subchapter XVI initially was denied. A year later, on August 23,1976, it was allowed. Plaintiff\u2019s claim under Sub-chapter II also was allowed, although not at the same time. However, plaintiff was not placed on benefit status with regard to the Subchapter II claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Because of the conflict in entitlement findings, the Subchapter II award was reviewed by the Social Security Administration in June, 1977. The disability examiner and reviewing physician secured a Psychiatric Consultative Evaluation from Dr. Arthur Meisel, who reported that, although claimant was a chronic alcoholic, he was alert, cooperative, and responded well to questions and directions. Dr. Meisel\u2019s report stated that plaintiff had a history of blackouts and seizures precipitated by alcoholism, but his symptoms had stabilized during the preceding year, and seizure activity had decreased. Plaintiff\u2019s neurological examination was essentially negative, except for a mild organic brain syndrome which was under good medical control at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">The disability examiner and physician also reviewed a report from the Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, which showed that plaintiff had commenced a voluntary treatment program for alcoholism on April 20, 1977. At the time of his admission to the program, plaintiff was sober, well motivated, goal directed and reality oriented. He was not psychotic and had no memory impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Based on these reports, the examiner concluded that plaintiff was \u201cnever under a severe disability\u201d, a \u201cdisability that would have affected him in terms of work related functions.\u201d The examiner decided that the Subchapter II claim should be denied \u201cbased on medical factors alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">In 1979, two disability examiners and two physicians reviewed plaintiff\u2019s Subchapter XVI claim and reached substantially the same conclusion, <em>i.e., </em>that plaintiff\u2019s physical impairments did not restrict him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>terms of work-related functions. Disability was terminated effective November 1979. Plaintiff was granted a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), at which he was represented by counsel. In a decision dated July 30, 1980, the ALJ agreed with the examiners\u2019 findings as to cessation of disability and directed that payments to plaintiff be discontinued as of the end of January, 1980. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(5). Plaintiff\u2019s request for review by the Appeals Council was denied on September 26, 1980, and the instant suit was then commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">On September 29, 1981, Judge Camella granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On an appeal such as this, we are faced with a simple reality which appellants often overlook, namely, that factual issues need not have been resolved by the Secretary in accordance with what we conceive to be the preponderance of the evidence. Congress has instructed us that the factual findings of the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); <em>Rivera v. Harris, supra, </em>623 F.2d at 216. We would be derelict in our duties if we simply paid lip service to this rule, while shaping our holding to conform to our own interpretation of the evidence. <em>Bastien v. Califano, </em>572 F.2d 908, 912 (2d Cir. 1978). We agree with Judge Cannella that there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s principle contention on this appeal relates to his alcoholism. Plaintiff contends, and the Secretary agrees, that chronic alcoholism can be disabling if it results in' serious personality disorders as set forth in 20 C.F.R. App. I, \u00a7 12.04 or in a substantial physical impairment, <em>Singletary </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>623 F.2d 217, 220 (2d Cir. 1980). However, if there is a continuing interrelationship between the excess consumption of alcohol and the disability, such that termination of the former will end the latter, the issue for the Secretary is whether the claimant has lost the voluntary ability to control his drinking. <em>Adams v. Weinberger, </em>548 F.2d 239, 244 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The ALJ found that plaintiff\u2019s seizures or black-out spells were alcohol induced. This finding was supported by the medical proof, and plaintiff himself conceded that he had seizures only when he drank. The record also shows that plaintiff voluntarily participated in alcohol treatment programs. For example, after plaintiff voluntarily entered the treatment program at Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in April 1977, he remained sober until May 1978. Within a week after he resumed drinking plaintiff voluntarily referred himself to the Kings County Hospital Center for further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Dr. Head, who examined plaintiff on November 13, 1979, described the plaintiff in much the same manner as had Dr. Meisel in 1977. Dr. Head said that plaintiff was alert and oriented, that his memory, comprehension and concentration were intact, and that there was no evidence of delusions, hallucinations, phobias, obsessions, compulsions, or psychosomatic difficulties. Plaintiff was able to travel around the city on his own, do his own chores and shopping, and attend to his own needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Dr. Head reported that plaintiff had been in an alcohol treatment program for six years and was then attending three to four times a week. He stated that plaintiff had been able to \u201cat least overcome his alcoholism temporarily.\u201d Dr. Head felt that plaintiff needed to continue his treatment program and would benefit from vocational rehabilitation and guidance. He failed however \u201cto find any evidence of major psychopathology which would totally preclude this patient from working at the present time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The ALJ, after referring specifically to Dr. Head\u2019s report, found that plaintiff had no significant secondary damage because of alcoholism, that his seizure disorder resulted from alcohol abuse, but that he was in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>alcohol treatment program. He also found that, as of November 1979, plaintiff\u2019s \u201calcoholism and other impairments were not of a severity to significantly affect his capacity to perform basic work-related functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Dr. Geller, Medical Consultant for the Bureau of Disability Insurance, reported on January 8, 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">Claimant has a moderate impairment by virtue of his seizure disorder which is under far [sic] control since he has abstained from alcohol, however he should not work around heavy machinery or in situations where seizures may be hazardous to himself or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The ALJ also noted that plaintiff had diabetes, which was treated with oral medication, arthritis, hypertension and a mild respiratory disorder. He stated, however, that \u201cmedical evidence does not show that any of these conditions impose significant limitations upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform basic work-related functions\u201d, and that, apart from the effects of alcohol abuse, there was an \u201cabsence of evidence of any other severe impairment.\u201d The ALJ made specific reference to plaintiff\u2019s complaints of pain, but obviously was not impressed. He noted plaintiff\u2019s concession that his only pain medication was Tylenol, a non-prescription drug that may be found in almost any family\u2019s medicine cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Following the hearing before the ALJ on May 14,1980, plaintiff\u2019s attorney requested and was given two extensions of time in which to submit supplemental medical reports. The only report submitted was from the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center showing that plaintiff had reported to the Center on May 29, 1980, complaining of headaches. Plaintiff told the hospital staff that his headaches occurred three or four times a week and that each of them lasted three or four days. The report indicated that plaintiff\u2019s blood pressure was 130/88, which was hardly indicative of hypertension. The report contained no objective findings to explain the headaches or to justify a claim of disability resulting from them. Other hospital reports in the record give no greater support to plaintiff\u2019s claim of disabling pain. The ALJ was entitled to rely on these negative reports, on the equally negative reports of the doctors,, and on his own evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s and his sister\u2019s credibility in determining whether plaintiff suffered such serious pain as to be disabled. <em>Miles v. Harris, </em>645 F.2d 122, 124 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">We agree with Judge Cannella that the Secretary\u2019s determination was based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence and that there was substantial evidence to support it. The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b159-11\">TIMBERS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZm\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">I regret that I am unable to concur in Judge Van Graafeiland\u2019s characteristically well written majority opinion. In dealing with one of the most disabling illnesses of our society \u2014 chronic alcoholism, I think it is critical that proper legal standards be applied in evaluating the evidence before denying or cutting off Social Security benefits. In my view neither the Secretary nor the ALJ applied proper legal standards here. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Although the Secretary\u2019s decision ordinarily will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence, application of improper legal standards in evaluating the evidence alone is ground for reversal. <em>See Marcus v. Califano, </em>615 F.2d 23, 27 (2 Cir. 1979); <em>Northcutt v. Califano, </em>581 F.2d 164, 167 (8 Cir. 1978). I shall confine my discussion to the legal standards applied by the ALJ. Consequently I find it neither necessary nor appropriate to reach the substantial evidence issue addressed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">In my view the ALJ failed to apply proper legal standards in two respects: first, he improperly evaluated the evidence concerning appellant\u2019s alcoholism; and second, he failed to analyze sufficiently the interrelationship of the various factors relevant to a determination of appellant\u2019s disability. I shall discuss each of these in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">APPELLANT\u2019S ALCOHOLISM</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">All of the exhibits submitted prior to and during the administrative hearing established that appellant is an alcoholic. Furthermore, although there was evidence that at times he had abstained temporarily from drinking, all of the doctors who examined him recognized that he is a chronic alcoholic. This diagnostic consensus apparently persuaded the ALJ that appellant\u2019s \u201cchief limitations are the result of alcohol abuse.\u201d App. at 7. The ALJ then proceeded, however, to apply several inappropriate criteria in determining the relationship of appellant\u2019s alcoholism to his disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">First, the ALJ remarked that \u201c[sjince the [appellant\u2019s] alleged seizures, or black-out spells, are alcohol induced, it is apparent that simple abstinence would remove this disorder.\u201d App. at 6. This simplistic approach to a serious illness has been sharply criticized by courts and represents no more than the ALJ\u2019s nonexpert conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Adams v. Weinberger, </em>548 F.2d 239, 244 (8 Cir. 1977) (ALJ should have focused on alcohol addiction and voluntary ability to control its use rather than on the inability to abstain from alcohol consumption); <em>Griffis v. Weinberger, </em>509 F.2d 837, 838 n.1 (9 Cir. 1975) (\u201cSome alcoholics can stop; more cannot.\u201d). To the extent that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion reflected his own personal predilections about an individual\u2019s ability to abstain from drinking, they were wholly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Second, the only substantive reference in the ALJ\u2019s findings to why appellant\u2019s alcoholism was not a sufficient disability was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">\u201cThe medical evidence establishes that the claimant\u2019s seizure disorder is a result of alcohol abuse, that the claimant is in an alcohol treatment program, and that the claimant has no significant secondary damage because of alcoholism.\u201d App. at 7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Only the latter two clauses provide any possible indication of the standards the ALJ might have used to evaluate appellant\u2019s alcoholism. I shall discuss each of these in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">\n<em>Participation in Alcohol Treatment Program.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">Although the ALJ never explained how appellant\u2019s participation in an alcohol treatment program is relevant to the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant was not disabled, it appears that the ALJ viewed this involvement as indicative either of appellant\u2019s ability to control his drinking or of the likelihood that appellant\u2019s drinking problems will diminish with continued treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">In my opinion, it is unnecessary to pursue further either construction of the ALJ\u2019s statement. This is so because appellant was required by statute to undergo treatment at an institution recognized by the Secretary as a prerequisite for continued eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(3)(A) (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently this fact has no possible legal relevance to the question of whether appellant is disabled. It seems hardly fair or sensible to penalize appellant for participating in an alcohol treatment program in compliance with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\n<em>Significant Secondary Damage.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The ALJ also relied on the apparent absence of evidence that appellant had sustained \u201csignificant secondary damage because of alcoholism.\u201d App. at 7. Although such a medical finding in the past has led courts to bar alcoholics from obtaining SSI benefits, chronic addiction and loss of voluntary ability to control the use of alcohol has been recognized increasingly as a basis for disability, regardless of organ damage. <em>See Adams v. Weinberger, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 243 (\u201cBy focusing on \u2018the absence of evidence that claimant has significant organ damage that precludes work activity,\u2019 the Administrative Law Judge and Appeals Council applied an improper legal standard .... \u201d); <em>Griffis </em>v. <em>Weinberger, supra, </em>509 F.2d at 838 (\u201cThe presence or absence of \u2018underlying\u2019 physical or mental impairment as accompaniments or products of the disease may be relevant evidence relating to the decision of [whether the claimant is disabled], but absence of them is not controlling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Accordingly, in my view, the ALJ should have gone beyond mere recitation of an absence of significant secondary damage and should have evaluated appellant\u2019s alcoholism according to his voluntary ability to control its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">INTERRELATIONSHIP OF FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In addition to evaluating appellant\u2019s alcoholism according to improper legal standards, the ALJ failed to interrelate adequately the various factors that are commonly applied in SSI cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Four factors traditionally are considered in determining whether a disability exists: (1) objective medical facts and clinical findings; (2) diagnoses and medical opinions of examining physicians; (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability as described by the claimant and corroborated by others who have observed him; and (4) claimant\u2019s age, educational background, and work history. <em>Underwood v. Ribicoff, </em>298 F.2d 850, 851 (4 Cir. 1962). These factors must be considered in combination with each other. <em>Id.; see also DePaepe </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>464 F.2d 92, 94 (5 Cir. 1972) (\u201cIt is obvious that <em>all </em>of these elements of proof must be considered together and in combination with each other, and not just one or two with the others excluded.\u201d); <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>431 F.Supp. 421, 423 (S.D.N.Y.1977) (\u201cAll of these elements of proof must be considered together and in combination with each other.\u201d); <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>424 F.Supp. 474, 478 (W.D.N.Y.1977) (the four elements should be considered interrelatedly). It is not sufficient therefore under established law merely to consider each factor in <em>isolation </em>(which the ALJ did here) without analyzing the <em>collective </em>effect of the several variables (which the ALJ did not do here).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">As stated above, the ALJ did address separately each of these four factors in his decision. He did review some of the medical findings and diagnostic opinions, mentioned that appellant testified at the hearing about \u201csevere pain from arthritis and severe headaches,\u201d App. at 6, and briefly summarized appellant\u2019s educational and work background. The ALJ made no effort, however, to interrelate these separable items and assess their total impact on the question of appellant\u2019s disability. For example, appellant is a functional illiterate who has worked at primarily unskilled occupations. In addition to his alcoholism, he suffers from arthritis, diabetes, dizziness and frequent headaches. Furthermore, he experiences blackouts, a condition that has been connected to appellant\u2019s alcoholism. The ALJ has left wholly unanswered the critical question of how these facts, when analyzed in combination, affect appellant\u2019s disability. Surely the combined effect of appellant\u2019s age (48 at the time the Social Security Administrator determined that he no longer was sufficiently disabled to warrant continued SSI benefits), illiteracy, and assorted illnesses would more likely lead to a finding of disability than if each item were examined in isolation. <em>See Dillon </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>345 F.2d 753, 757 (4 Cir. 1965) (criticizing the fragmentation of the claimant\u2019s ailments).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In urging a remand to enable the ALJ to make some effort at analyzing the interrelationship of the four <em>Underwood </em>factors, I am not suggesting that the ALJ did not carefully consider the testimony and exhibits. In his opinion, the ALJ said that he \u201ccarefully considered all the testimony given at the hearing and the documents described in the List of Exhibits attached to [his] decision.\u201d App. at 6. There is no reason to question this assertion. <em>See Miles v. Harris, </em>645 F.2d 122, 124 (2 Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The point, however, is that it is imperative that an ALJ satisfactorily make clear in his decision that he has applied the appropriate analytical formula in reaching his conclusion. In this case, the ALJ has not adequately demonstrated that he has properly applied the four factor test that is appropriate in SSI cases..</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">I would vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Secretary for reconsideration in light of the correct legal standards outlined above. From the majority\u2019s refusal to do so, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. The ALJ\u2019s discussion of appellant\u2019s alcoholism was especially significant in this case because the ALJ asserted that alcoholism was appellant\u2019s chief limitation. App. at 7. He accordingly gave less weight to appellant\u2019s other medical problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(3)(A) in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u201cNo person who is an aged, blind, or disabled individual solely by reason of disability ... shall be an eligible individual ... if such individual is medically determined to be a drug addict or an alcoholic <em>unless </em>such individual is undergoing any treatment that may be appropriate for his condition as a drug addict or alcoholic ... at an institution or facility approved ... by the Secretary ... and demonstrates that he is complying with the terms, conditions, and requirements of such treatment____\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
