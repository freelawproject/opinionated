We dismiss the appeal because the district court\u2019s action was not a final, appealable order; in the alternative, we find the appeal is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), and accordingly dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">Appellee Kenneth Royal brought this action in a Louisiana state court to compel payment under a fire insurance policy. Royal, a Louisiana resident, named State Farm and its local agent Ken Adams as defendants. Adams is also a Louisiana resident; State Farm is incorporated and has its principal place of business in Illinois. State Farm removed the action to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, alleging that Adams had been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity. The district court remanded, stating its belief that Louisiana law might possibly provide a cause of action against the agent as well as the principal in these circumstances, and that joinder of the non-diverse agent was therefore not fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">On remand, the state court granted an \u201cException of No Cause of Action\u201d with respect to Adams, dismissing him from the case. Over sixty days later, two days after the time to appeal Adams\u2019 dismissal had expired, State Farm filed a second removal petition realleging diversity jurisdiction. In a memorandum ruling, the district court once again remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">The district court based its decision on two grounds: (1) a case non-remoVable on the initial pleadings may become removable if the plaintiff <em>voluntarily </em>dismisses a non-diverse defendant but not if the dismissal is <em>involuntary, </em>and (2) the removal petition was untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). For the first proposition the court cited <em>Weems v. Louis Dreyfus Corp., </em>380 F.2d 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>(5th Cir. 1967), <em>Self v. General Motors Corp., </em>588 F.2d 655 (9th Cir. 1978), and <em>Phillips v. Unijax, Inc., </em>625 F.2d 54 (5th Cir. 1980). The court concluded that the case \u201cwas improvidently removed and that the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">State Farm now seeks appellate review of the district court\u2019s order. Although this matter is before us as a direct appeal, we note that a remand order, alone, does not ordinarily constitute a final, appealable judgment; accordingly, review of such an order, when permitted, should be by mandamus rather than direct appeal. <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 352-53, 96 S.Ct. 584, 593-94, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976). We therefore lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and must dismiss the appeal. Moreover, as we now show, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) precludes review of this case \u201con appeal or otherwise.\u201d Hence, even if State Farm had correctly chosen mandamus as a means to obtain review, or if we now construed its appeal liberally as a request for such relief, dismissal would be required. <em>See generally Self </em>v. <em>Self, </em>614 F.2d 1026 (5th Cir. 1980) (dismissal of attempted direct appeal); <em>London v. United States Fire Insurance Co., </em>531 F.2d 257 (5th Cir. 1976) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We begin by noting that although the parties do not mention \u00a7 1447(d) in their briefs, this section presents a threshold question of jurisdiction that the appellate courts must consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>whenever the question arises. <em>See, e.g., Live and Let Live, Inc. v. Carlsberg Mobile Home Properties, Ltd.\u2014</em>\u201973, 592 F.2d 846, 848 (5th Cir. 1979). Section 1447(d) by its terms provides a clear mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR4\">Section 1443 pertains to removal in civil rights cases and is not applicable here. Although the terms of section 1447(d) suggest an absolute bar to review of remand orders, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), requires an additional inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>Thermtron </em>held that sections 1447(c) and (d) must be read together, and that only the remand orders authorized by section 1447(c) are immunized from review. 423 U.S. at 345, 96 S.Ct. at 590. Section 1447(c) provides that \u201cIf at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case . ... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (1976). The district court in <em>Thermtron </em>had remanded on the ground that its docket was too crowded to afford the litigants a reasonably speedy trial; because this was a non-1447(c) ground, the Court held, the district court had exceeded its statutorily defined power and review was not barred. 423 U.S. at 351, 96 S.Ct. at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">As <em>Thermtron </em>itself stated, however, \u201cif a trial judge <em>purports </em>to remand a case on the ground that it was removed \u2018improvidently and without jurisdiction,\u2019 his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 96 S.Ct. at 589. (emphasis added; see <em>also Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977). This circuit defers to a district court\u2019s finding that remand is appropriate under 1447(c); the <em>Thermtron </em>exception applies only when the district court has affirmatively stated and relied upon a non-1447(c) ground for remand. <em>See In re </em>Weaver, 610 F.2d 335, 337 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>In re Merrimack Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>587 F.2d 642, 648 (5th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once section 1447(c) is invoked, therefore, review of the merits is barred \u201cno matter how clearly erroneous the order appears on its face.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Volvo of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>America Corp. v. Schwarzer, </em>429 U.S. 1331, 97 S.Ct. 284, 50 L.Ed.2d 273 (1976) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice); <em>Live and Let Live, Inc. v. Carlsberg Mobile Home Properties, Ltd.</em>\u2014\u201973, 592 F.2d 846, 848 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The district court in this case expressly based remand on the finding that the case was removed \u201cimprovidently and without jurisdiction\u201d and its order states only section 1447(c) grounds. Untimely filing of the removal petition, for example, is a defect causing \u201cimprovident\u201d removal. <em>London v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>531 F.2d 257, 260 (5th Cir. 1976). In addition, the district court purported to use the \u201cvol-' untary-involuntary\u201d rule as a test of diversity jurisdiction for purposes of removal. <em>Cf. Self v. General Motors, </em>588 F.2d 655, 658 (9th Cir. 1978) (\u201cThe voluntary-involuntary rule ... applies to the diversity requirement\u201d). Accordingly, section 1447(d) applies and we cannot reach the merits of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">.
