WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1179-20\">The Miller-Wohl Company fired Tamara Buley because she missed several days of work. Buley was pregnant. Her pregnancy-related illness caused her absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-21\">The company\u2019s employment policy permits no sick leave nor leave of absence for any illness during the first year of employment. Regardless what illness or condition causes a new employee\u2019s absence, he or she is discharged for missing work. The company claims it applies this policy consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-22\">Two statutes are involved. The Montana Maternity Leave Act (MMLA) proscribes an employer\u2019s termination of a woman\u2019s employment or refusal to grant a reasonable leave of absence because she is pregnant. Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-7-203(1), (2). And in Title VII, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k) (Supp. II 1978), declares that pregnant women shall be treated the same as nonpregnant employees similar in their ability or inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-23\">Buley complained to the Montana Commissioner of Labor and Industry who concluded that the discharge violated the MMLA because Miller-Wohl fired her for pregnancy-related absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-24\">Miller-Wohl sued in district court for declaratory relief. It argues that the MMLA conflicts with the PDA because it requires an employer to treat pregnant employees preferentially. It asserts that Title VII preempts the application of the contrary state provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-25\">The company\u2019s argument rests on the plain language of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-26\">The terms \u201cbecause of sex\u201d or \u201con the basis of sex\u201d include .. . pregnancy . . .; and' women affected by pregnancy . . . shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes ... as other per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>sons not [pregnant] but similar in their ability or inability to work ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k) (Supp. II 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The PDA expressly requires employers to treat pregnant women the same as similarly able nonpregnant persons. Women who are disabled because they are pregnant must be treated the same as women or men who are disabled for any other reason. Because the Montana Act requires Miller-Wohl to treat its pregnant employees differently, the company argues, it violates Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Not unexpectedly, the Commissioner and Buley, defendants in Miller-Wohl\u2019s declaratory judgment action, and amici curiae, including the EEOC, argue that the MMLA does not fail under Title VII. They contend that, although the company\u2019s policy is facially neutral, it violates Title VII because it exerts a disparate impact based on sex. <em>E.g., Dothard v. Rawlinson, </em>433 U.S. 321, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977). <em>See also Abraham v. Graphic Arts International Union, </em>660 F.2d 811 (D.C.Cir.1981); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.10(c) (1981) (EEOC Guidelines). Because Title VII would require a leave policy to provide a reasonable period for pregnancy, the result achieved by the MMLA, they contend the two statutes do not conflict and both may apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">The district court agreed and granted summary judgment against Miller-Wohl. It held that the company should provide a reasonable leave period for all first-year employees rather than permit no sick leave for pregnant employees. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.10 (questions &amp; answers 19, 29, 30) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">However intriguing these arguments, we conclude this court lacks jurisdiction to decide the question. The federal claims contained in Miller-Wohl\u2019s declaratory judgment complaint are defenses to the employee\u2019s state claim. They fail to create the requisite federal question. <em>See, e.g., Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 673, 70 S.Ct. 876, 879, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950); <em>Guinasso </em>v. <em>Pacific First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>656 F.2d 1364, 1366 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, - - -, 102 S.Ct. 1716-17, 72 L.Ed.2d 138 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-15\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-02, is procedural. It provides an additional remedy, but only in cases resting on some independent basis of federal jurisdiction. <em>Alton Box Board Co. v. Esprit De Corp., </em>682 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1982). Here, Miller-Wohl\u2019s anticipation of a federal defense to a state claim is insufficient to state that independent basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-16\">Buley\u2019s claim lies entirely within the Montana statute. That Miller-Wohl asserts a preemption defense, in the form of a declaratory judgment complaint, does not change its essential nature as a defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Gully v. First National Bank in Meridian, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112-18, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97-100, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936) (jurisdictional basis must appear in complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-17\">Federal law does not impose a remedy by displacing state law, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-7, nor does it define rights, duties, or relationships upon which the state claim depends. <em>See Guinasso, </em>656 F.2d at 1367 &amp; n.7; <em>cf. Franchise Tax Board of California v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>679 F.2d 1307, at 1308 n.1 (9th Cir. 1982) (federal question requirement satisfied in state\u2019s action challenging a trust created under a federal statute and naming a fiduciary defined by and subject to duties contained in federal statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-18\">All of Miller-Wohl\u2019s defenses that are federal in nature may be raised in its defense in the state courts. Indeed, they all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>are asserted in the company\u2019s petition for review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination that it violated the MMLA. Every issue pleaded in its federal complaint, as well as several defenses based solely on state law, appear in that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment, 515 F.Supp. 1264. It had no jurisdiction, Similarly, we dismiss this appeal because we have no jurisdiction to decide its merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">. Miller-Wohl also invokes the equal protection clause. That claim, like its statutory claim, is directed toward an anticipated application of the MMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">If any constitutional rights are directly affected, <em>but see Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974); <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), they are those of male employees, not of Miller-Wohl. The company asserts no federal claim of its own, constitutional or statutory, sufficient to confer jurisdiction under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 or \u00a7 1331. See <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 8 n.6, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2506 n.6, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
