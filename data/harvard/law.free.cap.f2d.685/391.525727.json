Miller, Judge for the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b482-10\">MILLER, Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">This appeal is from the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiff-appellant\u2019s action upon the court\u2019s approval of the Magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the motion for summary judgment of defendant-appellee Ford Motor Credit Company (\u201cFMCC\u201d) be granted and plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment be denied. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">The action was brought under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (hereinafter \u201cAct\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq,, </em>as amended, to recover statutory damages plus court costs and attorney fees. The controversy grew out of appellant\u2019s purchase of a used Buick automobile from Neal Pope Ford, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia, under a Georgia Automobile Retail Installment Contract, dated September 9,1980. The contract provides, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asig\">(13) PREPAYMENT REBATE: The Buyer may pay this contract in full at any time. If he does so, he will get a credit for the unearned part of the Finance Charge if it is $1.00 or more. This credit will be figured on the sum of the digits method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-18\">(14) LATE CHARGES: ... The Creditor may accelerate the remaining payments and repossess the Vehicle as explained below, if there is any default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-19\">(15) DEFAULT: If the Buyer fails to make any payment when it is due . .. the Creditor may do either or both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-20\">(a) ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS: The Creditor may require the Buyer to pay at once all remaining payments. The Buyer will receive a prepayment rebate as explained above when he pays.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-21\">(b) REPOSSESSION: ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">Appellant argues, first, that FMCC violated Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.8(b)(7),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of the Federal Reserve Board because FMCC\u2019s policy on rebate of unearned interest (using the pro rata method) in the event of acceleration of payments due to default under the contract differed from that specified in the event of voluntary prepayment (using the sum of the digits method), quoting from <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 562, 100 S.Ct. 790, 795, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">Section 226.8(b)(7), therefore, squares with the position of the Federal Reserve Board staff that specific disclosure of acceleration rebate policy is only necessary when that policy <em>varies </em>from the custom with respect to voluntary prepayment rebates. [Emphasis added.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">However, the meaning of \u201cvaries\u201d was clarified by the Court later in Part III of its opinion <em>(id. </em>at 565 n.8,100 S.Ct. at 796 n.8), thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">As we read the Staff Opinion and Letters, however, they are fundamentally consistent .... The staff\u2019s position in each appears to be that separate disclosure of acceleration rebate practices is unnecessary when those practices parallel voluntary prepayment rebate policy. On the other hand, <em>where acceleration rebates are less than voluntary prepayment rebates, acceleration policy must be separately explained </em>under \u00a7 226.8(b)(4) and, perhaps as well, under \u00a7 226.8(b)(7). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The rule requiring separate <em>disclosure </em>of acceleration rebate practices <em>only </em>when such rebates are <em>less </em>(not equal to or greater) than rebates under voluntary prepayment has been adopted by the Fifth Circuit. <em>McDaniel v. Fulton National Bank of Atlanta, </em>5 Cir., 571 F.2d 948, 951 (1978) (en banc).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This, of course, is \u201cbinding precedent\u201d for the Eleventh Circuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, in <em>McDaniel, </em>commented that the Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretation (No. FC-0054) \u201cis a practical one in a debatable area, is not plainly wrong, and should \u2014 if followed by the courts \u2014 produce uniformity in a matter where uniformity is very desirable.\u201d Significantly, the Supreme Court in <em>Milhollin, </em>while citing <em>McDaniel, </em>manifested no intent to disturb the rule adopted by the Fifth Circuit in <em>McDaniel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that FMCC violated Regulation Z, 12 CFR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>226.6(c), of the Federal Reserve Board<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because FMCC\u2019s contract disclosed that the method of rebating unearned interest was the same on acceleration due to default as on voluntary prepayment (viz., the sum of the digits method) when they were not the same, the pro rata method being used on acceleration. Appellant asserts that she was \u201centitled to know\u201d that if she allowed her contract with FMCC to go into default, she would receive more unearned interest as a rebate than if she voluntarily prepaid the installments owing under the contract. There are two answers to this. First, the only disclosure <em>required </em>by the regulation in this case was that concerning rebate on voluntary prepayment, and no misinformation was provided by FMCC <em>with respect to it. </em>Any possible \u201cconfusion\u201d of appellant would relate to rebate in the event of acceleration upon default which was <em>not required </em>to be disclosed. Thus, subsection (c) of the regulation is inapplicable to this case. <em>Fox v. Heilig-Meyers Co., </em>681 F.2d 212 (4th Cir. 1982); <em>see Gallois v. Commercial Securities Co., </em>661 F.2d 901 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Philbeck v. Timmers Chevrolet, Inc., </em>499 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1974). Second, to adopt appellant\u2019s approach would tend to encourage defaults by buyers under installment contracts contrary to good business prac<em>tices </em>\u2014 a result that should not be imputed to the Act in the absence of a showing of clear Congressional intent. Such intent is absent here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-13\">. Although, as indicated above, a prepayment rebate credit of the unearned part of the finance charge is stated to be figured on the sum of the digits method, FMCC has a policy, in the event of acceleration due to <em>default, </em>of rebating by using the pro rata method, which results in a <em>larger </em>rebate than would be received under the sum of the digits method. It is clear that under Georgia law the rebate under acceleration of payments due to <em>default </em>will be <em>no less </em>than that figured by the sum of the digits method. Ga.Code Ann. 96-1004(c) and 96-1005 (effective March 20, 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-24\">. Subsection (7) requires the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-25\">Identification of the method of computing any unearned portion of the finance charge in the event of prepayment in full of an obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>tion which includes precomputed finance charges and a statement of the amount or method of computation of any charge that may be deducted from the amount of any rebate of such unearned finance charge that will be credited to an obligation or refunded to the customer. If the credit contract does not provide for any rebate of unearned finance charges upon prepayment in full, this fact shall be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Appellant recognizes that subsection (4) of 12 CFR 226.8(b) requires disclosure of the method of rebate on acceleration for default only when the rebate of unearned interest is <em>less </em>than that provided on voluntary prepayment, but emphasizes that the disclosure requirement under subsection (4) is not the same as that under subsection (7). Subsection (4) requires disclosure of \u201c[t]he amount, or method of computing the amount, of any default, delinquency, or similar charges payable in the event of late payments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">. The Court (id. at 563, 100 S.Ct. at 795) referred to\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">the view of the Federal Reserve Board staff that the right of acceleration need <em>not </em>be disclosed, and that rebate practice under acceleration must be disclosed only if it differs from the creditor\u2019s rebate policy with respect to voluntary prepayment. [Citing FRB Official Staff Interpretation No. FC-0054, 12 CFR Part 226 Appendix, p. 650 (1981); FRB Public Information Letter No. 851 (1974), (1974-1977 Transfer Binder) CCH Consumer Credit Guide Par. 31,173; FRB Public Information Letter No. 1208 (1977), <em>id., </em>Par. 31,647; FRB Public Information Letter No. 1324 (1978), 5 CCH Consumer Credit Guide Par. 31,827.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-17\">. In a subsequent rehearing en banc (576 F.2d 1156, 1157 (1978)), the Fifth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-18\">But if the creditor possesses under his contract the right to retain more unearned interest in the event of accelerated payment pursuant to default than in that of voluntary prepayment ... then the existence of that right in him must be disclosed \u2014 and this entirely without regard to whether or how he exercises that right in the event.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-19\">. <em>Bonner v.

Subsection (c) provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\"><em>Additional information. </em>At the creditor\u2019s . . . option, additional information or explanations may be supplied with any disclosure required by this part, but none shall be stated ... so as to mislead or confuse the customer</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\">. The dissenting opinion speculates that, if appellant prevails, FMCC \u201cwould have to change its procedure and defaults by buyers would no longer be encouraged,\u201d but this simply overlooks the requirements of Georgia law, note 1, <em>supra, </em>and the competitive market in the credit industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b484-17\">.

The courts continue to have difficulty in interpreting various loan or finance contract clauses providing for rebate of unearned interest resulting from (1) voluntary prepayment or from (2) accelerated prepayment caused by default. The majority and I differ in the interpretation of <em>Ford Motor Credit Company v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\"><em>Milhollin </em>holds that when a creditor rebates unearned interest at differing rates for these separate precipitating causes, both methods must be disclosed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">The Federal Reserve Board staff treatment of acceleration disclosure rationally accommodates the conflicting demands for completeness and for simplicity. In determining that acceleration rebate practices need be disclosed <em>only when they diverge from other prepayment rebate practices, </em>the Federal Reserve has adopted what may be termed a \u201cbottom-line\u201d approach: that the most important information in a credit purchase is that which explains differing net charges and rates. Cf. S.Rep.No.96-73, <em>supra, </em>at 3-4; Federal Reserve Board, Annual Report, <em>supra, </em>at 350-352. Although the staff might have decided that acceleration rebates are so analytically distinct from identical voluntary prepayment rebates as to warrant separate disclosure, it was reasonable to conclude, alternatively, that ordinary consumers would be concerned chiefly about differing financial consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-14\"><em>Ford Motor Credit Company v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980) (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">Here, the creditor\u2019s practice and policy was to charge less for involuntary prepayment growing out of default than that specified in the contract. This practice is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>revealed on the face of the contract. The majority, in holding that a creditor can charge differing rates so long as the defaulting debtor is charged less than the debtor who voluntarily prepays, relies on a portion of note 8 of the <em>Milhollin </em>opinion. However, that separate disclosures are required when there are different rebate charges or practices is made abundantly clear in the text of the <em>Milhollin </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af7\">But so long as the creditor\u2019s rebate practice under acceleration is identical to its policy with respect to voluntary prepayments, <em>separate </em>disclosure of the acceleration policy does not seem obligatory under a literal reading of the regulation. Regulation 226.8(b)(7), therefore, squares with the position of the Federal Reserve staff that specific disclosure of acceleration rebate policy is only necessary when that policy varies from the custom with respect to voluntary prepayment rebates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACf\">100 S.Ct. at 795 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The majority asserts that the meaning of the word \u201cvaries\u201d was clarified by the Court in note 8. \u201cWhere acceleration rebates are less than voluntary prepayment rebates, acceleration policy must be separately explained.\u201d 100 S.Ct. at 796, n.8. I would submit that that statement is not a clarification of the meaning of \u201cvaries.\u201d The writer happened to use the phrase \u201cless than\u201d rather than \u201cdifferent from.\u201d However, in that same footnote 8, the Supreme Court quoted with approval Public Information Letter No. 851. \u201cIf the creditor rebates under one method for acceleration and another for voluntary prepayment, both methods would need to be identified under \u00a7 226.8(b)(7).\u201d Id. The opinion in <em>Milhollin </em>makes perfectly good sense in holding that when there are differing rates, both must be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">As to appellant\u2019s second argument, Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6(c), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">(c) <em>Additional information. </em>At the creditor\u2019s or lessor\u2019s option, additional information or explanations may be supplied with any disclosure required by this part, but none shall be stated, utilized, or placed so as to mislead or confuse the customer or lessee or contradict, obscure, or detract attention from the information required by this part to be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">The majority holds that the debtor in this case was not entitled to accurate information in the contract for two reasons. \u201cFirst, the only disclosure <em>required </em>by the regulation in this case was that concerning rebate on voluntary prepayment, and no misinformation was provided by FMCC with respect to it.\u201d (Majority opinion, p. 393) Two errors occur here. <em>Milhollin </em>requires disclosure of both rebate rates as discussed in the first part of this dissent. One of these rates was inaccurately stated. Since both were required and one was wrong, the disclosure requirements have not been met. Further, Regulation Z provides that the creditor may at its option supply additional information; but if it does, that information cannot mislead or confuse the customer or contradict or obscure information which is required. The majority holds that only required disclosures must be accurate. In section (c), two practices are forbidden, the misleading and confusing of customers AND the contradiction or detraction of attention from required information. A nexus with required information is necessary, only for the second part to be triggered. The first is involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Additionally, I disagree with the majority that to adopt appellant\u2019s approach would tend to encourage defaults by buyers under installment contracts. Rather, defaults are encouraged by the varying rebate practices of the lender and not by our application of truth-in-lending principles. In fact if appellant\u2019s approach is adopted, Ford Motor Credit Company would have to change its procedure and defaults by buyers would no longer be encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">For the above reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the district court, and therefore I dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">. The opinion, as revised since the dissent was first drafted, at page 5 suggests that the Supreme Court did not disturb the rule in <em>McDaniel v. Fulton National Bank, </em>571 F.2d 948 (5th Cir. 1978). While this is true, the issue involved there is not what this case is about.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Milhollin, supra, </em>said the following in note 6, 444 U.S. at 559, 100 S.Ct. at 794:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has also adopted the position that separate disclosure is not required when the creditor is obliged to treat acceleration and voluntary prepayment alike for rebate purposes; that court has emphasized that the critical factor is the creditor\u2019s legal obligation to rebate, rather than its unbidden rebate policy. <em>McDaniel v. Fulton Nat. Bank, </em>571 F.2d 948 (en banc), clarified, 576 F.2d 1156 (1978) (en banc).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">This note is from Part II of the Supreme Court opinion. In this part, that Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and held that \u201cso long as the creditor\u2019s rebate practice under acceleration is identical to its policy with respect to voluntary prepayments, <em>separate </em>disclosure of the acceleration policy does not seem obligatory under a literal reading of the regulation.\u201d 444 U.S. at 562, 100 S.Ct. at 795. Thus, everyone is in agreement that when the rebate rate or charge is the same for voluntary and involuntary prepayments, disclosure of the one rate is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-23\">The fact that \u201cdisclosure\u201d was the issue in <em>McDaniel </em>instead of the issue being the different treatment as between prepayment and acceleration as contended by the majority is illustrated by the opening sentence in the en banc opinion in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-24\">We here reconsider en banc the rule of <em>Martin v. Commercial Securities Co., </em>539 F.2d 521 (5th Cir. 1976), that neither an acceleration clause nor the lender\u2019s rebate policy with respect to acceleration clauses must be disclosed under the Truth-in-Lending Act (the Act).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-25\"><em>McDaniel, supra, </em>at 949 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-26\">The facts in the case <em>sub judice </em>show that a borrower received one rebate when acceleration occurred from default and a lesser amount when voluntarily prepaying the loan. The issue here then is controlled by Part III of <em>Milhoilin, </em>not Part II.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
