Manlowe has been granted leave to intervene. Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321, 2342.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">In December 1980 Manlowe filed its application with the Commission. The Commission considered the application using its \u201cmodified procedure\u201d with the parties submitting their evidence and arguments in written form. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1100.43-52 (1981). Three shippers filed statements in support of the application; five motor carriers filed statements protesting the application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A Commission review board granted the application for state-wide authority in a decision served on April 16, 1981. On petition for review by the protestants, the Commission affirmed the review board\u2019s decision on June 24, 1981. Because the protestants had raised \u201cserious allegations of misconduct on the part of applicant\u2019s president,\u201d however, the Commission limited Manlowe\u2019s authorization to a two-year term. The protestants now petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">Prior to the adoption by Congress of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 (the 1980 Act), Pub.L. No. 96-296, 94 Stat. 793, the primary statutory standard which controlled the Commission in licensing motor carriers was that the proposed service \u201cbe required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(a) (Supp. II 1978). The guidelines for the grants of certificates of public convenience and necessity were promulgated by the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>in Pan <em>American Bus Lines Operation, </em>1 M.C.C. 190, 203 (1936):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">The question, in substance, is whether the new operation or service will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need; whether this purpose can and will be served as well by existing lines or carriers; and whether it can be served by applicant with the new operation or service proposed without endangering or impairing the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The 1980 Act \u201cmodifie[d] the traditional public convenience and necessity test to make it easier for motor common carriers of property to obtain operating certificates from the Commission.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 96-1069, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. 3, <em>reprinted in </em>[1980] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2283, 2285. The Commission is now instructed to grant the requested authorization if it finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOL\">(A) that the [applicant] is fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate and to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3N\">(B) on the basis of evidence presented by persons supporting the issuance of the certificate, that the service proposed will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(1). With respect to transportation of property by motor carrier the 1980 Act expressly enunciates a policy \u201cto promote competitive and efficient transportation services.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Notwithstanding the relaxation of guidelines under the 1980 Act, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires that the Commission\u2019s decisions include \u201cfindings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record....\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A). Under the 1980 Act it is still essential that the Commission, before granting an operating certificate, (1) find \u201cthat the service proposed will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need . .. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(1)(B); (2) find that the applicant is \u201cfit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized ...,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(1)(A); and (3) \u201cconsider and, to the extent applicable, make findings on\u201d the National Transportation Policy, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(2)(A), among the goals of which are to promote a safe, economical, efficient and competitive transportation system, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(a)(1)-(7). Applicants for common carrier authority bear the initial burden of making a showing sufficient to support the required findings. <em>Baggett Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>666 F.2d 524, 526-27 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">The Commission argues that it has satisfied the requirements of the APA and the 1980 Act since its rationale \u201cmay reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974). We cannot agree. The Commission made <em>no findings </em>concerning (1) the need for Manlowe\u2019s services in the greater part of the state; (2) Manlowe\u2019s fitness as a motor carrier; and (3) the goals of the National Transportation Policy. Such findings are essential to enable a reviewing court \u201cto perform its function of ascertaining that the ultimate conclusions are derived from the record before the agency and are not the result of discretion exercised in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\u201d <em>Argo-Collier Truck Lines Corp. v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 149, 152 (6th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">Further we conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision is not supported by the requisite substantial evidence. The evidence of need presented in support of Manlowe\u2019s application was scant. Three shippers submitted statements. The first, Interlake, Inc., manufactures a single product line (strapping and packaging materials) and ships from Oakland to Pittsburg, California, a distance of some 30 miles. The second, Twin City Piggyback, Inc., is a ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>per\u2019s agent which transports what it described as \u201c[g]eneral [commodities which will move in piggyback intermodal service\u201d from railroad yards in the San Francisco Bay Area to destinations in Sacramento, Oakland, Richmond, Modesto, and Fresno, California. The third, Senco Products, manufactures a single product (fastening systems) and ships from Oakland to San Leandro, California, a distance of less than 10 miles. Each shipper stated that it would tender traffic to Manlowe and expected Manlowe to provide good service.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">On the basis of these statements the Commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Our review of the evidence in this proceeding, including the appeal and reply, leads us to conclude that applicant has demonstrated that its proposed operation will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need. Accordingly, we here affirm the Review Board\u2019s findings relative to the issue of need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9D\">The Review Board had found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">The evidence of record demonstrates that applicant has established a prima facie case of need for the service described in the appendix. The three supporting shippers ... show a need for the transportation of general commodities between points in California. They require timed deliveries and show a substantial volume of traffic to be tendered to applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In our judgment, these findings do not suffice as support for a certificate with the state-wide geographic scope of that here granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applications have been denied to the extent that they exceed the demonstrated need for the proposed services. <em>Refrigerated Transport Co., Inc. v. ICC, </em>663 F.2d 528, 531 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Green Field Transportation Co., Inc., Extension-General Commodities, </em>132 M.C.C. 485, 492 (1981), <em>petition for review pending sub nom. Refrigerated Transport Co., Inc. v. ICC, </em>No. 81-7333 (5th Cir. filed Apr. 21, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">In <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. ICC, </em>659 F.2d 452, 475 (5th Cir. 1981) the court stated, \u201ca grant of statewide authority has never needed support from all, or even most, municipalities in the state\u201d but must have \u201csupport from a representative number of municipalities in the state.\u201d Manlowe\u2019s showing of need in a portion of Northern California is not \u201crepresentative\u201d of a need throughout the state. The statements of the supporting shippers on their face demonstrate a need only for services in the San Francisco Bay Area and at most to points between Sacramento in the North and Fresno in the South.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">If in the judgment of the Commission, circumstances other than the need of supporting shippers justified a statewide certificate, findings to such effect should be made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Refrigerated Transport Co., Inc. v. ICC, supra, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">[W]e can find no direct evidence, much less substantial evidence, in the statement of the supporting shipper as to any need for the authority sought outside the four states comprising its production region. There may be such need, and there may be such evidence, but it is not disclosed in the record before us. It would be an abdication of our reviewing function not to hold the Commission to a reviewable determination on the record as to the appropriate scope of the authority for which evidence of need has been adduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">663 F.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">With reference to the fitness finding the purpose of the inquiry is to protect the public \u201cfrom carriers whose conduct demonstrates an unwillingness to operate in accordance with the requirements of regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Speedway Carriers, Inc., Extension-Pesticides, </em>128 M.C.C. 60, 66 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Commission found Manlowe fit despite allegations by petitioners that its president had misappropriated funds from another carrier and had made false statements in his application statement. On this point the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">[W]e note that the evidence of protestant Cal-Pacific raises serious allegations of misconduct on the part of applicant\u2019s president, Mr. James Manlowe, involving fraud, misrepresentation, and embezzlement. We also note that these charges, as well as counter-charges . . ., are the basis for [a] civil complaint.. .. We recognize that the fact of the suit, alone, cannot be probative with respect to any issues now before the Commission; nevertheless, the allegations against applicant\u2019s president, if proven, would have relevance to the issue of his company\u2019s fitness and ability to conduct the operations here proposed. Accordingly, we limit our grant of authority to a two-year term.... This matter will also be referred to the Office of Consumer Protection of the Interstate Commerce Commission for whatever action it may find appropriate in light of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Because Manlowe disputed the allegations, the Commission contends that petitioners are essentially challenging the Commission\u2019s weighing of the evidence. There is no indication in the record, however, that the Commission engaged in any weighing at all. Instead it simply referred the allegations to its Consumer Protection Office. This response was not in keeping with the Commission\u2019s statutory responsibility to assess the fitness of motor carrier applicants. \u201c \u2018The Commission ... is required to give reasons for its actions if the protestants raise a material disputed issue or if the existence of a material issue is apparent from the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Central Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>669 F.2d 1063, 1074 (5th Cir. 1982), <em>quoting Humboldt Express, Inc. v. ICC, </em>567 F.2d 1134, 1139 (D.C. Cir.1977). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We reject the Commission\u2019s argument that limiting Manlowe\u2019s authorization to a two-year period was an appropriate interim measure. As one court has stated, \u201cBecause the applicant was unfit to receive a grant of permanent operating authority, it was also unfit to receive the limited-term certificate actually granted by the Commission.\u201d <em>Curtis v. ICC, </em>662 F.2d 680, 689 (10th Cir. 1981). As long as proceedings on the civil complaint to which the Commission referred remain pending, that complaint constitutes a cloud on Manlowe\u2019s fitness which would have to be resolved, either in the civil proceeding or by the Commission, if fitness were to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The order of the Commission is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-13\">. The protestants were the four petitioners in this proceeding and Nationwide Enterprises, Inc., doing business as Cal-Pacific Company. The latter carrier has entered voluntary bankruptcy and is not a party to this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. Petitioners also argue that the bald statement of Twin City Piggyback that it transports \u201c[gleneral [c]ommodities\u201d is not sufficient to support the Commission\u2019s grant of general commodity authority to Manlowe. We need not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-17\">. For example, the Commission now argues that a state-wide grant of authority was appropriate to permit Manlowe to realize operating efficiencies. No findings in this regard were made, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
