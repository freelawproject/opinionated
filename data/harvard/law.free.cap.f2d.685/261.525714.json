Courts should construe pleadings filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants like Fierro liberally, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Gillespie v.

I believe the majority errs in denying Fierro the opportunity to prove that Arizona law creates a liberty interest in good-time credit and a certain level of custody and that the Arizona prison system deprived him of those interests without the procedural safeguards mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Lokey v.

The court relied upon <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976) and <em>Montanye v.

Arizona Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Sentence reduction for good behavior is a matter of statutory right under Ariz.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 41-1604.07 (amending and replacing, effective October 1, 1978, Ariz.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 31-251). <em>See, e.g., State v. Barnard, </em>126 Ariz. 110, 612 P.2d 1073-74 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>110 Ariz. 210, 516 P.2d 1222, 1225 (1973); <em>Davis v. State ex rel. Eyman, </em>6 Ariz.App. 29, 429 P.2d 521 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The statutes and regulations governing Arizona\u2019s prisons have been substantially revised and reorganized in recent years. The shifting coverages that have resulted from these extensive changes make it difficult to ascertain exactly which provisions apply to Fierro\u2019s situation. A review of the pertinent portions of the statutes and regulations, however, and of the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decisions indicates that Fierro had a legitimate liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">To comply with the requirements embodied in an unpublished order issued by the Arizona District Court on August 23, 1973 [referred to by the parties as the \u201cCopple Rules\u201d], the Arizona Department of Corrections developed a system of procedures and rules governing the control and conduct of prisoners. The Department published these rules in 1976 in what is known as the Inmate Reference Manual. <em>See Dickey v. Raines, </em>124 Ariz.App. 135, 602 P.2d 516, 517 (1979). The Arizona Supreme Court subsequently held that the Department was under a legal obligation to promulgate its rules under the state\u2019s administrative procedure act. <em>Thomas v. Arizona State Board of Pardons and Paroles, </em>115 Ariz. 128, 564 P.2d 79 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">When Fierro was sentenced to prison on May 8, 1978, the Department had not yet promulgated into regulation those portions of the Inmate Manual pertaining to custody-level reassignments and good time. At that time, however, Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31-251 provided that an inmate could be deprived of good time only after pre-forfeiture notice and proof that the inmate had violated a prison rule with \u201cviolence or evil intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Effective October 1, 1978, the former Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31-251 was replaced by \u00a7 41.1604.07. Section 41.1604.07 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">Upon reclassification of a prisoner resulting from such prisoner\u2019s failure to adhere to the rules and regulations of the department . .. the director may declare any and all release credits earned by the prisoner forfeited....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Although, in contrast to its predecessor, \u00a7 41-1604.07 does not specify the conditions under which the director should exercise his discretion to forfeit release credits or the procedures that must accompany forfeiture, those concerns are covered in extensive regulations that were also effective October 1, 1978. These regulations, principally Ariz. Admin.Comp. Rules and Regs., <em>Corrections </em>\u00a7\u00a7 R5-1-401 to 403 (Supp. 79-4) (hereinafter <em>\u201cCorrections\"), </em>incorporate by reference the Inmate Manual\u2019s disciplinary procedures, and specify in great detail the conditions and procedural safeguards applicable to transfer into higher security levels and forfeiture of good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">An apparent difficulty in Fierro\u2019s case arises because Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 41-1604.07, the new statute authorizing forfeiture of good time, appears to apply to all forfeitures made on or after October 1, 1978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>while the accompanying limiting regulations apply only to prisoners serving time for offenses committed after October 1, 1978. <em>Corrections </em>\u00a7 R5-1-402. Fierro lost his good time in July, 1979, after the new statute was in effect, but was serving time for an offense committed before the regulations were in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Nevertheless, the fact that the Department had not yet promulgated its rules into regulations that were applicable to Fierro does not mean that the Department was free to ignore such rules or that they were insufficient to create a liberty interest. In <em>Brown v. State, </em>117 Ariz. 476, 573 P.2d 876 (1978), the Arizona Supreme Court rejected the Department\u2019s claim that Arizona prisons did not have to comply with regulations that were not yet properly promulgated. The court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">The Department cannot grant privileges to one group of prisoners and arbitrarily deny the same privileges to another prisoner because it chooses to find its regulations valid in one instance and invalid in another. Obviously the Department must comply with the law and file its regulations with the Secretary of State, but in the meanwhile the current lack of regulations cannot be used to confer benefits on some prisoners and not on others in substantially the same condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Brown, </em>573 P.2d at 879. Unless the Department follows its regulations, a prisoner is subject to the unequal treatment condemned by the <em>Brown </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The principal issue in <em>Brown </em>was whether the inmate had a liberty interest in not having \u201cdouble time,\u201d a type of good-time earned by prisoners performing certain types of \u201chigh trust\u201d labor (see Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31-252, amended and recodified after Brown at \u00a7 31-144), forfeited by arbitrary state action. The Arizona court addressed the issue in light of the distinction between Wolff v. <em>McDonnell </em>and <em>Meachum v. Fano. </em>Although its language in remanding the matter to the Department of Corrections to reconsider the application for good-time credits is indirect, the court\u2019s decision supports a finding that Arizona prisoners have a liberty interest in the right to equal protection under rules and regulations that affect good-time. <em>See </em>573 P.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">A similar rationale underlies the Arizona court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Malumphy v. MacDougall, </em>125 Ariz. 483, 610 P.2d 1044 (1980). In <em>Malumphy, </em>the court rejected the Department\u2019s contention that rules and regulations governing inmate-custody criteria need not be filed with the Secretary of State because they concerned only the internal management of the agency. The court notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">the unfiled regulations materially affect the type of existence a sentenced prisoner will endure, which ranges from \u201cintensive\u201d custody, twenty-four-hour lockup, to \u201ctrusty.\u201d Regulations of this type which affect <em>such important interests </em>are the type of regulations which must be filed with the Secretary of State,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUD\">(emphasis added). 610 P.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Under Arizona law, Fierro was clearly deprived of a liberty interest when he was transferred into a more restrictive level of security where he lost good time. As in <em>Wolff, </em>Arizona has conferred a particular benefit, namely entitlement to good-time, with a specification of the conditions under which the benefit can be lost. Thus, in contrast to the inmates affected by the lockdown in <em>Hayward v. Procunier, </em>Fierro had a justifiable expectation under Arizona law that he would not be deprived of his eligibility for good-time \u201cfor any reason or no reason.\u201d 629 F.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The liberty interest in this case is clearer than the liberty interest found to exist in <em>Wakinekona. </em>In <em>Wakinekona </em>we found such an interest because Hawaii had established procedural steps to be complied with before an inmate could be transferred to an out-of-state prison. This liberty interest was held to exist despite the fact that there was no justifiable expectation under Hawaiian law that an inmate would not be transferred without some specified event or finding. 664 F.2d at 712. In Arizona, by contrast, the inmate has a legally supporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ble expectation of accumulating and retaining good-time unless it is determined, after notice and a fair hearing, that he has violated a prison rule or is a threat to institutional security. <em>Corrections, </em>R5 1-402(c)(2-4). Moreover, unlike the decision to transfer inmates at issue in <em>Wakinekona, </em>which was totally discretionary, an Arizona inmate has a justifiable expectation of not forfeiting good-time and not being transferred into the harsh confines of administrative segregation based on unbridled discretion. <em>See Brown, </em>573 P.2d at 878-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Two additional factors make this an easier case than <em>Wakinekona. </em>First, an Arizona prisoner\u2019s interests in good-time and in avoiding arbitrary transfer into administrative segregation are more traditional types of liberty interests than the largely procedural interests involved in <em>Wakinekona. </em>Thus, finding a liberty interest in this ease is warranted even under the more rigorous test set forth in Judge Goodwin\u2019s <em>Wakinekona </em>dissent. Second, the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decisions strongly support a finding of a liberty interest in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>The Applicable Due Process Safeguards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AtI\">Once it has been established that a liberty interest is at stake, it is necessary to determine whether adequate procedural safeguards have been followed. The procedural safeguards required when an inmate is deprived of a liberty interest turns on the nature of the liberty interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, Fierro\u2019s liberty interest involves both loss of good-time credit and transfer from the general prison population to administrative segregation. The Supreme Court has considered the due process question in both contexts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The Court held in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell </em>that the deprivation of a state-created right to good-time credit requires the following procedural safeguards: (1) written notice of the reasons for the sanctions given early enough and in sufficient detail to enable the prisoner to prepare a response; (2) a prompt and fair hearing; (3) an opportunity to call witnesses and present evidence when doing so will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals (there is no right to confront or cross-examine adverse witnesses); (4) representation by counsel-substitute when necessary for an adequate presentation of the issues and evidence; and (5) a written statement setting forth the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action. 418 U.S. at 563-66, 569-70, 94 S.Ct. at 2978-79, 2981.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In <em>Wright v. Enomoto, </em>the Court approved a nearly identical set of procedural safeguards that a three-judge district court required California prisons to follow when transferring inmates to administrative segregation. <em>See </em>434 U.S. 1052, 98 S.Ct. 1223, 55 L.Ed.2d 756, <em>summarily aff\u2019g, </em>462 F.Supp. at 404-05. The district court noted in <em>Wright </em>that <em>Wolff </em>established only the minimum level of procedure necessary to satisfy due process. Although it was not prepared to reach the issue on the record before it, the district court noted that greater safeguards are probably warranted when the transfer into a higher level of security is made for \u201cadministrative\u201d reasons, as in <em>Wright </em>and in Fierro\u2019s case, than when it is made for \u201cdisciplinary\u201d reasons, as in <em>Wolff. </em>The charges at a disciplinary hearing are specific and narrow \u2014 alleged violation of a specific prison rule \u2014 and any resulting punishment is for a definite period. <em>Wright, </em>462 F.Supp. at 403-04. In contrast, as is apparent in Fierro\u2019s case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cadministrative segregation is for an indefinite period ... [and the charges] tend to be vague, and are frequently based on mere rumor, suspicion, or conjecture.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">To properly evaluate the adequacy of the procedural safeguards attending Fierro\u2019s transfer, it is first necessary to examine the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>A. Pertinent Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In July, 1979, without a prior hearing, Fierro was transferred from the general prison population, where he received good-time credit and earned 13$ an hour working in the kitchen, to administrative segregation. In administrative segregation he received no good-time credit and could not work. Several hours after his transfer, Fierro was notified in writing that he was being confined in administrative segregation because he was \u201cconsidered a threat to the orderly operation of this institution and the safety of other inmates\u201d because \u201cinformation has been received [from three informants that he was] involved in running a protection racket on main line kitchen.\u201d Six days later, Fierro wrote the Director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, requesting a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d Twelve days after his transfer, Fierro appeared before the Intensive Custody Committee at an Administrative Segregation hearing. According to Fierro, prison officials did not inform him of the guidelines or criteria it relied upon in determining that the transfer was appropriate. He thereby implies that he was not afforded a suitable opportunity to defend. He claims that the hearing was a brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">virtuall [sic] onesised [sic] interrogation by prison officials, inquiring into whether or not Petitioner was in any way involved with the extortion racket. In general, the prison officials appeared to react with hostility toward Plaintiff, and made inflammatory remarks to the effect that \u201cthey think\u201d that Petitioner is involved with the Mexican Mafia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The Intensive Custody Committee affirmed the transfer in a one paragraph decision, citing \u201crecent probable extortion of others in Cell Block # 1\u201d as the sole reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Approximately one month after its initial decision, the Intensive Custody Committee reviewed Fierro\u2019s custodial status and interviewed him. The Committee decided that Fierro should remain segregated from the prison\u2019s general population pending further review in ninety days. The only reason given for the Committee\u2019s decision was Fierro\u2019s \u201cinstitutional record.\u201d Fierro contends that the disciplinary reports on his institutional record were too minor to justify indefinite confinement in administrative segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\n<em>B. Adequacy of Prison\u2019s Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Although Fierro was not deprived of his liberty interests without some procedural safeguards, the process he was afforded failed to satisfy the standards articulated in <em>Wolff </em>and <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">1. <em>Notice: </em>Fierro did not receive any notice regarding the transfer until several hours after it occurred, and then was told only that he was considered a threat to the institution and other inmates because undisclosed informants had indicated that he was involved in running a protection racket in the kitchen. It is arguable whether this notice was constitutionally adequate. <em>Wolff </em>requires only that notice be given no less than 24 hours before the hearing, and must be detailed enough \u201cto clarify what the charges are.\u201d 418 U.S. at 564, 94 S.Ct. at 2978.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Citing the graver consequences attending confinement in administrative segregation than the loss of good-time credit at issue in <em>Wolff, </em>the <em>Wright </em>court required the notice to precede the initial transfer \u201cexcept in case of genuine emergency.\u201d 462 F.Supp. at 404. The need for this added requirement is obvious if the inmate is to have any hope of exercising his right to a meaningful opportunity to marshall facts and witnesses in his defense. <em>See Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 564, 94 S.Ct. at 2978. The present record contains no evidence that Fierro\u2019s transfer was prompted by a genuine emergency. Moreover, regardless of whether the notice was timely, it did not clarify the issues or identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>fy the evidence relied upon sufficiently to enable Fierro to prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">2. <em>Prompt fair hearing-. Wright </em>requires a fair hearing to be held within 72 hours (three days) of the inmate\u2019s transfer to administrative segregation. 462 F.Supp. at 404. Fierro\u2019s hearing was not held until twelve days after his transfer. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to rebut Fierro\u2019s contention that the hearing was cursory and unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">3. <em>Written record: </em>The most serious flaw in the procedure afforded Fierro is the inadequate record compiled by the Intensive Custody Committee. The only reason given in the Committee\u2019s initial decision was Fierro\u2019s \u201crecent probable extortion of others in Cell Block # 1.\u201d The decision following the second hearing (held almost six weeks after the initial transfer) was even more vague, citing Fierro\u2019s \u201cinstitutional record\u201d as the only reason for retaining him in administrative detention. Neither decision discusses the evidence introduced at the hearings or the criteria the Committee relied upon in reaching its decisions. The statements thus fall far short of <em>Wolff\u2019s </em>requirement that a written record be provided in order to protect the inmate from collateral consequences and to insure that prison officials acted fairly. <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 565, 94 S.Ct. at 2979. <em>See also Chavis v. Rowe, </em>643 F.2d 1281, 1286-87 (7th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Adequate records are particularly important because without them it is impossible for a reviewing agency or court to determine whether the inmate\u2019s other procedural rights were abridged. For example, the absence of adequate records makes it impossible to ascertain whether Fierro was given an opportunity to present witnesses and documentary evidence, or, if he was not allowed to do so, why the denial was necessary to preserve institutional safety or correctional goals. The Committee\u2019s decision notes only that Fierro was not allowed to cross-examine adverse witnesses, a permissible position under <em>Wolff. </em>Similarly, the lack of an adequate record makes it impossible to determine whether a counsel-substitute should have been appointed pursuant to the criteria set forth in <em>Wolff </em>and <em>Wright. </em>Given Fierro\u2019s alleged connection to the \u201cMexican Mafia\u201d and the awkwardness of his pro se briefs, it is not inconceivable that he may have difficulty with the English language and needed assistance at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Fierro\u2019s complaint clearly alleged facts which, if proven, would establish a viable \u00a7 1983 claim for deprivation of a state-created liberty interest without adequate due process safeguards. I believe that Fierro should be given the opportunity to amend his complaint and that the issues are sufficiently complex to warrant the appointment of counsel on Fierro\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. Our analysis in <em>Hayward </em>was carried a step further in <em>Wakinekona, </em>where we held that Hawaii\u2019s prison regulations governing interstate transfers created a liberty interest subject to due process protection. We rejected the state\u2019s argument that there was no state-created liberty interest because the administrator was not bound by the committee\u2019s recommendation and, as a result, inmates were, as a practical matter, \u201ctransferable at will\u201d within the meaning of <em>Meachum </em>and <em>Montanye. </em>664 F.2d at 712. The existence of the procedural scheme itself was enough to create a liberty interest in having the procedure followed. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12. Judge Goodwin argued in dissent that it is the nature of the interest at stake, rather than the scope of the procedure implemented to safeguard the interest, that should determine whether a liberty interest is at stake. Under Judge Goodwin\u2019s analysis, a liberty interest exists only if the inmate can \u201cdemonstrate the existence of a right rooted in state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>law that limits the prison administrator\u2019s discretion to transfer him....\u201d 664 F.2d at 713. Judge Goodwin concluded that Hawaii\u2019s grant of discretionary transfer authority to the prison administrator was too broad to support a justifiable expectation that an inmate would not be transferred without some specified event or finding. <em>Id. </em>The Hawaii Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in a decision published while <em>Wakinekona </em>was under submission. <em>See Lono v.
