Allgood, U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1381-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1381-22\">On November 5, 1980, appellant Hector Ruanos Tapanes and two other individuals were aboard the \u201cPAPER DOLL\u201d when it was stopped and boarded by the United States Coast Guard near Key Largo, Florida. While walking to the engine room for a safety inspection, Tapanes told Officer Wold of the Coast Guard \u201cJust between you and me there is grass on this boat.\u201d On board were 18,000 pounds of marijuana. Tapanes further stated \u201cLook, I have got a family and kids and everything. Couldn\u2019t you let us go.\u201d The request was declined, defendants were arrested and the vessel seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-23\">On February 13, 1981, Tapanes was convicted by a jury of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Appellant appeals from that conviction, enumerating as error: (1) the denial of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a unanimous verdict; and (2) the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of simple possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-24\">Citing <em>United States v. Sexton, </em>456 F.2d 961 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>469 F.2d 1362 (5th Cir. 1972) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number><em>United States v. McCoy, </em>429 F.2d 739 (D.C. Cir.1970), appellant contends the verdict against him lacked unanimity because of an indefinite response by a juror when polled, after which proper procedure required the jury to further deliberate. The following colloquy occurred during the poll of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-4\">THE CLERK: Pr\u00e1xedes Suarez, is the verdict as read your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-5\">JUROR NO. 8: I am sorry. I need to ask you a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-6\">THE COURT: Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-7\">JUROR NO. 8: I could not understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-8\">THE COURT: All right. He is asking you whether or not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-9\">JUROR NO. 8: One that omits there, that what he means, I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-10\">THE COURT: Just listen to me. I am trying to explain to you what we are doing. The jury has gone back and voted in the case and the foreman says that all 12 of you voted guilty. Mr. O\u2019Hare is now asking you whether or not you, individually, vote guilty, so perhaps the easiest way to do it is to say to you, \u201cMiss Suarez, what is your verdict in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-11\">JUROR NO. 8: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-12\">THE COURT: Okay. You understand what we are doing now. We are taking an individual reading on the representation that the verdict is unanimous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-13\">Now, what did you say a moment ago, Miss Suarez, so that we won\u2019t cut you off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-14\">JUROR NO. 8: No, because, well, I don\u2019t know to say this here or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-15\">THE COURT: I cannot hear you, madam. Speak up again, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-16\">JUROR NO. 8: I do not know to say it here or no. I do not know to say something here or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-18\">THE COURT: So tell us again what it is that you wish to say. I will be glad to hear from you. That is exactly why we are giving you an opportunity to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-19\">JUROR NO. 8: No, because I did not understand, first, what I, we say over there or not, you know, because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-20\">THE COURT: You did not understand what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-21\">JUROR NO. 8: What you say, you know, like, maybe I say something before, before, after, you know, after we discuss and everything, we reached the verdict, that is what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-22\">THE COURT: All I want to know is whether or not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-23\">JUROR NO. 8: After we reach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-24\">THE COURT: Whether or not you yourself individually have determined that the government has proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt against this defendant. If you have so determined we want to know it. If you have not, we want to know it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-25\">Now, what is your verdict in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-26\">JUROR NO. 8: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-27\">The colloquy continued and at its conclusion, Juror No. 8 had stated that the guilty verdict was her verdict at least seven times. Unlike the ambiguous, indefinite or equivocable verdicts of <em>Sexton, Edwards </em>and <em>McCoy, </em>the verdict in the present case was unequivocable and definite. No doubt was raised as to its unanimity. The verdict was therefore properly accepted without further jury deliberation. <em>See United States v. Duke, </em>527 F.2d 386, 394 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-28\">Appellant further contends that the trial judge erred by not instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of simple possession of marijuana. Because of the \u2022large quantity involved, thereby making it inconceivable that the marijuana was intended for the appellant\u2019s personal consumption, an instruction on the lesser included offense was unnecessary. <em>United States v. Hirst, </em>668 F.2d 1180, 1184 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-29\">Appellant\u2019s contentions being without merit, his conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-30\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
