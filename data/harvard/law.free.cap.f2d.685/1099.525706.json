The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the organizations were corporations, and assessed a deficiency of $868,170 against MCA, an indirect owner of the organizations. MCA paid the deficiency and filed this action for a refund, contending that the organizations are partnerships within the meaning of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.-7701-2, T.D. 6503, 1960-2 C.B. 413. The district court, 502 F.Supp. 838, acting on cross motions, granted summary judgment for the government. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-20\">In 1970, MCA Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Universal City Studios, Inc. (\u201cMCA\u201d) entered an agreement with Paramount Pictures Corporation (\u201cParamount\u201d) to form a joint organization for the distribution of films abroad. Pursuant to the agreement, MCA and Paramount formed a Dutch corporation, Cinema International Corporation (\u201cCIC\u201d) and each received 49% of the corporation\u2019s stock. The remaining 2% of the CIC stock was used to fund an entity called \u201cStichting,\u201d an employee trust created by MCA and Paramount for the benefit of CIC\u2019s top directors. CIC has an eight-member Board of Directors, four elected by MCA and four by Paramount. For the relevant tax years (1972 and 1973), MCA elected its chief executive officer, Mr. Lew Wasserman, and Paramount elected its chief executive officer, Mr. Charles Bludhorn. Messrs. Wasserman and Bludhorn were each given authority to designate three additional directors.</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>Stichting has a three-member Board of Trustees. Two Trustees are appointed by the CIC Board of Directors and those two, in turn, appoint the third Trustee. For the relevant tax years, CIC appointed Messrs. Wasserman and Bludhorn, who in turn appointed a Dutch attorney. The Stichting Trustees act by majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Shortly after Stichting was created, CIC and Stichting jointly established local distribution outlets (\u201cdistributorships\u201d) in 29 countries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each distributorship is owned 95% by CIC and 5% by Stichting, and is structured as an independent taxable entity under the applicable foreign laws. In addition, to obtain favorable United States tax treatment, the organizational documents of each distributorship include provisions intended to conform to the partnership requirements of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-2, T.D. 6503, 1960-2 C.B. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">It is undisputed that CIC is a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 957(a). Accordingly, all \u201csubpart F\u201d income earned by CIC must be included in the taxable income of CIC\u2019s United States shareholders, MCA and Paramount, in the year the income is earned. I.R.C. \u00a7 951(a)(1). Subpart F income includes \u201cforeign base company income,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 952(a)(2), which in turn includes all rents and royalties received from \u201crelated persons.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 954(a)(1) and (c)(3)(A). An entity is a related person with respect to a controlled foreign corporation, \u201cif such [entity] is a <em>corporation </em>which ... is controlled by .. . the controlled foreign corporation.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 954(d)(3)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-14\">The parties agree that if the distributorships were properly characterized as corporations, the income received by CIC from the distributorships in 1972 and 1973 was subpart F income, taxable to MCA and Paramount in the years earned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They also agree that if the distributorships are partnerships, MCA is entitled to a refund, because non-subpart F income received by CIC is taxable to CIC\u2019s United States shareholders only when repatriated in the form of dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-15\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-16\">The tax character of an unincorporated organization is determined by the test prescribed in Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-2, T.D. 6503,1960-2 C.B. 413.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To be classified as a corporation under that test, an organization must possess at least three of four enumerated corporate characteristics: limited liability, centralized management, free transferability of interests and continuity of life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 301.7701 \u2014 2(a)(l)-(3). <em>See Larson v. Commissioner, </em>66 T.C. 159 (1976), <em>acquiesced in, </em>1979-1 C.B. 1 (1979). An organization with fewer than three corporate characteristics is treated as a partnership for tax purposes. \u00a7 301.7701-2(a)(3). The presence or absence of the corporate characteristics is determined both under the entity\u2019s organizational documents and the local laws under which the entity is organized. \u00a7 301.7701 \u2014 2(b)(2), -2(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>The parties stipulated that the distributorships exhibit the corporate characteristic of limited liability and that they lack the corporate characteristic of centralized management. The parties also stipulated that,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under both the organizational documents and the applicable local laws, the distributorships nominally lack the two remaining corporate characteristics: continuity of life, because the organizational documents and local laws provide for dissolution upon the happening of specified events, including the bankruptcy of a member,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and free transferability of interests, because the organizational documents and local laws prohibit the transfer or burdening of one member\u2019s interest without the consent of the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">Notwithstanding these stipulations, the government contends that, as a matter of substance, the distributorships have continuous life and freely transferable interests. The government reasons that, although nominally separate organizations, CIC and Stichting represent a single economic interest and that, as a practical matter, Stichting can never act independently of CIC. Thus, the government concludes that the provisions purporting to regulate the relationship between CIC and Stichting, by restricting the transferability of interests and providing for dissolution of the organization in specified circumstances, have no legal significance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">The IRS first applied its single economic interest theory in Rev.Rul. 77 \u2014 214, 1977-1 I.R.B. 408. In that ruling, two domestic corporations, each a wholly owned subsidiary of the same domestic parent, had formed under German law an unincorporated entity (denominated a \u201cGmbH\u201d) with the corporate characteristics of limited liability and centralized management. The memorandum of association restricted the transferability of interests and provided for dissolution upon the happening of specified events, thus apparently qualifying the GmbH for partnership status under \u00a7 301.-7701-2. In its ruling, the IRS opined that, despite the provisions of the memorandum, the GmbH had freely transferable interests, because the controlling parent would make all transfer decisions for its wholly owned subsidiaries; similarly, the GmbH had continuous life, because there were no separate interests to compel dissolution should one of the specified events occur.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the IRS concluded that the GmbH would be classified as a corporation for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">We begin our analysis with the recognition that CIC and Stichting, unlike the corporations in Rev.Rul. 77-214, are beneficially owned by parties with separate and distinct economic interests \u2014 CIC principally by MCA and Paramount, and Stichting personally by individual employees of CIC. It follows that, whatever the commonality of their business interests, there is a potential for legitimate conflict of interest between them in the management of the distributorships.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">The government asserts that despite the separate beneficial ownership of CIC and Stichting, any potential for conflict is hypothetical. The government reasons that CIC and Stichting are subject to the common control of MCA and Paramount, through the dual roles of Messrs. Wasserman and Bludhorn as controlling members of both the CIC Board of Directors and the Stichting Board of Trustees. The government emphasizes that the Trust Deed grants the Stichting Trustees virtually unlimited discretion to manage and invest the trust assets, \u201cirrespective of any law or rule of court limiting or restricting the investment of trust funds.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the government concludes that Messrs. Wasserman and Bludhorn, when acting as Stichting Trustees, will always be free to act in conformance with the interests of MCA and Paramount and in concert with CIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-12\">The government\u2019s control theory disregards the Trustees\u2019 duty of loyalty to the Stichting beneficiaries. As fiduciaries, regardless of the breadth of their discretion, the Stichting Trustees have a duty to exercise their powers in good faith and without concern for their own personal interests or for those of third parties. <em>See </em>Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 543 (2nd Ed. 1978). Thus, although the Trust Deed grants the Trustees broad investment discretion, and may effectively preclude judicial review of the Trustees\u2019 investment judgments, it does not, and cannot, relieve the Trustees of their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the trust beneficiaries. Under California law,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> even a grant of absolute discretion \u201cdoes not authorize a trustee to neglect its trust or abdicate its judgment,\u201d <em>Coberly v. Superior Court, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 685, 689, 42 Cal.Rptr. 64, 67 (1965), and the California courts will review a trustee\u2019s actions to determine whether they are \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, capricious or ... in bad faith.\u201d <em>Lix </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>82 Cal.App.3d 573, 578, 147 Cal. Rptr. 294, 298 (1978). <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 2269(c) (West Supp.1982) (\u201cwhere a trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>instrument confers absolute, sole, or uncontrolled discretion upon a trustee, the trustee shall act in accordance with fiduciary principles and shall not act in bad faith or in disregard of the purposes of the trust.\u201d) <em>See generally </em>Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 2228-2240 (West 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">The government\u2019s control theory rests on the implicit assumption that, in the event of conflicting interests, the Trustees will act in derogation of their fiduciary duty, choosing the corporate interests of MCA and Paramount over those of the individual executives who are the trust beneficiaries. This court has rejected a similar theory in the area of family partnerships, <em>see Bateman v. United States, </em>490 F.2d 549 (9th Cir. 1973), and we reject the theory in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">In <em>Bateman, </em>two general partners in a limited partnership transferred partnership interests to themselves as trustees for the benefit of their children. The Commissioner challenged the transaction, arguing that the trusts were not legitimate partners for tax purposes and that, as donors, trustees, remaindermen and general partners, the donor-trustees were the true owners of the trusts. This court acknowledged that the donor-trustees had gone to the \u201cbrink of permissible control,\u201d 490 F.2d at 553; we emphasized, however, that the trustees were obligated to exercise their broad powers in accordance with fiduciary principles, and ruled that, absent evidence that the trustees had violated their fiduciary duty, the trusts must receive tax recognition. <em>Id. See also Kuney v. United States, </em>524 F.2d 795, 796 (9th Cir. 1975) (\u201c[T]he question \u2018whether [a] trustee [with extraordinarily broad powers] has become the real owner of the partnership interest\u2019 . . . depend(s) on the manner in which the trustee actually conducts himself in reference to the trust.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">Like the donor-trustees in <em>Kuney, </em>MCA and Paramount may have gone to the brink of permissible control over Stichting; but the government offers no evidence that the Messrs. Wasserman and Bludhorn, in their capacities as Stichting Trustees, have gone over the brink. Thus, although we agree with the government that CIC and Stichting are likely, as a practical matter, always to act in concert in their management of the distributorships, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that their interests will never diverge. Nor do we think that the tax consequences of a legitimate business transaction should turn on an unsupported assumption that certain parties to the transaction will act in breach of their fiduciary duties and, indeed, unlawfully. Thus, we conclude that the disputed provisions, which restrict the transferability of distributorship interests and limit the continuity of distributorship life, have legal effect. We hold that under \u00a7 301.7701 \u2014 2 the distributorships must be classified as partnerships for domestic tax purposes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">The government suggests that even if the distributorships technically satisfy the partnership test of \u00a7 301.7701-2, we should construe the regulations broadly to classify the distributorships as corporations, thereby eliminating an abusive form of tax shelter. Brief for the Appellee 17, 21. The government reasons that Congress enacted sub-part F to eliminate the tax deferral advantage of doing business through controlled foreign corporations, by taxing currently to United States shareholders all income that is deemed earned by those shareholders. The government asserts that in enacting subpart F Congress was more concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>with the nature of the income than the form of the entity generating the income, and that CIC\u2019s distributorship income is precisely the kind that Congress intended to tax currently under I.R.C. \u00a7 951(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">We find this argument unpersuasive. Although we agree that CIC\u2019s distributorship income is apparently the kind that Congress intended to tax currently <em>if </em>received from a controlled <em>corporation, </em>we decline the government\u2019s invitation to depart from the plain language of the statute. Congress wrote the statute unambiguously to apply to subpart F income received from controlled \u201ccorporations\u201d only. If the omission of income received from controlled partnerships has indeed created an unjustified loophole in the tax laws, the remedy lies in new legislation, not in judicial improvisation. <em>See United States v. Olympic Radio &amp; Television, Inc., </em>349 U.S. 232, 236, 75 S.Ct. 733, 736, 99 L.Ed. 1024 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">The government\u2019s argument that we should read the regulations expansively because they were developed to distinguish domestic, not foreign, entities, is similarly unpersuasive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The government stipulated that for purposes of this litigation the tax character of the distributorships would be determined by the \u00a7 301.7701-2 regulations. Those regulations, which were originally designed to limit the availability of corporate tax status,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Kurzner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>413 F.2d 97, 105 (5th Cir. 1969), prescribe a mechanical and formalistic test, <em>see Larson, </em>66 T.C. at 172, permitting taxpayers to select a form of business organization with certainty about the attendant tax consequences. If the test has proven unsatisfactory, or if the Commissioner determines that the test should not apply to foreign entities, the Commissioner is free to promulgate a new regulation that taxpayers can rely on in planning their foreign business ventures. <em>See Henry C. Beck Builders, Inc., </em>41 T.C. 616, 628-29 (1964); <em>Report on Foreign Entity Characterization, </em>35 Tax L.Rev. 169, 211-12 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">The decision of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">. Stichting\u2019s participation in the distributorships was conducted through Proteus, a corporation wholly owned by Stichting. To avoid confusion, we refer to both Proetus and Stichting as \u201cStichting\u201d throughout the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">. If more than 70% of a foreign-controlled corporation\u2019s income for a taxable year is subpart F income, all of its income for that year is treated as subpart F income. I.R.C. \u00a7 954(b)(3)(B). The parties stipulated that more than 70% of CIC\u2019s income for tax years 1972 and 1973 came from twelve distributor- \u2022 ships: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Columbia, France, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. Thus, for purposes of this case, the tax character of those distributorships only is at stake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1191-19\">. The parties stipulated that the test of \u00a7 301.-7701-2 applies to both foreign and domestic entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1191-20\">. Two additional characteristics \u2014 associates and a business purpose \u2014 are irrelevant to the corporation/partnership distinction, because they are common to both forms of organization. \u00a7 301.7701-2(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">. These facts were listed in the pre-trial memorandum under the heading of facts \u201cnot admitted [but] not to be contested at trial by evidence to the contrary.\u201d For purposes of this opinion, we treat the pre-trial statement as a stipulation of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">. The continuity of life factor reflects the fact that a \u201ccorporation . .. has a continuing identity which is detached from the relationship between its stockholders,\u201d while the \u201cpersonal relation between the partners ... constitutes the identity of the partnership itself.\u201d \u00a7 301.-7701-2(b)(2); <em>see Larson, </em>66 T.C. at 173-74. Accordingly, if any enumerated event, including the \u201cdeath, insanity, bankruptcy, retirement, resignation or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization, continuity of life does not exist.\u201d \u00a7 301.7701-2(b)(1). Moreover, if such an event will cause a technical dissolution of the organization, thereby altering its identity, the organization lacks continuity of life even though the remaining partners may elect to continue the business. <em>Larson, </em>66 T.C. at 174-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">. Free transferability of interests exists if each member of an organization, or those members \u201cowning substantially all of the interests ... have the power, without the consent of other members, to substitute for themselves in the same organization a person who is not a member of the organization.\u201d \u00a7 301.7701-2(e)(l). There is no free transferability of interests, regardless of any provision in the organizational documents, if, under local law, the transfer of a member\u2019s interest will cause a technical dissolution of the organization. \u00a7 301.7701-2(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1192-13\">. The district court agreed with the government and concluded that \u201cthe relationship between CIC and the trust, the structure of the trust and its manner of operation, point to the conclusion that CIC and the trust had an identity of interests with regard to the local distribution outlets and that such outlets were operated in a manner characteristic of corporations.\u201d [E.R., Vol. V at 1082],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1192-14\">. Apparently, there were no relevant provisions of German law governing continuity of life or transferability of interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">. The individual interests of the Stichting beneficiaries could conflict with the corporate interests of CIC both in the short run \u2014 e.g., in the need for cash distributions from the distributorships \u2014 and in the long run \u2014 e.g., in the attractiveness of continued investment in the distributorships.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">.

The Board of Trustees may use the capital to purchase insurance policies or annuity contracts issued by an insurance corporation.

Because Stichting was created under Netherlands law, the Trustees are presumably subject to the Netherlands law of fiduciaries. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 44.1, when the parties have given written notice of intent to raise an issue of foreign law, a federal court may take judicial notice of the laws of a foreign country. Because the parties here neither gave such written notice, nor sought in the district court to establish Netherlands law, we are under no obligation to apply Netherlands law; thus, we look to the law of the forum state, California, to determine the nature of the Trustees\u2019 fiduciary duty. <em>See Commercial Insurance Co. of Newark v.
