We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-23\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-24\">In November of 1978, DOE began an audit of LaJet, which continued until June 15, 1979, when a conference between the two parties was held, but there were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>further communications between them until February of 1981. At that time LaJet was notified by DOE that it was in a position to complete the examination of LaJet\u2019s records; however, no regulatory violations were alleged. LaJet objected to such an examination and DOE issued a subpoena for the records on April 1, 1981. After LaJet\u2019s request for administrative review of the subpoena was denied, it instituted suit against DOE requesting declaratory and injunctive relief from the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">Seven months later DOE filed a petition to enforce the subpoena. LaJet then filed a motion to consolidate the two actions, and DOE moved to dismiss LaJet\u2019s suit on the ground that it was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">After a hearing on all pending motions, the district court entered orders 1) denying consolidation of the cases and dismissing LaJet\u2019s action against DOE; and 2) upholding the DOE subpoena, but modifying it by limiting the period for review of the documents to sixty (60) days, and ordering DOE to review the records at LaJet\u2019s place of business, with DOE paying the expense of reproduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">LaJet appealed both cases, and by the order of this Court the appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">The role of a reviewing court in a subpoena enforcement proceeding is limited to determining whether the subpoena was issued for a lawfully authorized purpose, and whether it seeks information relevant to the agency\u2019s inquiry. <em>United States v. Pasco Petroleum Co., Inc., </em>633 F.2d 956, 959 (TECA 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 955, 101 S.Ct. 1698, 68 L.Ed.2d 195 (1981). In its consideration of whether the subpoena is relevant to the agency\u2019s inquiry, the court will also consider whether it is sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome. <em>See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 U.S. 541, 544, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 1740, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-11\">Lawfully Authorized Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-12\">LaJet\u2019s contention that the subpoena was not issued for a lawfully authorized purpose is without merit. This Court has recognized that Congress conferred broad subpoena authority on DOE, and \u201c.. . has repeatedly upheld enforcement of DOE\u2019s and its predecessor agencies\u2019 subpoenas seeking similar information relevant to the same lawfully authorized purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Andrus Energy Corporation </em>(consolidated with <em>United States v. Robison Energy, Inc.), </em>678 F.2d 1081 (Em.App.1982), and the authorities cited therein; and <em>United States v. Lotus Petroleum, Inc., </em>678 F.2d 1082 (Em.App.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-13\">LaJet insists that the subpoena was not lawfully authorized because Executive Order No. 12287, issued on January 28, 1981, decontrolled crude oil and refined petroleum products, and directed the Secretary of Energy to promptly eliminate the reporting and record keeping requirements, except for those that are necessary for emergency planning and energy gathering purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It argues that when the President ordered that those requirements be eliminated, he \u201ccertainly cannot have intended that firms ... not then the subject of ongoing enforcement proceedings, (that) had previously been audited without the discovery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>any regulatory violations, should continue to be subjected to unwarranted \u2018fishing expeditions\u2019 ...\u201d Yet, says LaJet, that is precisely what will happen if DOE prevails in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-4\">LaJet\u2019s position is that the Secretary of Energy\u2019s regulation 210.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that record keeping requirements in effect on January 27, 1981, will remain in effect for all transactions prior to February 1, 1981, conflicts with Executive Order 12287, and is, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">DOE counters that the records required to be kept are necessary to determine compliance with price and allocation regulations authorized by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 <em>et seq., </em>as amended; and that while \u00a7 760g of the Act authorized the President to decontrol crude oil and refined petroleum products, prior to September 30, 1981, \u201cit in no way abrogated the legislative mandate that the expiration of this authority shall not affect Administrative or Civil Actions, whether or not pending, which are based upon acts committed prior to such expiration.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since it finds the provisions of Section 2 of the Executive Order consistent with that view, DOE perceives no conflict between the Executive Order and regulation 210.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-6\">In our opinion, the Executive Order did not abolish DOE\u2019s authority to continue the audit of LaJet, begun more than two years earlier, even though there had been a lapse of eighteen months, and no regulatory violations had been discovered. Nor did the Executive Order put an end to LaJet\u2019s obligation as an oil producer to maintain records required during the regulatory period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Realistically, the most practical way to determine whether violations have occurred is by an examination of the records,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we find nothing in \u00a7 760g, Executive Order 12287, or \u00a7 210.1 to indicate any intention to grant amnesty for any possible violations occurring prior to the effective date of the Executive Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-16\">Relevant to Agency\u2019s Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-17\">The DOE subpoena seeks documents and records relating to transactions involving crude oil. The information sought is clearly relevant to the agency\u2019s inquiry into LaJet\u2019s compliance with the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-18\">LaJet argues that the scope of the subpoena is unduly broad and unreasonably burdensome. The record demonstrates that the district court considered this argument and modified the subpoena.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As modified, the subpoena seeks \u201csimilar information relevant to the same lawfully authorized purpose\u201d to those before this Court in <em>United States v. Robison Energy, Inc., </em>(consolidated with <em>United States v. Andrus Energy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number><em>Corp.), </em>678 F.2d 1081 (Em.App.1982), and the authorities cited therein.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">Dismissal of LaJet\u2019s Action Against DOE</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">LaJet\u2019s asserts that the district court was in error in dismissing counts one through four of its actions against DOE for lack of \u201cripeness\u201d. \u201cIn determining whether a challenge to an administrative regulation is ripe for review, a twofold inquiry must be made; first to determine whether the issues tendered are appropriate for judicial resolution, and second to assess the hardship of parties if judicial relief is denied at that stage.\u201d <em>Toilet Goods Association, Inc. v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 158, 162, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 1523, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967); <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); <em>Marathon Oil Company v. U. S. Department of Energy, </em>642 F.2d 436, 438 (Em.App.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-5\">Counts one and two of LaJet\u2019s action against DOE involved challenges to the recordkeeping regulation; count three alleged harassment of LaJet by DOE; and count four alleged that the audit was barred by laches. Since any complaint as to the validity of the audit itself may be raised in any administrative enforcement action resulting from the audit, or may be considered in any district court review of a final agency determination of a regulatory violation, the district court did not err in dismissing the four counts without prejudice to LaJet\u2019s right to pursue the matter further \u201cafter entry of some final order by the Department of Energy\u201d. <em>See Reisman v. Caplin, </em>375 U.S. 440, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964); <em>Wearly v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>616 F.2d 662 (3rd Cir. 1980); <em>American Motors v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>601 F.2d 1329 (6th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 941, 100 S.Ct. 294, 62 L.Ed.2d 307 (1979); <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>546 F.2d 646 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>359 F.2d 487 (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-8\">After judgment was entered with respect to the dismissal of the four counts, the district court granted LaJet\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal of the order requiring LaJet to comply with the DOE subpoena. In light of our disposition of this case, the stay should now be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-10\">In conclusion the Court finds that the DOE subpoena was issued for a lawfully authorized purpose; that the subpoena seeks information relevant to the agency\u2019s inquiry; that the dismissal of Counts I through IV of LaJet\u2019s action against DOE was not error; and that the stay order entered by the district court on March 26, 1981, should be DISSOLVED, and it is SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-11\">The Judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1470-8\">.
