Jameson, United States District Judge for the District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b418-28\">Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846). Given the presumptions available to the government, we have little hesitation in characterizing the evidence against appellant as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Peeper argues, on appeal, that introduction of taped telephone recordings, made with a coconspirator\u2019s knowledge, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation as the coconspirator was not present and there was no showing by the government as to why he was unavailable. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>making this argument appellant relies on <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance is misplaced. At the trial his own attorney wished to utilize certain portions of the tapes which he believed were exculpatory. He could hardly object to the government\u2019s use of other portions of those same tapes. As a result no objection was made to the introduction of the tapes and thus the issue of coconspirator hearsay and the issue of his unavailability never came up.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We are convinced on this record that the decision by appellant\u2019s attorney not to object to the tapes was intentionally made for tactical purposes. As this is so, the claim of a violation of the Confrontation Clause is clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">We are also convinced on this record that appellant received representation that was effective under the test of <em>Cooper v. Fitzharris, </em>586 F.2d 1325 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
