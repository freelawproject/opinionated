The parties vigorously dispute the proper standard of materiality as enunciated by this Court in prior cases. At oral argument the appellants asserted that the District Court\u2019s opinion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>contrary to three controlling Ninth Circuit decisions that address the issue of fraud before the Patent Office. <em>See W. R. Grace &amp; Co., Inc. v. Western U. S. Industries, Inc., </em>608 F.2d 1214, 1218 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 953, 100 S.Ct. 2920, 64 L.Ed.2d 810 (1980); <em>Maurice A. Garbell, Inc. v. Boeing Co., </em>546 F.2d 297 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 955, 97 S.Ct. 2677, 53 L.Ed.2d 272 (1977); <em>Monolith Portland Midwest Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>407 F.2d 288 (9th Cir. 1969). We do not agree. The District Court\u2019s opinion is consistent with the standards announced in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In judging whether misrepresentations made before the Patent Office rise to the level of fraud or inequitable conduct that would justify invocation of the maxim of unclean hands, we have not adopted, as the appellants argue, a definition of materiality that encompasses any information that \u201cmight affect\u201d the patentability of the claimed invention. Rather, we have adhered to the proposition that false statements or omissions are material so as to constitute fraud before the Patent Office when such statements or omissions were a <em>\u201csubstantia] cause </em>\u201d of the patent grant or a <em>\u201ccrucial factor\u201d </em>in obtaining the patent. <em>See W. R. Grace &amp; Co., Inc., </em>608 F.2d at 1218; <em>Cataphote Corporation v. DeSoto Chemical Coatings, Inc., </em>450 F.2d 769, 773 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>408 U.S. 929, 92 S.Ct. 2497, 33 L.Ed.2d 341 (1972); <em>Monolith Portland Midwest Co., </em>407 F.2d at 296. The proper focus in determining the materiality of information misrepresented to or withheld from the Patent Office is on the <em>effect </em>of the misrepresentation or withholding upon the subjective considerations of the patent examiner. <em>See Norton v. Curtiss </em>433 F.2d 779, 795 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The appellants have cited and relied on language in our cases that a patent applicant has a duty to disclose \u201call facts which may affect the patentability of his invention.\u201d <em>Monolith, </em>407 F.2d at 294; <em>see Maurice A. Garbell, Inc. v. Boeing Co., </em>546 F.2d 297, 300 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 955, 97 S.Ct. 2677, 53 L.Ed.2d 272 (1977). This standard is inapposite to a determination of the <em>materiality </em>of false statements or omissions before the Patent Office; rather, the <em>Monolith </em>language bears on another requisite element of fraud \u2014 that of state of mind, or scienter. <em>See W. R. Grace &amp; Co., Inc., </em>608 F.2d at 1218. An inquiry into whether withheld information \u201cmay affect\u201d the patentability of an invention must be distinguished from a determination of the actual impact of omitted information upon a patent examiner\u2019s decisions. The former is an inquiry into the state of mind of the applicant at the time the decision to withhold is made; the latter is an inquiry into the materiality of the information withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In addition to materiality, a party seeking to invalidate a patent by invocation of the doctrine of unclean hands must establish a sufficiently culpable state of mind on the part of the patent applicant. <em>Carpet Seaming Tape Licensing Corp. v. Best Seam Incorporated, </em>616 F.2d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 1980). We have stated that only a showing of wrongfulness, willfulness, bad faith, or gross negligence, proved by clear and convincing evidence, will establish sufficient culpability for invocation of the doctrine of unclean hands. See <em>Carpet Seaming Tape Licensing Corp., </em>616 F.2d at 1138-39; <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co., Inc., </em>608 F.2d at 1218 (standard established if plaintiff\u2019s course of conduct \u201creveals a calculated recklessness about the truth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The District Court\u2019s opinion in this case was consistent with these standards. It found that the appellants failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that Pfizer misrepresented or concealed prior art, facts, or information material or pertinent to patentability. <em>See </em>545 F.Supp. at 537, 207 U.S.P.Q. at 437. In making this determination the District Court properly relied on the patent examiner\u2019s testimony that he was not misled by Pfizer\u2019s representations, <em>id. </em>at 527, 207 U.S.P.Q. at 408, 430, and that certain information Pfizer withheld \u201cwould not have made any difference\u201d to the patent examiner\u2019s decision, <em>id. </em>at 527, 207 U.S.P.Q. at 430. The evidence clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>supports a finding that the information withheld by Pfizer was not a crucial factor or a substantial cause of the patent grant and, therefore, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the information was not material is not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
