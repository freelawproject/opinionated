HOFFMAN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">In October 1980, CTI-Container Leasing Corporation (CTI) brought this action against Uiterwyk Corporation (Uiterwyk) alleging the breach of leases for ocean cargo containers and other related equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Jurisdiction was asserted under diversity and admiralty and CTI designated its claim as a maritime claim within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h). In February 1981, Uiterwyk moved to implead Iran and IEL as third-party defendants pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 14. In March 1981, the United States Department of Justice filed the first of several Statements of Interest which expressed the United States\u2019 position concerning litigation involving American nationals and Iranian entities as a consequence of the Iran-United States Agreement that obtained the release of the American hostages in January 1981. On June 19, 1981, the district court without having ruled on Uiterwyk\u2019s impleader motion, stayed this action with the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-4\">In each of these cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the United States has filed a statement of interest, and subsequent to that, a supplemental statement of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-5\">The statement, in effect, is a motion for a stay of these proceedings, as a result of the agreement between the United States and the Government of Iran on January 19, 1981. 46 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>7913-32 (January 23, 1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-11\">The Court is of the opinion that these cases should be, and they are, STAYED, pending determination by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear these claims. <em>See </em>Exec. Order No. 12,294, 46 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>14,111 (Feb. 26, 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">We now decide CTI\u2019s appeal of this stay order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-14\">CTI is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York and is a lessor of ocean carrier cargo containers. Uiterwyk is a Florida corporation and acted as agent for entities whose business included carriage of cargo in international trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">CTI as lessor and Uiterwyk as lessee entered into a number of leases for ocean cargo containers and other related equipment which are the basis of this action. CTI alleged that Uiterwyk failed to pay its obligations under such leases. Uiterwyk argued that it entered into the leases as agent for IEL,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was an Iranian corporate entity and is now an alleged instrumentality of Iran. Uiterwyk alleged that IEL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>transported the containers and related equipment to Iran where they remain in custody and control of IEL and Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">A. <em>Appellate jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">Uiterwyk argued that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s stay order. CTI argued that the stay order is reviewable as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cfinal decision\u201d pursuant to <em>Hines v. D\u2019Artois, </em>531 F.2d 726 (5th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">In <em>Hines, </em>the Fifth Circuit found a stay order appealable because the order operated in practical effect as a \u201cfinal order\u201d under \u00a7 1291. The district court in <em>Hines sua sponte </em>stayed plaintiffs\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 employment discrimination action until plaintiffs initiated proceedings before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and pursued such proceedings to final administrative action. The Fifth Circuit held such order appealable because its practical effect placed plaintiffs out of court. <em>See Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, </em>370 U.S. 713, 715 n.2, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 1296 n.2, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962). The court concluded that the district court abused its discretion in staying the action until the conclusion of administrative proceedings and reversed the stay order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">The Fifth Circuit relied on the following factors to treat the stay order as appealable under \u00a7 1291. First, the court cited <em>Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 152-53, 85 S.Ct. 308, 310-311, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), for the principles that \u201cthe requirement of finality is to be given a practical rather than a technical construction,\u201d and when \u201cdeciding the question of finality the most important competing considerations are the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of denying justice by delay on the other.\u201d (citations omitted). The court stated that such a practical construction of the finality doctrine \u201crequires that when a plaintiff\u2019s action is effectively dead, the order which killed it must be viewed as final. Effective death should be understood to comprehend any extended state of suspended animation.\u201d <em>Hines, supra, </em>at 730; <em>see also McKnight v. Blanchard, </em>667 F.2d 477, 479 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-12\">Second, the circumstances of the case reinforced the court\u2019s conclusion that the stay order was a final order for \u00a7 1291 purposes. No EEOC complaint had been filed when the stay order was entered and a minimum delay of eighteen months was needed for final EEOC processing. The effect of such a \u201cprotracted and indefinite delay\u201d, <em>id., </em>at 732, was to put plaintiffs effectively out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-13\">Finally, the district court had not yet addressed the merits of the action when it entered the stay order, and, therefore, \u201cthe inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review\u201d were outweighed by \u201cthe danger of denying justice by delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit decided that these factors favored treating the stay as a final order, and we likewise feel that similar factors exist in the instant case that make this stay order a final order subject to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">The danger of denying justice by delay for CTI outweighs Uiterwyk\u2019s possible inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review. We have no way to estimate the months or even years that may pass before Uiterwyk\u2019s claims against Iran and IEL are decided by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d), <em>see NIC Leasing, Inc. v. Uiterwyk Corp., </em>No. 81 Civ. 3866, slip op. at 9 (S.D.N.Y. March 1, 1982), and CTI, an American corporation, should not be denied its day in court against Uiterwyk, another American corporation, because the Tribunal might at some future date assert jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>tion over Uiterwyk\u2019s action against Iran and IEL. Furthermore, Uiterwyk\u2019s argument that the delay from the stay order is outweighed by the possibility of inconsistent results from piecemeal review is without merit. CTI did not institute an action against Iran or IEL. Uiterwyk\u2019s claims against these two parties are contingent upon a finding in the district court of Uiterwyk\u2019s liability to CTI before the Tribunal can accurately enter a judgment in the Uiterwyk and Iran-IEL dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">By staying the action pending the Tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction over Uiterwyk\u2019s claim for a protracted and indefinite period, the district court placed CTI in an \u201cextended state of suspended animation.\u201d <em>Hines, supra, </em>at 730. The practical effect of the stay order placed CTI \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d and for such reason we hold that the stay order was a \u201cfinal\u201d order subject to appellate review under \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">B. <em>Merits of the stay order</em></p>\n<p id=\"Azl\">CTI and Uiterwyk disagree as to whether the district court\u2019s stay order was a mandatory or discretionary stay. We conclude that the stay order as it affected Uiterwyk\u2019s third-party claims against Iran and IEL was mandatory in nature because such claims were suspended by Executive Order No. 12,294 as they are clearly within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The district court was required to stay those claims, although it nevertheless retained jurisdiction over them. <em>See Dames &amp; Moore, supra, </em>453 U.S. at 684, 101 S.Ct. at 2989. We agree with the district court\u2019s stay order as it pertains to the stay of the third party action, but reach a contrary conclusion concerning the stay of the principal action of CTI against Uiterwyk. This portion of the stay order was discretionary in nature as the district court was not required to stay an action between two American corporations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">The inherent discretionary authority of the district court to stay litigation pending the outcome of related proceeding in another forum is not questioned. <em>See generally Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., </em>437 U.S. 655, 665, 98 S.Ct. 2552, 2558, 57 L.Ed.2d 504 (1978); <em>Landis v. North American Co., </em>299 U.S. 248, 255, 57 S.Ct. 163, 166, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936); <em>P. P. G. Industries Inc. v. Continental Oil Co., </em>478 F.2d 674 (5th Cir. 1973). Our review of such an exercise of discretion is limited to an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See McKnight v. Blanchard, </em>667 F.2d 477, 479 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">In <em>McKnight, </em>the Fifth Circuit recently vacated a stay order as an abuse of discretion because the stay continued an action for an indefinite period of time. In <em>McKnight, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-9\">The district court has a general discretionary power to stay proceedings before it in the control of its docket and in the interests of justice. Nevertheless, stay orders will be reversed when they are found to be immoderate of an indefinite duration. In <em>Landis v. North American Co., </em>299 U.S. 248 [57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153] (1936), the Supreme Court held that a \u201cstay is immoderate and hence unlawful unless so framed in its inception that its force will be spent within reasonable limits, so far at least as they are susceptible of prevision and description.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-10\">667 F.2d at 479 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">It is difficult to accurately predict the time that CTI will be forced to stand aside if it is required to await the Tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction to hear these claims, but it can safely be described as an indefinite period of time. We cannot uphold such an indefinite or immoderate stay despite Uiterwyk\u2019s arguments to the contrary. We, therefore, agree with the procedural posture taken by other courts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>similar litigation arising out of Uiterwyk\u2019s involvement with Iran and IEL. <em>See NIC Leasing, Inc. v. Uiterwyk Corp., </em>No. 81 Civ. 3866 (S.D.N.Y. March 1, 1982); <em>Cotco Leasing Co. v. Uiterwyk Corp., </em>No. 80-706 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 9, 1981); <em>Xtra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Uiterwyk Corp., </em>No. 79-1021-Civ.-T-H (M.D. Fla. Aug. 25, 1981). <em>But see Itel Corp. v. M/S Victoria U, </em>No. 80-2328 (E.D.La. Sept. 23, 1981), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 82-3129 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 1982).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These courts that were faced with third party complaints have severed and stayed the third-party actions against Iran and IEL while allowing the principal actions against Uiterwyk to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">Uiterwyk argued that the stay of the entire action should be affirmed because: (1) it will be prejudiced in developing its evidence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> without the presence of IEL and Iran who are necessary for a comprehensive disposition at one time of the rights of the parties to litigation arising out of the same facts; (2) it will be subjected to significant costs of duplicative proceedings before the district court and the Tribunal; and (3) IEL and Iran are indispensable parties to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">First, Uiterwyk\u2019s argument that it may be prejudiced in developing evidence to support its agency defense without the third-party defendants\u2019 presence is not a determinative factor in our decision concerning the stay. An alleged agency agreement between Uiterwyk and IEL is not at issue; it is the contract between CTI and Uiterwyk that is the focus in the principal action. Uiterwyk also will not be hampered by the third-party defendants\u2019 absence in attempting to substantiate its impossibility of performance and force majeure defenses. The historical context of the Iran-United States Agreement has not been disputed and CTI has not questioned the factual basis for these affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">Second, Uiterwyk will not be subjected to any undue hardship of duplicative costs by proceeding with the principal action. It will not suffer significant overlapping costs and preparation for proceeding in the Tribunal because we agree with the district court that the third-party claims should be stayed because such claims are within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Furthermore, any extra costs Uiterwyk might incur do not outweigh the serious harm to CTI if it is compelled to stand aside for an indeterminate period of time to await the Tribunal\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-12\">Third, Uiterwyk argued that Iran and IEL are indispensable parties under F.R.Civ.P. 19(b) because CTI\u2019s claims are inextricably related to Uiterwyk\u2019s claims against IEL and Iran. It is not necessary to analyze the factors enumerated in Rule 19(b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to determine if IEL and Iran are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>indispensable parties, because \u201cRule 19(b) deals with the determination a court should make whenever joinder of an interested person is not feasible.\u201d <em>Gertner v. Hospital Affiliates International Inc., </em>602 F.2d 685, 688 (5th Cir. 1979). Hence, the first step in an indispensable party determination requires a decision as to whether joinder of the person in question is feasible. <em>See Challenge Homes, Inc., v. Greater Naples Care Center, Inc., </em>669 F.2d 667 at 669 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">The district court did not rule on Uiterwyk\u2019s motion to join IEL and Iran as third-party defendants and CTI argued that such joinder would deprive the court of jurisdiction under Executive Order 12,294 and violate Rule 19(a). However, we agree with Uiterwyk\u2019s argument on this point that \u201cExecutive Order 12,294 purports only to \u2018suspend\u2019 the claims, not divest the federal court of \u2018jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dames &amp; Moore v. Regan, supra, </em>453 U.S. at 684, 101 S.Ct. at 2989.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">The court in <em>Challenge Homes, supra, </em>stated that in making the decision whether the party in question should be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a), \u201cpragmatic concerns, especially the effect on the parties and the litigation, control.\u201d <em>Challenge Homes, supra, </em>at 669 (citations omitted). We conclude, viewing the Rule 19(a) factors in light of pragmatic concerns, that joinder of IEL and Iran is feasible and was also the course followed by other courts faced with the same decision. <em>See NIC Leasing Corp., supra; </em>Cotco <em>Leasing, Inc., supra; Xtra, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">We feel that the district court\u2019s objectives of adhering to the Iran-United States Agreement, Executive Order 12,294, and the Statements of Interests filed by the United States can best be accomplished by following the paths taken by the courts in the <em>NIC Leasing, Cotco Leasing, </em>and <em>Xtra </em>cases. In these cases, Uiterwyk\u2019s motions for a stay of the entire actions were denied and the third party defendants were joined, but such third-party actions were severed under Rule 42(b), and stayed pursuant to Executive Order No. 12,294. The parties were directed to proceed with their respective principal actions. Therefore, we conclude that district court abused its discretion when it ordered a stay of this entire action. We vacate the district court\u2019s stay order and remand the action to the district court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">. CTI had previously brought the nearly identical cause of action based on the alleged breach of the same leases with slightly different monetary damages requested in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in February 1980. CTI filed this action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida while the Maryland action was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-24\">Uiterwyk filed a third-party complaint against the Government of Iran (Iran) and Iran Express Lines (IEL) in the Maryland action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>On January 21, 1982, the district court in Maryland severed and stayed the third-party claims against Iran and IEL. CTI\u2019s principal action against Uiterwyk was referred to a magistrate on April 12, 1982 for a hearing, report, and recommendation as to all dispositive pre-trial matters. On May 17, 1982, the magistrate in Maryland stayed the principal action of CTI against Uiterwyk pending our review of the stay issued in the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">. In addition to Uiterwyk\u2019s impleader motion, it also filed separate actions against Iran and IEL, <em>Uiterwyk Corp. v. Iran Express Lines, </em>No. 81-107-Civ-T-K (M.D.Fla., filed Feb. 15, 1981); <em>Uiterwyk Corp. v. Iran Express Lines, </em>No. 81-108-Civ-T-K (M.D.Fla., filed Feb. 15, 1981). The June 19, 1981 stay order stayed these actions along with the instant action, and another action against Uiterwyk, <em>Recovery Services Int\u2019l Inc. v. Uiterwyk, </em>No. 81-39-Civ-T-K (M.D.Fla., filed Jan. 15, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">Uiterwyk argued that the district court\u2019s \u201cconsolidated\u201d stay order was, in effect, a Fed. R.Civ.P. 42(a) consolidation. Uiterwyk argued that this consolidation properly placed the third-party defendants before the court. Such a conclusion would bolster Uiterwyk\u2019s argument concerning the validity of the stay order. However, we conclude that the district court\u2019s stay order was not a Rule 42(a) consolidation and our review of the stay order is limited to CTI\u2019s action against Uiterwyk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1376-17\">.

As the United States stated in its Second Supplemental Statement of Interest, which was filed in the Maryland action, only claims of nationals of the United States against Iran and claims of nationals of Iran against the United States are within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Therefore, we agree with the view of the United States that CTI\u2019s claims against Uiterwyk are not within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and not suspended by Executive Order 12,294. In addition, the United States also stated that a stay of this entire action <em>may </em>be appropriate: we disagree with this conclusion for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">. A stay was granted in the <em>Itel </em>case, but <em>Itel </em>is distinguishable because no third-party action was filed in that case. CTI argued that plaintiffs cause of action in <em>Itel </em>\u201cwas based on leases showing IEL as lessee; Uiterwyk as lessee; IEL c/o Uiterwyk as lessee; and IEL c/o Nippon Umpansha, Ltd. as lessee.\u201d Reply Brief for Appellant at 22. Uiterwyk did not dispute this assertion and Uiterwyk\u2019s counsel admitted at oral argument that <em>Itel </em>was not a similar case, but only cited as an example of possible prejudice that might ensue if the action was not stayed. Indeed, possible prejudice might ensue in an action when named defendants-lessees-agents are not before the court because of Executive Order 12,294. However; this is not the situation in the present action and, therefore, <em>Itel </em>is inapposite to these circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">. Although not emphasized in its brief, Uiterwyk asserted at oral argument, that its status as agent for IEL provides a meritorious defense to CTI\u2019s claims and such status cannot be proved without the presence of IEL and Iran at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1379-14\">.

The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person\u2019s absence might be prejudicial to him or those already parties; second, the extent to which by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person\u2019s absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1380-13\">. We take cognizance of the fact that in the substantially identical action in Maryland, <em>CTI-Container Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Uiterwyk Corp., </em>No. JH-80-313 (D.Md., filed Feb. 8, 1980), the district court severed and stayed the third-party action and referred the action to a magistrate. The magistrate subsequently stayed the principal action pending our decision. <em>See, </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>We, in effect, approve of the action taken by the district court in Maryland. However, upon remand of this action to the Middle District of Florida, it remains to be decided by the two district courts as to which court will proceed to trial with the principal action. Clearly, the same parties in substantially the exact same litigation should not be permitted to proceed simultaneously in two separate district courts, but we leave the decision of which district court will proceed to trial to the discretion of the district courts involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
