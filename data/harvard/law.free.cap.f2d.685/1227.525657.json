Case History<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-17\">On March 21, 1974 appellant Charles Proffitt was tried and convicted of first degree murder by a jury in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida. In the second phase of the bifurcated proceeding the jury issued an advisory sentence recommending the death penalty, and the judge, in agreement with that recommendation, sentenced appellant to death. Pursuant to Florida\u2019s capital sentencing statute, Pub.L.No. 72-724, \u00a7 9,1972 Fla. Laws (current version at Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141 (West Supp.1982)), appellant was afforded an automatic appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, which upheld his conviction and sentence. <em>Proffitt v. State, </em>315 So.2d 461 (Fla. 1975). Appellant then sought review by the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to consider the constitutionality of the Florida death penalty statute. 423 U.S. 1082, 96 S.Ct. 1090, 47 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976). Seven members of the Court, in three separate opinions, held that the statute did not violate the eighth or fourteenth amendments, <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 244-60, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 2963-70, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976) (opinion of Powell, Stevens, and Stewart, JJ.); <em>id. </em>at 260-61, 96 S.Ct. at 2970 (opinion of White and Rehnquist, JJ. and Burger, C. J.); <em>id. </em>at 261, 96 S.Ct. at 2970 (opinion of Blackmun, J.), and hence affirmed appellant\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>Having exhausted his direct remedies, appellant sought collateral relief \u2014 first in the state courts, which denied relief summarily without an evidentiary hearing, <em>see Proffitt v. State, </em>360 So.2d 771 (Fla.1978), <em>cert. dismissed on appellant\u2019s motion, Proffitt v. State, </em>372 So.2d 1111 (1979),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and finally in the federal district court, the decision of which denying habeas corpus is the subject of this appeal. In the district court appellant urged several grounds for relief. He claimed the representation he received at the guilt phase of his trial was ineffective rendering his conviction unconstitutional under the sixth amendment. He also raised several constitutional challenges to the state court\u2019s sentencing decision, including (1) ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty hearing; (2) admission of testimony and reports by court-appointed psychiatrists without adequate opportunity for confrontation; (3) limitation of the jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence in violation of <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978); and (4) consideration of aggravating factors not authorized by the sentencing statute in violation of the due process clause and eighth amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">The district court appointed a magistrate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to conduct the evidentiary hearing required by <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). The magistrate, after thorough and probing analysis, recommended denial of relief on all of appellant\u2019s claims except that based on ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing stage of the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the latter, he found defense counsel\u2019s representation constitutionally deficient and recommended remand to the state court with instructions either to conduct a new sentencing hearing or, alternatively, to resentence appellant to life imprisonment. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations on all issues except the last. It rejected the claim of ineffective counsel at sentencing and the magistrate\u2019s conclusion on that ground and thus dismissed appellant\u2019s habeas petition. Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s substantive conclusions and further argues that the district court committed procedural error in rejecting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation on his ineffective counsel claim without conducting a new hearing on that issue. We address the procedural question first because its resolution, if favorable to appellant, would require a remand to the district court obviating the need for us to decide most of appellant\u2019s substantive claims at this juncture. Since an understanding of the operation of the Florida capital sentencing statute under which appellant was sentenced is necessary for informed evaluation of both the procedural and substantive issues, we preliminarily set forth a brief description of that act and of the sentencing proceeding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>II. Florida\u2019s Capital Sentencing Statute</p>\n<p id=\"A6s\">Under Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> following the guilt phase of trial for a defendant convicted of a capital felony, the trial judge conducts a separate sentencing proceeding before the jury that convicted the defendant. At the sentencing hearing, the parties may introduce evidence of and argument concerning aggravating<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and mitigating factors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the basis of the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing together with that presented at the guilt phase of the trial,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a majority of the jury renders an advisory sentence. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.-141(2), (3) (West Supp.1982). The jury is instructed to consider \u201c[wjhether sufficient aggravating circumstances exist\u201d; \u201c[wjhether sufficient mitigating circumstances exist which outweigh the aggravating circumstances found to exist\u201d; and, \u201c[bjased on these considerations, whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 921.141(2). The trial judge then independently evaluates the evidence, makes the same determination as to the existence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and decides which sentence to impose. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 921.141(3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-19\">In this case, the sentencing proceeding was brief. The prosecution called one witness: a Dr. Crumbley who, acting as psychiatric consultant for the County Sheriff\u2019s Office, had examined appellant shortly following his arrest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the course of two interviews with the doctor, appellant had confessed to committing the murder. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>pellant\u2019s attorney waived his doctor-patient privilege for purposes of sentencing only, allowing the doctor to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">On direct examination, Dr. Crumbley testified that appellant had expressed concern about a feeling he had that was \u201cso overwhelming that he felt he would do damage to people in the future.\u201d Dr. Crumbley testified that appellant told him his uncontrollable desire had built up an unbearable tension, which he had \u201cfought as hard as he could,\u201d but that it finally overcame him with the result that he killed a man and was now awaiting trial. Appellant had further expressed concern that if he was acquitted he might kill someone again, and he asked Dr. Crumbley about arranging psychiatric help for him. At a second interview, appellant again spoke of the tension he had experienced prior to the killing and described a sense of relaxation he had felt afterward. He told the doctor the tension was building up again with his hostility directed toward a particular inmate. He asked whether he could be moved to a different cell or whether something could be done to relieve the emotional pressure he was experiencing. Dr. Crumbley further testified that appellant killed the victim (who was a total stranger to him) solely to satisfy his emotional tension and that in Crumbley\u2019s opinion appellant could be dangerous to society and to other inmates. Dr. Crumbley stated that his two interviews with appellant took fifteen to twenty minutes each and that he had performed no psychiatric or psychological testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then cross-examined the doctor, eliciting his opinion that appellant was acting under extreme, uncontrollable emotional distress when he committed the murder, that appellant \u201ccouldn\u2019t help what he did,\u201d that appellant\u2019s condition was treatable, and that if treated appellant would no longer be dangerous. Dr. Crumbley explained that there were confinement facilities specializing in treatment of individuals with the kind of emotional disturbance suffered by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">Defense counsel called no witnesses, and following the doctor\u2019s testimony the attorneys argued briefly concerning the aggravating and mitigating factors enumerated in the Florida capital sentencing statute. The prosecuting attorney argued that five of the aggravating factors<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and none of the mitigating factors<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> were present. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that at most the prosecution had established only one aggravating factor<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that this was outweighed by the mitigating evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>III. Procedural Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">In 1976, Congress expanded district courts\u2019 delegatory authority by permitting appointment of magistrates to conduct evidentiary hearings in federal habeas cases. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>In <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980), the Supreme Court, interpreting the Federal Magistrates Act, held that a district court judge need not rehear the testimony on which the magistrate relied in accepting the magistrate\u2019s findings or recommendation. Rather, the Court held, the statutory command to district court judges to \u201cmake a de novo determination\u201d of those portions of the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations to which the parties object is satisfied as long as the judge, rather than the magistrate, exercises \u201cultimate adjudicatory power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674-76, 100 S.Ct. at 2411-12. The Court also held that this arrangement does not violate the due process clause or article III of the Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 677-84, 100 S.Ct. at 2413-16. The Court left open the question whether a district court judge may constitutionally <em>\u201creject </em>a magistrate\u2019s proposed findings on credibility when those findings are dispositive and substitute the judge\u2019s own appraisal ... without seeing and hearing the witness or witnesses: whose credibility is in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681 n.7, 100 S.Ct. at 2415 n.7. The Fifth Circuit addressed the latter issue in <em>Louis v. Blackburn, </em>630 F.2d 1105 (5th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It held that in cases involving the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant due process requires that, before entering an order inconsistent with the credibility choices made by a magistrate, a district court judge must himself hear the testimony of witnesses whose testimony is determinative. <em>Id. </em>at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">Appellant argues that the district court judge\u2019s rejection, without hearing testimony, of the magistrate\u2019s recommendation concerning his ineffective counsel claim was erroneous under <em>Louis v. Blackburn. </em>Determining whether the judge\u2019s order is \u201cinconsistent with credibility choices made by the magistrate\u201d is a two-step process. First, we must review the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and decide whether credibility choices he made in assessing appellant\u2019s ineffective counsel claim were dispositive. If the answer is affirmative, we must then scrutinize the district court\u2019s order to ascertain if the judge\u2019s rejection of the magistrate\u2019s recommendation was also a rejection, whether express or implicit, of the magistrate\u2019s credibility choices. <em>See id. </em>at 1107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">In support of his ineffective counsel claim, appellant presented to the magistrate numerous detailed allegations concerning the defense attorney\u2019s actions before trial, at the guilt stage of the trial, and at the sentencing phase. The magistrate rejected all of appellant\u2019s ineffective counsel arguments except that based on the sentencing phase, and the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings with respect to the pre-sentencing claims. Hence, appellant\u2019s <em>Louis v. Blackburn </em>due process challenge is limited to his claim of ineffective counsel at sentencing, on which the magistrate and judge disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-12\">The magistrate concluded appellant had received ineffective assistance at the penalty hearing due to five flaws in defense counsel\u2019s representation: (1) the attorney\u2019s failure to present any mitigating evidence, (2) his consent to the admission of Dr. Crumbley\u2019s testimony, (3) his failure to request a presentence investigation report, (4) his failure to explain the circumstances of appellant\u2019s prior conviction, and (5) the brevity of his argument. The magistrate\u2019s conclusion that these omissions, viewed cumulatively, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel was based partly on his analysis of the constitutional requirements for sentencing in capital cases and partly on his assessment of the reasons for the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>ney\u2019s failure to ensure those requirements were met at Proffitt\u2019s trial. The district court addressed each of the bases for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel and rejected all five. We now consider whether the magistrate\u2019s conclusions on these issues were based on credibility choices concerning testimony at the evidentiary hearing and, if so, whether the district court\u2019s disagreement with the magistrate involved a rejection of such credibility choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">A. <em>Failure to Present Mitigating Character Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">1. <em>The Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\"><em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), established a constitutional requirement in capital cases that the sentencing authority consider all mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant relating to his character and record and to the circumstances of the particular offense. Appellant\u2019s trial took place in 1974, some four years prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lockett. </em>At that time, the rule had not yet been established that the Constitution compels consideration of all relevant mitigating character evidence. Moreover, although the Supreme Court subsequently interpreted the Florida statute as not limiting sentencer consideration of mitigating evidence,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the ambiguous wording of the statute left open the question whether that act allowed consideration of mitigating character evidence other than that falling within the statutorily enumerated factors.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">At the sentencing phase of appellant\u2019s trial his counsel presented no evidence of his character or personal history.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The attorney\u2019s testimony at the magistrate\u2019s evidentiary hearing indicates that, at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, he understood the Florida statute as limiting the mitigating evidence that could be introduced to that falling within the statutory mitigating circumstances. Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing 190-91, 218-20. In a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment the defense attorney asserted <em>inter alia </em>that the Florida death-penalty statute unconstitutionally limited presentation of mitigating evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial judge denied the motion, however, and defense counsel made no further attempt to introduce nonstatutory evidence. Although the attorney testified that his interpretation of the statute influenced his decision as to what evidence to present at the sentenc- \u25a0 ing hearing, he suggested that other reasons were important as well. In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>he stated that he believed that he could fit any mitigating evidence within the statutory mitigating factors, <em>id. </em>at 191 \u2014 92, and that, in any event, the defendant had instructed him not to introduce any mitigating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">2. <em>The Magistrate\u2019s Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">In assessing whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence constituted ineffective assistance, the magistrate recognized that <em>Proffitt </em>was one of the first capital cases tried under the then newly-enacted Florida death penalty statute and that Proffitt\u2019s trial preceded the <em>Lockett </em>decision by several years. The magistrate did not believe the attorney\u2019s \u201cmisperception of the law\u201d was excused, however, by the indefiniteness of that constitutional rule at that time. The magistrate accepted defense counsel\u2019s testimony \u201cthat he went into the trial assuming that he could not put on any evidence in mitigation except as set forth in the statute.\u201d Nonetheless, the magistrate concluded that the subsequent Supreme Court holding against limiting mitigation evidence was reasonably foreseeable and that the attorney had in fact anticipated it. The magistrate rejected defense counsel\u2019s statement that he introduced no mitigating evidence pursuant to an instruction from appellant based on his not wanting to spend twenty-five years in jail.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The magistrate also rejected respondent\u2019s assertion that defense counsel failed to present mitigating evidence because no such evidence was available. The magistrate relied on a written proffer of evidence submitted by appellant in finding that the attorney could have procured favorable character evidence to present at the penalty phase. In addition to the proffer, defense counsel\u2019s testimony that he did not call appellant\u2019s mother because he could not think of any reason to do so except for \u201cthe possible sympathy that it might have evoked from the jury,\u201d instead of supporting counsel\u2019s decision, in the magistrate\u2019s view bolstered appellant\u2019s claim that she should have been called as a witness to testify concerning appellant\u2019s character and personal history. The magistrate attributed defense counsel\u2019s failure to present mitigation evidence to a \u201clack of preparation\u201d as well as to a mistake of law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">In summary, the evidence considered by the magistrate on the issue of defense counsel\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence included (1) the trial record (including pretrial motions filed by defense counsel), (2) defense counsel\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing, and (3) a written proffer of evidence submitted by appellant. The testimonial evidence he referred to in his memorandum included the defense attorney\u2019s statements concerning his understanding of the law respecting the Florida death penalty statute, his description of his preparation for the penalty stage of trial, and his statement that his failure to introduce mitigating evidence was in response to appellant\u2019s instructions. The magistrate accepted the attorney\u2019s testimony as to his interpretation of the statute and his preparation for the penalty stage of trial; indeed, the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>trate relied on this testimony in finding counsel\u2019s assistance inadequate. The magistrate disbelieved defense counsel\u2019s statement that he was following Proffitt\u2019s instructions in not introducing mitigating evidence, however, and the rejection of this testimony was critical to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">3. <em>The District Court\u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">The district court disagreed with the magistrate\u2019s conclusions concerning defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce mitigating evidence at the penalty stage. The judge\u2019s disagreement stemmed primarily from a difference in his interpretation of the standard for judging ineffective assistance of counsel claims rather than from differences in his view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">The judge agreed with the magistrate that defense counsel had labored under the impression that evidence in mitigation was limited to the specific mitigating circumstances enumerated in the statute. He disagreed, however, with the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel had erroneously interpreted the law as it existed at the time of trial. The attorney\u2019s \u201cmisapprehension of the law,\u201d the judge found, could \u201conly be characterized as a misapprehension through hindsight which has the advantage of <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>decided four years later.\u201d The attorney\u2019s belief that evidence in mitigation was limited to the statutory circumstances was, in the judge\u2019s view, \u201cunderstandable,\u201d and his inclusion in a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d pre-trial motion of the contention that, as such, the statute was unconstitutional did not undermine that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">The judge disagreed with the magistrate\u2019s assessment of the evidence insofar as the magistrate attributed counsel\u2019s omission to insufficient preparation rather than unavailability of mitigating evidence. The judge cited the defense attorney\u2019s testimony concerning his general preparation for trial \u2014 testimony not referred to in the magistrate\u2019s memorandum. The judge relied on the attorney\u2019s statements that he had met with appellant weekly to discuss the case, that he had engaged the assistance of an investigator, that he had talked to witnesses in Tampa who knew and worked with appellant, and that he had personally traveled to Connecticut to interview members of appellant\u2019s family. Moreover, the judge found convincing the attorney\u2019s testimony that he had not called appellant\u2019s sister as a mitigating witness because she had a criminal record; that he had not called appellant\u2019s half-brother because he and appellant \u201chad not had a relationship for some time\u201d; that he had not called appellant\u2019s mother because she was ill and therefore unable to travel from Connecticut to Florida for the trial, because appellant did not want to get his family involved, and because the attorney felt appellant\u2019s mother had nothing of substance to contribute in any event; and that he had not called appellant\u2019s'wife because he did not feel she would make a good witness since she was unhappy with appellant\u2019s lifestyle and because he was concerned that calling her to testify might constitute waiver of the marital privilege, which appellant had asserted to prevent her from testifying at the guilt phase of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">In accepting the above-described testimony, the judge did not reject any credibility determinations implicitly made by the magistrate in violation of <em>Louis v. Blackburn, supra. </em>Although the magistrate ultimately concluded that the attorney\u2019s failure was the product of his \u201cmisperception of the law\u201d and \u201cnot the result of tactical considerations,\u201d nothing in the magistrate\u2019s findings indicates he did not credit the above testimony. First, the magistrate\u2019s acceptance of appellant\u2019s proffer describing mitigating evidence that could have been introduced does not indicate that he rejected the defense attorney\u2019s testimony concerning why he did not present certain witnesses. In addition to appellant\u2019s relatives, whom the defense attorney declined to call, the proffer lists as possible witnesses several other persons, including one of appellant\u2019s supervisors and a psychiatrist who examined appellant after trial. The magistrate, without accepting \u201call the details in the proffer as true,\u201d simply found that the information it contained generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>indicated that the defense attorney could have called character witnesses on appellant\u2019s behalf. Since the magistrate did not expressly reject the defense attorney\u2019s testimony as to why he did not call certain of the enumerated witnesses, the only conclusion one can draw from his partial reliance on the proffer is that he felt it probable the attorney could have called some of the witnesses listed by appellant in the proffer and not that the reasons the attorney gave for rejecting particular witnesses were not believable. The district court judge, on the other hand, rejected appellant\u2019s written proffer of evidence, correctly concluding that the magistrate\u2019s reliance on the proffer was improper. Even if the proffer had constituted competent evidence, however, rejection by the judge of such nontestimonial evidence would not require a second evidentiary hearing under <em>Louis v. Blackburn. </em>Second, the magistrate\u2019s memorandum does not evince disbelief of the defense attorney\u2019s description of his general preparatory efforts. Rather, the magistrate thought the attorney\u2019s failure to plan a separate strategy for the sentencing phase rendered his assistance inadequate irrespective of whatever other preparatory efforts the attorney undertook before and during trial. Nor does the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion indicate that the judge disbelieved the defense attorney\u2019s testimony, which the magistrate accepted, to the effect that the attorney engaged in no special preparation for the penalty phase; the judge simply disagreed that such separate preparation was required to meet the legal standard of reasonably effective counsel. We conclude that the judge\u2019s rejection of the magistrate\u2019s recommended ruling that defense counsel\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence rendered his representation inadequate did not depend on differences in credibility choices requiring a rehearing under <em>Louis v. Blackburn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">B. <em>Absence of Presentence Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADM\">The magistrate concluded that defense counsel erred by failing to request a presentence investigation report. Such investigation he found was necessary to provide information on appellant\u2019s character and background, on which no other information in the record had shed any light. Moreover, because \u201cthe only view the jury and the judge had of the petitioner was the impersonal picture drawn by Dr. Crumbley of an obsessed killer,\u201d presentation to the sentences of information about appellant\u2019s personality and characteristics could be critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">The defense attorney\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing on this point was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-7\">Q Do you believe there was a pre-sentence investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-8\">A Should have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-9\">Q If there was not one, should you have asked for one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-10\">A Should have been automatic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-11\">Q Why would it be automatic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-12\">A Well, let me put it this way. I know it\u2019s automatic now unless waived by statutory authority. Whether that statute was in effect at the time of Proffitt\u2019s trial, I can\u2019t tell you. But I do recall a pre-sentence investigation being run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-13\">Q Did you recall th\u00e1t there was a presentence investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-14\">A I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-15\">Q And if there hadn\u2019t been one, should you have asked for one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-17\">A If there were such things as pre-sentence investigations then, and I think there were, I should have asked for one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aimv\">Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing 275-76. As the magistrate noted, the record indicates that no presentence investigation was conducted for Proffitt\u2019s trial. The magistrate\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s failure to demand such an investigation constituted ineffective assistance rested partly on the magistrate\u2019s opinion that the Crumbley testimony, which presented a very negative picture of appellant\u2019s character, created a strong need for \u201chumanizing information\u201d about appellant. The magistrate also viewed the statement by the attorney at the evidentiary hearing that he \u201cshould have asked for\u201d a presentence investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>as an admission that he erred in not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">The district court judge, noting that the attorney\u2019s testimony \u201cwas given from unaided memory more than five years after the trial,\u201d found it \u201cnoteworthy that counsel in his testimony talked about \u2018now\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018then.\u2019 \u201d The judge observed that the Florida rule governing presentence investigation reports in criminal cases was amended shortly before appellant\u2019s trial to extend authorization for trial courts to order presentence investigations from only \u201ccases in which probation is authorized by law\u201d to \u201call cases in which the court has discretion as to what sentence may be imposed.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Rule 1.790, Fla.R.Crim.P. [adopted by Florida Supreme Court, 196 So.2d 124 (1967) (effective Jan. 1, 1968), as amended by 211 So.2d 203 (Fla. 1968) and 253 So.2d 421 (Fla.1971)] <em>with </em>Rule 3.710, Fla.R.Crim.P. [adopted by Florida Supreme Court, 272 So.2d 65 (Fla.1972); codified at 34 Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 3.710 (West 1975) ]. Although the language of the new rule seems to encompass capital cases (as compared with the old rule, which was expressly limited to cases in which probation could be granted), the Committee Note indicates it was not intended to cover capital cases.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The district court judge recognized that later cases have held Rule 3.710 neither requires nor precludes presentence investigations in capital cases, <em>see Thompson v. State, </em>328 So.2d 1 (Fla.1976); <em>Songer v. State, </em>322 So.2d 481 (Fla.1975); <em>Swan v. State, </em>322 So.2d 485 (Fla.1975). Nonetheless, he found that \u201cat the time of Petitioner\u2019s trial in 1974, both historical as well as contemporary legal opinion and authority was to the effect that presentence investigation reports were not customary or necessary in capital cases; and, in fact, there was a serious question at the time that the use of a presentence report might even be error.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\"> The district judge\u2019s disagreement with the magistrate on whether counsel\u2019s failure to request a presentence investigation constituted ineffective assistance directly concerns the attorney\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing. In some sense, the disagreement can be viewed as a difference in interpretation of that testimony. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>difference was not a matter of credibility, however. This is not a situation in which the magistrate believed the attorney was telling the truth but the district court disbelieved his testimony. Rather, the magistrate interpreted the attorney\u2019s statement as a simple admission that he should have requested a presentence investigation, while the district judge interpreted it as a conditional admission that he should have requested one if the law authorized such investigations at the time of Proffitt\u2019s trial. These circumstances thus present us with an issue we have not previously faced: whether the reasoning of <em>Louis v. Blackburn, supra, </em>requires that a district court judge conduct a new evidentiary hearing when the judge\u2019s interpretation of a witness\u2019s testimony differs from that of the magistrate on a point critical to decision of the issue to which the testimony is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">The rationale for requiring district judges to rehear testimony before rejecting credibility choices made by a magistrate lies in the recognition that credibility choices frequently depend on the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of the witness\u2019s demeanor. Obviously, observation of such factors as witnesses\u2019 facial expressions and tone of voice cannot be observed by reading a \u201ccold and impersonal written transcript.\u201d <em>See Louis v. Blackburn, </em>630 F.2d at 1110. These factors not only reflect on the witness\u2019s credibility (i.e., on his sincerity and the degree of certainty with which he asserts matters about which he testifies) but may also reflect on the meaning the witness intends by the words he uses when such meaning is unclear from the words alone. We thus do not hold that a judge need never rehear testimony when he attributes a different meaning to words uttered by a witness than the meaning ascribed to them by the magistrate. Unless the words spoken by the witness are inherently ambiguous, however, the decision whether a second hearing is necessary must be left to the sound discretion of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">In the case before us, the witness\u2019s testimony was not inherently unclear. The attorney\u2019s remark that \u201cif there were such things as pre-sentence investigations then, ... I should have asked for one,\u201d itself suggests that at some point relevant to the period in question there was a change either in the law or in practice with respect to conducting presentence investigations. The magistrate made no apparent attempt to decipher the attorney\u2019s ambiguous reference to change and interpreted the attorney\u2019s testimony without the benefit of such understanding. The district judge, on the other hand, determined what changes had occurred and took them into consideration in interpreting the attorney\u2019s testimony. When viewed in the context of the changes in Florida\u2019s law governing presentence investigations that occurred shortly after Proffitt\u2019s trial, the import of the defense attorney\u2019s statement becomes clear: if Proffitt\u2019s trial took place after the statute requiring presentence investigations in felony cases was enacted, <em>see </em>note 25 <em>supra, </em>then he should have requested such an investigation; if the trial took place before it became clear that such investigations were proper in capital cases, however, he was admitting to no such obligation. Since the defense counsel\u2019s testimony was not inherently vague, and since any uncertainty it presented was resolvable by reference to matters within the judicial notice of the court, <em>J. M. Blythe Motor Lines Corp, v. Blalock, </em>310 F.2d 77 (5th Cir. 1972) (federal courts will take judicial notice of state laws without requiring proof thereof), the district judge did not abuse his discretion in rejecting the magistrate\u2019s interpretation of that testimony without rehearing the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">C. <em>Failure to Object to Admission of Crumbley Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">At the penalty stage of appellant\u2019s trial, the defense attorney waived appellant\u2019s doctor-patient privilege and allowed the prosecutor to introduce Dr. Crumbley\u2019s testimony. After cross-examining the doctor, he argued that the testimony established two mitigating circumstances: that the crime was committed while appellant was under extreme mental or emotional stress and that appellant\u2019s capacity to appreciate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>the criminality of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The prosecutor countered these arguments by contending that the doctor\u2019s opinions concerning appellant\u2019s mental state were not reliable because the doctor had no psychiatric credentials and had performed no psychiatric tests on appellant. The prosecutor argued further that the doctor\u2019s testimony showed appellant was likely to kill other people in the future and was therefore a danger to society \u2014 an argument not justified by any of the statutorily enumerated aggravating circumstances but nonetheless likely to appeal to the emotions of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">At the evidentiary hearing, the attorney testified that he allowed the introduction of the doctor\u2019s testimony because he thought it would establish mitigating circumstances. He also stated that he had hoped the trial judge, who under the Florida statute renders the final decision on sentencing, \u201cwould be able to cut through the emotional impact of that information, recognize it as a mitigating circumstance, and rule in accordance with that recognition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">The magistrate concluded that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of Dr. Crumbley\u2019s testimony was so grievous an error that \u201ca substantial contention can be made that this failure alone constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d In the magistrate\u2019s view, the introduction of this \u201cfrightening\u201d testimony was unnecessary to obtain evidence of psychiatric mitigating circumstances because the attorney could have obtained other psychiatric opinions through a privately employed psychiatrist. Moreover the magistrate noted that Dr. Crumbley\u2019s \u201copinion as to whether the petitioner was laboring under emotional distress or a substantial mental impairment did not carry much force\u201d in light of his lack of psychiatric credentials. At the very least, the magistrate concluded, \u201cthe use of Dr. Crumbley\u2019s testimony significantly increased the need to present humanizing information in order to counteract the dramatic impact of that testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">The district court judge disagreed that the attorney\u2019s decision to waive appellant\u2019s privilege constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The judge found that the record of the penalty hearing, as well as defense counsel\u2019s testimony at the habeas hearing, showed that the attorney had had a \u201ccogent reason\u201d for his decision: \u201c[t]he Petitioner had already been found guilty at that point in the proceeding and counsel expected to develop on cross-examination the existence of two of the statutory mitigating circumstances, namely, that the Petitioner acted \u2018under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,\u2019 and that \u2018the capacity of the defendant . . . to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.\u2019 \u201d The judge found that defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the doctor at the penalty hearing was clearly directed toward developing the enumerated mitigating circumstances and that his argument at the habeas hearing reinforced the conclusion that development of those circumstances was the basis for his waiving the privilege. The judge disagreed with the magistrate\u2019s statement that Crumbley\u2019s testimony was unnecessary to establish the statutory mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-9\">[T]he magistrate\u2019s reasoning is further flawed on this point because it presupposes the contemporary availability of such testimony from other qualified sources. The fact is that two other practicing psychiatrists subsequently appointed by the trial judge failed to support Dr. Crumbley\u2019s view concerning the mitigating circumstances about which he testified. Defense counsel used what he had, and it may well have been all he could get.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-10\">The judge\u2019s disagreement does not rest on rejection of credibility choices made by the magistrate. The factors on which the magistrate\u2019s conclusion rested included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>(1) the content of appellant\u2019s conversations with Dr. Crumbley, which the magistrate found to be \u201cfrightening\u201d; (2) the doctor\u2019s \u201clack of psychiatric credentials,\u201d which in the magistrate\u2019s view rendered his opinion \u201cwithout much force\u201d; and (3) a presumption that other psychiatric opinions supportive of the statutory mitigating circumstances could have been obtained. The magistrate did not derive any of these considerations from testimony given at the evidentiary hearing, nor could he have done so. The facts involved were all taken from the record of the penalty hearing, with the exception of the question of availability of alternative favorable psychiatric testimony, which may have been based partly on information contained in appellant\u2019s proffer. As noted above, the judge was not required to accept the written proffer. Neither, of course, was he required to accept the magistrate\u2019s assessment of facts contained in the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">Although the district judge\u2019s opinion indicates that he gave credence to defense counsel\u2019s testimony concerning the reasons for his decision to waive appellant\u2019s privilege, that testimony was not mentioned by the magistrate. The testimony established that despite the frightening nature of the evidence and its potential negative emotional impact on the jury, the defense attorney \u201chope[d]\u201d that the judge would recognize it as a mitigating circumstance. Not only did the magistrate not explicitly reject this testimony, but such rejection is not implicitly required by his conclusion. <em>See Louis v. Blackburn, </em>630 F.2d at 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">D. <em>Failure to Explain Prior Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">Under the Florida capital sentencing statute, prior criminal conduct by a defendant is relevant to sentencing in two respects. First, a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for \u201canother capital felony or [] a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person\u201d may be considered by the sentencer as an aggravating circumstance. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(5)(b) (West Supp. 1982). Second, that \u201c[t]he defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity\u201d is a statutory mitigating circumstance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 921.141(6)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-10\">At the sentencing phase of appellant\u2019s trial, the prosecution introduced a certified copy of a judgment of conviction against appellant for \u201cBreaking and Entering Without Permission.\u201d The defense attorney made no attempt to explain the circumstances of this conviction, and appellant claims that the facts render the conviction insignificant either as an aggravating circumstance or to rebut the mitigating one.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The magistrate accepted the explanation of the conviction provided by appellant in his written proffer and concluded that defense counsel should have presented these facts in rebuttal. No testimony or other evidence was presented to the magistrate either by the state or by appellant concerning the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-11\">The district judge rejected the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that the defense attorney should have presented evidence to explain or rebut the prior conviction. Citing <em>United States v. Gray, </em>565 F.2d 881, 887 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 955, 98 S.Ct. 1587, 55 L.Ed.2d 807 (1978), the district court stated that, in its view, the magistrate mistakenly accepted \u201cspeculative and inconcrete claims of \u2018what might have been if.\u2019 \u201d The judge\u2019s primary basis for disagreement, however, was his conclusion, after reviewing the record of the penalty hearing, that \u201c[t]he matter of Petitioner\u2019s prior conviction was a low profile subject which, in terms of Petitioner\u2019s best interests at that time, might well have been handled by his counsel with utmost skill in choosing to leave it that way.\u201d Neither the magistrate\u2019s nor the judge\u2019s conclusions on this issue were based on any testimony at the evidentiary hearing; the opinions of each and the disagreement between them were based solely on appellant\u2019s written proffer and on a review of the trial transcript for the penalty phase. Hence <em>Louis v. Black</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number><em>burn, supra, </em>provides no basis for challenging this portion of this district judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">E. <em>Brevity of Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">Similarly, the magistrate\u2019s comment that the generality and brevity of the defense counsel\u2019s argument at the sentencing hearing \u201cadds weight\u201d to appellant\u2019s ineffective counsel claim and the district judge\u2019s disagreement with that statement were based on their differing views about facts contained in the trial record and not on any evidence brought out at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">F. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">For the reasons stated above, we find that the district court\u2019s disagreement with the magistrate on appellant\u2019s ineffective counsel claim did not turn on rejection of credibility choices made by the magistrate. Hence appellant was not entitled, under <em>Louis v. Blackburn, supra, </em>to a second evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-8\">IV. Substantive Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-9\">A. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">Appellant contends his attorney\u2019s representation at trial was inadequate to meet minimum constitutional standards. This contention involves the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s key witness, a boarder named Mary Bassett who resided with appellant and his wife in their trailer. Bassett testified at trial that she was awakened early on the morning of the murder and overheard a conversation between appellant and his wife in which appellant related the facts of the killing. Appellant\u2019s attorney filed a pre-trial motion to suppress this testimony on the ground that the conversation was a confidential communication between appellant and his wife and therefore was privileged under Florida law. The attorney renewed the objection at the close of the testimony and, after an adverse ruling on that issue and appellant\u2019s ensuing conviction, asserted it as a ground of error on appeal. Appellant now argues that the defense attorney\u2019s failure to present evidence in support of the suppression motion violated his right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-12\">The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s assertion of privilege. Appellant describes the court\u2019s holding as based on an absence of evidence supporting the alleged confidentiality of the conversation. He attributes this lack of evidence to his trial counsel and maintains that had the attorney put appellant or his wife on the stand or brought forth other available evidence, confidentiality would have been shown. We reject appellant\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, in contrast to appellant\u2019s characterization, the Florida Supreme Court not only found an absence of evidence that the statements were made in confidence; it found affirmative evidence in the record indicating that they were not. <em>See Proffitt v. State, </em>315 So.2d 461, 465 (Fla.1975). Thus, even had the attorney presented contrary evidence the evidence would have been conflicting, and the likelihood that appellant would have prevailed on the privilege claim is not great. More importantly, appellant presents no convincing evidence that his attorney might have proffered to support the privilege claim. Appellant contends, for example, that he or his wife \u201ccould have testified to their actual, subjective expectations of privacy.\u201d Such testimony would not have aided appellant, however, since Florida employs an objective standard of confidentiality. As the Florida Supreme . Court stated on appellant\u2019s direct appeal, no privilege attaches to marital communications where the spouses knew or <em>should have known </em>that the communication was being overheard. <em>Proffitt v. State, </em>315 So.2d at 464. The Florida court specifically found appellant and his wife \u201cwere speaking in a manner and place where they had a reasonable chance of being overheard, and [] knew of that possibility at that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. To the extent Mrs. Proffitt\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing suggested different facts, the district court found her testimony incredible. Hence, even if appellant or his wife had testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>and the court had believed they were unaware that Bassett could hear their conversation, such conversation would not have been privileged under Florida law. Nor does appellant\u2019s proffer of evidence that Bassett may have derived some of her information from conversations with appellant\u2019s wife or the police rather than by overhearing appellant convince us that his attorney failed him. The district court found the attorney had investigated fairly thoroughly how Bassett learned of the information about the killing and had eliminated the possibility that she had heard it from news reports, appellant\u2019s wife, or the police. These findings are not clearly erroneous. We therefore conclude that appellant received reasonably effective assistance at the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">B. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim that he was denied effective legal assistance at the penalty phase of his trial rests on arguments substantially similar to those he made to the district court. We begin our analysis by considering the standard governing our review of the district court\u2019s holding and, in turn, of the performance rendered by appellant\u2019s trial attorney. As to the former, the Fifth Circuit has held that \u201cwhether a defendant has enjoyed effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law\u201d as to which \u201cthe court of appeals must make an independent evaluation based on [the district court\u2019s] subsidiary findings.\u201d <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em>655 F.2d 1346,1354 (5th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In other words, the district court\u2019s conclusion on this question is entitled to no special deference; rather this court must review the record of counsel\u2019s \u201cactual performance [in] conducting the defense\u201d and determine independently whether the constitutional standard was met. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. Once having reviewed the record, the sixth amendment standard we must apply in assessing counsel\u2019s performance is that of \u201creasonably effective assistance.\u201d This standard is not to be viewed as a guarantee of \u201cerrorless counsel\u201d; nor may counsel\u2019s performance be judged by benefit of hindsight. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the assistance rendered must be evaluated \u201cfrom the perspective of counsel, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case, but only as those circumstances were known to him at the time in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1356. We note further that the constitutional standard for effective counsel is no more stringent in capital cases than in cases where less severe punishments are imposed. Nonetheless, the seriousness of the charges against the defendant is a factor that must be considered in assessing counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Id. </em>at 1357. With this standard in mind, we now consider the alleged defects that appellant claims rendered his trial counsel\u2019s representation inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-9\">1. <em>Failure to Present Character Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">Appellant argues that his attorney should have called character witnesses to testify on his behalf at the sentencing hearing. The magistrate agreed that the attorney erred by not presenting \u201chumanizing information [ ][ ] to counteract the dramatic impact of [Dr. Crumbley\u2019s] testimony.\u201d We do not dispute that the jury\u2019s impression of appellant, based on the evidence introduced by the prosecution at the guilt and penalty stages of his trial, was possibly unbalanced. We further agree that a cogent presentation of character evidence could have influenced the jury to recommend a life sentence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We do not agree, however, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that the attorney\u2019s failure to introduce such nonstatutory mitigating evidence rendered his assistance ineffective. Even accepting <em>arguendo </em>appellant\u2019s allegation that character witnesses willing to testify in his favor were available at the time of his trial, we cannot say that the attorney\u2019s performance, evaluated \u201cfrom the perspective of counsel, taking into account the circumstances . .. known to him at the time,\u201d <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em>655 F.2d at 1356, was not reasonably effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">At the time of appellant\u2019s trial in 1974, the law concerning capital sentencing was in a state of reformation. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), that the sentencer in a capital case must be free to consider all relevant mitigating evidence had not yet been decided; nor was that result clearly foreshadowed by <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) \u2014 the only contemporary death penalty case decided by the United States Supreme Court prior to appellant\u2019s trial. Moreover, Florida\u2019s capital sentencing statute was barely a year old at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, and the only Florida Supreme Court case addressing its constitutionality supported an interpretation of the statute as limiting the mitigating evidence that could be considered to that falling within the seven statutory factors.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In view of these facts, the defense attorney\u2019s belief that he could not, under the Florida statute, introduce evidence of mitigating factors not listed in Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(6) was entirely reasonable. His decision not to call witnesses at the penalty stage to testify about appellant\u2019s general character and background was therefore justifiable and fully within the sixth amendment standard of reasonably effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">2. <em>Failure to Request Presentence Investigation Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\">Appellant claims that his trial attorney\u2019s failure to request a presentence investigation report prior to sentencing \u201cleft the court completely in the dark concerning petitioner\u2019s individual circumstances and constituted gross ineffectiveness of counsel.\u201d As noted above, the magistrate agreed with appellant but the district court did not. We agree with the conclusion reached by the district court for two reasons. First, appellant\u2019s argument and the magistrate\u2019s recommendation are predicated largely on the assumption that a presentence investigation, had it been conducted, would have revealed favorable evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>concerning appellant\u2019s character and background <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that in turn could have served as the basis for a claim of mitigating circumstances. To the extent such investigation might have provided evidence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, appellant\u2019s argument must fail for the same reason as his claim concerning the attorney\u2019s failure to present character witnesses; the attorney reasonably understood the law as limiting mitigating evidence to the statutory mitigating factors. Second, any claim that a presentence investigation would have revealed evidence of statutory mitigating factors, or evidence that would have rebutted the statutory aggravating factors, must also fail. Appellant has submitted no evidence demonstrating that a presentence investigation conducted at the time of his trial would have revealed evidence substantiating any statutory mitigating factors or repudiating any of the aggravating factors asserted by the prosecution. Moreover, having reviewed the testimony of defense counsel at the evidentiary hearing and the rules and cases relied on by the district court, we concur in the court\u2019s finding that at the time of appellant\u2019s trial Florida law did not provide for presentence investigations in capital cases.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the attorney\u2019s failure to request such investigation cannot be viewed as falling below the level of reasonably effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">3. <em>Mishandling of Psychiatric Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ag7\">Appellant discusses at length his attorney\u2019s handling of the psychiatric evidence at the sentencing phase of his trial. At the core of his argument is the fact that the attorney learned of the conversations between appellant and Dr. Crumbley by a telephone call from the doctor the night before the trial and, without requesting a continuance or further investigating this matter, relied solely on Crumbley\u2019s testimony to establish a mitigation defense at appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing. Appellant enumerates many ways in which the attorney failed him, arguing that he should have requested a continuance,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> obtained expert psychiatric assistance,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and perhaps should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>not have allowed admission of Dr. Crumbley\u2019s testimony at all. While having reviewed the transcript of the evidentiary hearing and the record of appellant\u2019s sentencing proceeding we may in hindsight agree that the attorney\u2019s performance was less than stellar, we cannot conclude that it fell below the standard of reasonably effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">4. <em>Other Ineffective Assistance Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">Appellant details a long list of other shortcomings in his trial counsel\u2019s performance to buttress his ineffective assistance claim, including the brevity of the attorney\u2019s sentencing argument and his failure to object to various arguments and evidence presented by the prosecution. As we have noted, the constitutional right to effective legal assistance is not a guarantee of errorless counsel, <em>Herring v. Estelle, </em>491 F.2d 125, 127 (5th Cir. 1974) (quoting <em>MacKenna v. Ellis, </em>280 F.2d 592, 599 (5th Cir. 1960), <em>modified, </em>289 F.2d 928 (5th Cir.)

Appellant\u2019s attorney agreed to the examinations,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and appellant was subsequently seen by Drs. Coffer and Sprehe. Both doctors submitted reports to the court, which stated that appellant was competent at the time of the examination and had been capable of distinguishing right from wrong when he committed the offense. Dr. Sprehe\u2019s report additionally opined that appellant\u2019s \u201clong standing compulsion to kill someone ... did not involve a break in reality testing and did not involve psychosis... . \u201d Dr. Sprehe described appellant as having</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALX\">a long standing sociopathic personality characterized by resort to violence as a solution to his life problems and [\u00b6] a rather chaotic life history with a lot of anti-social behavior including an Undesirable Discharge from the Armed Forces and numerous minor criminal convictions and other charges where he was not convicted. He had three rather chaotic marriages and has gen\u00e9rally lived his life outside the usual standards of society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">Following submission of the reports the judge ordered a hearing, at which the defense attorney waived appellant\u2019s right of presence. Dr. Coffer appeared and testified that he did not believe appellant committed the murder while under the influence of extreme emotional or mental pressure nor that appellant\u2019s capacity to conform his conduct to law was substantially impaired at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Dr. Sprehe was unable to attend, and defense counsel requested an opportunity to cross-examine him about the report. The judge indicated he would allow Sprehe\u2019s testimony to be taken and made part of the record at a later date but proceeded to sentence petitioner without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>Appellant raises two arguments with respect to the psychiatrists\u2019 reports and testimony. First, he claims the court\u2019s consideration of Dr. Sprehe\u2019s report without affording him an opportunity to confront and cross-examine Dr. Sprehe violated his rights to confrontation, due process, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. Second, appellant contends his constitutional right to be present at trial was violated by Dr. Coffer\u2019s testifying outside his presence and without his knowledge. The dis-r trict court rejected these claims. The court held that appellant\u2019s rights were not violated by his not being afforded an opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Sprehe because the trial judge \u201cdid not consider [Dr. Sprehe\u2019s] report in imposing sentence.\u201d Moreover, while accepting appellant\u2019s argument that his attorney\u2019s waiver of his right to be present during Dr. Coffer\u2019s testimony was ineffectual because not authorized by appellant personally, the court held that appellant\u2019s nonconsensual absence was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">1. <em>Use of Dr. Sprehe\u2019s Report Without Affording Appellant Opportunity for Cross-Examination </em><footnotemark>36a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHo\">The right to cross-examine adverse witnesses is guaranteed to criminal defendants by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. <em>Douglas v.

Traditionally, sentencing hearings have not been accorded the significance of the guilt-determination portion of trial; by and large, sentencing has been left to the broad discretion of the judge or jury, <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); <em>McGautha v. California, </em>402 U.S. 183, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971), and courts have declined to apply to sentencing most of the procedural rights guaranteed by the sixth amendment. <em>E.g., Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949) (confrontation and cross-examination); <em>United States v.

The justification for the refusal to extend the procedural limitations of the trial to the sentencing hearing was in part historical and in part rested on the belief that modern penological policies, which favor sentencing based on the maximum amount of information about the defendant, would be thwarted by restrictive procedural and evidentiary rules. <em>Williams v. New York, </em>357 U.S. at 246-50, 69 S.Ct. at 1082-84. The possibilities of delay in criminal administration and retrial of issues not relevant to the determination of guilt are additional considerations underlying the result in these cases. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 69 S.Ct. at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">Although the absence of procedural requirements designed to ensure fairness in sentencing has been widely criticized, Note, <em>supra </em>at 360; <em>see, e.g., </em>Kadish, <em>Legal Norm and Discretion in the Police and Sentencing Processes, </em>75 Harv.L.Rev. 904, 926-29 (1962), such has remained the constitutional rule with respect to sentencing in noncapital cases. <em>E.g., Farrow v. United States, </em>580 F.2d 1339, 1353-54 n.25 (9th Cir. 1978) (en banc); <em>United States v. Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707, 711-12 n.10 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>appeal after remand, </em>603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1073, 100 S.Ct. 1018, 62 L.Ed.2d 755 (1980). The constitutional requirements governing capital sentencing, by contrast, have undergone substantial evolution in the wake of <em>Furman v. Georgia. </em>The thrust of <em>Furman </em>and its progeny is that the risk of arbitrary imposition of the death penalty inherent in sentencing determinations made without substantive and procedural standards conflicts with the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>unusual punishment. Because the death penalty, unlike other punishments, is permanent and irrevocable, the procedures by which the decision to impose a capital sentence is made bring into play constitutional limitations not present in other sentencing decisions. <em>See Enmund v. </em>Florida, - U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 3375-76, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982); <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>438 U.S. at 605, 98 S.Ct. at 2965; <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 357-58, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977); <em>Woodson v.

Georgia, </em>408 U.S. at 286-91, 92 S.Ct. at 2750-53 (Brennan, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 306, 92 S.Ct. at 2760 (Stewart, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 314-71, 92 S.Ct. at 2764-2793 (Marshall, J., concurring). The Supreme Court has adhered to the traditional concept of individualized sentencing, see <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978); <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. at 303-04, 96 S.Ct. at 2990, but has imposed procedural, as well as substantive, limitations on capital sentence decisionmaking. The view, once prevalent, that the procedural requirements applicable to capital sentencing are no more rigorous than those governing noncapital sentencing decisions, <em>see, e.g., McGautha v. California, </em>402 U.S. at 217, 91 S.Ct. at 1472; <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. at 251-52, 69 S.Ct. at 1085, is no longer valid. <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 357-58, 97 S.Ct. at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">Although the Court has held capital sentencing proceedings must meet certain procedural requirements, it has not yet delineated the exact scope of constitutional procedural protection to which capital defendants are entitled. <em>See Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 358 n.9, 97 S.Ct. at 1204 n.9. Whether the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses extends to capital sentencing proceedings has not been specifically addressed by the Supreme Court and is an issue of first impression in this Circuit. We must therefore decide this question in accord with the general principles articulated by the Supreme Court in its recent death penalty decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">The focus of the Court\u2019s current capital sentencing decisions has been toward minimizing the risk of arbitrary decisionmaking. <em>See, e.g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>- U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 869, 874-76, 71 L.Ed.2d 1, 8-9 (1982); id. - U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 878, 71 L.Ed.2d at 13 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 427-28, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 1764-65, 64 L.Ed.2d 398; <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. at 605, 98 S.Ct. at 2965; <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 358, 97 S.Ct. at 1204; <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. at 188, 96 S.Ct. at 2932 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); <em>id. </em>at 189, 96 S.Ct. at 2932 (opinion of White, J., concurring); <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. at 248-49 &amp; n.11, 92 S.Ct. at 2731 &amp; n.11 (opinion of Douglas, J.); <em>id. </em>at 309-20, 92 S.Ct. at 2762-67 (opinion of Stewart, J.); <em>id. </em>at 313, 92 S.Ct. at 2764 (opinion of White, J.). Whereas earlier cases had focused on the quantity of information before the sentencing tribunal, recently the Court has shown greater concern for the quality of such information. <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 359, 97 S.Ct. at 1205. Thus, it has recognized the defendant\u2019s interest both in presenting evidence in his favor, <em>Eddings v. </em>Oklahoma, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982); <em>Lockett v. Ohio, supra, </em>and in being afforded the opportunity to explain or rebut evidence offered against him. <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 362, 97 S.Ct. at 1207. Reliability in the factfinding aspect of sentencing has been a cornerstone of these decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 359-60, 362, 97 S.Ct. at 1205; <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. at 305, 96 S.Ct. at 2991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-17\">In <em>Gardner v. Florida, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that a judge\u2019s reliance, in imposing the death penalty, on information not disclosed to the defendant or his attorney violated the defendant\u2019s rights to due process and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Gardner </em>is premised on the principle that death sentences may not constitutionally be imposed on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>information that the capital defendant has been afforded no opportunity to rebut. <em>See id. </em>at 362, 97 S.Ct. at 1206. The holding in <em>Gardner, </em>narrowly viewed, simply prohibits the use of \u201csecret information\u201d; the Court did not in that case address the scope of the capital defendant\u2019s procedural rights in attempting to rebut information that has openly been presented to the sentencing tribunal. In reaching its decision in <em>Gardner, </em>however, the Court emphasized the unacceptability of the \u201crisk that some information accepted in confidence may be erroneous, or may be misinterpreted, by the . . . sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 97 S.Ct. at 1205. Moreover, the Court expressly recognized the importance of participation by counsel and adversarial debate to eliciting the truth and \u201cevaluating the relevance and significance of aggravating and mitigating\u201d evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 97 S.Ct. at 1205. The Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis in <em>Gardner </em>and other capital sentencing cases on the reliability of the factfinding underlying the decision whether to impose the death penalty convinces us that the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses applies to capital sentencing hearings. The Supreme Court has recognized cross-examination as \u201cthe \u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (quoting 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1367 (3d ed. 1940)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-4\">The right of cross-examination is more than a desirable rule of trial procedure. It is implicit in the constitutional right of confrontation, and <em>helps assure the \u201caccuracy of the truth-determining process.\u201d </em>It is, indeed, \u201can essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.\u201d Of course, the right to confront and to cross-examine is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accomodate other legitimate interests in the criminal process. <em>But its denial or significant diminution calls into question the ultimate integrity of the fact-finding process\u2019 \u201d </em>and requires that the competing interest be closely examined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYp\"><em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1045, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973) (citations omitted; emphasis added). Where expert witnesses are employed, cross-examination is even more crucial to ensuring accurate fact-finding. Since, as in this case <em>(see </em>note 36 and accompanying text <em>supra), </em>information submitted by an expert witness generally consists of opinions, cross-examination is necessary not only to test the witness\u2019s knowledge and competence in the field to which his testimony relates but also to elicit the facts on which he relied in forming his opinions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">Finally, we note that the decision of the former Fifth Circuit in <em>Smith v. Estelle, </em>602 F.2d 694 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), buttresses our conclusion that appellant had a constitutional right to cross-examine Dr. Sprehe before the doctor\u2019s report could be used in determining sentence. In <em>Smith, </em>we reversed a death sentence that was based in part on the testimony of a psychiatrist whose name the prosecution had intentionally omitted from its witness list. A primary basis for the decision in that case was that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose its intent to call the doctor prevented the defendant\u2019s counsel from conducting effective cross-examination. <em>See id. </em>at 699-701 &amp; n.7.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Although the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>did not specifically address whether the defendant had a constitutional right to cross-examine the psychiatrist, it concluded that his testimony, \u201cnot effectively cross-examined by the [defense attorneys,] [] carries no assurance of reliability whatever,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 701, and hence that its use in sentencing the defendant violated the principles set forth in <em>Gardner v. Florida. </em>The reasoning in <em>Smith </em>clearly supports the view that the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses applies to capital sentencing proceedings, at least where necessary to ensure the reliability of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Gardner </em>indicates that abridgment of fundamental constitutional rights at capital sentencing may be justified in some instances where the state demonstrates a compelling interest. <em>See Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 358-61, 97 S.Ct. at 1205-06. <em>See also Smith v. Estelle, </em>602 F.2d at 701-02. Appellee suggests no cogent reason for denying appellant the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Sprehe, however. Nor does any justification appear in the record, which indicates neither the reason for Sprehe\u2019s absence from the hearing nor why the judge chose to proceed with sentencing without his cross-examination. The most likely explanation of the judge\u2019s actions was that he wished to avoid further delay in sentencing appellant. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Gardner </em>in a similar context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-6\">In those cases in which the accuracy of a report is contested, the trial judge can avoid delay by disregarding the disputed material. Or if the disputed matter is of critical importance, the time invested in ascertaining the truth would surely be well spent if it makes the difference between life and death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\"><em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 359-60, 97 S.Ct. at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">The district court did not address the merits of appellant\u2019s confrontation clause claim with respect to Dr. Sprehe\u2019s report because it found that \u201cthe trial court did not consider Dr. Sprehe\u2019s report in imposing sentence.\u201d We are bound by this factual finding unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Baty v. Balcom, </em>661 F.2d 391, 394 n.7 (5th Cir. 1981). The district court relied on statements by Judge Burnside, who presided at appellant\u2019s trial, to the effect that he did not use Dr. Sprehe\u2019s report in imposing sentence. A review of the judge\u2019s testimony reveals that he qualified his statement by explaining that he did receive and read Dr. Sprehe\u2019s report and considered it for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether it supported the psychiatric mitigating circumstances.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> After determining that the report did not support such mitigating factors, he did not consider it further. The court\u2019s reliance on this testimony is flawed in two respects. First, the district court should not have considered the trial judge\u2019s post-decision statements concerning the influence various facts had on his decision. The judge\u2019s testimony was not limited to matters of basic, historical fact but directly addressed the effect of the psychiatric evidence on his sentencing decision. Such post-decision statements by a judge or juror about his mental processes in reaching decision may not be used as evidence in a subsequent challenge to the decision. <em>See Fayerweather v. Ritch, </em>195 U.S. 276, 25 S.Ct. 58, 49 L.Ed. 193 (1904); <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>566 F.2d 1311, 1316 (5th Cir. 1978). Second, even had it been competent evidence, the judge\u2019s testimony does not support a finding that he made no use of the report. We therefore hold the district court\u2019s finding that the trial court did not consider Sprehe\u2019s report was clearly erroneous, and appellant was entitled to cross-examine Dr. Sprehe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>2. <em>Taking Dr. Coffer\u2019s Testimony in Appellant\u2019s Absence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">A defendant\u2019s right to be present at all stages of a criminal trial derives from the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Illinois v.

Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 579, 4 S.Ct. 202, 204, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This right extends to all hearings that are an essential part of the trial \u2014 i.e., to all proceedings at which the defendant\u2019s presence \u201chas a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934). <em>Compare Hopt v. Utah, supra </em>(defendant has right to be present at impaneling of jurors); <em>Bartone v. United States, </em>375 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 21, 11 L.Ed.2d 11 (1963) (court cannot impose sentence in absence of defendant); <em>with United States v. Howell, </em>514 F.2d 710 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 838, 97 S.Ct. 109, 50 L.Ed.2d 105 (1976) (no right to be present at <em>in camera </em>conference concerning attempted bribe of juror); <em>United States v. Gradsky, </em>434 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 894, 93 S.Ct. 203, 34 L.Ed.2d 151 (1971) (right to presence does not extend to evidentiary hearing on suppression motion). We have already held that the penalty phase is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>integral part of a capital trial for purposes of cross-examination. <em>See </em>text <em>supra </em>at 35-41. For similar reasons, we conclude that the capital defendant\u2019s interest in attending his sentencing hearing is as great as his interest in being present at the guilt-determining stage. <em>Cf. Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 358, 97 S.Ct. at 1204 (sentencing is \u201ccritical stage\u201d of capital trial). Hence we hold that the right to be present extends to the sentencing as well as the guilt portion of a capital trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\">The hearing at which Dr. Coffer testified, however, was not part of the statutory sentencing proceeding but rather was an ad hoc proceeding scheduled by the trial judge after completion of the formal sentencing hearing to allow cross-examination concerning court-ordered reports. The state argues that this \u201cpost-trial hearing\u201d is analogous to a suppression hearing, to which the Fifth Circuit has held the defendant\u2019s right of presence does not extend. <em>United States v. Gradsky, supra. Accord United States v. Bell, </em>464 F.2d 667 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 991, 93 S.Ct. 335, 34 L.Ed.2d 258 (1972). The function of the proceeding and its significance with respect to the trial, rather than the timing or sequence of events, is dispositive of the presence question, however. The psychiatric reports were evidence ordered by the court for its consideration in determining appellant\u2019s sentence. The purpose of the hearing was obviously to allow the attorneys to question the authors of those reports about the factual premises on which the reports were based, to probe further into the conclusions drawn by the two doctors, and otherwise to test the accuracy of the reports and their relevance to appellant\u2019s sentence. That the judge did not request the reports until after the jury had completed its advisory sentencing does not refute their evidentiary function nor preclude the possibility that they critically affected the sentencing decision. The judge is the ultimate decisionmaker under Florida\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, and his role in sentencing is as important as that of the jury \u2014 if not more so. <em>See Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 251-53, 96 S.Ct. at 2966-67 <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the hearing at which Dr. Coffer testified was a critical stage of appellant\u2019s trial at which he had a constitutional right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">The state argues that even if appellant was entitled to attend the hearing, his attorney waived that right. We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">First, our review of the relevant case law convinces us that presence at a capital trial is nonwaivable. The only precedents directly ruling on the issue are early Supreme Court cases holding that the right to presence in capital cases is so fundamental that the defendant cannot waive it. <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>223 U.S. 442, 455, 32 S.Ct. 250, 253, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912); <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 579, 4 S.Ct. 202, 204, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884). <em>Accord Near v. Cunningham, </em>313 F.2d 929, 931 (3d Cir. 1963)<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>More recently, commentators have interpreted dictum in <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) as authorizing a limited exception to the no-waiver rule for defendants who wilfully disrupt their trials, 3 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 723 (Supp.1980 at 754 n.28); 8B J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 43.02[2] at 43-9 (2d ed. 1981).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The state does not claim that appellant disrupted or hindered any part of his trial, however; hence such exception is inapplicable to this case. Another contemporary decision\u2014<em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 182, 95 S.Ct. 896, 909, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975)\u2014indicates that the Supreme Court may reconsider the issue of waiver of presence in a capital case. Until the Court expressly overrules its decisions in <em>Diaz </em>and <em>Hopt, </em>however, we are bound by the rule established in those cases that a capital defendant\u2019s right to presence is nonwaivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">Second, even were we to find sufficient support in the <em>Allen </em>and <em>Drope </em>cases for a departure from the no-waiver rule, we would at least adhere to the knowing-and-voluntary-consent requirement established in the noncapital context.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Appellee does not deny that appellant was neither apprised of the hearing with Dr. Coffer nor afforded an opportunity to assert his right to attend; hence appellant did not knowingly or voluntarily waive his right to presence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">The state\u2019s final argument with respect to the Coffer testimony is that any error in denying appellant\u2019s right to hear that testimony was harmless.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>the state presented deposition testimony of the trial judge to the effect that he ordered the doctors\u2019 reports and testimony solely to determine the existence of mitigating factors. Relying on this testimony, the district court found that appellant could have benefited from this psychiatric evidence only if it had supported a finding of mitigating factors. Even had appellant been present at the hearing and able to aid his attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Coffer, the district court reasoned, the doctor would not likely have completely reversed his position to support the mitigating circumstances claimed by appellant; hence, appellant\u2019s absence did not prejudice him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\">We cannot agree with the district court\u2019s approach.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We note again that the district court\u2019s consideration of the trial judge\u2019s testimony concerning his use of the psychiatrists\u2019 reports and their effect on his decision was improper. <em>See </em>text <em>supra </em>at 42. Thus, if the district court\u2019s finding that the psychiatrists\u2019 reports and testimony did not affect the trial judge\u2019s assessment of aggravating circumstances was supported solely by the latter\u2019s testimony, that finding could not stand. Review of the Coffer report and testimony in conjunction with the four aggravating factors found by the trial judge <em>(see </em>note 50 <em>infra), </em>however, provides independent support for the district court\u2019s finding. The only aggravating circumstance found by the trial judge to which Coffer\u2019s report and testimony were relevant was that the defendant \u201chas the propensity to commit the crime for which he was convicted.\u201d This factor was amply substantiated by appellant\u2019s own statements to Dr. Crumbley, which were related to the court at the sentencing hearing. Moreover, appellant has presented no evidence indicating that his presence at the Coffer hearing would have enabled him to rebut Coffer\u2019s testimony on that issue. Hence, whatever influence the Coffer testimony had on the trial judge\u2019s determination of aggravating factors was minimal and, in any event, harmless. We agree with the district court that appellant\u2019s absence from the Coffer hearing was significant only insofar as it may have prevented him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>assisting his attorney in developing mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">We must therefore address the district court\u2019s conclusion that the possibility appellant\u2019s absence affected the trial court\u2019s findings on mitigating factors was so insubstantial as to render his absence harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Applied in the right-to-presence context, the harmless error rule has been stated as requiring that \u201c[w]here there is any reasonable possibility of prejudice from the defendant\u2019s absence at any stage of the proceedings, a [judgment] cannot stand.\u201d <em>United States v. Stratton, </em>649 F.2d 1066, 1080 (5th Cir. 1981) (quoting <em>Estes v. United States, </em>335 F.2d 609, 618-19 (5th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 964, 85 S.Ct. 656, 13 L.Ed.2d 559 (1965)). Thus, whether or not appellant\u2019s absence likely prejudiced him is not the standard we must apply; rather, if there is any reasonable possibility appellant\u2019s absence and inability to respond to Dr. Coffer\u2019s testimony affected the sentencing decision, we will not engage in speculation as to the probability that his presence would have made a difference. <em>Cf. Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 317, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) (where trial judge violated accused\u2019s right to confrontation by preventing defense from impeaching credibility of prosecution witness, Court would not speculate whether trier of fact would have accepted defense\u2019s impeachment theory).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The district court concluded appellant\u2019s absence was harmless because appellant did not demonstrate that, had he been present and able to assist his attorney at the hearing, he would have been able to effectuate a \u201ccomplete reversal\u201d of Coffer\u2019s opinion concerning the psychiatric mitigating factors. The court found no evidence that such would have been the case. Having reviewed the record, we simply cannot agree. Appellant has shown that during the period when he was examined by Drs. Coffer and Sprehe he was receiving anti-psychotic medication and that neither his attorney nor the doctors were aware of that fact. Dr. Coffer\u2019s evaluation of appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense was based in part on his observation that, at the time of the examination, appellant exhibited no psychotic tendencies. The doctor\u2019s opinion might have differed had he known appellant was under medication. Appellant has presented additional information, such as repeated suicide attempts, of which his attorney and the doctors were not informed at the time of the sentencing hearing. It is possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>that none of these facts would have changed Dr. Coffer\u2019s opinion; however, we cannot with confidence eliminate the very reasonable possibility that they would have had such effect. We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s violation of appellant\u2019s right to presence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">D. <em>Unconstitutional Consideration and Application of Aggravating Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">In support of his decision imposing the death penalty the trial judge listed four aggravating factors.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Appellant contends that three of these factors were invalid and therefore that imposition of the death penalty in this case violated his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">1. <em>Unsupported Aggravating Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">Appellant contends that two of the aggravating factors relied on by the judge \u2014 that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, and that appellant created a great risk of serious bodily harm and death to many persons \u2014 were unsupported by any evidence in this case. Appellant does not contend that it is the federal courts\u2019 function in habeas cases generally to review state courts\u2019 findings for evidentiary sufficiency.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Appellant relies on <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980), however, in urging that it is properly within the province of this court to review a claim that a state court\u2019s construction of an aggravating factor provision in a particular case is so vague or broad as to violate <em>Furman\u2019s </em>requirement that sentencing decisions be guided by clear, objective, rationally reviewable standards. On the basis of <em>Godfrey, </em>we conclude that the claim appellant presents is cognizable by this court.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-18\">In <em>Godfrey, </em>the Court considered the constitutionality of a death sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>under the Georgia capital sentencing statute on the basis of the aggravating factor that the murder \u201cwas outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 100 S.Ct. at 1764. The defendant had been convicted of killing his wife and his mother-in-law by shooting each in the head with a shotgun. Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s prior decision holding that the same aggravating factor was not unconstitutionally vague, <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 201, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2938, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976),<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> a plurality in <em>Godfrey </em>held that the jury\u2019s and state supreme court\u2019s application of the \u201cvile, horrible and inhuman\u201d aggravating factor absent any evidence of torture or aggravated battery to the victims was an \u201cunconstitutional construction\u201d of that provision. Although the Georgia courts previously had accorded a limiting construction to the aggravating factor at issue, the plurality found that such construction had not been followed in Godfrey\u2019s case.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The plurality concluded that, \u201cin light of the facts and circumstances of the murders that Godfrey was convicted of committing,\u201d his crimes could not \u201cbe said to have reflected a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. at 432, 433, 100 S.Ct. at 1767. Since there was \u201cno principled way to distinguish [that] case, in which the death penalty was imposed, from the many cases in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>was not,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 433, 100 S.Ct. at 1767, the Georgia courts had failed to comply with <em>Furman\u2019s </em>requirement that any decision to impose the death sentence be based on clear, detailed, and objective standards reflecting \u201creason rather than caprice or emotion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">The aggravating factors challenged by appellant here were upheld by the Supreme Court as facially valid on appellant\u2019s direct appeal. <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 255-56, 96 S.Ct. at 2968. The Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the provision as applied in this case,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> however; hence the issue is properly before this court. Before addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s claim, we deem it advisable to state the precise nature of the issue before us. The question is not whether we agree with the sentencing court that appellant should receive the death penalty. <em>See </em>note 51 <em>supra. Nor </em>is it within our province to judge the merits of the particular aggravating factors chosen by the Florida Legislature and interpreted by the Florida courts as justifying the imposition of death. Rather, the issue we must decide is essentially a procedural one: whether the construction of the eighth statutory aggravating factor evinced by the trial court\u2019s application of it to the facts of this case comports with the eighth amendment requirement that death sentences be based on clear, detailed, and rationally reviewable standards. <em>See Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. at 427-33, 100 S.Ct. at 1764-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">As the Supreme Court noted on Proffitt\u2019s direct appeal, the Florida court has accorded a limited interpretation to the \u201cheinous, atrocious, and cruel\u201d aggravating factor. <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 255-56, 96 S.Ct. at 2968. The state court has required that the \u201chorror of the murder be accompanied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart from the norm.\u201d <em>Cooper v. State, </em>336 So.2d 1133 (Fla.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 925, 97 S.Ct. 2200, 53 L.Ed.2d 239 (1977); <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1, 9 (Fla.1973). More specifically, the court has held that the murder must be \u201cconscienceless or pitiless\u201d in the sense that it is \u201cunnecessarily torturous to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The numerous cases in which the Florida Supreme Court has considered challenges to the application of this aggravating factor support the interpretation requiring acts of physical harm or torture to the murder victim prior to or accompanying the act resulting in death. <em>Compare, e.g., Welty v. State, </em>402 So.2d 1159 (Fla.1981) (factor upheld where defendant robbed victim, later returned to victim\u2019s residence, struck sleeping victim several times in neck, and then set fire to his bed); <em>Straight v. State, </em>397 So.2d 903 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1022, 102 S.Ct. 556, 70 L.Ed.2d 418 (1981) (factor upheld where defendant participated in murder inflicted by multiple stab wounds and bludgeoning); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>389 So.2d 197 (Fla.1980) (factor upheld where victim died of wounds from gruesome series of torturous acts by defendant); <em>Lucas v. State, </em>376 So.2d 1149 (Fla.1979) (factor upheld where defendant shot victim, pursued her into house, struggled with her, hit her, dragged her from house, and shot her to death while she begged for her life); <em>Dobbert v. State, </em>375 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>So.2d 1069 (Fla.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 912, 100 S.Ct. 3000, 64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980) (factor upheld where defendant tortured his child over prolonged period and murdered her to prevent discovery of her battered condition); <em>Washington v. State, </em>362 So.2d 658 (Fla.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 937, 99 S.Ct. 2063, 60 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979) (factor upheld where evidence showed bullet did not penetrate victim\u2019s skull and cause of death was four of nine stab wounds, none of which was instantly fatal) <em>with Maggard v. State, </em>399 So.2d 973 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1059, 102 S.Ct. 610, 70 L.Ed.2d 598 (1981) (factor reversed where victim died quickly from single gunshot blast fired through window and victim was unware he was going to be shot); <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>399 So.2d 953 (Fla.1981) (factor reversed where murderers were only at scene of crime for very brief period and shooting was precipitated by armed resistance); Wil<em>liams v. State, </em>386 So.2d 538 (Fla.1980) (factor reversed where victim died almost instantaneously from gunshot wounds); <em>Fleming v. State, </em>374 So.2d 954 (Fla.1979) (factor reversed where killing of policeman accomplished by single shot fired when hostage grabbed defendant\u2019s gun); <em>Kampff v. State, </em>371 So.2d 1007 (Fla.1979) (factor reversed where defendant directed pistol shot straight to head of victim); <em>Halliwell v. State, </em>323 So.2d 557 (Fla.1975) (factor reversed where mutilation of victim\u2019s body occurred only after victim\u2019s death). The Florida court has repeatedly rejected application of this factor to killings accomplished quickly by acts of shooting or stabbing involving no additional torturous acts to the victim. <em>E.g., Lewis v. State, </em>398 So.2d 432 (Fla.1981); <em>Demps v. State, </em>395 So.2d 501 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 933, 102 S.Ct. 430, 70 L.Ed.2d 239 (1981); <em>Kampff </em>v. <em>State, supra; Menedez v. State, </em>368 So.2d 1278 (Fla.1979); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State, </em>366 So.2d 19 (Fla.1978). Moreover, the court has expressly held that the fact that a murder is \u201cpremeditated, cold and calculated\u201d does not render it especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>398 So.2d at 438. Nor does the commission of the killing in the presence of another family member bring it within the statutory factor, since, under the Florida court\u2019s construction of the factor, the atrocity must consist of an act done to the victim. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State, </em>366 So.2d at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">In this case, there was no evidence that appellant perpetrated any physical act on the victim other than the single stab in the chest that resulted in his death.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Moreover, neither in his findings nor in his instructions to the jury as to the meaning of the eighth aggravating circumstance did the trial judge indicate that such factor requires proof of torturous acts to the victim.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The finding made by the judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>this case therefore suggests no \u201cinherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence.\u201d <em>Cf. Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. at 428, 100 S.Ct. at 1764 (instructions alone did not restrain jury\u2019s discretion). Finally, the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming appellant\u2019s sentence does not indicate it even considered the propriety of the application of such factor in this case, <em>see Proffitt v. State, </em>315 So.2d at 466-67, and thus that court\u2019s review \u201cin no way cured\u201d the exercise of \u201cuncontrolled discretion\u201d by the judge in this case. <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. at 429, 100 S.Ct. at 1765.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Applying the same analysis to the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he defendant knowingly .. . created a great risk of . . . death to many persons,\u201d we conclude that application of that provision in the instant case implies a construction so broad that it cannot be viewed as a meaningful limitation on sentencer discretion. Appellant\u2019s act of killing, consisting of the infliction of a single knife wound in the chest of the victim, endangered only the victim himself. Although the facts indicate that appellant struck the victim\u2019s wife with his fists when she was awakened by her husband\u2019s moans, there was no evidence that the blows- were of such force that they were likely to kill her.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Even if appellant could reasonably be said to have threatened the woman\u2019s life, the sum of appellant\u2019s acts surrounding the killing, viewed in the light least favorable to him, at most could be said to have risked death to two persons. Application of this aggravating factor to the facts of this case is not only inconsistent with the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the provision; <footnotemark>59</footnotemark> it also reflects an absence of control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>or guidance of the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion. We cannot say that the death sentence imposed on the basis of such factor was \u201cbased on reason rather than caprice or emotion.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 51 L.Ed.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">2. <em>Nonstatutory Aggravating Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">In addition to the two aggravating factors discussed above, appellant challenges a third factor relied on by the judge because it does not accord with circumstances identified as aggravating in Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.-141(5). The judge\u2019s finding that appellant \u201chas the propensity to commit the crime for which he was convicted . . . and is a danger and a menace to society,\u201d on which he relied as one aggravating factor supporting the death penalty, bears no resemblance to any of the statutory aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">In <em>Henry v. Wainwright, </em>661 F.2d 56 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>vacated on other </em>grounds, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 2922, 73 L.Ed.2d 1326 (1982), the Fifth Circuit held that consideration by the sentencer of non-statutory aggravating factors violates the eighth and fourteenth amendments. Although the <em>Henry </em>decision has been vacated by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds not relevant to this case,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>its reasoning persuasive and therefore adopt its analysis. <em>See Zant v. Stephens, </em>- U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 1856, 1859-65, 72 L.Ed.2d 222 (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>id. </em>102 S.Ct. at 1865 (Powell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">In <em>Henry, </em>the court held that admission of evidence of aggravating factors not listed in the statute coupled with an instruction allowing the jury to consider nonstatutory aggravating factors in rendering an advisory sentence was unconstitutional. Unlike Henry, appellant does not complain that the jury was allowed to consider evidence of nonstatutory aggravating circumstances or that the jury\u2019s advisory sentence was based on such evidence; <footnotemark>61</footnotemark> rather, he challenges the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision, which its findings indicate was based partly on nonstatutory aggravating factors. In our view, the reasoning employed by the <em>Henry </em>court, with which we agree, is equally applicable to the advisory sentence decision of the jury and the ultimate sentence determination made by the trial judge.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> As the <em>Henry </em>court noted, <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) held unconstitution\u00e1l under the eighth amendment capital sentencing procedures that, by failing to limit and guide sentencer discretion, permitted arbitrary and selective imposition of the death penalty. <em>Henry v. Wainwright, </em>661 F.2d at 58. In <em>Furman\u2019s </em>1976 progeny, in which five <em>post-Furman </em>capital sentencing statutes were challenged, the Court upheld those statutes that provided specific and detailed standards to guide the sentencer in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. <em>See Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976); <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976); <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). The Court specifically approved the Florida statute because its aggravating and mitigating provisions appeared to provide such guidance. <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 248-53, 96 S.Ct. at 2964-2967. In considering appellant\u2019s \u201cpropensity to commit [murder]\u201d and the danger he posed to society, the trial court transcended the list of aggravating factors set forth in the Florida statute and substituted his own judgment of what circumstances justify capital punishment for that of the Florida Legislature. In so doing, the trial judge not only committed error under the state law, <em>see Brown v. State, </em>381 So.2d 690, 696 (Fla.1980); <em>Elledge v. State, </em>346 So.2d 998, 1002 (Fla. 1977); he also exceeded the federal constitutional limitations imposed by <em>Furman </em>on capital sentencing by increasing the risk that the death penalty would be imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. In short, we agree with the <em>Henry </em>court that because \u201cthe limitations of the statute make the death penalty constitutional . . . [ignoring those limitations [ ] implicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>the constitution.\u201d <em>Henry v. Wainwright, </em>661 F.2d at 60. For the reasons just stated, we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s reliance on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances renders appellant\u2019s sentence unconstitutional under the eighth and fourteenth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">As a fallback argument, the state contends that even if the trial judge erroneously considered nonstatutory aggravating factors such error was harmless because in this case the judge found no mitigating circumstances. As long as some of the aggravating factors found by the sentencer are valid, the state argues, death is \u201cpresumed proper\u201d in the absence of mitigating evidence. We cannot agree with this argument for several reasons. First, one premise of the state\u2019s argument \u2014 th\u00e1t there were several valid aggravating factors supporting the sentence \u2014 cannot be established in this case. Eliminating the non-statutory factor, we are left with three statutory aggravating circumstances found by the trial judge: that appellant committed the murder while in the course of committing the additional felony offense of burglary, that he created a great risk of death to many persons, and that the murder he committed was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel. <em>See </em>note 50 <em>supra. </em>Although these factors fall within the statutory list, we have determined that the trial court\u2019s application of the \u201cheinous, atrocious and cruel\u201d and \u201cgreat risk of death to many persons\u201d factors in this case was unconstitutional under <em>Godfrey. See </em>section IV.D.l <em>supra. </em>Hence, the only valid aggravating factor in this case is that appellant committed the murder in conjunction with a burglary. In some cases one statutory aggravating circumstance may be sufficient justification for imposing the death penalty. We cannot conclude, however, that appellant\u2019s entry of the victim\u2019s house, which he did for the purpose of committing the murder, was a circumstance \u201csufficient[ly] aggravating\u201d in nature that the judge necessarily would have imposed the death penalty on that ground alone. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(3) (West Supp.1982) (judge must find <em>\u201csufficient </em>aggravating circumstances\u201d exist to justify sentence of death). The second premise of the state\u2019s argument\u2014 that there were no mitigating circumstances that might outweigh any aggravating ones \u2014 presents similar difficulties. The trial court\u2019s findings do not unqualifiedly state that there are no mitigating circumstances but rather indicate the judge\u2019s conclusion that such factors \u201care <em>primarily </em>negated\u201d and are \u201coutweigh[ed]\u201d by the aggravating factors he found.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the state\u2019s characterization, this case does not present the situation in which there exist valid aggravating \u2022 factors undoubtedly sufficient to justify a death sentence counterbalanced by no mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">An even more substantial impediment to adopting the analysis suggested by the state is that the Fifth Circuit has already rejected it. In <em>Henry, </em>in addition to the nonstatutory aggravating factors, the trial court had found several statutory aggravating factors and no mitigating ones. Although the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the sentence on this ground, the former Fifth Circuit disagreed and held that affirming a death sentence partially predicated on nonstatutory factors violates the eighth amendment requirement of rational appellate review of capital sentencing decisions. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>661 F.2d at 58-60. The Florida Supreme Court\u2019s attempt \u201cto divine what motives impelled [this] death penalt[y],\u201d in the <em>Henry </em>court\u2019s view, had compounded rather than resolved the trial court\u2019s sentencing error. <em>Id. </em>at 59. Recognizing the importance of the appellate review aspect of Florida\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, which the Supreme Court em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>phasized in upholding the Florida statute,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> the <em>Henry </em>court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-5\">Guarding against the arbitrary and discriminatory imposition of the death penalty must not become simply a guessing game played by a reviewing court in which it tries to discern whether the improper nonstatutory aggravating factors exerted a decisive influence on the sentence determination. The guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment demands more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\"><em>Id. </em>We agree that the rational appellate review of capital sentencing decisions contemplated by <em>Furman </em>and its progeny requires more than mere speculation or conjecture as to what the sentencing tribunal would have decided had it correctly applied the law. Such post hoc justification of a sentencing decision, which depends on a rationale for imposing death distinct from that relied on by the sentencer, cannot fulfill the appellate court\u2019s constitutional responsibilities. <em>Cf. Presnell v. Georgia, </em>439 U.S. 14, 99 S.Ct. 235, 58 L.Ed.2d 207 (1978) (per curiam) (imposition of death penalty where appellate court rejected jury grounds for sentence but affirmed on different theory violated due process). Only where the factors supporting the death sentence are so clear that proper application of the statute by reasonable persons could produce no other result should a sentence be affirmed despite constitutional error. Such was not the case here. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s unconstitutional application of statutory aggravating factors and consideration of nonstatutory ones entitled appellant to resentencing in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">E. <em>Unconstitutional Limitation of Mitigating Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">Appellant contends the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on aggravating and mitigating factors violated his right under <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) to have the sentencers consider nonstatutory mitigating evidence concerning his character and the circumstances of his offense. The state asserts that appellant\u2019s failure to object to the jury instructions resulted in a waiver of such objection under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) and that in any event there was no <em>Lockett </em>violation in this case. Both the substantive <em>Lockett </em>issue and the waiver issue are currently before this court for en banc consideration in a case involving facts substantially similar to those presented by this case. <em>See Ford </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>676 F.2d 434 (11th Cir. 1982), <em>rehearing granted </em>(Apr. 28, 1982). Resolution of Proffitt\u2019s mitigating circumstances claim without benefit of the en banc court\u2019s decision in <em>Ford </em>would be premature. Because our disposition of the other issues raised by appellant entitles him to resentencing in the <em>Florida </em>courts, decision of the mitigating circumstances claim is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">We find appellant\u2019s procedural challenge to be without merit; the district court\u2019s decision not to conduct a second evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance claims was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. On the merits, we affirm the decision of the district court insofar as it rejected appellant\u2019s claims of ineffective legal assistance at both the guilt and sentencing phases of trial. We disagree with the court\u2019s disposition of the confrontation and aggravating circumstances claims, however. Because the state court\u2019s use of psychiatric evidence that appellant had no opportunity to rebut and its consideration of nonstatuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>ry aggravating factors violated appellant\u2019s sixth, eighth, and fourteenth amendment rights, the decision of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Judge CLARK reserves the right to file a concurring or dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">.

The Note states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-6\">The rule provides for the utilization of a presentence report as part of the sentencing process. While use of the report is discretionary in all cases, it is mandatory in two instances, the sentencing of a first felony offender and of a defendant under 18 years of age. <em>Of course, no report is necessary where the specific sentence is mandatory, e.g., the sentence of death or life imprisonment in a verdict of first degree murder </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, some Florida judges were ordering presentence reports in capital cases under Rule 3.710 notwithstanding the Committee Note\u2019s suggestion that the rule does not encompass such cases. <em>See, e.g., Gardner v. State, </em>313 So.2d 675, 677 (Fla.1975) (opinion of Ervin, J.), <em>rev'd, </em>430 U.S. 349, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977). Although the Florida Supreme Court upheld the sentence in <em>Gardner, </em>that case indicates the doubtful status of presentence investigations in capital cases at the time. The defendant argued to the Florida Supreme Court that the trial judge had erred in considering the presentence report because it contained detrimental facts about him that did not fit within the aggravating circumstances enumerated in the capital sentencing statute. <em>Id. </em>at 677-78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">. Complicating the question of presentence investigation reports even further, the Florida Legislature in 1974 enacted a statute purporting to make preparation of such reports mandatory in all felony cases in which a guilty verdict has been rendered and discretionary in misdemeanor cases. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.-231 (West Supp.1982). This statute did not become effective until July 1, 1974, and hence it had no effect on the law at the time of appellant\u2019s trial. As the district court noted, however, this later statute explains defense counsel\u2019s statement that presentence investigations are \u201cautomatic now ... by statutory authority.\u201d That the statute was enacted at a point in time so close to appellant\u2019s trial also tends to explain the attorney\u2019s inability to remember whether it was in effect at the time of the trial. (The Florida Supreme Court has held that, to the extent it conflicts with Rule 3.710 by making presentence investigations mandatory rather than discretionary in most felony cases, the statute unconstitutionally invades the rulemaking province of that court, and thus is to be construed as directory only. <em>See Huntley v. State, </em>339 So.2d 194 (Fla.1976). It may be that trial courts in Florida have nonetheless continued to comply with the statute\u2019s directive by making presentence investigations \u201cautomatic.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">. Defense counsel also argued that Crumbley\u2019s testimony established the statutory mitigating circumstance that \u201c[t]he defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person,\u201d see Fla.

Prior to the <em>Washington </em>decision, the Fifth Circuit precedents set forth conflicting standards for review of district courts\u2019 conclusions concerning ineffective counsel claims. The <em>Washington </em>panel resolved this issue by adopting the independent-evaluation standard of review and rejecting the line of cases that had treated the determination of effectiveness as a purely factual finding to which the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard applies. The court found the cases that applied an independent-judgment standard more persuasive and better supported than those applying the clearly-erroneous test. <em>See Washington v.

The majority and dissenting opinions in <em>State v. Dixon, supra, </em>reflect the two divergent interpretations of <em>Fur-man </em>prevailing at that time. The majority interpreted the rule of <em>Furman </em>as not abolishing discretion in capital sentencing entirely but rather as concerned with \u201cthe quality of discretion and the manner in which it [is] applied.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d at 6. The majority read <em>Furman </em>as requiring that the discretion exercised in capital sentencing be \u201creasonable and controlled rather than capricious and discriminatory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7, but did not expressly state whether the state\u2019s mitigating circumstances provision was intended to be an exclusive list of the factors juries may consider in mitigation. The opinion\u2019s focus on the issue of control over sentencer discretion, coupled with its statement that \u201cthe propounding of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\u201d is the \u201cmost important safeguard\u201d the statute employs to restrain and guide such discretion, <em>id. </em>at 8-9, would have supported an interpretation of \u00a7 921.141 as limiting sentencer consideration of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances to the factors expressly described in the statute. The dissenting opinion of Justice Ervin, which leans toward a reading of <em>Furman </em>as condemning <em>ail </em>discretion in capital sentencing, <em>see id. </em>at 13-14 (Ervin, J., dissenting), and concludes that \u00a7 921.141 allows more discretion than permissible under Furman, <em>id. </em>at 14, expressly interprets the statute as limiting the aggravating and mitigating circumstances judges and juries may consider to those enumerated in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-10\">The earliest case listed in Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141, Notes of Decisions (West 1973 &amp; Supp.1982) specifically discussing the mitigating circumstances provision is a 1975 case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">.

The magistrate specifically rejected appellant\u2019s contention that the attorney\u2019s failure to request a continuance after hearing from Dr. Crumbley, in order to determine whether appellant was incompetent to stand trial, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

The magistrate also credited the attorney\u2019s later testimony that he had \u201cwanted the trial to begin without delay because on the morning of the trial a newspaper reporter had heard Dr. Crumbley\u2019s information and the attorney was concerned that newspaper publicity would prejudice the potential jurors. <em>See </em>Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation 26; Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing 269-70, 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">. We reject appellant\u2019s argument that his attorney should have requested expert assistance to aid him in preparing the mitigation defense. At the time of appellant\u2019s trial the law governing capital sentencing was undergoing significant change and the extent of capital defendants\u2019 procedural rights had not yet been clearly delineated. Now that cases such as <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) and <em>Gardner v.

Balkcom, </em>636 F.2d 114 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Davis v. Alabama, </em>596 F.2d 1214 (5th Cir. 1979), vacated <em>as moot, </em>446 U.S. 903, 100 S.Ct. 1827, 64 L.Ed.2d 256 (1980) <em>United States v.

No case has yet addressed this issue, however, and in 1974 it could hardly have been said that such a rule was foreshadowed.

Although appellant\u2019s attorney asserted the right to cross-examine Dr. Sprehe at the hearing, the trial court\u2019s failure to afford appellant that opportunity was not raised as error on direct appeal. The state has not contended that appellant waived this issue, however, and we therefore will not decide the claim on that ground. <em>See Washington v.

For that reason it is necessarily exploratory; and the rule that the examiner must indicate the purpose of his inquiry does not, in general, apply. It is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them. To say that prejudice can be established only by showing that the cross-examination, if pursued, would necessarily have brought out facts tending to discredit the testimony in chief, is to deny a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>substantial right and withdraw one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.

Indeed, the Florida rule governing expert testimony, much like the corresponding federal rule, eliminates the requirement that expert witnesses disclose the facts and data underlying their opinion testimony and instead places the burden on opposing counsel to elicit such information through cross-examination. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 705; Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 90.705 (West 1979); <em>Jones v.

Because Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 requires a defendant\u2019s presence \u201cat every stage of [a federal] trial, including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence,\u201d the federal courts have not often been called upon to consider the extent to which that rule is constitutionally based. See, <em>e.g., Rogers v. Unites, </em>422 U.S. 35, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (Rule 43 entitles defendant to be present when trial court responds to jury\u2019s request for instruction in mid-deliberation); United <em>States v.

The weight of modern authority supports a broad constitutional right of presence. <em>See Illinois v.

The standard we employ in reviewing the district court\u2019s factual findings is the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>635 F.2d 449 (5th Cir. 1981). In reviewing questions of law and mixed questions of fact and law, however, we are free to substitute our own judgment for that of the lower court. <em>Baty </em>v. <em>Balkcom, </em>661 F.2d 391, 394 n.7 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Baker v. Metcalfe, </em>633 F.2d 1198, 1201 (5th Cir. 1981). Although a few prior cases may be read as suggesting otherwise, <em>see St. Jules v. Estelle, </em>505 F.2d 656 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Lawrence v. Wainwright, </em>445 F.2d 281, 282 (5th Cir. 1971), we believe the determination whether a constitutional error is harmless presents a mixed question of fact and law. <em>Cf. United States v. Dixon, </em>593 F.2d 626, 629 (5th Cir. 1979) (decision whether error is harmless requires examination of facts, context of error, and prejudice created thereby juxtaposed against strength of evidence of guilt). <em>See also Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959) (Supreme Court is not bound by state or lower courts\u2019 determination that constitutional error did not affect verdict and must make independent examination of record); <em>Taylor v.

Hence, though we will defer to the district court\u2019s subsidiary findings absent clear error, we apply our own independent judgment to the question of whether the facts shown indicate appellant\u2019s absence from the Coffer hearing was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">. The right of a criminal defendant to be present at all critical stages of his trial is a fundamental constitutional right. <em>See Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 79, 91 S.Ct. 210, 214, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (confrontation of adverse witnesses is a fundamental right); <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) (right to be present is \u201c[o]ne of the most basic rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause ... \u201d). It is clear that once the defendant has established a violation of that right his conviction is unconstitutionally tainted and reversal is required unless the State proves the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Stratton, </em>649 F.2d 1066, 1080 (5th Cir. 1981) (citing <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 40, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 2095, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975)); <em>cf. Wright v. Estelle, </em>572 F.2d 1071, 1081 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc) (Godbold, J., dissenting) (violation of fundamental rights necessitates automatic reversal, even in face of arguably harmless error). We see nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d -(1982), that alters this mode of analysis in cases involving the defendant\u2019s right to be present at the critical stages of his trial. In <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>the Court held that because the sixth amendment only guarantees a criminal defendant \u201ccompulsory process for obtaining <em>witnesses in his favor,\u201d </em>the defendant must make a plausible showing that the witnesses whose testimony he seeks to compel would offer favorable testimony. <em>Id. </em>at -, 102 S.Ct. at 3446 (emphasis in original). This decision may, but need not be read as requiring that a defendant demonstrate prejudice as a prerequisite to obtaining relief under the compulsory process clause. Because <em>ValenzuelaBernal </em>concerns a criminal defendant\u2019s rights under the compulsory process clause, its arguable prejudice requirement does not govern this case, in which a different constitutional provision \u2014 the confrontation clause \u2014 is at issue. Even if we assume that the holding in <em>Valenzuela-Bernal </em>is so broad as to incorporate a prejudice requirement in confrontation clause cases, our result would be no different. In our view, the same evidence proffered by Proffitt to rebut the State\u2019s claim of harmless error conclusively establishes that the denial of his right to be present at the post-trial hearing seriously prejudiced him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">.

The state argues that the former Fifth Circuit decision in <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1978) precludes us from reviewing the Florida court\u2019s application of specific aggravating factors to the facts of this case. In <em>Spinkellink, </em>the court interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976) as holding that the aggravating and mitigating provisions of the Florida death penalty statute <em>\u201cconclusively </em>remove[] the arbitrariness which <em>Furman </em>held violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>See Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d at 604-06. The court therefore declined to review an attack on the statute as applied absent facts and circumstances \u201cso clearly undeserving of capital punishment that to impose it would be patently unjust and would shock the conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605-06 &amp; n.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-21\">Two years after the former Fifth Circuit decided <em>Spinkellink, </em>the Supreme Court ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>dressed an attack on a state court\u2019s application of an aggravating factor under its capital sentencing statute. <em>See Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980). Four Justices joined in the plurality opinion, which accorded full review to this contention. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 100 S.Ct. at 1762. Two Justices concurred in the judgment both on the ground that the death penalty is under all circumstances unconstitutional and in agreement with the plurality\u2019s conclusion concerning the application of the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 433-42, 100 S.Ct. at 1767-72. (Brennan, J. and Marshall, J., concurring). In view of <em>Godfrey, </em>we can only conclude that the language in the <em>Spinkellink </em>opinion precluding federal courts from reviewing state courts\u2019 application of capital sentencing criteria is no longer sound precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">In <em>Williams v. Maggio, </em>679 F.2d 381, 386-90 (5th Cir. 1982), the former Fifth Circuit refused to consider a challenge to two statutory aggravating factors on grounds similar to those asserted here because the state appellate court had affirmed the sentence on the basis of a third valid aggravating factor. The court interpreted <em>Godfrey </em>as justifying reversal of a death sentence only where the sentence is based solely on the unsupported aggravating factor. <em>Id. </em>at 390. <em>Williams, </em>which was decided by Unit A of the former Fifth Circuit after October 1, 1981, is not controlling precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. <em>Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir., 1982 as corrected June 28, 1982). Moreover, <em>Williams </em>is distinguishable because in that case the petitioner challenged only allegedly unsupported aggravating factors, whereas appellant here asserts that his sentence was based on unsupported and nonstatutory factors. <em>See </em>section IV.D.2 infra. We need not decide whether appellant\u2019s claims of unsupported aggravating factors alone would merit reversal of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">. In <em>Gregg, </em>the Court had rejected a challenge to the same aggravating circumstance on the ground \u201cthat it is so broad that capital punishment could be imposed in any murder case,\u201d noting that \u201c[i]t is, of course, arguable that any murder involves depravity of mind or an aggravated battery. But this language need not be construed in this way, and there is no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt such an open-ended construction.\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. at 201, 96 S.Ct. at 2938.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">. The plurality noted that \u201c[tjhere is nothing in these few words [\u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman\u201d], standing alone, that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence,\u201d since \u201c[a] person of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder\u201d as meeting that definition. Because the judge had given the jury no instruction regarding the meaning of those terms, the plurality concluded that the jury\u2019s sentencing discretion was basically uncontrolled. <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. at 428-29, 100 S.Ct. at 1764-65. Moreover, the record evinced no evidence nor had the prosecution claimed that the defendant \u201ccommitted an aggravated battery upon his wife or mother-in-law, or in fact, caused either of them to suffer any physical injury preceding their deaths.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 100 S.Ct. at 1767. Finally, the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of the defendant\u2019s sentence did not, in the plurality\u2019s view, cure the broad construction that the jury apparently had accorded the aggravating factor, since that court had not disagreed with the trial judge\u2019s statement that the murders had not involved any torture. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">. <em>See Proffitt v.

The challenge was directed toward, and was treated by the plurality as one questioning, the facial constitutionality of the statutory aggravating factors \u201cas they have been construed by the Supreme Court of Florida.\u201d <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 255-56, 96 S.Ct. at 2968. In support of his challenge to the statute, appellant cited the application of the aggravating factor provisions to his own case as demonstrative of the broad interpretation accorded them by the Florida Supreme Court. With respect to the \u201cgreat risk of death to many persons\u201d factor, the plurality found that the Florida court had not relied on such factor in affirming appellant\u2019s sentence; the Court thus did not consider appellant\u2019s case as having any bearing on the construction of that provision. <em>See Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 256 n.13, 96 S.Ct. at 2968 n.13. The plurality, in concluding that the Florida court had consistently applied its limited construction of the \u201cheinous, atrocious, and cruel\u201d circumstance, did not specifically state whether the application of that provision to appellant\u2019s crime comported with the Florida court\u2019s constitutionally tailored definition of the eighth statutory factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">. The trial judge\u2019s findings state only that the eighth statutory factor was established and not the particular facts on which such conclusion was based. Since the physician who conducted the autopsy of the victim testified that he discovered no injuries to the victim\u2019s body other than the stab wound that pierced his chest and heart, II Trial Record 229, there were no facts supporting the trial court\u2019s application of factor eight under the limiting construction adopted by the state supreme court. Nor was the higher court\u2019s construction of that provision unavailable to the trial court at the time of appellant\u2019s sentencing. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1 (Fla.1973), the seminal decision interpreting the new Florida death penalty statute and considering its constitutionality, was decided nearly one year before appellant\u2019s trial. That case stated that \u201c[wjhat is intended to be included [in the eighth statutory aggravating circumstance] are those capital crimes <em>where the actual commission of the capital felony was accompanied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart from the norm of capital felonies </em>\u2014 the <em>conscienceless or pitiless crime which is </em>unnecessarily <em>torturous to the victim.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>at 9 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">. The relevant portion of the judge\u2019s sentencing instructions provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-9\">The aggravating circumstances which you may consider are limited to such of the following as may be established by the evidence: . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-10\">Eighth, that the crime for which the defendant is to be sentenced was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-11\">You are instructed that \u201cheinous\u201d means extremely wicked or shockingly evil; and that \u201catrocious\u201d means outrageously wicked and vile. \u201cCruel\u201d means designed to inflict a high degree of pain; utter indifference to, or enjoyment of, the suffering of others; pitiless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>IV Trial Record 531. This language, which is derived from <em>State v. Dixon, supra, </em>provides little more guidance than the statute\u2019s original terms to aid the jury in determining when this factor should be applied as a basis for imposing the death penalty. The modifiers in the instruction \u2014 \u201cextremely,\u201d \u201coutrageously,\u201d and \u201cshockingly,\u201d like the term \u201cespecially\u201d employed in the statute, signal that the crime should be in some respect worse than average. The difficulty with the various adjectives used in either the statute (heinous, atrocious, and cruel) or the instruction (wicked, evil, vile) is that they fail to indicate in what way the crime should be \u201cworse.\u201d While they indicate some sense of dimension or degree, they fail to state what is being measured. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[a] person of ordinary sensibility could characterize almost every murder\u201d within such terms, <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. at 428-29, 100 S.Ct. at 1764-65, and the jury in this case could well have subscribed to such a view. Finally, although the definition of cruel provided by the trial judge is more specific than the rest of the instruction and hints of the \u201cadditional [torturous] acts\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Dixon, </em>the instruction fell short of imposing such limitation since the cruelness feature of the aggravating factor is an alternative one. Hence, the jury\u2019s sentencing discretion was not significantly limited by this part of the instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">. The trial court\u2019s findings stated this aggravating factor in terms that were arguably broader than the statutory terms; it found appellant had \u201ccreated a <em>great risk of serious bodily harm and death </em>to many persons,\u201d whereas the statutory factor encompasses only <em>\u201cgreat risk of death.\u201d Compare </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(5)(c) (reprinted in note 8 <em>supra) with </em>note 50 <em>supra. </em>Because the statute does not include as aggravating a risk of bodily harm other than death, appellant contends the judge\u2019s finding represents a nonstatutory aggravating factor. The discrepancy between the judge\u2019s findings and the statute does not on its face appear significant, because the language used by the judge suggests his finding included both a risk of death <em>and </em>a risk of bodily harm to many persons. On the other hand, the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s offense, which do not support risk of death, may be viewed as an indication that the court included the reference to serious bodily harm precisely because it thought the evidence in this case did not support the \u201cgreat risk of death\u201d factor. In any event, we need not decide whether the trial court\u2019s finding, as stated, represents consideration of a nonstatutory aggravating factor since we have already concluded that the application of \u00a7 921.141(5)(c) to this case renders the provision unconstitutionally vague and invalidates its use as a factor supporting appellant\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>section IV.D.1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">.

On his direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, appellant objected to the findings concerning at least two of the aggravating circumstances and asserted generally that the judge had exercised unfettered discretion in imposing the death sentence. <em>See </em>V Trial Record 561; VII Trial Record 615. In any event, the state has not argued that appellant waived his objections to the aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>vating circumstances findings; hence, the state has waived any waiver argument it might have asserted. <em>Cf. Hopkins v. Jarvis, </em>648 F.2d 981, 983 n.2 (5th Cir. 1981) (state\u2019s failure to raise lack of exhaustion constitutes waiver of exhaustion requirement); <em>Messelt v. Alabama, </em>595 F.2d 247, 250-51 (5th Cir. 1979) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">. The transcript of appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing indicates that the attorney for the state introduced evidence of, and directed part of his argument to establishing, nonstatutory aggravating factors. He asked the jury to consider various factors, which he did not attempt to place within the statutory categories, such as the \u201csenselessness\u201d of the killing; the relative youth of the victim, the fact that he was well-liked, and the impact of the killing on his family; the dangerousness of the defendant and failure of the criminal justice system to rehabilitate him after his prior conviction; the frightening nature of the crime and the \u201cpreciousness\u201d of people\u2019s right to be secure in their own homes; and the defendant\u2019s flight after the crime and five-month absence from the jurisdiction prior to extradition. Appellant does not challenge the court\u2019s admission of such evidence and argument \u2014 presumably because his attorney\u2019s failure to object at the time waived his right to assert such a challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">. Indeed, in view of the special responsibility of the judge to ensure consistency in capital sentencing decisions by applying the statute \u201cin the light of judicial experience,\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1, 8 (Fla.1973); <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 252, 96 S.Ct. at 2966, the judge\u2019s improper consideration of nonstatutory aggravating factors in this case may be a more egregious violation of <em>Furman </em>than the jury\u2019s consideration of such evidence in <em>Henry. See </em>note 42 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">. Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s instructions precluded the jury from considering mitigating evidence he proffered that did not fall within the statutory mitigating circumstances, if accepted, would further undermine the state\u2019s characterization of this case as involving no mitigating factors. As noted in section IV.E <em>infra, </em>however, we do not decide appellant\u2019s mitigating circumstances claim because such decision is unnecessary to our resolution of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">. <em>Proffitt v.

I also disagree with the subsidiary holding that \u201cthe constitutional standard for effective counsel is no more stringent in capital cases than in cases where less severe punishments are imposed.\u201d (Slip op. at 1247). This latter holding flies in the face of the common understanding of the uniqueness of capital cases, as expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Lockett v. Ohio:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-8\">Given that the imposition of death by public authority is so profoundly different from all other penalties, we cannot avoid the conclusion that an individualized decision is essential in capital cases. The need for treating each defendant in a capital case with that degree of respect due the uniqueness of the individual is far more important than in noncapital eases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\"><em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2965, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">Counsel for the defendant was ineffective at the sentencing phase of the trial. This ineffectiveness was starkly demonstrated by the failure of counsel to present <em>any </em>testimony at the sentencing hearing. The majority and district court opinions imply that counsel\u2019s failure is excusable because Proffitt was tried in 1974. These opinions, along with others, suggest that the idea that a sentencing authority should consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances originated in the 1976 trilogy of cases approving capital crime statutes in Florida and Georgia and disapproving such a statute in North Carolina. <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976); <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976); <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). Nothing could be further from the truth, as illustrated in the early opinion by Justice Black in <em>Williams v. New York:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-12\">[B]oth before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-13\">A sentencing judge ... is not confined to the narrow issue of guilt. His task within fixed statutory or constitutional limits is to determine the type and extent of punishment after the issue of guilt has been determined. Highly relevant \u2014 if not essential \u2014 to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-14\"><em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246-47, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082-83, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-15\">In addition to the historical recognition of an individual\u2019s character at the sentencing phase, counsel should have been alerted to the importance of mitigating circumstances by the Florida capital crime statute enacted in 1972, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141 (1973), after <em>Furman v. Georgia </em>had declared unconstitutional the statutes of a number of states. <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). That statute explicitly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-16\">In the [sentencing] proceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence, and <em>shall include </em>matters relating to any of the aggravating or <em>mitigating circumstances </em>enumerated in subsections [(5)] and [(6)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>\u00a7 921.141(1) (emphasis added). Even though counsel may not have foreseen the <em>Lockett </em>rule, that a court may not preclude evidence of <em>any </em>mitigating circumstance, the Florida statute left no doubt that: (1) evidence of the enumerated mitigating circumstances, which included mental or emotional disturbance, was mandated, and (2) any evidence relevant to sentencing was permitted. Also available to guide counsel was the opinion of <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1 (Fla.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 943, 94 S.Ct. 1951, 40 L.Ed.2d 295 (1974), in which the Florida Supreme Court discussed the new statute thoroughly, and pointed out the advantage to the defendant of presenting matters in mitigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1361-5\">The most important safeguard presented in Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141, F.S.A., is the propounding of aggravating and mitigating circumstances which must be determinative of the sentence imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1361-6\">When one or more of the aggravating circumstances is found, death is presumed to be the proper sentence unless it or they are overridden by one or more of the mitigating circumstances provided in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.141(7), F.S.A. <em>All evidence of mitigating circumstances may be considered by the judge or jury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\"><em>Dixon, </em>283 So.2d at 8-10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">Counsel for Proffitt was apprised by Dr. Crumbley of the defendant\u2019s unstable mental condition on the evening before the trial started. Although counsel was thus alerted to the possibility of mitigating psychiatric circumstances, he obtained no psychiatric evaluation and made no effort to seek a continuance to permit further investigation. Counsel testified at the habeas corpus hearing that he had visited with Proffitt a number of times and that Proffitt had appeared lucid to him. Just as a psychiatrist should not assume the role of a lawyer, an attorney defending someone subject to the death penalty should not assume he is capable of evaluating whether his client, at the time the crime was committed, \u201cwas under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d or had a substantially impaired capacity \u201cto appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(6)(b) and (f) (West Supp. 1981). This court has long recognized the responsibility of counsel to acquire expert psychiatric assistance when a defendant\u2019s mental condition may be critical to the outcome of his case. <em>Beavers v. Balkcom, </em>636 F.2d 114 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); <em>United States v. Fessel, </em>531 F.2d 1275 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">At the habeas hearing, counsel also stated that he did not engage in any separate and distinct preparation for the penalty phase, but prepared for that part of the trial in conjunction with his preparation of the case as a whole. He said that he had no strategy for the penalty stage but that his approach to that stage was dependent upon what occurred during the guilt phase. With only a thirty-five minute break between the end of the guilt phase and the beginning of the sentencing phase of the trial, counsel obviously had no opportunity to remedy his inadequate preparation. This failure to investigate the entire area of his client\u2019s mental condition and possible mitigating circumstance strikes at the core of ineffective assistance of counsel. An attorney cannot make a wise choice of strategy without meeting the initial duty to investigate. <em>Beavers v. Balkcom, </em>636 F.2d 114.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1361-11\">The lawyer also has a substantial and very important role to perform in raising mitigating factors both to the prosecutor initially and to the court at sentencing. This cannot effectively be done on the basis of broad general emotional appeals or on the strength of statements made to the lawyer by the defendant himself. Information concerning the defendant\u2019s background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, family relationships and the like will be relevant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense itself. <em>Investigation is essential to fulfillment of these functions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">A.B.A. Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to: The Prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>cution Function and The Defense Function, 227 (1970) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">The Florida statute and the <em>Dixon </em>opinion make clear that an attorney has, and had in 1974, an obligation to investigate the possible existence of psychiatric evidence bearing on the statutory mitigating circumstances. The existence of such evidence might have made the difference between life and death for Proffitt. Counsel\u2019s failure to have his client examined by a psychiatrist under such circumstances was automatically ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">In its denial of habeas corpus, the district court relied in part on the fact that the state trial judge obtained two psychiatric evaluations before imposing a final sentence. Such reliance was unwarranted. Most important, the jury did not hear the testimony before making its sentencing recommendation. Furthermore, the testimony was aimed at the defendant\u2019s competency rather than at mitigating circumstances and was presented by court-appointed psychiatrists not secured on behalf of the defendant. The innovation brought about by the Florida 1972 statute which governed this trial was participation by the jury in the sentencing process. Here, however, the jury was denied the presentation of any evidence, humanizing or psychiatric, which would provide a basis for recommending a sentence less than the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">For both sixth amendment and eighth amendment reasons, Proffitt cannot be put to death without a fair and complete sentencing trial at which he has an opportunity to present mitigating and psychiatric evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
