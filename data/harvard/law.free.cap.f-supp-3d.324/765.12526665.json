Over a hundred and forty years later, on August 11th and 12th, 2017, the Defendants in this lawsuit, including the Ku Klux Klan, various neo-Nazi organizations, and associated white supremacists, held rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia. Violence erupted. Charlottesville residents who suffered injuries at the rallies, the Plaintiffs, allege that this violence was no accident. Instead, they allege the Defendants violated the 1871 Act and related state laws by conspiring to engage in violence against racial minorities and their supporters. The Defendants retort that they were simply engaged in lawful, if unpopular, political protest and so their conduct is protected by the First Amendment. While ultimate resolution of what happened at the rallies awaits another day, the Court holds the Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged the Defendants formed a conspiracy to commit the racial violence that led to the Plaintiffs' varied injuries. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs' claims largely survive, although one Defendant is dismissed and other claims are pared down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This opinion addresses one precise question: the legal sufficiency of the Plaintiffs' allegations that the Defendants conspired to engage in racial violence. This question comes before the Court because some of the Defendants have moved the Court to dismiss the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A motion to dismiss a complaint tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations to determine whether the Plaintiffs have properly stated a claim; \"it does not, however, resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before addressing the complaint, three brief points are necessary. First, Plaintiffs' complaint is 112-pages long, pushing the limits of Rule 8(a)'s requirement of a \"short, plain statement.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). While the Court will not ask the Plaintiffs to trim their complaint, the following summary will necessarily leave out some details. To the extent those details are material to the Court's analysis, they are discussed later in the opinion. Second, the complaint frequently uses vague nouns, lumping all Defendants and all co-conspirators together. Because this style of pleading raises problems addressed below, the following summary focuses on allegations that are tied to specific Defendants. Third, it is important to remember that the following summary is a recounting of\n   <em>\n    allegations.\n   </em>\n   While the Court does not repeatedly state \"Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    allege\n   </em>\n   that Defendant\n   <em>\n    X\n   </em>\n   did\n   <em>\n    Y\n   </em>\n   ,\" this summary should not be taken as the Court's endorsement of one version of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plaintiffs are ten Charlottesville residents who each allegedly suffered some injury related to the rallies. Their relationships to the Defendants fall into three general groups. First, there are those that attended a counter-protest on the night of Friday, August 11th, 2017. As discussed more fully below, various Defendants led a torchlight march at the University of Virginia. At the end of that march, some Plaintiffs were assaulted. One of these Plaintiffs was Tyler Magill, who was surrounded and assaulted by various marchers around a Thomas Jefferson statue. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 166). The marchers hurled torches at Magill and others, sprayed them with pepper spray, and threw other liquids on them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 169, 173, 174). He later suffered a \"trauma-induced stroke\" and related injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Plaintiff John Doe, an African-American UVA student, attended the march where he also was harassed and assaulted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). He suffered various emotional injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 293). A third Plaintiff, a UVA student named Natalie Romero, was also surrounded and assaulted at the statue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, another group of Plaintiffs was injured when one of the Defendants, James Fields, drove his car into a crowd of counter-protestors after the \"Unite the Right\" rally on Saturday, August 12th. Plaintiff Romero also falls into this second group, as she was hit by Fields's car and sustained subsequent injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff Marcus Martin, an African-American counter-protestor, was hit by Fields's car and sustained a broken leg and ankle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). He pushed his fianc\u00e9, Plaintiff Marissa Blair, out of the way of the oncoming car, but she too suffered various physical injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Plaintiff Chelsea Alvarado was also hit by Defendant Fields's car, and she suffered physical\n   and emotional injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). Plaintiff Elizabeth Sines, a second year law student, witnessed the events and suffered severe emotional distress and shock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Plaintiff April Mu\u00f1iz was close to being hit by the car, and she has been diagnosed with acute stress disorder and trauma since the event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, there are two other Plaintiffs who are more difficult to classify. Plaintiff Seth Wispelwey is a minister who led an ecumenical organization called \"Congregate\" in non-violent protest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 134). He was part of a church service across from the torchlight march on the 11th, was confronted by one of the Defendants after the torchlight rally, and was assaulted while counter-protesting on Saturday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 178, 182, 208). The last Plaintiff is Hannah Pearce. She is a member of Congregation Beth Israel, a synagogue close to the park where the Saturday rally took place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). She peacefully protested throughout the weekend and was subjected to anti-Semitic harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 219-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Two of the primary organizers of the Friday and Saturday events were Defendants Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler. Defendant Richard Spencer planned the Friday night march and encouraged his many followers to attend the Saturday rally. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 21). Defendant Jason Kessler is a Charlottesville resident who applied for, and eventually received, a permit to hold the Saturday rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two other promoters were Defendants Christopher Cantwell and Michael Peinovich. Defendant Cantwell attended the events and faced criminal charges for using pepper spray at the Friday night march. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Defendant Michael Peinovich hosts a podcast called The Daily Shoah and was featured on a promotional poster for the event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Many of the individual Defendants who helped plan the events are part of organizations that are themselves Defendants. Defendants Andrew Anglin and Robert \"Azzmador\" Ray run a website called The Daily Stormer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27). They used this platform and associated \"book clubs\" to promote the events, which Ray attended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The website is owned by an Ohio limited liability corporation, Defendant Moonbase Holdings, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant Vanguard America is a white nationalist group with twelve chapters across the country. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). Many of its members attended the events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 153, 197). Plaintiffs alleged one of its members, Defendant James Fields, intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one individual and injuring many others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Another organizer was Defendant Eli Mosley. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 29). He is associated with the white supremacist organization Defendant Identity Evropa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30). The founder of that organization is Defendant Damigo, who helped facilitate transportation for the events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Defendant Identity Evropa popularized the \"You will not replace us!\" chant that became the protesters' rally cry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Both Damigo and Mosley attended the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant Traditionalist Worker Party is a white nationalist organization, with many members who attended the rallies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). It is led by Defendant Matthew Heimbach and Defendant Matthew Parrott. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 32). Parrott wrote an account of his experiences at the Saturday rally, and he described how multiple Defendants used organized formations of \"shield walls\" in \"the fight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant League of the South and two of its leaders, Defendants Michael Hill and Michael Tubbs, were also involved in the fighting at the Saturday rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-36). Defendant Tubbs, in particular, led an organized charge of League of the South members against counter-protestors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant Augustus Sol Invictus is a member of Defendant Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, which is the \"military wing\" of the white nationalist group \"Proud Boys.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40- 41). He attended both events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Two different Ku Klux Klan organizations also participated in some capacity. Defendant Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan organized a previous Charlottesville rally, and then made various statements celebrating Defendant Fields's decision to drive his car into counter-protesters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Defendant East Coast Knights of the Ku Klux Klan also attended the previous rally and then participated in the August 12 rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant National Socialist Movement is a white supremacist organization that has a \"paramilitary\" structure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). Defendant Jeff Schoep, its leader, attended the rallies and afterwards tweeted that is was an \"honor\" to stand with the other \"warriors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Defendants Schoep, Heimbach, and Hill lead Defendant Nationalist Front, an umbrella organization that includes many of the aforementioned organizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Months preceding August 11 and 12th\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Charlottesville drew Defendants' attention because of its decision to change the name of Lee Park, a small park in Downtown Charlottesville that contains a statue of General Robert E. Lee, to Emancipation Park in February 2017. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48). In May 2017, various white supremacist groups, including some Defendants, led a torchlight march around the Lee statue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). \"Capitalizing on the perceived success of the May event,\" Defendant Kessler submitted an application for a follow-up rally on August 12th. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55). In the intervening months, various Defendants came to Charlottesville for marches and demonstrations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57). Plaintiff Romero protested one of these events, a Ku Klux Klan march, and received harassing phone calls afterwards from a member of the Klan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Planning for the August 11th and 12th rallies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Key Defendants met together in person for planning purposes at least a few times. Defendant Spencer and Evan McLaren, a member of Defendant Identity Evropa, met at the Trump Hotel in D.C. to organize the rally on an unspecified date. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 64). Closer to the rallies, Defendants Cantwell and Kessler then met on August 9th in Charlottesville to plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65). Defendants Ray, Cantwell, Mosley, and purported co-conspirator David Duke had a similar meeting on August 11. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Much more significantly, the majority of the planning appears to have occurred online. Defendants Kessler and Mosley used an online program called \"Discord\" for planning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 71-73). This \"invite only\" platform allowed Defendants and their chosen invitees to engage in private conversations during the lead up to the events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72). While Defendants Kessler and Mosley moderated and managed Discord, many other Defendants participated on the platform, including Defendants Heimbach, Parrott, Cantwell, Ray, Vanguard America, Identity Evropa, Traditionalist Worker Party, League of the South, and Moonbase Holdings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 77). Organizational Defendants were able to maintain private sub-forums for their own members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Conversation on Discord included mundane planning details, racist \"jokes,\" and concrete threats of violence. Defendant Mosley posted \"General Orders\" for \"Operation Unite the Right Charlottesville 2.0.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75). Organizers also posted information about shuttle service information, lodging, and carpools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76). Other corners of Discord were significantly darker. One user posted a fake advertisement for a pepper-spray-look-alike called \"Nig-Away,\" described as a \"a no-fuss, no muss 'nigger killer,' \" promised to \"kill[ ] on contact\" in order to \"rid the area of niggers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111). Another frequent Discord user asked whether it was \"legal to run over protestors blocking roadways?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 239). He clarified he was not joking, \"I'm NOT just shitposting. I would like clarification. I know it's legal in [North Carolina] and a few other states. I'm legitimately curious for the answer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Other Discord users made similar comments about running over counter-protestors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 236-41). Elsewhere on Discord, users made it clear they planned to fight at the events, saying things like \"I'm ready to crack skulls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97). Defendant Kessler told users: \"I recommend you bring picket sign post, shields and other self-defense implements which can be turned from a free speech tool to a self-defense weapon should things turn ugly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112). Defendant Vanguard America instructed its members \"to arrive at the rally in matching khaki pants and white polos,\" with one member noting that this was \"a good fighting uniform.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115). Defendant Hill wrote, in a Defendant League of the South Facebook group, that he wanted \"no fewer than 150 League warriors, dressed and ready for action, in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 12 August.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Similar comments from other Defendants abound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Counter-protestors prepare\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While this planning was ongoing, separate counter-protesters received permits to hold events in other parks during the Defendants' rally. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 132). Plaintiff Wispelwey started an organization, \"Congregate,\" to join with interfaith clergy in protesting against racial inequality and the rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 134). Defendant Kessler advised other attendees about Congregate's work, allegedly in an attempt to threaten the organization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135). The names of other counter-protestors were shared over Discord. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Other individuals opposed to the \"Unite the Right\" rally also prepared. Plaintiff Pearce's temple, Congregation Beth Israel, moved its Torah scrolls off site in advance of the rally and changed the time of its normal Shabbat services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 138-39). Stores around town put signs up supporting diversity and equality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 140). Defendants Kessler, Mosley, Spencer, and Peinovich shared the names and addresses of these businesses, allegedly in an attempt to have attendees intimidate them.

The march on August 11th\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants Mosley, Spencer, Kessler, Ray, Anglin, Cantwell, and Invictus organized a secret torchlight march at UVA. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 143-49). These torches were supposed to invoke the Ku Klux Klan's and Nazi's similar use of torches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150). The marchers marched two-by-two up the Lawn, around the Rotunda, and towards a Thomas Jefferson statue on the far side of the Rotunda. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 159, 164). As they marched, they chanted various racist slogans and performed Nazi salutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 161-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the march was supposed to be secret, approximately thirty counter-protesters,\n   including Plaintiffs Doe, Magill, and Romero, reached the Jefferson statue before the marchers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 164, 169). The counter-protesters linked arms and surrounded the statue, facing away from it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164). As the marchers rounded the Rotunda, they charged towards the statue and surrounded the counter-protestors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 164, 166). Fighting broke out, and the marchers kicked and punched the counter-protesters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 168). People in the crowd threw an unidentified fluid at the counter-protesters, including on Plaintiffs Doe, Magill, and Romero. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169). These Plaintiffs were afraid it was fuel and that they would be burned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Ray shouted, \"The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A photo shows Defendant Cantwell spraying a counter-protestor with pepper spray.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172). Plaintiffs Doe and Romero felt trapped and did not believe they could escape safely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 173-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   During this time, Plaintiff Wispelwey and around 1,000 others were inside St. Paul's Church, which is located across the street from the Rotunda. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 154). The faith community at St. Paul's, including Plaintiff Wispelwey, witnessed the marchers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 178). The church leaders asked everyone to remain at the church out of a fear of violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 180). Plaintiff Wispelwey eventually drove some attendees to their homes and hotels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 181). At one hotel, Defendant Invictus confronted Wispelwey and aggressively asked him what he was doing at the hotel and what church he belonged to. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 182).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The night ended with Defendants Kessler and Spencer, and others, celebrating the evening's events and encouraging their followers to come to the following day's rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 184).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The rally on August 12th\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Almost all of the Defendants attended Saturday's \"Unite the Right\" rally, including Defendants Kessler, Cantwell, Mosley, Heimbach, Hill, Invictus, Ray, Spencer, Damigo, Peinovich, Fields, Parrott, Tubbs, Nationalist Front, League of the South, National Socialist Movement, Traditionalist Worker Party, Vanguard America, East Coast Knights, Loyal White Knights, Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, and members of The Daily Stormer's \"book clubs.\" (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 187).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants arrived in passenger vans, gathered at pre-arranged meet up spots, and then marched towards the park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 196, 207). They entered Emancipation Park \"in military formations, armed like paramilitary forces.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 195). Organizations marched with matching uniforms, coordinated shields, and regimental flags. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 197-98). Defendant Fields, who would later drive his car into the crowd, wore Defendant Vanguard America's uniform and marched with other Vanguard America members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 197).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the military formations marched into the park, they assaulted and knocked over various counter-protestors, including Plaintiffs Wispelwey and Romero. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208). Other counter-protesters were blockaded around the park, and rally attendees used \"shields, flags, or fists\" to break through these counter-protesters and enter the park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 209). Once in the park, the violence escalated. According to an account of the day written by Defendant Parrott, members of Defendants Traditionalist Worker Party, League of the South, National Socialist Movement, and other Nationalist Front groups, jointly created \"two shield walls\" for \"the fight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212). Defendant Identity Evropa \"were occupied on other fronts,\" but \"sent a detachment of fighters to assist us and to relay intelligence to Jason Kessler and\n   other organizers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Tubbs ordered Defendant League of the South members to \"charge,\" and \"[a]fter receiving this command, the group streamed past him to attack counter-protesters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Some marchers also yelled anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans while passing Plaintiff Pearce's synagogue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 202). Defendant Ray carried a banner that stated \"Gas the kikes, race war now!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). An anonymous individual later threatened to \"torch those Jewish monsters\" in a comment on a YouTube video, leading Charlottesville's mayor to ask for police protection for the synagogue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 203). Plaintiff Pearce and her son counter-protested the rally outside the park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 220). She wore a Star of David and carried a rainbow flag. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 219). She was harassed by a rally attendee, who shouted, \"Oh good, they are marking themselves for us.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 220). Another rally attendee threw an open bottle with a \"foul liquid\" that hit Plaintiff Pearce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 221).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Then, at 11:22 a.m., Charlottesville declared the gathering an unlawful assembly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 223). Defendants Kessler, Cantwell, Ray, Schoep, and Vanguard America among others, moved to McIntire Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 226-28). Defendant Parrott did not leave, and was arrested for failure to disperse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 228). Violence continued in McIntire Park and on Charlottesville's downtown mall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 229, 234).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    H. The car attack on August 12th\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At 1:40 p.m., Plaintiffs allege Defendant Fields deliberately drove his car into a crowd of peaceful protesters that were congregated at the intersection of Fourth Street and the Downtown mall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 242). Plaintiffs Martin, Blair, Sines, Mu\u00f1iz, Alvarado, and Romero were all on Fourth Street when Fields drove his car into the crowd. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 243). Multiple of these Plaintiffs were struck by Defendant Fields' car and incurred serious injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 244-56). A friend of some of the Plaintiffs, Heather Heyer, was killed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 248).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Happenings after the event\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After the event, Defendants Anglin, Vanguard America, Kessler, Heimbach, East Coast Knights, and Loyal White Knights posted messages approving of the Defendant Fields's car attack. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 264, 266-69, 272). Defendant Schoep said it was an honor \"to stand\" with the other co-Defendants at the rally, and referred to them as \"true warriors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 271). Defendant Spencer referred to the rally a \"huge moral victory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 273). Defendant Cantwell was glad nobody on the Defendants' \"side\" died. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Many Defendants have stated they would like to return to Charlottesville for a similar event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 296). Defendant Spencer and others engaged in another torchlight march in Charlottesville on October 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 306). Defendant Kessler filed an application for another rally on August 11 and 12, 2018.

The Court first addresses the requisite racial animus and purpose of the conspiracy (the second and third elements). After laying this framework, the Court evaluates the complaint to see if it plausibly alleges that each Defendant joined such a conspiracy (the first element). The Court then asks whether that conspiracy caused Plaintiffs' alleged injuries (the fourth and fifth elements). Finally, while Plaintiffs' overarching First Amendment and other defenses are addressed separately at the end of this opinion, the Court does flag specific allegations that are not protected by that Amendment throughout the following discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Racial animus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs must plead that the Defendants were \"motivated by a specific class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.\"\n   <em>\n    A Soc'y Without A Name\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828278\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/342/#p346\">\n    655 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   346 ;\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

No Defendant seriously disputes that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged Defendants possessed racial animus against black and Jewish individuals; the complaint is replete with racist statements made and affirmed by Defendants. However, some Defendants do argue that they only possessed racial animus against non-white individuals, and so they cannot be held liable by white Plaintiffs.

That statute provides: \"All citizens of the United States shall have the same right ... as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\" Plaintiffs claim that rally attendees\n   interfered with the property rights of Congregation Beth Israel by marching past it and making anti-Semitic remarks outside of it. Plaintiff Pearce, a member of that synagogue, seeks to assert its alleged rights.

Those facts represent a paradigmatic Section 1982 violation. Some courts have extended the reach of that statute to something closer to Plaintiff's theory.

In that case, a skinhead and member of the Klu Klux Klan shot into a synagogue late at night.

The worst of the allegations concern unidentified individuals who marched past the synagogue and shouted anti-Semitic slogans. This alleged conduct is very different from the shots fired into synagogues in the above cases or the repeated harassment found in other cases. Furthermore, the only allegation concerning an actual Defendant states Defendant Ray carried a banner with anti-Semitic language. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 202). It does not allege he carried this banner past the synagogue or otherwise interacted with it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

These allegations do not adequately plead that one of the Defendants interfered with the property rights of the synagogue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While Plaintiffs have identified an underlying federal right guaranteed against private impairment in the Thirteenth Amendment, they must plausibly allege that Defendants entered a conspiracy to deprive them of that right.

And, in the days leading up to the event, he met in person with Defendant Cantwell to plan \"unlawful acts of violence [and] intimidation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65, 316).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At the Friday night torchlight march, Defendant Kessler once again functioned as an organizer, telling the marchers to get in formation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 143, 147, 157, 328). Along with Defendants Cantwell, Mosley, Spencer, Ray, and Invictus, Defendant Kessler \"directed and incited physical assaults and violence, the use of open flames, and the intimidation of minority residents and those who advocate for equal rights for minority citizens\" at the rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 329). The complaint identifies Defendant Kessler as leading the charge towards Plaintiffs Magill, Doe, and Romero at the Thomas Jefferson statue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164). This charge culminated with the circling of the counter-protesters (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166), Defendant Cantwell and others spraying pepper spray at the counter-protesters (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172), and the marchers throwing their burning torches at the counter-protesters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169). Throughout this time, the marchers were performing Nazi salutes, chanting \"Blood and Soil,\" \"Jews will not replace us,\" and making monkey noises at black counter-protesters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 162, 165). Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged Kessler came to an agreement with these co-Defendants to engage in racially motivated violence against the counter-protesters at the torchlight march.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Then, the next day at the rally, various co-Defendant organizations fought against counter-protesters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212). While they did this, Defendant Identity Evropa \"sent a detachment of fighters to assist [Defendant League of the South] and to relay intelligence to Jason Kessler and other organizers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This paragraph plausibly alleges Defendant Kessler was overseeing the racial violence at the rally. Finally, after hearing about Defendant Fields's later attack, Kessler called Heather Heyer, the victim who died, a \"communist\" and said \"Communists have killed 94 million. Looks like it was payback time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 267). In light of his other conduct, this plausibly alleges ratification of Defendant Fields's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The complaint plausibly alleges that Defendant Kessler entered into agreements with these other Defendants for the purpose of assaulting and intimidating individuals who were counter-protesting Defendants' message of white supremacy. As discussed below, many of these actions are completely divorced from any First Amendment protection. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164 (the charge resulting in violence around the Jefferson statue);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212 (overseeing the violence at the Saturday rally) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Richard Spencer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant Spencer was also prominently involved in the organization of the events. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 28, 29, 40, 42, 49, 52, 63, 64, 70, 85, 87, 92, 108, 120, 141, 143, 153, 164, 166, 175, 184, 187, 229, 230, 260, 273, 297, 300, 305, 306, 311, 315, 327-29). Alongside Defendant Kessler, \"Spencer invited white supremacist groups to visit and hold events around the statue with the intent of intimidating nonwhite and Jewish individuals and their allies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). Spencer coordinated with Defendants Damigo and Identity Evropa, who \"took the lead in organizing white supremacist participation among people from outside Charlottesville ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 70). In the lead up to the rally, Spencer met Evan McLaren, a purported Defendant Identity Evropa member, in person in Washington, D.C. for further organization and direction of the rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). During this time of planning, Spencer made statements that plausibly demonstrate an agreement to engage in violence. An article posted on his website told his followers that \"it's time to dominate the streets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87). A Discord user relayed Spencer's desire that rally attendees \"[b]ring as much gear and weaponry as you can within the confines of the law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Spencer was also a planner of Friday's torchlight march. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 143, 153, 328). Along with Defendants Cantwell, Mosley, Kessler, Ray, and Invictus, Defendant Spencer \"directed and incited physical assaults and violence, the use of open flames, and the intimidation of minority residents and those who advocate for equal rights for minority citizens\" at the rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 329). As with Defendant Kessler, Spencer is specifically alleged to have led the charge towards Plaintiffs Magill, Doe, and Romero at the Thomas Jefferson statue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164). Marchers climbed to the top of the statue, waved their torches, and yelled \"Hail Spencer! Hail victory!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 175). Afterwards, Defendant Spencer confirmed that Defendants had surrounded the counter-protestors at the statue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166). After the event, he addressed the crowd and thanked them for \"risking their lives\" for their future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 175).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant Spencer was also involved with and attended the Saturday rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 187). He continued to actively promote the rally through social media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 184). And then, in the aftermath of the rally, his website posted a statement that announced \"The Alt-Right is finished debating, negotiating, surrendering. We're ready to close ranks and fight for what is ours.... [W]e stand poised to conquer the continent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 305).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Allegations of this degree of planning, followed by these coordinated actions (specifically at the Friday night march), plausibly allege that Defendant Spencer joined a conspiracy to engage in the racially motivated violence that occurred on August 11th and 12th. As with Spencer, much of this conduct was not protected by the First Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164 (the charge resulting in violence around the Jefferson statue) ). Other statements might be protected speech taken by themselves, but in light of Spencer's other conduct they can plausibly \"be taken as evidence that [he] gave other specific instructions to carry out violent acts or threats.\"\n   <em>\n    N.A.A.C.P. v.

Christopher Cantwell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   While Defendant Cantwell may have been lower in the pecking order than either Kessler or Spencer, he is more closely tied to acts of overt violence in furtherance of the conspiracy than either of them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 63, 65, 66, 74, 107, 127, 143, 151, 157, 159, 160, 172, 187, 226, 227, 273, 277, 303, 304, 309, 310, 316, 317, 322, 323, 326-330). He was an active participant on Discord in the months leading up to the event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 322). He used his various platforms to \"advise[ ] rallygoers on bringing weapons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 323). In the days before the rally, he met with Defendants Kessler, Ray, Mosley, and purported co-conspirator David Duke \"to plan and direct the unlawful acts of violence ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65, 66, 316, 317). On the morning of the 11th, he told a reporter that he was \"trying to make [himself] more capable of violence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 151).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Then, at the Friday night torchlight march, Cantwell joined Defendants Spencer,\n   Mosley, Kessler, Ray, and Invictus, Defendant Spencer in \"direct[ing] and incit[ing] physical assaults and violence, the use of open flames, and the intimidation of minority residents and those who advocate for equal rights for minority citizens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 329). \"Defendants Cantwell, Kessler, Ray, and other co-conspirators were issuing orders to the other white supremacists and neo-Nazis, telling them to get in specific formations and assigning people either to march with a torch or on the side as 'security.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157). \"Organizers, including Defendant Cantwell, wore earpieces, carried radios, and shouted specific orders at the marchers. They shouted to keep pace, avoid gaps, stay in line 'two-by-two,' and march alongside a 'security guard.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 159). Defendant Cantwell himself marched with guards \"who were selected for their willingness to 'get physical' with counter-protestors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 160).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As they approached counter-protesters, Defendant Cantwell personally \"attacked the [counter-]protestors with mace.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172). A photograph included in the complaint shows Cantwell in the act of spraying counter-protestors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He was later charged \"with two felony counts of illegal use of tear gas and one felony count of malicious body injury by means of a caustic substance. He was indicted on December 4 on a felony charge of illegal use of tear gas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). This conduct, of course, is not protected by the First Amendment. Other co-Defendants shared this picture, congratulating Cantwell on his violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant Cantwell came to the Saturday rally heavily armed, bringing three pistols, two semi-automatic machine guns, and a knife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 303). Then as events spiraled out of control, the Daily Stormer informed its followers to assemble \"behind\" Defendants Cantwell and Ray. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 227). In the aftermath, he told a reporter that he thought \"a lot more people are going to die before we're done here, frankly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 303). Reflecting on co-Defendant Fields's attack, he said \"[N]one of our people killed anybody unjustly .... [O]ur rivals are just a bunch of stupid animals who don't pay attention that couldn't just get out of the way of the car.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 273). He continued, saying \"[t]hese people want violence and the right is just meeting market demand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In light of the specific statements made by Cantwell, the picture of him assaulting counter-protesters with pepper spray, and his joint leadership of various portions of the events with other Defendants (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the Friday night march, the Daily Stormer's encouragement for its followers to get \"behind\" him), Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Defendant Cantwell joined the conspiracy to engage in the racially motivated violence at the \"Unite the Right\" events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Vanguard America\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant Vanguard America's fingerprints were all over last August's events. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 34, 50, 53, 63, 67, 77, 81, 91, 93, 96, 114-17, 121, 153, 167, 185, 187, 191, 196-98, 218, 228, 266, 270, 276, 319, 322, 332). Like other organizational Defendants, Vanguard America had a private channel on Discord called \"Southern Front.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77). They used this channel to coordinate attendance, with an organizer telling other members \"This event is a **BIG DEAL** and offers a chance to link up Vanguard Guys from across the nation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81, 114). Specifically, members were instructed to wear \"matching khaki pants and white polos,\" which members liked because \"it's a good fighting uniform.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115). Some chapters planned to bring shields with matching logos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121). Vanguard America\n   made twenty extra shields for attendees who were unprepared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 191).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Members made their violent plans explicit. \"One member of Defendant Vanguard America explained on the Southern Front server after the event that Vanguard America had coordinated with Defendant National Socialist Movement because the Charlottesville event was about violence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117). While Vanguard America did not normally associate with National Socialist Movement, they needed to in Charlottesville because \"NSM fought so hard\" and Vanguard America \"need[ed] them in a fight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Members also discussed whether to bring firearms, collapsible batons, and various types of knives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115). A Vanguard America member also posted \"a violent drawing of Defendant Heimbach wearing a shirt bearing Nazi and Defendant TWP symbols and the words 'nigger killer' above a tally of 'communists killed,' smiling in front of decapitated black men wearing logos associated with anti-fascist movements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116). While this could potentially being taken as very dark hyperbole in some instances, in the light of the later events it plausibly alleges a plan for violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendant Vanguard America members were present at the Friday night event, marching in uniform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 153). Once they had surrounded counter-protesters at the Thomas Jefferson statue, online members encouraged those members present \"to physically remove [the counter-protestors].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 167). The violence described above ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant Vanguard America also led the violent events at the Saturday rally. Its members met with Defendants Nationalist Front, League of the South, National Socialist Movement, and Traditionalist Worker's Party to coordinate the march into the park in formation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 196). \"Defendant Vanguard America marched to the Park first.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 197). They chanted \"Blood and Soil!\" and carried matching shields and flags. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Fields, wearing the pre-approved uniform, marched with Defendant Vanguard America. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Members also carried rods and other weapons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Other groups followed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 198). Members on Discord had said they would \"remove whoever is in [their] way\" when they got to the park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 191). Consistent with this plan, members used their shields to break through counter-protestors and move into the park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 209). Once inside the park, online members continued telling members physically there to \"[j]ust incite a riot already.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 218).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   At some point, Defendant Fields broke off from the rest of the group and allegedly committed his attack. He was \"wearing the uniform white polo and khakis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 332). After his attack, Defendant Vanguard America members congratulated him and celebrated the attack on Discord, stating, \"We fucked up many commies .... We hospitalized dozens .... Now you make the next rally and fight for your people.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 266, 270).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In light of the coordinated marching and shield tactics, the various communications on Discord, and their members' continued admissions of violence, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Defendant Vanguard America was part of the conspiracy to engage in racially motivated violence. Many of these allegations describe conduct that either does not implicate the First Amendment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 191 (alleging \"Vanguard is fabricating 20 additional shields\" for the fighting at the rally) ), or plausibly serves as evidence of other specific violent acts.\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/#p927\">\n    458 U.S. at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/#p927\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; dkt. 175 at \u00b6 270 (\"We fucked up many commies ....

Some of these meetings were under the auspices of the Daily Stormer's \"book clubs,\" which Defendant Ray clarified do not actually have anything to do with books and instead were used to organize the events. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93 (\"You don't think the [Daily Stormer book clubs] have anything to do with books do you? ... Think boots, not books.\").

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Throughout this time, Defendant Ray used violent language and demonstrated signs of planning for violence. He told a reporter, \"We are stepping off the Internet in a big way .... We have been organizing on the Internet. And so now they are coming out.

At some point we will have enough power that we will clear them from the streets forever ... you ain't seen nothing yet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88). He wrote that \"this rally will put the fear of god into the hearts and minds of our enemies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92). On Discord, he advised that his followers would \"be ready with lots of nifty equipment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 110). He directed his followers to bring tiki torches (for the Friday night march), pepper spray, flag poles, flags, and shields. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This planning came to life on Friday the 11th. Along with Defendants Cantwell and Kessler, Defendant Ray was \"issuing orders to the other white supremacists and neo-Nazis, telling them to get in specific formations and assigning people either to march with a torch or on the side as 'security.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157).

Nathan Damigo and Identity Evropa\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant Nathan Damigo attended the events with members of the white supremacist organization he founded, Defendant Identity Evropa. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 28-30, 50, 52, 63, 64, 70, 77, 92, 187, 212, 276, 300-02, 308, 311, 320, 322). Defendant Spencer claims that Defendants Damigo and Identity Evropa coordinated attendance from outside Charlottesville. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70, 320). A purported Identity Evropa member, Evan McClaren, met with Defendant Spencer to coordinate and organize the rally in Washington, D.C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). Defendant Identity Evropa also had its own Discord channel, which it used to communicate with its members about the events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 77, 322). Defendant Damigo also attended a previous rally held in Berkeley, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Damigo referred to Berkeley as a \"test run\" for Charlottesville. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that rally, Damigo was arrested for assaulting a counter-protestor, demonstrating his violent intentions for the main event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendants Damigo and Identity Evropa were key participants in the violence on the 12th. In an account of the day called \"Catcher in the Reich: My Account of My Experience in Charlottesville,\" co-Defendant Parrott claimed that \"most of the Identity Evropa men were occupied on other fronts\" during the fighting, but that Defendant Identity Evropa \"sent a detachment of fighters to assist us and to relay intelligence to Jason Kessler and other organizers. They offered more fighters, but we had our positions amply covered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212). These allegations of organized paramilitary fighting plausibly allege that Defendants Damigo and Identity Evropa were part of the conspiracy to commit racial violence at these events. Defendant Damigo's prior violence at the \"test run\" for the Charlottesville events further bolsters the allegations of his personal involvement in a plan to commit racial violence at these events. The First Amendment does not shield Defendants from these allegations of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/#p927\">\n    458 U.S. at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/#p927\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The First Amendment does not protect violence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    vii.

(Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30). However, Defendant Mosley had a more central role in the organization of the events, and particularly in the organization of violence at them. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 20, 29, 30, 63, 66, 73, 75, 78, 89, 97, 100, 129, 137, 141, 143, 147, 148, 152, 172, 187, 189, 192, 231, 300, 311, 317, 321, 322, 324, 326, 328, 329). Defendant Mosley referred to himself as the \"command soldier major of the 'alt-right' \" and told attendees that he was running the rally \"as a military operation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 192). He also declared that Defendants would not be replaced \"without a fight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Defendant Mosley, along with Kessler, \"moderated, reviewed, directed, and managed\" Discord. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 73, 322). Mosley and other leaders \"used Discord for regular 'leadership' meetings through which they shared information and plans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75). Defendant Mosley used this platform to issue \"General Orders\" for \"Operation Unite the Right Charlottesville 2.0.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These orders described individuals opposed to Defendants' racist ideologies as \"hostiles.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A \"video for basic formation, roles, and commands\" was also promised on Discord, and a \"Shield Tactics Primer\" and accompanying video was then posted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 192). The video illustrated shield fighting techniques. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Distribution of these sorts of instruction manuals to commit crimes is not protected by the\n   First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

(Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 66, 317). Mosley then helped lead the Friday night march, previously having instructed attendees to buy torches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 143, 147, 328). He ordered the marchers \"to arrive at Nameless Field, a large area behind UVA's Memorial Gymnasium, at 9:30p.m., so that they could march once darkness fell at 9:47 p.m.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148). He used Discord to tell marchers when \"to start staging.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152). He would later approvingly tweet the picture of Cantwell spraying pepper spray in a counter-protester's eyes, saying \"He protect / He at[t]ack / But most importantly he got your back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172). This plausibly alleges Defendant Mosley ratified Cantwell's assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendant Mosley was also active in organizing events on the 12th. He exhorted attendees to arrive before the park opened and create a \"a white bloc barrier or square around the entire statue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 189). Once an unlawful assembly was declared and the attendees began leaving the park, \"Defendant Mosley sought people with guns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 231). He said, \"I need shooters\" because \"[w]e're gonna send 200 people with long rifles back to that statue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In light of the Defendant Mosley's self-proclaimed role as \"command soldier major of the alt-right,\" his use of Discord to share fighting tactics, and his alleged organization of attendees at the Friday night march, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that he was part of a conspiracy to commit racial violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    viii. Matthew Heimbach, Matthew Parrott, and Traditionalist Worker Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants Matthew Heimbach and Matthew Parrott are leaders of Defendant Traditionalist Worker Party, an anti-Semitic organization with around 500 members. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-33). These Defendants, alongside the Defendants associated with Defendant League of the South, allegedly engaged in many of the most specific acts of violence in furtherance of the conspiracy. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 37, 50, 63, 67, 74, 77, 90, 116, 187, 188, 196, 200, 212, 214, 228, 268, 271, 319, 322, 327). Like other organizational Defendants, Defendant Traditionalist Worker Party used a private Discord channel for planning with its members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77). Defendants Heimbach and Parrott participated on Discord. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74). In addition to planning, and as mentioned above, a member of co-Defendant Vanguard America used Discord to distribute a drawing of Defendant Heimbach with \"kill tallies\" of communists, the words \"nigger killer,\" and drawing of decapitated black men. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On the morning of the 12th, members of Defendant Traditionalist Worker Party met with members from Defendants Nationalist Front, League of the South, and National Socialist Movement \"at a pre-set location in order to march to Emancipation Park in formation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 196). Defendants Parrott, Heimbach, and other Traditionalist Worker Party members then marched behind Defendant League of the South. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 200). Defendants in these formations \"charged through the peaceful clergy when they arrived at the park ... and Plaintiff Wispelwey was knocked into a bush.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208). Then, in Parrott's words, members worked with other Defendants \"to help create two shield walls\" for \"the fight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212). This apparently\n   was part of an \"original plan to define and secure the event perimeter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 214). Defendants Parrott and Traditionalist Worker Party then coordinated the placement of \"detachment[s] of fighters\" with other Defendants to \"amply cover\" their positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212). Defendant Parrott described how, \"[w]ith a full-throated rebel yell,\" co-Defendant League of the South member Michael Tubbs \"towered over and pushed through the antifa like a Tyrannosaurus among raptors as League fighters with shields put their training to work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Once the gathering was declared an unlawful assembly, Defendant Parrott was arrested for failure to disperse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 228). A co-Defendant later thanked Defendant Traditionalist Worker Party for their work, referring to them as \"true warriors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 271).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiff's recounting of Defendant Parrott's own account of the events, as well as the other allegations of violence, plausibly allege that these three Defendants joined the conspiracy to commit racial violence. As with other Defendants, the First Amendment does not prevent the imposition of liability for the acts of violence alleged here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212 (summarizing Defendant Parrott's account of the fighting) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    ix. Michael Hill, Michael Tubbs, and League of the South\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As with the three just-discussed Defendants, Defendants Michael Hill, Michael Tubbs, and League of the South were allegedly in the heart of the violence that occurred on Saturday the 12th.

Defendant Michael Hill is the co-founder and President of Defendant League of the South. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). The white supremacist organization includes \"an armed, paramilitary unit\" called \"the Indomitables\" that has been \"tasked with advancing southern secession by any means necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Michael Tubbs is the \"Chief of Staff\" of Defendant League of the South. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendant League of the South used Discord and Facebook to communicate with its members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 77, 322). In the lead up to the events, Defendant Hill posted in the Facebook group, saying he wanted \"no fewer than 150 League warriors, dressed and ready for action, in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 12 August.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). One member explained that he planned to attend the rally because \"I intend to stand for the South and die for it if need be.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   They coordinated with the other Defendants.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188).

Members then followed Defendant Hill, marching \"with coordinated shields and flags,\" and carrying \"rods and other weapons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 198). Either as they approached the park, or once they were already within it, Defendant Tubbs ordered League of the South members \"to attack by yelling 'charge!' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). \"After receiving this command, the group streamed past him to attack counter-protestors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.; compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noto v.

No. We need them in a fight? Yes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117). Likewise, another Discord described National Socialist Movement as \"nuts ... in a good way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188). Members from Defendant National Socialist Movement met with other Defendants \"at a pre-set location in order to march to Emancipation Park in formation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 196).

This was part of \"the original plan to define and secure the event perimeter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants National Socialist Movement and Nationalist Front were also engaged in the fighting summarized by Defendant Parrott's account.

The podcast, without more, is protected speech. Another paragraph alleges that on his podcast, an unnamed individual asked \"Now come on, beating up the wrong negro ... is that even a possibility? Beat up the wrong nigger ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96). Without more context about, for example, when and who said this and how Defendant Peinovich responded, this is insufficient to demonstrate Peinovich had entered an agreement to engage in racial violence at the events. The promotional poster at most demonstrates an agreement to promote the rally, an event which many people attended for divergent reasons. His promotion of the event is insufficient to plausibly allege an agreement to commit violence. Finally, the mere fact he addressed followers is innocuous. Although it is ambiguous whether this was part of the same address, the complaint elsewhere alleges \"Peinovich called the counter-protestors 'savages.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 230). This sort of name calling is far short of plausibly pleading an agreement to commit racial violence and, even within this context, is protected speech.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bible Believers v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 207). Likewise, the fact he reassembled with followers in McIntire Park, without an allegation of an agreement to commit violence, is insufficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 229).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Two other paragraphs concern only his appearances at a previous rally with some co-Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52). But there are no allegations these rallies were unlawful;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Defendant Peinovich cannot be held liable simply for his associations. Three other paragraphs allege that Defendant Peinovich set up a legal fund before the rally and helped Defendant Cantwell fundraise from prison after the events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 129, 310, 326). This sort of fundraising is too far removed from the other Defendants' violence to plausibly connect Defendant Peinovich to a conspiracy to commit violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege Defendant Peinovich tweeted, \"Do these white business owners and shitlibs in CVille think that their virtue signaling mean they will be spared somehow? Lol.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 141). Peinovich was responding to signs put up by various organizations in Charlottesville that \"voiced support for equality and diversity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 140). Some of these businesses later received threatening mail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 142). His tweet is still insufficient to demonstrate a conspiracy to commit violence that injured these Plaintiffs. Even if these businesses were injured, a fact not alleged here, they are not parties to this lawsuit. This tweet does not plausibly allege an agreement to engage in racial violence\n   <em>\n    at these events.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   There are no allegations Defendant Peinovich engaged in violence. There are no allegations that he even used Discord. And in light of this discussion, there are no other plausible allegations that he joined the conspiracy to commit racial violence. Accordingly, the Court holds Plaintiffs' complaint fails to plausibly allege that Defendant Peinovich violated Section 1985(3), and so he will be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether Plaintiffs' injuries resulted from overt acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Defendants, other than Peinovich, joined a conspiracy to engage in racially motivated violence at the \"Unite the Right\" events. However, in order to hold Defendants liable, Plaintiffs must also plausibly allege they suffered injuries caused by Defendants' overt acts taken in furtherance of the conspiracy (the fourth and fifth elements).\n   <em>\n    A Soc'y Without A Name\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828278\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/342/#p346\">\n    655 F.3d at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Injuries incurred at the torchlight march\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiffs Magill, Doe, and Romero allege they were pepper sprayed and otherwise assaulted at the base of the Thomas Jefferson statue on the night of August 11th. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 18, 166, 169, 173, 174, 293). Injuries associated with these assaults were reasonably foreseeable\n   consequences of the Defendants' conspiracy: Defendant Cantwell sprayed pepper spray at counter-protestors at the foot of the statue (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22), Defendants Spencer and Cantwell led the charge of marchers towards the statue (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 164, 166), and Defendant Ray yelled \"The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens!\" while torches were being thrown at them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169). These Plaintiffs have adequately pled their Section 1985(3) claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Injuries incurred from Defendant Fields's attack\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs Romero, Martin, Blair, Alvarado, Sines, and Mu\u00f1iz were all injured by Defendant Fields's car attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-19). Other Defendants may be held liable for these injuries if it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" to them that a co-conspirator would intentionally drive his car into a crowd of counter-protestors. The Court holds that Plaintiffs have adequately pled that Defendant Fields's attack was reasonably foreseeable for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   First, the exact possibility of running over counter-protestors was explicitly mentioned on the invite-only Discord platform before the events. The complaint alleges that a \"run them over\" catchphrase was popularized on the Fox Nation website, the Daily Caller website, and by Defendants. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 236). For example, Defendant Heimbach had previously encouraged a police car to run over protesters, saying \"Don't stop, officer\" and \"Fucking step on the gas!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A Discord user posted an image of a bus retrofitted with chainsaws and running over pedestrians. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 237). Another frequent Discord user responded, saying \"I know NC law is on the books that driving over protesters blocking roadway isn't an offense ... Sure would be nice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 238). The user later asked whether it was \"legal to run over protestors blocking roadways?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 239). He clarified that this was not some sort of sick joke: \"I'm NOT just shitposting. I would like clarification. I know it's legal in [North Carolina] and a few other states. I'm legitimately curious for the answer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Kessler was part of a conversation where a different Discord user talked about how counter-protestors had previously flooded streets, and regretted that it was \"[t]oo bad the civilians didn't just make new speed bumps for some of these scum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 241). These posts were all on the private, invite-only, moderated platform that Defendants used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Second, the Defendants planned to bring deadly weaponry to the event. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , dkt. 175 at \u00b6 303 (\"After the Unite the Right 'rally,' Defendant Cantwell explained, 'I came pretty well prepared for this thing today,' while pulling out three pistols, two semi-automatic machine guns, and a knife.\") ). Allegations concerning this level of weaponry demonstrate that it was eminently foreseeable to the Defendants that the rally could turn deadly. The fact that a counter-protestor was killed by a vehicle, instead of by the \"semi-automatic machine guns\" Defendants brought, provides a distinction that makes no difference to this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Third, multiple Defendants ratified Defendant Fields's attack after the fact. (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6\u00b6 263-67, 272-73). For example, Defendant Loyal White Knights said: \"Nothing makes us more proud at the KKK than we see white patriots such as James Fields, Jr, age 20, taking his car and running over nine communist anti-fascist, killing one nigger-lover named Heather Heyer. James Fields hail victory.\" (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 272). Defendant Kessler tweeted \"Communists have killed 94 million. Looks like it was payback time.\" (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 267). Others made similar comments. These ratifications plausibly demonstrate that Defendant Fields's actions\n   were consistent with the conspiracy's avowed goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In light of the discussion of these sorts of attacks, the potentially deadly nature of the planned violence, and the various ratifications of Defendant Fields's attack, the Court finds Plaintiffs Romero, Martin, Blair, Alvarado, Sines, and Mu\u00f1iz have adequately pled Defendant Fields's attack was reasonably foreseeable to his co-conspirator Defendants. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that these co-conspirator Defendants may be held liable for the overt act Fields's took in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Newsome\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369057\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/328/#p338\">\n    322 F.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338 (4th Cir. 2003). Of course, factual development may undermine this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Plaintiffs Wispelwey and Pearce\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   That leaves only two remaining Plaintiffs. Plaintiff Wispelwey was \"knocked into a bush\" when rally attendees charged through peaceful clergy, \"[c]onsistent with their elaborate planning and lessons in battlefield tactics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208). While Plaintiff Wispelwey does not allege which specific Defendant knocked him into a bush, the preceding paragraphs of the complaint extensively allege that specific Defendants, including Vanguard America and League of the South, organized in military formations outside Emancipation Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 195-98). Defendant Parrott specifically alleges that Defendant League of the South entered the park by breaking \"through the wall of degenerates and [an otherwise unidentified individual named \"TradWorker\"] managed to enter the [Emancipation] Park venue itself while they were largely still reeling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212). Plaintiffs also allege Defendants \"use[d] shields, flags, or fists to break through the blockade of counter-protestors\" in order to enter the park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 209). In light of the specificity of these allegations of how Defendants entered the park, and Plaintiff Wispelwey's allegation that he was knocked over by someone who was acting consistently with these \"battlefield tactics,\" he has plausibly alleged his injuries were caused by overt actions of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   On the other hand, while the Court in no way minimizes the injuries Plaintiff Pearce suffered, she has not sufficiently alleged her injuries were caused by overt acts committed in connection with Defendants' conspiracy. Pearce is mentioned in nine paragraphs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 138, 202, 219-22, 258, 295). Some of these paragraphs only allege injury in a conclusory fashion. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14 (\"On the basis of her religion, Pearce was threatened, harassed, intimidated, and physically assaulted.\"). Others mention fear of injury that was not associated with a specific overt act of any Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 138, 219, 295). There is no allegation she was exposed to certain anti-Semitic banners allegedly carried by a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 202). And the most targeted injuries and insults were made by anonymous \"co-conspirators,\" who Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege were part of Defendants' conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 220, 221). While the Court finds Plaintiff Pearce has insufficiently alleged her injuries were caused by overt acts made in connection with the conspiracy, she may seek leave to amend with more specific factual allegations if she is able to provide them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Accordingly, each of the Plaintiffs except Pearce has alleged they suffered injuries that were caused by an overt act in furtherance of the moving Defendants' conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Count I conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court concludes Plaintiffs have, for the most part, adequately alleged that Defendants formed a conspiracy to hurt black and Jewish individuals, and their supporters,\n   because of their race at the August 11th and 12th events. The alleged violence is greater than that alleged in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , and likewise \"lies so close to the core of the coverage intended by Congress [in enacting Section 1985(3) ] that it is hard to conceive of wholly private conduct that would come within the statute if this does not.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026715\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/88/#p102\">\n    403 U.S. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026715\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/88/#p102\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There are two caveats to that general conclusion. First, Plaintiff Pearce's Section 1985(3) claims against the moving Defendants will be dismissed because she has not adequately connected her injuries to these Defendants. Second, the Section 1985(3) claims against Defendant Peinovich will be dismissed because Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged he joined the conspiracy. Finally, while the Court has pointed out conduct and statements that were not protected by Defendants' First Amendment defense along the way, that defense is addressed more fulsomely at the end of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

In the second, she alleges she \"witnessed co-conspirators throwing fuel and tiki torches at the peaceful protestors around the statue.\" (Dkt. 175 at \u00b6 170). The same problems apply. Plaintiff neither alleges that these specific Defendants were the ones throwing fuel and torches, nor does she allege that this conduct was directed at her. Her claims under this statute against the moving Defendants will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Likewise, Plaintiff Wispelwey's claims against the moving Defendants cannot survive. In response to the motion to dismiss, he identifies five relevant paragraphs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 178-82). These paragraphs describe the church service that occurred across from the Rotunda, where Wispelwey and others could see the mob and their torches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But the only Defendant mentioned by name in these paragraphs is Defendant Invictus, who is not moving to dismiss.

They have plausibly alleged violations of the hate crime statute by Mosley, Spencer, Kessler, Ray, and Cantwell, and so the motion to dismiss these claims against these Defendants will be denied. Plaintiffs allege the torchlight march was designed to intimidate racial minorities by replicating the Ku Klux Klan's and Nazi's use of torches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150). Plaintiffs allege that the torch-wielding mob, including each of these Defendants, \"charged toward a small group ... including Plaintiffs John Doe and Romero, who had locked arms around the statue of Thomas Jefferson.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 143, 164, 169, 172). Magill later joined Doe and Romero at the statue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169). These Plaintiffs were surrounded by Defendants and other marchers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166). Marchers then \"began to kick and punch the protesters around the statue, using their torches as weapons, and to beat the individuals onto the ground.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 168). Marchers also threw fluid, which Plaintiffs feared was fuel, onto them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169). Marchers then threw their torches in the air at Plaintiffs and other counter-protesters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

And so, as described there, the Court has required Plaintiffs to plausibly allege that their various injuries resulted from agreements made by specific Defendants; they cannot allege that all the rally attendees who disagree with them were part of one overarching conspiracy. The Court has imposed this heightened standard to the pleadings in order to satisfy the \"precision of regulation\" demanded by the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/#p927\">\n    458 U.S. at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/#p927\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Defendants' more general argument that it is immunized from liability by the First Amendment fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Second Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Many of the above allegations note that Defendants brought weapons (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , assault rifles, shields, poles, and pepper spray) to the Friday and Saturday events. Defendants briefly argue that the Second Amendment protected their rights to bring these weapons to the rally. But Plaintiffs' theory here is not that Defendants incurred liability by\n   <em>\n    bringing\n   </em>\n   these weapons, but by\n   <em>\n    using\n   </em>\n   them. (Dkt. 231 at ECF 52). As Plaintiffs correctly point out, the Second Amendment \"right of the people to keep and bear Arms\" no more insulates Defendants from civil liability for the use of their weapons in an assault than it insulates a criminal defendant from liability because he committed his crime with a weapon. \"Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not\n   unlimited.\"\n   <em>\n    D.C. v. Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p626\">\n    554 U.S. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p626\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p626\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Likewise, Defendants point to no authority preventing the Court from considering Defendants' decisions to bring substantial amounts of weapons to the rally as evidence of a plan to engage in violence. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , dkt. 175 at \u00b6 303 (\"After the Unite the Right 'rally,' Defendant Cantwell explained, 'I came pretty well prepared for this thing today,' while pulling out three pistols, two semi-automatic machine guns, and a knife. Of the next 'alt-right protest,' he said, 'it's going to be tough to top but we're up to the challenge ... I think a lot more people are going to die before we're done here, frankly.' \") ). While the reasonableness of this inference may vary based on specific allegations (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an individual lawfully carrying a licensed gun does not reasonably give rise to this inference), some of Plaintiffs' allegations concerning weapons do support an inference that Defendants planned to engage in racially motivated violence at the rally. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 191 (\"Vanguard is fabricating 20 additional shields.

Defendants cite no cases to the contrary, choosing instead to invoke\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   as talismans. Defendants' Second Amendment arguments fall flat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Judicial notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Defendants also ask the Court to take judicial notice of various documents and videos, ranging from the Heaphy Report (a report Charlottesville commissioned in the wake of the rally) to YouTube videos of speeches Defendants' made at the rally.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201. First, Defendants wish to demonstrate that the City of Charlottesville and various counter-protesters were also responsible for the violence. While the Court has reviewed the Heaphy Report, other potential causes of violence mentioned by it do not undermine Plaintiffs' allegations about these Defendants' conspiracy to commit violence. Even assuming it is proper to take judicial notice of the whole report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) (\"The court may judicially notice a\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   ....\"), its only relevance here is to provide general background to the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Second, Defendants also wish to provide context for various quotes and statements that they made through videos and transcripts of their speeches and statements. Here, the Court declines to take judicial notice of these documents because doing so would lead the Court into some of the fundamental factual disputes of the case, disputes that are appropriate for discussion later in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldfarb v.

First, a few Defendants argue that this Court's August 2017 order enjoining Charlottesville from revoking the attendee's permit establishes the legality of the rally as a matter of\n    <em>\n     res judicata.\n    </em>\n    But that\n    <em>\n     ex ante\n    </em>\n    determination, that included none of these Plaintiffs, about whether Charlottesville violated the First Amendment is completely different than this\n    <em>\n     ex post\n    </em>\n    consideration of whether Defendants violated specific laws. As just discussed, Defendants and other rally attendees did have legitimate First Amendment rights at the rally, but the problem is that Plaintiffs allege Defendants exceeded the bounds of those rights by conspiring to commit violence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    Second, the same Defendants argue that the torchlight march was an expressive activity that is no different than flag burning.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Texas v.

As just discussed, that violence is not protected by the First Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    Defendant Nationalist Front briefly raised this issue in a motion to dismiss filed in response to the original complaint. (Dkt. 105 at 1-2; dkt. 207). Defendant Schoep, the founder of Defendant Nationalist Front, filed an affidavit in support of the motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 105-1). The affidavit states that Nationalist Front \"has no existence other than [its] website.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 9). This is directly contradicted by Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants Schoep and Heimbach \"co-chair\" the organization (dkt. 175 at \u00b6 31), that Defendant Hill also assists in its leadership (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 39), that it was designed to be \"the thread that would unite white supremacist and white nationalist circles\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 39), and that its members were present and acted as \"warriors\" at the Saturday rally (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 196, 212). Considering this affidavit and resolving whether Defendant Nationalist was merely a website or instead a platform for Defendants to coordinate their conduct at the rally would require the Court to treat this as a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Furthermore, Defendant Nationalist Front does not respond to Plaintiffs' argument that consideration of the affidavit would be inappropriate without allowing Plaintiffs time for discovery. The Court holds consideration of the affidavit would be inappropriate at this stage, and so the affidavit will be excluded.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Occupy Columbia v.
