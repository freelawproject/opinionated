Things changed with Commerce's adoption of its PRC-wide entity policy, see Import Administration Policy Bulletin 05.1: Separate-Rates Practice and Application of Combination Rates in Antidumping Investigations involving Non-Market Economy Countries (Apr. 5, 2005), which effectively enables Commerce to make an affirmative less than fair value determination even though all individually investigated mandatory respondents receive de minimis margins, which is what happened in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   , 76 Fed. Reg. at 64,322. Non-participating companies were deemed non-cooperative and assumed to be part of a government-controlled PRC-wide entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They were assigned the highest calculated transaction-specific rate among mandatory respondents, 58.84 percent, as total adverse facts available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite no direct evidence of dumping, Commerce here imposed an antidumping duty order on multilayered flooring from the PRC based on indirect evidence (an adverse inference) against the PRC-wide entity. Lumber Liquidators' argument that Commerce must terminate the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   never comes to terms with this aspect of Commerce's affirmative determination. They fail to challenge either the PRC-wide entity policy or the PRC-wide rate.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Lumber Liquidators Cmts. The court therefore must sustain Commerce's decision to deny Lumber Liquidators' request that Commerce terminate the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Commerce ultimately did exclude the mandatory respondents from the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   . To derive the separate rate, Commerce averaged the zero rates assigned to the mandatory respondents under the \"expected method\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fifth Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 8. The question is whether that zero percent \"all-others rate\", 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673d(c)(1)(B)(i)(ll), 1673d(c)(5), constitutes \"any\" de minimis weighted average dumping margin that Commerce must \"disregard\" pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The term \"any\" is broad, and the \"all-others rate\" is just a proxy for the individual weighted average dumping margins Commerce, in theory, should calculate for all respondents pursuant to \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(1) (which, as noted above, is rare in practice). Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement also speaks in broad terms, requiring \"immediate termination in cases where the authorities determine that the margin of dumping is de minimis....\" Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, art. 5.8. It is entirely possible, therefore, that Congress intended Commerce to disregard a zero percent all-others rate (and\n   exclude the separate rate respondents from the final affirmative dumping determination). At the same time, however, the \"all-others rate\" is derivative in nature, and because it has general applicability to all non-examined separate rate respondents, it is not really quite as \"specific\" as what is contemplated by the \"weighted average dumping margin\" of \u00a7 1677(35)(B), or an \"individual\" weighted average dumping margin of \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That means there is some free play in the statute. And that, in turn, implicates the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , under which the court must defer to Commerce's permissible construction of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p842\">\n    467 U.S. at 842-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p842\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Eurodif S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679347\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/305/#p316\">\n    555 U.S. at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679347\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/305/#p316\">\n    129 S.Ct. 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (An agency's \"interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of language that is ambiguous.\"):\n   <em>\n    Wheatland Tube Co. v.

Cir. 2007) (To determine whether Commerce's interpretation is reasonable, the court \"may look to 'the express terms of the provisions at issue, the objectives of those provisions, and the objectives of the antidumping scheme as a whole.' \"). The court cannot conclude that Commerce's desire to treat \"exclusion as an extraordinary measure, and one that should only be available in limited circumstances to companies that have been subject to individual investigation and all that entails (i.e., providing full and complete questionnaire responses, cooperating with the Department, subject to verification, etc.)\",\n   <em>\n    Fifth Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 25, unreasonably resolves ambiguous statutory language, or advances a policy prescription at odds with the antidumping statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The separate rate respondents argue that Commerce waited too long over the course of the litigation to apply the exclusion regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Armstrong Cmts. at 2-3; Fine Furniture Cmts. at 14-19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17 (highlighting that plaintiffs expressly requested exclusion from the order as part of their initial Complaint, subsequent motions for summary judgment on the agency record, in their comments and briefing on the prior remand redeterminations, and in oral argument before the Federal Circuit). Defendant acknowledges that plaintiffs raised the issue of exclusion early on, but avers that Commerce was not squarely presented with the issue of whether separate rate plaintiffs should be excluded from the order until the\n   <em>\n    Fifth Remand Results\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 9-10 (\"We acknowledge that certain separate rate plaintiffs have long taken the position that they should be excluded from the order. But it was not necessary for Commerce to evaluate the merits of plaintiffs' argument until the Federal Circuit reversed this Court's judgment and Commerce assigned a zero margin to the separate rate plaintiffs.\" (internal citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court understands that it would have been preferable if Commerce had raised the exclusion regulation before the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Hawd VI\n   </em>\n   , and explained that there would be no substantive effect to assigning the separate rate respondents a zero percent margin. That omission, however inefficient, does not invalidate the regulation or mute its operation. It was duly promulgated in 1997 and carries the force of law. What does give the court pause, however, is Commerce's application of the exclusion regulation to the Voluntary Applicants. Given the history of the exclusion regulation in which concerns about limiting exclusion to selected/mandatory respondents were mitigated through the availability of voluntary examination,\n   there is an inherent arbitrariness in Commerce (1) issuing a blanket refusal to entertain voluntary examination requests, and (2) subsequently denying exclusion to the Voluntary Applicants that were assigned a \"representative\" separate rate of zero (which again, is just a proxy for the individual weighted average dumping margins Commerce should theoretically calculate for all respondents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant notes that the Voluntary Applicants did not challenge Commerce's respondent selection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 12, 22 (explaining that Commerce's respondent selection decisions have not been challenged). Although they chose not to appeal Commerce's refusal to conduct any voluntary examinations, the Voluntary Applicants may nevertheless challenge Commerce's separate and distinct decision denying them exclusion from the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   . That determination (like many Commerce determinations), just happens to comprise numerous other decisions Commerce made through the course of the proceeding: mandatory respondent selection, treatment of voluntary examination requests, the calculation of each of the mandatory respondents' margins, and the calculation of the separate rate, among others. Commerce's determination that resource constraints precluded voluntary examinations may itself have been reasonable. Having made that decision, Commerce's subsequent decision to refuse to exclude Voluntary Applicants assigned a zero percent margin is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Commerce's exclusion regulation requires individual examination for exclusion because, as a policy matter, it wants to confirm that a specific party is not in fact dumping. That policy carries a corresponding inference or assumption that a party is trading unfairly unless it can demonstrate with its own direct evidence that it is not. In explaining the enactment history of the exclusion regulation, Commerce acknowledged that \"the revised statutory language and regulations allowed for companies not selected for individual examination to request participation as voluntary respondents.\"\n   <em>\n    Fifth Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court believes Commerce's application of its exclusion regulation to the Voluntary Applicants it assigned \"representative\" zero percent margins has two insurmountable problems. The first is Commerce's refusal to conduct any voluntary examinations, preventing the Voluntary Applicants from demonstrating directly their own evidence of fair trading. The second is Commerce's continuing assumption or inference that Voluntary Applicants denied individual examination and ultimately assigned a \"representative\" zero percent margin were nevertheless unfairly trading, precluding exclusion. The court questions how a reasonable mind could maintain such an assumption or inference against the Voluntary Applicants. With that said, the court does believe there is a material difference between those separate rate respondents that requested voluntary examination, and those that did not. In the court's view, those that did not cannot overcome the regulation and the underlying inference/assumption that they were unfairly trading despite being assigned the same \"representative\" zero percent margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As for remedy, the court typically remands for further consideration when it identifies unreasonableness or arbitrariness in agency decision-making.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harry T. Edwards &amp; Linda A. Elliott,\n   <em>\n    Federal Standards of Review\n   </em>\n   276-77 (3d ed. 2018) (\"When a court finds that an agency action\n   is arbitrary and capricious, it will normally remand the case to the agency for further consideration.... Thus when an administrative action is found to be arbitrary and capricious, an agency has an opportunity to revisit its decision and provide an adequate justification or reach a different conclusion.\"). Here, though, too much time has passed for Commerce to individually examine the Voluntary Applicants. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Hawd Flooring Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3966841\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/44/1376/#p1390\">\n    44 F.Supp.3d 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1390 (2015) (\"while Commerce retains the discretion to reasonably reopen the record, its decision to conduct a full individual investigation of Changzhou Hawd at such a late date is arbitrary and capricious\"). Also, this is the\n   <em>\n    seventh\n   </em>\n   court decision, reviewing the\n   <em>\n    sixth\n   </em>\n   administrative determination. And there may well be an appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A final judgment moves this action toward final resolution. The court does not believe a remand for reconsideration is necessary. Instead, the court believes the proper remedy is entry of judgment declaring Commerce's failure to exclude the Voluntary Applicants arbitrary, and directing Commerce to exclude them from the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court sustains Commerce's decision (1) denying Lumber Liquidators' request to terminate the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , and (2) denying exclusion from the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   for the separate rate respondents that did not request voluntary examination. For the Voluntary Applicants, the court determines that Commerce arbitrarily applied its exclusion regulation, 19C.F.R. \u00a7 351.204(e)(1), and will enter judgment ordering Commerce to exclude them from the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   . Judgment will enter accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The court finds unpersuasive Defendant and Changzhou Hawd's arguments about Commerce's prior practice for dealing with exclusion from an order (albeit disagreeing about what that practice is). Commerce reaches back to a 28-year old determination in which Commerce did not exclude respondents assigned an \"all-others\" rate of zero.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fifth Remand Results\n    </em>\n    at 12 (citing\n    <em>\n     Certain Small Business Telephone Systems and Subassemblies Thereof from Taiwan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Fed.%20Reg.%2042%2C543\">\n     54 Fed.

Changzhou Hawd identifies one prior determination in which Commerce appears to have treated respondents assigned a de minimis \"all-others\" rate as though they were excluded despite a final affirmative determination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Changzhou Hawd Cmts. at 5-7 (citing\n    <em>\n     Certain Automotive Replacement Glass Windshields from the People's Republic of China\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%2070%2C294\">\n     72 Fed.

Therefore, the court has not found either administrative determination to be helpful or informative.
