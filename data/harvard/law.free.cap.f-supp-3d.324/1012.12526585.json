(Doc. 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2015, an officer from the Missouri Highway Patrol provided, under oath, a probable cause statement seeking the arrest of a Matthew Smith who was born in 1985 and had an address in Perryville, Missouri (\"1985 Smith\"). (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 9.) The statement provided that the Matthew Smith sought was 30 years of age, and it contained the 1985 Smith's Social Security Number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pursuant to the probable cause statement, an information was filed in the Circuit Court of Wayne County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Garrison is the Circuit Clerk of Wayne County, Missouri. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Defendant Yount is an employee of the Office of the Circuit Clerk of Wayne County, Missouri. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). On September 8, 2015, Defendant Garrison, Defendant Yount, or another one of Defendant Garrison's employees completed a warrant or warrant application for the arrest of a Matthew Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11-12.) Defendant Garrison's duty and his employees'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   duty was simply to type the information from the probable cause statement and information into the arrest warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). However, when completing the warrant application, instead of using the information in the probable cause statement and the information identifying the 1985 Smith, Defendant Yount or Defendant Garrison inserted the birth date and age of Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13-14.) Plaintiff's birthdate is in 1961, his address at that time was in St. Charles, Missouri, and his age was 54. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.) An arrest warrant was issued, and the 1985 Smith was arrested and posted bond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 23, 2015, another arrest warrant for the 1985 Smith was authorized in the same proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) Instead of issuing an arrest warrant for the 1985 Smith as listed in the probable cause statement and information, Defendant Yount, Defendant Garrison, or someone from Defendant Garrison's office issued a second warrant application seeking the arrest and jailing of Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Defendant Garrison signed the warrant containing the erroneous information without reviewing its accuracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) Defendant Garrison did not provide any training to his employees regarding the proper method of entering data from an information or probable cause statement into a warrant application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) The warrant application was presented to the Circuit Court of Wayne County without notice that the data in it had been changed and was different from the data in the information and probable cause statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). The warrant was issued based upon the erroneous data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An employee of the Office of the Sheriff for Wayne County entered the warrant for the arrest of Plaintiff into MULES and other police-used communications that seek the arrest and detention of individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Defendant Dean Finch is the Sheriff of Wayne County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). There is no custom or practice in Defendant Finch's office to review or provide for the accuracy of information in arrest warrants when the information is entered into MULES. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October of 2015, Plaintiff was travelling internationally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) On October 30, 2015, Plaintiff returned from Hong Kong, arriving at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) Because of the arrest warrant, the United States Customs Service detained Plaintiff as he was going through customs and turned him over to the Chicago Police Department (\"Chicago PD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Chicago PD representatives and the attorney then representing Plaintiff contacted the Wayne County Sheriff's Department that afternoon to request confirmation that the warrant seeking Plaintiff's arrest was valid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.) Defendant Stacey Sikes was on duty at the Wayne County Sheriff's Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She did not undertake any review of the warrant but advised the Chicago PD that Plaintiff should be held without bail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Chicago PD placed Plaintiff in the Cook County Jail until a court hearing could be held. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.) The next afternoon, on October 31, 2015, Plaintiff's attorney, officials from the Cook County Prosecutor's Office, and/or representatives of the Chicago PD contacted the Wayne County Sheriff's Department a second time to request confirmation that the arrest warrant for Plaintiff was valid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) This time, the representative undertook a review of the warrant and informed the Chicago PD that it was erroneous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was subsequently released. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was never charged with possession of illegal drugs, was never on bail, and had no charges pending against him in Wayne County or any other jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   acts were outrageous and done with malice, or in the alternative were willful and wanton and done with a conscious disregard for Plaintiff's rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts seven claims: (I) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Defendants Finch and Sikes; (II) violation of the Missouri Sunshine Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20610.010\">\n    Mo.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the instant motion, Defendants argue that Counts V, VI, VII, and VIII should be dismissed for several reasons. First, Defendants argue that any official capacity claims against Defendant Yount are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 and are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Second, Defendants argue that Count V (Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim) is barred by absolute quasi-judicial immunity. Third, Defendant Garrison argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Defendant Garrison in Count V because an official cannot be held vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of his subordinates under \u00a7 1983, because Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support a failure to train or supervise claim against Defendant Garrison, and because Plaintiff's allegations against Defendant Garrison amount to, at most, negligence. Fourth, Defendants argue Count V is barred by qualified immunity. Fifth, Defendants argue that Count VI (negligence) and Count VII (false imprisonment) are barred by Missouri's judicial immunity doctrine. Sixth, Defendants argue that Count VI (negligence) is barred by the public duty doctrine. Seventh, Defendants argue that Count VII (false imprisonment) and Count VIII (ultra vires acts) should be dismissed because Plaintiff has alleged no more than negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. To the Extent that Plaintiff Is Asserting Claims Against Defendant Yount in Her Official Capacity, Those Claims Are Dismissed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the caption of his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff states that he is bringing the action against \"Laura Yount, individually and in her official capacity...\" In their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss, Defendants argue that any official capacity claims against Defendant Yount are not cognizable and are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and they\n   provide case law to support that assertion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63, at 5-6. In his response to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff provides no opposition to Defendants' argument; instead, he states that he \"does not seek relief from Defendants Garrison and Yount in their official capacities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 70, at 8, n.1. Plaintiff also states that to the extent that he needs to clarify the capacity in which he is suing Defendant Yount, he requests leave to amend his complaint to provide such clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In light of Plaintiff's acknowledgment that he does not seek relief from Defendant Yount in her official capacity, the Court finds that any official capacity claims against Defendant Yount in the Second Amended Complaint should be dismissed. The Court finds no need for Plaintiff to file yet another amended complaint to clarify this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count V Is Not Barred by Absolute Quasi-Judicial Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Count V, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' actions with regard to his arrest warrant violated his constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983. As discussed above, Plaintiff brings this claim against Defendants in their individual capacities. Defendants argue that this claim should be dismissed because it is barred by absolute quasi-judicial immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Absolute quasi-judicial immunity derives from absolute judicial immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

These circumstances fall into two general categories. First, absolute quasi-judicial immunity may apply to individuals who conduct adjudicative proceedings similar to those conducted by judges, such as members of state boards and commissions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilliam v.

Second, absolute quasi-judicial immunity may apply to court employees or other government employees when they perform acts closely related to the judicial function, such as carrying out a judge's order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

Compl., Doc. 49, \u00b6 30.) However, Plaintiff has not made any allegations to suggest that there was a pattern of unconstitutional acts committed by Defendant Garrison's employees or that Defendant Garrison received any notice of such a pattern. He has also not alleged any other facts plausibly suggesting that Defendant Garrison had notice that his training procedures were inadequate and likely to result in a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court notes that this is not a case where it was \"patently obvious\" that the supervisor needed provide the training at issue. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant Garrison and his employees \"are required and it is their duty to simply type and put the verified and sworn information in the probable cause statement and Information into the arrest warrant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). This is a simple procedure that appears to require nothing more than typing information from one document into a second document. It would not have been \"patently obvious\" to Defendant Garrison that he would need to train his employees not to alter the data in the probable cause statement or information before inserting it into the warrant, nor would it have been patently obvious to Defendant Garrison that he would need to train his employees not to enter information from individuals other than those described in the Probable Cause Statement or Information. Any reasonable employee would understand that he or she was not permitted to fill out an arrest warrant using information for an individual not described in the probable cause statement. Because Defendant Garrison was not on notice of any pattern of misconduct, and because there was no obvious need to train his employees in order to avoid the constitutional violations at issue, Defendant Garrison is not liable based on a failure to train or supervise theory.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637535\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/340/#p355\">\n    700 F.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a sheriff was not liable based on a failure to train or supervise theory where the sheriff's subordinates fabricated evidence; stating that there was no \"patently obvious need\" to train employees not to fabricate evidence and noting that \"any reasonable DCCSI employee would know fabricating evidence was unacceptable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For all of the above reasons, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Defendant Garrison based on a failure to train or supervise theory, and that claim will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff Has Alleged More than Mere Negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against them under \u00a7 1983, because Plaintiff's allegations amount to nothing more than negligence, which is not sufficient to sustain a claim under \u00a7 1983.

Based on the facts as alleged, this is not simply a case where someone failed to notice a detail while reading a document or made a typographical error while entering a name or date. Plaintiff's allegations indicate that Defendants had in their possession a probable cause statement containing accurate identifying information for a particular individual, and it was their duty to type that information into an arrest warrant for that individual. However, instead of simply typing that information the arrest warrant, Defendants ignored that information and (for some unknown reason) went out of their way to find the identifying information of a different, 54-year-old individual, and then used\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   identifying information to create an arrest warrant. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants did this without reviewing the warrant or verifying that the information they were typing into the arrest warrant was the same as the information in the probable cause statement on which they were supposed to be relying. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants' acts were done with malice or, in the alternative, were willful, wanton, and done with a conscious disregard for Plaintiff's rights. These allegations, taken as true and without additional context, are sufficient to suggest a plausible claim that Defendants may have acted in at least a reckless manner. Thus, Plaintiff's argument that Count V should be dismissed because it alleges only negligence is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court acknowledges that additional details and context obtained through discovery may demonstrate that Defendants' actions amounted to no more than negligence. However, based on the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has stated a claim under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Department policy required that the personal property be immediately inventoried, recorded, and stored in a property bag.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the officers placed the property in an open wooden box on a counter accessible to the public for about 45 minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the plaintiff left the police station the next morning, his watch was missing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Missouri Supreme Court held that the public duty doctrine did not protect the officers from a negligence claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206. It reasoned that \"[a]lthough inventorying property may serve public purposes, such as the correct identification of arrestees, its primary purpose is to account for an arrestee's property in order that all lawful property not kept as evidence is returned upon release.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' actions were only negligent, the Court agrees with Defendants that the public duty doctrine applies and bars liability here. Like the lab technicians in\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   , when Defendants were discharging (or failing to discharge) their duty to accurately transpose information from a probable cause statement or information into a warrant application, their task was not performed for the primary purpose of protecting any individual person's right not to be arrested. Instead, the primary purpose of that task was to serve the state's and the public's interest in law enforcement-specifically, its interest in arresting individuals for whom probable cause to arrest exists. In addition, like the task being carried out by the lab technicians in\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' task here fell squarely within their duties to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, because Plaintiff has alleged more than mere negligence, the Court cannot say that Count VI is entirely barred by the public immunity doctrine. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants' acts were done with malice or, in the alternative, were willful, wanton, and done with a conscious disregard for Plaintiff's rights. This is sufficient to allege bad faith or malice that takes this claim outside of the protections of the public duty doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheeler v.

The Court disagrees. Assuming, arguendo, that it is necessary for Plaintiff to prove Defendants' knowledge that the information was false in order to prevail on his false imprisonment claim, Plaintiff has adequately alleged such knowledge through his allegations that Defendants' actions were \"willful\" and done with malice.
