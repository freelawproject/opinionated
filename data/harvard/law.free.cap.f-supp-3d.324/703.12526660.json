Payne, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on DEFENDANTS' RULE 12(b) (6) MOTION TO DISMISS (ECF No. 7). For the following reasons, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Denise Penn and Houstonia Clymer filed this action against Defendants, 1st Southern Insurance Services, Inc., George Roberts, and Fran Pless, for their failure to procure proper insurance coverage for Jimmy Barker and Barker &amp; Son Forestry Services, Inc. Defendants have moved for dismissal of the Complaint (ECF No. 1) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Context (As Set Forth in the Complaint)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following factual overview is based on the allegations in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case arises out of an insurance policy selected and placed by Defendants on behalf of Jimmy Barker and Barker &amp; Son Forestry Services, Inc. (collectively \"Barker\"). Compl. *1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants contracted with Barker to advise as to the kinds and amount of insurance that Barker had to purchase under\n   applicable law (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for a trucking business operating in at least four states) and to select and place that insurance. Compl. *6-8. Barker had no special experience in insurance matters and therefore relied entirely on Defendants and their promised expertise for the selection and placement of insurance. Compl. *4. Barker's reliance arose, at least in part, from Defendants' claimed experience in insuring truckers. Compl. *4. Defendants were aware that Barker counted on them to secure all required insurance. Compl. *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendants selected and placed a policy that did not meet mandatory minimum financial responsibility federal trucking standards. Compl. *5. That policy did not contain a MCS-90 endorsement, and it failed to satisfy coverage minimums. Compl. *5. As to the latter deficiency, the minimum financial responsibility protection required under federal law is $750,000 in liability coverage, but the policy provided only $100,000. Compl. *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Penn and Clymer were severely injured in an accident caused by Justin Colvard, while he was driving a truck for Barker. Compl. *2. That accident occurred while the policy at issue here was in effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. *2-5. Thereafter, Penn and Clymer secured judgments against the Barker &amp; Son business in the Circuit Court of Brunswick County, Virginia. Compl. *2. Penn was awarded damages in the amount of $2,450,000. Compl. *2. Clymer was awarded damages in the amount of $275,000. Compl. *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The insurer refused to pay the additional amount required to meet minimum insurance standards under federal law ($650,000).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. *2-3. Barker, therefore, assigned all of its rights against Defendants to Penn and Clymer, who now sue Defendants for their failure to provide proper guidance and for failure to obtain proper coverage for Barker. Compl. *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Additional Factual Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants allege that the Complaint omits a substantial amount of relevant information. Defs.' Br. 2, 4-5. This information is discussed here, although whether it can be considered in resolving Defendants' motion shall be addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants observe that the policy at issue was \"procured and issued in\n   <em>\n    2004\n   </em>\n   for a policy period that terminated in\n   <em>\n    2005\n   </em>\n   .\" Defs.' Br. 2. Furthermore, they claim that the accident in which Penn and Clymer were injured occurred on August 2, 2005. Defs.' Br. 2, 4-5. And, they note that the policy at issue was previously considered by this Court in a declaratory judgment action in 2007 (to which Penn and Clymer were parties).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 5. In a ruling affirmed by the Fourth Circuit in 2009, this Court found that the policy provided only $100, 000 in liability coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 2, 5. To support those factual claims, Defendants attach as exhibits: (1) the declarations pages of the policy at issue; (2) the complaint in the declaratory judgment action (which itself includes a copy of the policy); (3) the answers filed by Penn and Clymer in that action; (4) the district court's final order in that action; and (5) the Fourth Circuit's opinion affirming the district court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The procedural history in this case is short. Penn and Clymer filed their Complaint on November 11, 2017. They alleged six claims: Count I-breach of contract; Count II-breach of oral contract; Count III-breach of implied contract;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Count IV-negligence; Count V-professional negligence; and Count VI-direct negligence (against Penn and Clymer personally). After Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, Counts IV (negligence) and VI (direct negligence) were dismissed by agreement. ORDER (ECF No. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS GOVERNING MOTIONS TO DISMISS UNDER FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The standards governing motions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) are clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" When ruling on a motion to dismiss [pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ], courts must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs' factual allegations, taken as true, must \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" The plausibility standard is not a probability requirement, but \"asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\" Although it is true that \"the complaint must contain sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face, it nevertheless need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it rests.\" Thus, we have emphasized that \"a complaint is to be construed liberally so as to do substantial justice.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Hall v. DIRECTV, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/757/#p765\">\n    846 F.3d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765 (4th Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants argue,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that all counts are barred by applicable statutes of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 2. The Court agrees and therefore grants Defendants' motion on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A preliminary matter involves which state's law governs the relevant issues in this case. There is no dispute between the parties that Virginia law governs the statutes of limitations questions at issue here (including when a claim accrues), and the Court concurs in the parties' assessment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 5; Pls.' Opp'n 4 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Relevant Statutes of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under Virginia law, for actions upon a written contract, the limitations period is five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-246\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). For actions upon an unwritten contract, the statute of limitations is three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-246\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.01-246(4). For professional negligence claims, the limitations period is the same as for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Browning v. Tiger's Eye Benefits Consulting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883556\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/313/656/#p664\">\n    313 F.

Va. July 23, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The remaining claims involve only breach of contract and professional negligence. Consequently, the applicable limitations period is, at most, five years. The parties do not dispute this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 7-8, 13; Pls.' Opp'n 4 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Accrual\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The main dispute in this case involves when the claims accrued. Defendants argue that the statutes of limitations began to run no later than 2004, when the inadequate policy was issued. Defs.' Br. 8, 12-13. They also note that, even using the date of Penn and Clymer's accident (in 2005) or the date that the declaratory judgment\n   action was resolved (in 2009) as the accrual date, Penn and Clymer's claims are time barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 9, 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Penn and Clymer respond that injury is necessary for a claim to accrue, and they contend that no injury occurred until the judgments in their favor were entered against Barker &amp; Son (less than one year before this action was filed) because, before that time, the insurer provided all that it had promised (by satisfying its duty to defend).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n 5-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants reply that injury occurred when the improper policy was issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply Br. 5-10. They also note that Penn and Clymer suffered another injury in 2005, when the accident occurred, because after that date Barker could not secure proper insurance to cover the accident. Defs.' Reply Br. 9. And, they observe that Penn and Clymer were again injured in 2009 when it was conclusively determined that the policy provided only $100, 000 in coverage. Defs.' Reply Br. 9. In short, Penn and Clymer suffered several injuries that triggered accrual long enough ago to render the claims untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Conclusion as to Accrual\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, it is clear that, for a claim to accrue, only a very slight injury is required. In the failure to procure insurance context, sufficient injury (and accrual) occurs when the duty to procure adequate insurance is violated in some fixed manner, such as when a deficient policy is signed or placed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The position of Penn and Clymer that no claim accrued until the judgments were entered against Barker &amp; Son cannot be supported, given the foregoing principles. Their primary argument is that \"no injury happened pre-judgment\" because the insurer never breached its duty to defend. Pls.' Opp'n 10-11. In particular, the argument seems to be that, because monetary losses caused by Defendants' failure to procure the proper policy were contingent upon Barker\n   <em>\n    losing\n   </em>\n   in court (after being defended by the insurer), no injury occurred until Barker in fact lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   That view, however, rests upon a misunderstanding of Virginia accrual law. As set out above, a claim accrues in the failure to procure insurance setting when a fixed violation of the duty to obtain insurance occurs, such as when a deficient insurance policy is issued. That is because only a slight injury as a result of the breach is necessary to trigger accrual. Loss of the \"bargain to receive [the] coverage\" sought is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204707464\">\n    2017 WL 4707464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To be sure,\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   injury occurred once judgments were entered against Barker &amp; Son and the insurer refused to pay more than the coverage limits of the inadequate policy. But, the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   injury occurred when Defendants saddled Barker with an insurance policy that did not contain the terms that Barker had contracted with Defendants and relied on them to obtain. It was at that point that Defendants' duty to procure insurance was violated and fixed injury occurred (given that Barker was now\n   bound by an insurance contract that did not meet its needs or expectations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is true that, as Penn and Clymer suggest, substantial damages were contingent until the judgments were entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n 10-11. But, that is of no moment, for two reasons. First, the Supreme Court of Virginia has expressly held that, \"[i]n case of a failure to issue a policy, the right to recover is fully matured when the agreement is violated, and the party to whom it was to be issued is not obliged to wait until his property is destroyed,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , until a covered loss occurs, \"before instituting an action for damages.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Autumn Ridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632981\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/435/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Thus, the \"contingency\" of a policy-triggering loss is irrelevant to when a claim for failure to procure insurance accrues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, it is clear that slight injury (even that which \"could not be delineated as a sum certain or reflected as a final judgment on the merits\") is sufficient, notwithstanding that the lion's share of damages are contingent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shipman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20S.E.2d%20319\">\n    593 S.E.2d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hence, in\n   <em>\n    Hensel Phelps\n   </em>\n   , injury was found to have occurred when the subcontractors performed deficient work, even though monetary losses were contingent on whether the prime contractor would be sued and settle (or lose).\n   <em>\n    Hensel Phelps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12646107\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/791/734/#p740\">\n    791 S.E.2d at 736-37, 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They omitted any and all references to time in their Complaint. Compl. *1-11. They even omitted such basic facts as when the policy over which they are suing was issued and when the accident in this case occurred. Compl. *1-11. They have also omitted reference to documents that might time-stamp the events depicted in their Complaint, such as the declaratory judgment decision. Compl. *1-11. Then, when Defendants proffer documents that establish the omitted timeline, Penn and Clymer (weakly) fight the documents' authenticity. Pls.' Opp'n 13-14. They seem to be hoping that, if they can bury their heads in the sand as to the statutes of limitations issue for long enough, it will go away. Unfortunately for them, it will not. And, Penn and Clymer have failed to hide the relevant timeline well enough to prevent the Court from considering it now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As set forth above, certain extrinsic documents may be considered on a motion to dismiss so long as the documents' authenticity is not questioned. Here, it is arguable that the authenticity of \"[t]he policy documents [Defendants] offer\" is disputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n 13. So, the Court will not consider those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   However, nothing in the Opposition submitted by Penn and Clymer suggests that they dispute any of the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   documents relied on by Defendants,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those that are not \"policy documents.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n 13-14. There seems to be no quarrel with, for example, the authenticity of the Fourth Circuit's opinion in the declaratory judgment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. F (\n   <em>\n    Canal Ins. Co v. Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849765\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/358/470/\">\n    358 F.

It is also independently central to the claims of Penn and Clymer because it resolved the coverage amounts provided by the policy at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. F 3 (\"The district court rejected Appellants' contention that Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-2143 or federal regulations would operate to increase the policy's limit to $750,000 ... and instead granted Canal's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings that the policy was limited to the face amount of $100,000 listed on its declaration page. We agree and affirm the judgment.\").\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Compl. *2 (\"But Barker's policy placed by [Defendants] provided only $100,000 in liability coverage, not the $750,000 minimum financial responsibility protection required under federal law.\"). Accordingly, and because the authenticity of the Fourth Circuit opinion is not disputed, the Court will consider that opinion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As discussed above, the Fourth Circuit opinion decided the actual coverage limits of the policy at issue in this case. Even if the policy was issued after coverage took effect, the issuance date could not have been subsequent to a judicial decision respecting its terms. And, the Fourth Circuit opinion made clear that the policy had been issued before the case was submitted for consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. F 3.
