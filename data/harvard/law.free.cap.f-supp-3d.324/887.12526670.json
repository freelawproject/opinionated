For the reasons discussed below, both motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS AND CLAIMS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The pending motions center on Defendant Prospect Funding Holdings, LLC's (\"Defendant\") efforts to recoup monies it loaned to Plaintiff Christopher Boling (\"Plaintiff\"). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mem. Law Opp'n Pl.'s Third Mot. Summ. J. Supp. Def's Second Cross-Mot. Summ. J. 1-7, DN 96 [hereinafter Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot.] ). The relevant facts are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed a personal injury lawsuit and, he used the prospective recovery from that suit as collateral to obtain and secure loans from Cambridge Management Group, LLC (\"CMG\") and Defendant over a four-year period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. Exs. A-D, DN 1-1 to 1-4). As this Court has previously noted, the transactions can be summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-13\"><strong>Date of Agreement</strong> <strong>Lender</strong> <strong>Amount of Loan &amp; Fees</strong> October 2009 CMG $10,000.00 plus fees of $1,075.00 plus additional costs March 2010 CMG $5,000.00 plus fees of $525.00 plus additional costs May 2012 Prospect $5,000.00 plus fees of $1,025.00 plus additional costs April 2013 Prospect $10.000.00 plus, fees of $1,800.00 plus additional costs</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. &amp; Order 2, DN 31; Berlin Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15, 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The loan agreements governing the transactions provided that Plaintiff would not become obligated to pay off the loans until he obtained a favorable settlement in his personal injury action. (Compl. Exs. A-D, F, DN 1-1 to 1-4, 1-6). The agreements further stated that each loan accrued interest at a rate of 4.9% per month, and that any disputes arising from: (1) the first two agreements were to be governed by New Jersey law and resolved via arbitration; (2) the third agreement was to be litigated in courts located in Hennepin County, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and (3) the fourth agreement would be litigated in New York County, New York. (Compl. Exs. A-D, F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Plaintiff obtained a favorable settlement in his personal injury action, Defendant notified him that he owed $340,304.00, thereby prompting him to file a declaratory judgment action in this Court. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45, DN 1). Specifically, Plaintiff sought a judgment declaring that: (1) Kentucky law governed his action, and (2) the loan agreements were void pursuant to Kentucky's prohibition on champerty and usurious interest rates. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant raised several counterclaims in response to the Complaint. In particular, it alleged that Plaintiff's failure to pay off the loans amounted to: a breach of contract, a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and conversion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.'s Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-48, 58-74). Defendant also asserted that, in the event the loan agreements were held unenforceable, it would be entitled to equitable relief-i.e., recoupment of the $30,000.00 it loaned to Plaintiff plus $4,625.00 in fees-pursuant to principles of unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel. (Def.'s Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court ultimately issued two judgments in Plaintiff's favor. In the first, this Court held that Kentucky law governed the interpretation and enforcement of the loan agreements. (Mem. Op. &amp; Order 10-14, DN 31). In the second, this Court found the loan agreements unenforceable due to Kentucky's prohibition on champerty and usurious interest rates, but nonetheless reasoned that Defendant could pursue its equitable claims in order to recoup the funds that it loaned to Plaintiff. (Mem. Op. &amp; Order 4-13, 16, DN 83). This Court also held that Defendant could pursue its claims for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and conversion. (Mem. Op. &amp; Order 4-13, 16, DN 83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Not long after this Court entered its two judgments, Plaintiff and Defendant filed\n   competing motions for summary judgment on Defendant's counterclaims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Third Mot. Summ. J. Mot. Att'ys' Fees &amp; Sanctions, DN 93-1 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot.]; Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot.). Plaintiff argued in his motion that Defendant's counterclaims fail as a matter of law, and that Defendant's \"gamesmanship\" through the course of this litigation entitles him to sanctions and fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 4-16). Defendant asserted that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of its counterclaims, and that Plaintiff's motion for sanctions is meritless. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 1-23). The motions are ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction of this matter based upon diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Counterclaims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties move for summary judgment on Defendant's remaining counterclaims. Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"[A] party moving for summary judgment may satisfy its burden [of showing] that there are no genuine issues of material fact simply 'by pointing out to the court that the [non-moving party], having had sufficient opportunity for discovery, has no evidence to support an essential element of his or her case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Minadeo v.

App'x 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 (6th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). To prevail on an unjust enrichment claim, the party seeking restitution must prove: \"(1) [a] benefit conferred upon [another at the claimant's] expense; (2) a resulting appreciation of benefit by [the other]; and (3) inequitable retention of benefit without payment for its value.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

App. 2009) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant claims that the undisputed facts show that it is entitled to recoup\n   the principal that it loaned to Plaintiff pursuant to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 1-2). Quite simply, Defendant contends that Plaintiff obtained a benefit at its expense-i.e., retention of the $30,000.00 Defendant loaned to him plus the costs associated with the loan that Plaintiff never repaid-and that Plaintiff's continued retention of said benefit is unjust. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 1-2; Berlin Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff appears to concede that Defendant has satisfied the elements of an unjust enrichment claim, but argues that Defendant's claim should nonetheless be denied for two reasons. First, Plaintiff contends that restitution is not available as a remedy to recoup benefits conferred under an\n   <em>\n    illegal\n   </em>\n   (as opposed to merely\n   <em>\n    unenforceable\n   </em>\n   ) contract. (Pl.'s Reply Supp. Third Mot. Summ. J. &amp; Resp. Def.'s Second Cross-Mot. Summ. J. 2-8, DN 100 [hereinafter Pl.'s Reply] ). Second, Plaintiff asserts that the doctrine of unclean hands bars Defendant's restitution request. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 9-11). The Court will address each argument separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Availability of Restitution/Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Defendant cannot seek restitution of the benefits it conferred under the loan agreements because those agreements are illegal. (Pl.'s Reply 2-8). The gist of Plaintiff's position is: (1) Kentucky law holds that a party to an illegal contract may not seek restitution of benefits conferred pursuant thereto; and (2) the loan agreements are illegal (as opposed to only unenforceable) because they provided for the exchange of illegal consideration: namely, the proceeds of Plaintiff's personal injury litigation. (Pl.'s Reply 2-8). Plaintiff relies on two cases in support of his position:\n   <em>\n    Cougler v. Fackler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    510 S.W.2d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1974), and\n   <em>\n    Varner v.

App. Dec. 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The decision in\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   arises from a most unusual, and somewhat salacious, set of facts. The defendant-a known prostitute-wanted to purchase a house, so the plaintiff (one of the defendant's recurring customers) entered into an oral agreement with her under which he promised to make the down payment on the house in her name in exchange for the house's deed.\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    510 S.W.2d at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the defendant refused to confer the deed, the plaintiff brought suit seeking recoupment of the down payment, and, at trial, the defendant testified that she provided the plaintiff with sexual favors in consideration for the down payment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, the Kentucky's highest court concluded that the defendant's entitlement to restitution turned on the question whether sexual favors constituted any part of the consideration for the bargain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Citing to Section 355 of the Restatement (First) of Contracts, the court reasoned that if an illegal act (i.e., sexual favors) formed part of the consideration for the agreement, then the agreement was\n   <em>\n    illegal\n   </em>\n   and the plaintiff could not seek restitution as a remedy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the court noted that if the bargain was legal but\n   <em>\n    unenforceable\n   </em>\n   under the statute of frauds as an oral agreement involving the exchange of land, then \"the remedy of restitution to prevent unjust enrichment\"\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be available\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the statute of frauds \"prohibits [that] remedy, or the purpose of the statute [of frauds] would be nullified by granting such a remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

The court also reasoned that, under\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff could not seek restitution because the statute that rendered the contract unenforceable (i.e., KRS 292.480(6) ) prohibited litigation as a means to obtain a remedy and therefore implicitly bars the remedy of restitution.\n   <em>\n    Varner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205952867\">\n    2017 WL 5952867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (alterations in original) (emphasis in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    510 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   18 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While the Court observes similarities between\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Varner\n   </em>\n   , and the case at bar, it disagrees that\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Varner\n   </em>\n   serve as an absolute bar to Defendant's restitution claim and therefore rejects Plaintiff's argument. The primary distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   is the obviousness of the illegality of the consideration. Consider: the illegality of prostitution was such a foregone conclusion that Kentucky's highest court did not cite any authority to support it, and this Court has no doubt that the parties in\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   knew that prostitution was illegal at the time the time of the purported bargain.\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10118406\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/510/16/\">\n    510 S.W.2d at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the illegality of litigation funding agreements was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a foregone conclusion at the time the parties entered into the loan agreements; in fact, it is\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   somewhat of an open question under Kentucky law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. &amp; Order 4-10, DN 83). This conclusion is underscored by the fact that this Court could not find a Kentucky state court decision addressing the issue and had to instead rely a federal decision of this Court \"\n   <em>\n    predict\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    ing\n   </em>\n   ] that the Kentucky Supreme Court would prohibit\" such agreements.

Indeed, \"general considerations of right and justice\" support the conclusion that a party who has entered into an agreement that calls for the exchange of obviously illegal consideration should not be allowed to recoup any benefits he conferred pursuant thereto. But those same considerations protect parties-such as Defendant-who enter into illegal contracts without any actual or imputed knowledge of the invalidity of the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to\n   <em>\n    Varner\n   </em>\n   , the Kentucky Court of Appeals' reliance on Comment A in Section 197 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts is noteworthy because that provision supports this Court's inclination to balance the equities. Section 197 provides that \"a party has no claim in restitution for performance that he has rendered under or in return for a promise that is unenforceable on grounds of public policy\n   <em>\n    unless denial of restitution would cause disproportionate forfeiture.\n   </em>\n   \" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 197, cmt. a. (emphasis added). In this instance, allowing Plaintiff to retain the $30,000.00 Defendant loaned to him-and to avoid payment of the fees associated with said loans-results in a disproportionate forfeiture. Plaintiff receives an enormous windfall at no cost whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that neither\n   <em>\n    Cougler\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Varner\n   </em>\n   forecloses Defendant from obtaining restitution in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 10-11). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Defendant's hands are unclean because: (1) the loan agreements violate Kentucky's prohibition on champerty; and (2) throughout the pendency (and after the resolution of) Plaintiff's declaratory judgment action, Defendant filed a number of lawsuits-including an action against Plaintiff and another against Plaintiff's attorney in the underlying personal injury action, Michael Breen (\"Breen\")-related to the loan agreements in a New Jersey state court. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The first instance of alleged misconduct does not bar Defendant from seeking restitution. As noted above, given the uncertainty under Kentucky law regarding the validity of loan agreement, it seems overly harsh to conclude that Defendant's violation of Kentucky's champerty laws is determinative of unclean hands. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. 10).

Shortly after Plaintiff filed this declaratory judgment action-and long before this Court entered judgments declaring that Kentucky law governed the agreements and that it was an appropriate forum in which to adjudicate Plaintiff's claims-Defendant initiated two lawsuits in New Jersey state court: (1) an action to compel arbitration against Plaintiff; and (2) an action for an accounting against Breen. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Third Mot. Summ. J. Mot. Att'ys' Fees &amp; Sanctions Exs. 2, 8, DN 93-2, 93-8). Given that the first two loan agreements provided that disputes arising from them would be submitted to arbitration and governed by New Jersey law, Defendant's filing of the first two actions cannot be deemed unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtin v.

B, \u00b6 3(a) (same); Compl. Ex. C, 1-2 (same); Compl. Ex D, 1-2 (same) ). Given that excusing Plaintiff from paying back the borrowed money would constitute an unjust result, the Court holds that the doctrine of promissory estoppel requires Plaintiff to pay Defendant the amount Defendant loaned to him ($30,000.00) plus the fees associated therewith ($4,625.00).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Negligent Misrepresentation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff also seems summary judgment on Defendant's negligent misrepresentation claim.

Given that this Court previously held that the loan agreements are unenforceable (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem.

First, Defendant filed an action to compel arbitration against Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Ex. 8). Second, Defendant initiated a lawsuit seeking an accounting from Breen. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Ex. 2). And third, Defendant filed suit against Breen on the ground that Breen breached contracts executed alongside the loan agreements. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Ex. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court finds that Defendant's alleged misconduct is not sufficiently unreasonable and vexatious to justify an award of attorney's fees in Plaintiff's favor. As previously noted, Defendant was justified in filing the first two lawsuits, as both were filed prior to the order holding that this Court was an appropriate forum in which to adjudicate Plaintiff's claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Exs. 2, 8; Mem. Op. &amp; Order, DN 31). Further, the Court finds it hard to believe that Defendant \"multiplie[d] the proceedings\" in Plaintiff's case by filing a lawsuit against Breen. Accordingly, the Court will not award Plaintiff attorney's fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   1.
