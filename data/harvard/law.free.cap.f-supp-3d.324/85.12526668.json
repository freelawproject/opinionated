Through that election, sprinkler fitters employed by construction company AFP Specialties Inc. (\"AFP\") decisively voted out Local 669 as their representative for collective-bargaining\n   purposes. Although federal courts generally lack subject matter jurisdiction over Board orders emanating from representation proceedings, Local 669 argues that the Court has jurisdiction under the narrow exception announced in\n   <em>\n    Leedom v.

As explained below, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Leedom\n   </em>\n   exception does not apply. As such, the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this matter and will grant the Board's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 11). It will also deny as moot Local 669's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 13) and Corrected Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
