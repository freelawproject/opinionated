D.C. area who uses screen reading software to navigate the Internet. Dkt. 11 at 2. Defendant FedFinancial Federal Credit Union (\"FFCU\") is a community-based, not-for-profit, member-owned, federally-chartered credit union with a branch in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 13 at 2.

Plaintiff alleges that he attempted to access Defendant's website to learn about the credit union's services and locations, but was denied equal access to the website due to numerous accessibility barriers, including linked images missing alternative text, redundant links, and empty or missing form labels.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Because of these access barriers, Plaintiff was deterred from using Defendant's website and from visiting Defendant's credit union location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint (Dkt. 13) is now before the Court. Defendant seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's claims due to lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, and failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 13 at 1.

Dkt. 8 at 3. Defendant acknowledges that its field of membership includes individuals employed in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas, that some of its members do actually reside in Virginia, and that it sends mailings to those Virginia members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"FedFinancial has a total of 6,240 members and 298 of those members live in Virginia.\"). However, because Defendant does not directly advertise to Virginia residents for\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   members, and because its only branch office is located in Silver Spring, Maryland, Defendant argues that personal jurisdiction does not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Courts can exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant only if such jurisdiction is authorized by the long-arm statute of the state in which the district court sits and application of the relevant long-arm statute is consistent with the Due Process clause.\n   <em>\n    Thousand Oaks Barrel Co., LLC v.

The Fourth Circuit adopted a \"sliding scale\" approach under which a state can exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant when the defendant (1) directs electronic activity into the State; (2) with the manifested intent of engaging in business or other interactions within the State; and (3) that activity creates, in a person within the State, a potential cause of action cognizable in the State's courts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417223\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/707/#p713\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417223\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/707/#p713\">\n    at 715-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the facts giving rise to Plaintiff's claims involve Defendant's website, on which Defendant holds itself out as providing services to federal employees and their family members \"located in the\n   <em>\n    Washington, D.C.\n   </em>\n   and Baltimore, M.D.\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Areas.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 2 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   https://www.fedfinancial.org/history-and-mission. Defendant posts information on its website with the intent of targeting members or potential members of its credit union, groups which undeniably include Virginia readers. Furthermore, Defendant acknowledges that it has approximately 298 members who reside in Virginia. This, in combination with Defendant's admitted mailing of advertisements to the Virginia residents who are members in its credit union, is sufficient to establish minimum contacts to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction, and to show that Defendant could have reasonably anticipated being brought into court in Virginia for claims arising from its services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thousand Oaks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267742\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/708/#p714\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   717 n.8 (\"The fact that Deep South Barrels admits to having 251 customers in Virginia, even though that is a small percentage of its total customer base, shows a consistent level of contact\n   with Virginia residents.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeil v.

Va. June 16, 2017) (noting the importance, in a specific jurisdiction analysis, of posts directed at Virginia or Virginia users).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court thus turns to the second prong of the analysis, and finds that exercising jurisdiction over Defendant is constitutionally reasonable. The burden for Defendant to litigate in Virginia is minimal, Virginia has an interest in protecting its citizens from discrimination, and Plaintiff has an interest in obtaining relief here, as Virginia is his home state and the location from which he was allegedly prevented from acquiring information about Defendant's services and branch location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332093\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/435/#p440\">\n    92 F.Supp.3d at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Thus the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in Virginia, and venue is proper in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    c. Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can be Granted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a third proposed basis for dismissal, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for several reasons. First, Defendant asserts that its website is fully compliant with the requirements of the ADA. Second, even if the website is not compliant, Defendant asserts that Title III does not apply because Title III is limited to physical spaces. Third, Defendant argues that applying private sector web accessibility guidelines to the FFCU website would violate Due Process. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Compliance with Guidance from the Department of Justice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, Defendant argues that its website is, in fact, accessible to the visually-impaired. Defendant argues that it has complied with the method suggested by the Department of Justice in its 2010 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in that Defendant's website \"contains a link at the top of the page to 'Convenient Support' and a phone number ... to contact the credit union.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 15. However, the question of whether Defendant provides effective communication to visually-impaired persons through alternative means is an affirmative defense, and that inquiry is not ripe for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Access Now, Inc. v.

And Defendant's argument ignores the fact that Plaintiff has been denied equal access to information that would enable him to visit Defendant's brick-and-mortar location. For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has successfully stated a claim for a violation of Title III arising from the access barriers on Defendant's website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that applying private sector web content guidelines (specifically,\n   the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   would violate Due Process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19 at 3.
