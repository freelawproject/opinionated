Rule 16 Discovery Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Castro, Rule 16 requires the United States to disclose additional discovery. (Docket No. 51.) Pursuant to Rule 16, \"the government must permit the defendant to inspect [\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , documents and photographs] or copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control\" and \"the item is material to preparing the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"A showing of materiality requires 'some indication' that pretrial disclosure of the information sought 'would have enabled the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his [or her] favor.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263377\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/40/#p44\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263377\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/40/#p44\">\n    at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

District courts possess broad discretion in deciding motions to compel discovery.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"153690\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/511/757/#p763\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"In order to uphold a district court's denial of a request for additional discovery, we do not demand epistemological certainty that no discoverable information was withheld from the defendant.\") (internal citation omitted). If \"a defendant's discovery request is grounded in a speculative theory,\" for example, \"a district court's decision to deny that request is not an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"153690\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/511/757/#p763\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Castro seeks the disclosure of: (1) \"All Bureau of Prison Records pertaining to any and all alleged co-conspirators,\" (2) the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") Attorney Visiting Log Book from 2015 to the present, (3) \"all surveillance images, still or video images of any and all inmates visited by [private investigator] Sherley Montilla between 2015 and the present where they are seen carrying binders,\" (4) all monitored Corr Links communications for federal inmates Carlos Mart\u00ednez-Rodr\u00edguez (\"Mart\u00ednez\"), Lu\u00eds Fuentes-Nazario, and Emmanuel Moyano-Rodr\u00edguez (\"Moyano\") from 2015 to the present, the (5) unredacted manual for the X-ray machine at MDC, (6) evidence of repairs or repair requests for the MDC X-ray machine, (7) surveillance video of Castro at MDC on July 30, 2016, and (8) the \"Original Copy of the images of alleged\n   contraband contained in binders on July 30, 2016.\" (Docket No. 51.) Moreover, Castro seeks information from the Rover A. Deyton Detention Facility in Lovejoy, Georgia regarding Castro's 2016 visit with federal inmate Moyano.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Castro's discovery requests are premised on speculation. For instance, Castro claims that \"monitored communications [from federal inmates] may be of an exculpatory/impeaching nature, in so far [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] as they should reflect a scheme wherein unsuspecting victims were used to allegedly smuggle cell phones for them, without knowledge.\" (Docket No. 51 at p. 5.) The Court cannot compel disclosure of discovery based on Castro's presumption that communications \"should,\" or may contain information favorable to the defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stepus\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-30025,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201257804\">\n    2018 WL 1257804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2040027\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *8 (D. Mass. Mar. 12, 2018) (denying defendant's request for additional discovery because defendant \"relies on mere speculation to support his claim that his computer was vulnerable to a third party\"). Because Castro's discovery requests are based on speculation, the motion to compel is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court emphasizes that communication between the parties would address most of Castro's discovery requests, and obviate the need for judicial intervention in ongoing discovery disputes. (Docket No. 62.) Several discovery requests are moot. For instance, the United States claims that it \"has produced all surveillance video that MDC retained of July 30, 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. Also, the United States informed Castro that \"the redactions in the [X-ray] manual produced to the defendant are as they appear in the version the prison possesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The United States requested that Castro travel to MDC to inspect the requested BOP records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11.
