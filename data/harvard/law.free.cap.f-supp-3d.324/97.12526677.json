On July 25, 2018, Jones filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16. Because the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not made a showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his lawsuit, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jones alleges that the BOP has \"constantly and continuously denied [him] care for a serious medical need contrary to a physician's instruction.\" Dkt. 16 at 3. As the Court understands Jones's allegations, Jones injured his hand and wrist during an altercation in December 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. After being seen by BOP medical professionals, Jones complained of severe pain and swelling and eventually was admitted to the emergency room at Princeton Community Hospital in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His visit to the hospital revealed a bacterial infection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19 at 3. Although Jones does not discuss his treatment there, it appears he was successfully treated for the infection at the hospital and that he was discharged in February 2017. Dkt. 16 at 2. Upon his release, the treating physician suggested that Jones receive a course of \"physical therapy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From early 2017 onwards, Jones contends that the condition of his hand and wrist has continued to deteriorate and that prison staff has not \"provide[d] [him] physical therapy\" and has failed to \"provide or arrange an outside therapist,\" as purportedly directed by the emergency room physician.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, Dkt. 16, Jones seeks \"release from solitary confinement\" so that he can access both an \"orthopedic\" and \"infectious [disease]... specialist,\" and a \"prescription for a course of physical therapy\" that will \"restore and maintain the full function of his [r]ight arm and [r]ight wrist.\" Dkt. 16-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
