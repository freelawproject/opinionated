BYRON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This controversy arises out of Plaintiff Marcos R. Lopez's (\"\n   <strong>\n    Lopez\n   </strong>\n   \") campaign for Osceola County Sheriff in the November 2016 election. While blazing the campaign trail, Lopez's actions got him in hot water at work. As a result, he was demoted. Lopez then initiated this action against Defendant Russell Gibson (\"\n   <strong>\n    Sheriff Gibson\n   </strong>\n   \" or \"\n   <strong>\n    Defendant\n   </strong>\n   \"). Now before the Court are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment (Docs. 43, 44), responses (Docs. 48, 50), and a reply by Defendant (Doc. 52). With briefing complete, the matter is ripe. Upon consideration, Defendant Russell Gibson's Motion for Summary Judgment is due to be granted and Lopez's denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2003, Lopez was hired by the Osceola County Sheriff's Office (\"\n   <strong>\n    OCSO\n   </strong>\n   \") as a communications dispatcher. (Doc. 43-1, 18:20-22). Throughout the years, he moved up the OCSO ranks, culminating in his promotion to the rank of sergeant on June 6, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:21-30:19, 45:4-8). But Lopez had higher aspirations, and two days after his promotion, he launched a campaign for Osceola County Sheriff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:11-14). Lopez's two primary election opponents were Dave Sklarek and Defendant Russell Gibson, (Doc. 43-11, 26:10-13), neither of whom were OCSO employees in June 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The campaign was immediately contentious. Lopez announced his candidacy for Sheriff on Facebook. (Doc. 43-1, 42:24-43:14, 46:11-14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, two fellow OCSO officers-Sergeant John Pearce and Detective Albert Vazquez-made negative comments about his candidacy on Lopez's Facebook page. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:3-12, 68:1-9). The comments accused Lopez of, among other things, \"[s]tealing cable\" and publicizing a letter chiding the OCSO as racist for not promoting \"a Spanish person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Lopez responded by filing an internal report complaining about his co-workers' social media postings and accusing them of violating OCSO regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 196-99). After an initial inquiry, Captain Keith Parsons recommended an internal investigation be conducted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 201).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lieutenant Ryan Berry performed the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 202-19). He found that Lopez's hands were not entirely clean and informed Lopez that the investigation included his Facebook posts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83:15-84:8, p. 212). Following the completion of the investigation and submission of Lt. Berry's report on September 23, 2016, Lopez received a written reprimand for his own Facebook posts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 219).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sgt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pearce was also reprimanded, while Det. Vazquez was exonerated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 216-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lopez's problematic Facebook activity wasn't over. On August 12, 2016, then-OCSO-Sheriff Robert Hansell (\"\n   <strong>\n    Sheriff Hansell\n   </strong>\n   \") received a report that Lopez publicly criticized the OCSO on his Facebook page, prompting a new investigation headed up by Sergeant Steve Moser (\"\n   <strong>\n    Sgt. Moser\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 43-2, pp. 1-3). Sgt. Moser's investigation found that Lopez posted\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to his Facebook numerous posts and comments disparaging the OCSO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The investigation also concluded that Lopez disobeyed Sheriff Hansell's directive prohibiting Lopez from wearing his uniform in campaign-related social media posts. (Doc. 43-1, 127:8-132:18). In light of his abrasive campaigning, Sgt. Moser concluded that Lopez violated three separate OCSO Standards of Conduct. (Doc. 43-2, pp. 25-26).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subsequent Notice of Disciplinary Action recommended Lopez be punished with a demotion and a forty-hour suspension without pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lopez took up an appeal in front of the Career Service Appeals Board (\"\n   <strong>\n    CSAB\n   </strong>\n   \"), as afforded by Florida Law. Ch. 2000-388, Fla. Laws;\n   <em>\n    Leath v. Hansell\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:06-cv-896-Orl-19DAB, Doc. 39, p. 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20151869\">\n    2008 WL 151869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. Jan. 15, 2018). The CSAB panel was comprised of five panel members-two appointed by Sheriff Hansell, two appointed by Lopez, and the fifth selected by the other four panelists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ch. 2000-388, Laws of Florida; (Doc. 43-2, p. 36). The CSAB ultimately affirmed Lopez's demotion but overturned the forty-hour suspension. (Doc. 43-2, pp. 36-43). The CSAB's decision was final and binding on Lopez and the Sheriff. Ch. 2000-38, Laws of Florida. It appears Lopez did not appeal the CSAB's decision in Florida Circuit Court. Thus, in February 2017, Lopez was demoted to a deputy sheriff road patrol position with OCSO, where he remains employed. (Doc. 43-1, 41:3- 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After all this, Lopez instituted this action against Sheriff Gibson\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   on February 24, 2017, asserting two counts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of his First\n   (Count I) and Fourteenth Amendment rights (Count II). (Doc. 1, pp. 15-18). The gist of Lopez's First Amendment claim is that the campaign speech for which he was punished is protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment on both counts. (Doc. 43). Lopez opposes Defendant's motion as to his First Amendment claim, but \"agrees that his equal protection claim can be dismissed.\" (Doc. 50). Lopez also moves for summary judgment as to several non-dispositive issues, including that Plaintiff has standing and that Lopez's Facebook posts constitute protected political speech. (Doc. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Under the CSAB procedure prescribed by Florida law, Lopez handpicked two of the five panelists, had an opportunity to present his case and introduce evidence, and ultimately succeeded in overturning part of the discipline. Accordingly, CSAB's review easily meets the \"meaningful administrative review\" threshold, and Sheriff Gibson is not a final policymaker for municipal liability purposes. Lopez fails to show that the CSAB had defective procedures, \"rubber-stamped\" the Sheriff's decisions, or merely ratified the Sheriff's decisions and improper motive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maschmeier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566170\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/269/941/#p943\">\n    269 F. App'x at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lopez protests that the CSAB's review was not meaningful because its procedures were defective. First, Lopez argues that Sheriff Gibson has the exclusive authority to promote officers, and his failure to \"correct the unconstitutional discipline\" (by promoting Lopez to his pre-demotion position) renders Sheriff Gibson a final policymaker with respect to Lopez's demotion. (Doc. 50, p. 12). This argument fails because (1) the Complaint lacks a separate cause of action for Defendant's failure to re-promote Lopez, and (2) the authority to promote does not bear on whether Sheriff Gibson had final policymaking authority with respect to demotion decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, Lopez argues that the CSAB proceeding lacked sufficient due process protections, and therefore did not provide \"meaningful administrative review.\" (Doc. 50, pp. 12-15). Lopez, however, fails to cite caselaw supporting his contentions that a two-and-a-half-hour hearing is too brief to be meaningful, or that being denied counsel renders the proceeding \"defective.\" These complaints are therefore insufficient to support the conclusion that the CSAB's review was not meaningful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court likewise disagrees with Lopez's final point, that the denial of counsel and cross-examination at the CSAB hearing violate Florida law. Lopez complains that the CSAB's procedures failed to adhere to Florida Statutes \u00a7 30.076's due process guarantees. (Doc. 50, pp. 13-15). However, \u00a7 30.076 does not apply to Lopez's appeal of his demotion and suspension. Section 30.076(1) guarantees a deputy sheriff\n   <em>\n    facing termination\n   </em>\n   , among other things, the right to cross-examine witnesses testifying against them and the right to counsel at termination appeals hearings. Section 30.076(1) applies only to appeals of terminations, not demotions. Lopez attempts to bridge this gap by insisting that \u00a7 30.076 applies to terminations\n   <em>\n    of promotions\n   </em>\n   as well as normal terminations, relying on an unrelated subsection of another statute, \u00a7 30.073(3). (Doc. 50, p. 14). Lopez's importation of the broad \"termination\" definition from \u00a7 30.073(3) to avail himself of \u00a7 30.076's robust due process guarantees defies basic statutory construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Lopez's argument that the CSAB procedures violated his due process rights guaranteed by \u00a7 30.076 fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Lopez's cursory insinuation that the CSAB impermissibly ratified unconstitutional discipline is without merit. (Doc. 50, pp. 8, 10, 12). As noted above, administrative review is not meaningful where the administrative body simply \"ratified the official's decision and improper motive.\"\n   <em>\n    Maschmeier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566170\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/269/941/#p943\">\n    269 F. App'x at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lopez cites no evidence showing that the CSAB approved the alleged improper basis for his discipline. (Doc. 50). Instead, the CSAB's published decision shows that the CSAB affirmed Lopez's demotion (and overturned his suspension) based on their considered review of witness testimony and evidence, and their ultimate conclusion that Lopez violated OCSO regulations. (Doc. 43-2, pp. 36-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, the CSAB exercised \"meaningful administrative review\" over the OCSO Sheriff's discipline of Lopez. Though Lopez complains about perceived inadequacies of the CSAB procedure, the record is clear that Lopez's discipline was subject to satisfactory review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Having found Sheriff Gibson is not a final policymaker with respect to Plaintiff's demotion, Plaintiff has failed to prove a basis for municipal liability as to Count I.
