Plaintiffs challenge the legislation on the grounds that it violates plaintiffs' rights of free speech and association as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution and rights of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 17.1, DE 17.2). Defendant also advised the court that two other matters addressing the legal status of certain proposed amendments to the North Carolina Constitution were scheduled to be argued before a three-judge panel on August 15, 2018 and that those matters also may impact when the Board may print election ballots.

On or about June 6, 2018, the Constitution Party of North Carolina became a recognized political party under the elections laws of North Carolina. (Compl. (DE 1) \u00b6 10). The Constitution Party of North Carolina, through its representatives, timely filed with the Board more than the required amount of petition signatures, as well as more than 200 signatures from more than three congressional districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Board then voted unanimously to recognize the Constitution Party of North Carolina as the state's newest political party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Until June 6, 2018, this party did not have access to the ballot in North Carolina and could not nominate candidates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Likewise, voters could not register to vote as a Constitution Party of North Carolina voter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). Prior to this party becoming recognized under the elections laws of North Carolina, no voter in North Carolina could affiliate with the party in that voter's registration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Primary elections in North Carolina for 2018 occurred on May 8, 2018 with options for second primaries occurring after June 27, 2018, or July 17, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Prior to the ballot access recognition of the Constitution Party of North Carolina, plaintiff Poindexter ran for the office for North Carolina House of Representatives, District 90, in the Republican Party primary election and lost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Similarly, plaintiff Holt ran for office for Craven County Board of Commissioners, District 1, in the Republican Party primary election and lost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Finally, plaintiff Jones ran for office for Greene County Board of Commissioners, District 3, in the Democratic Party primary election and lost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to the election laws governing newly recognized parties, the Constitution Party of North Carolina was not permitted to participate in the primary elections and was required to nominate its candidates by convention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). After the Constitution Party of North Carolina held its convention, it submitted its candidate list, which included plaintiffs Poindexter, Jones, and Holt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). The candidates were accepted by the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about June 5, 2018 the North Carolina General Assembly passed Senate Bill 486, \"An Act to Make Various Changes Related to Election Laws,\" that in part modified the provisions of the election law governing the participation of new political parties in the general election. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). The bill went to the Governor for signing or for veto. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On or about June 15, 2018, the Governor vetoed Senate Bill 486, stating \"[c]ontinued election meddling for partisan advantage weakens public confidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The North Carolina General Assembly, on or about June 20, 2018, overrode the Governor's veto and passed Senate Bill 486 into law as S.L. 2018-13. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). S.L. 2018-13 states in pertinent part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   An individual whose name appeared on the ballot in a primary election preliminary to the general election shall not be eligible to have that individual's name placed on the general election ballot as a candidate for the new political party for the same office in that year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (citing S.L. 2018-13) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thereafter, on or about June 21, 2018, the Board decertified candidates Poindexter, Jones, and Holt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The statewide general election for both state and federal offices will be held on November 6, 2018. State law requires that the Board provide absentee ballots \"60 days prior to the statewide general election in even-numbered years.\" (DE 18 at 3 (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 163A-1305 ) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant alleges that in order for the ballots to be properly prepared prior to making absentee ballots available to voters by September 7, 2018, 60 days prior to the November election, preparation and testing that normally takes approximately 30 days must be completed, although defendant has indicated to the court that truncated preparation and testing can occur.
