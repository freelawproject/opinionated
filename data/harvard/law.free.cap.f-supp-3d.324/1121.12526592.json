MARSHALL, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The matters before the Court are the parties' respective motions for partial summary judgment. (Dkt. Nos. 35, 40.) Defendants seek summary judgment in their favor on Plaintiff Mahgerefteh's \u00a7 1983 claim for unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Plaintiffs seek summary judgment that certain provisions of the Torrance Municipal Code relating to its farmers' market are unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the speech/petition provisions of the California Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts are largely undisputed. Defendant City of Torrance (\"the City\") owns and operates a public Farmers' Market (\"the Market\"), which takes place in the parking lot of Charles H. Wilson Park every Tuesday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. (Dkt. No. 42, Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"PSUF\") # 9.) It is open to the public, and no fee is charged to enter or use the Market, the parking lot, or the park. (PSUF # 9.) The fifth largest farmers' market in the United States, the Market is roughly 79,568 square feet in size and can attract 2,953 or more customers on a given market day. (PSUF ## 29-30, 38.) Defendant Joyce Chan is the Market's manager. (Dkt. No. 45-1, Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"DSUF\") # 7.) Defendant Nicholas Rea is a police officer employed by the City of Torrance. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6 7\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 13 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sellers reserve and occupy stalls at the Market to sell their goods and services to the public, and the City generates revenue by collecting a percentage of sellers' gross sales. (PSUF # 10.) The Market also includes a 10' x 30' \"Expressive Conduct Area,\" where spaces may be reserved for activities such as \"fundraising and information sharing by community groups and individuals, political outreach[,] and campaigning.\" (Dkt. No. 37-1, Torrance Municipal Ordinance No. 3791, Ex. A (Torrance Certified Farmers' Market Rules and Regulations (\"Market Rules\") ) \u00a7\u00a7 I.5, III.4.) The Expressive Conduct Area is divided into three 10' x 10' stalls, and no more than three \"Expressive Conduct Users\" are allowed to set up a stall in the Expressive Conduct Area per Market day. (PSUF # 26; Market Rules \u00a7 III.4.) Those who\n   wish to use the Expressive Conduct Area apply in advance for a spot, and a member of the City staff assigns one of the three spaces on a first-come-first-served basis. (DSUF # 4.) Applicants are limited to reserving a space at one Tuesday Market and one Saturday Market each month. (Market Rules \u00a7 III.4.) Each Market day, any unreserved spaces can be claimed by submitting an application between 7:00 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unreserved spaces are also assigned on a first-come-first-served basis, and there are no limits on the number of times an individual or group may apply for and use an unreserved space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Market Rules prohibit the following activities, except at Expressive Conduct User Spaces:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 \"Circulating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 \"Unauthorized solicitation - For purposes of this prohibition, 'unauthorized solicitation' means solicitation that is unrelated to the Market, is not conducted from an authorized selling space, or both. These prohibitions do not preclude any person or organization from conducting these activities during Market hours on sidewalks or other public property adjacent to the Market. Violations of these prohibitions will result in expulsion from the Market for the remainder of that Market day.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"Commercial photography or videotaping\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Market Rules \u00a7 II.8.) Violation of the Market Rules constitutes a misdemeanor. (Torrance Municipal Code \u00a7 412.1.1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs Nazila Mahgerefteh and Patricia Montoro, who regularly attend the Market, are advocates of veganism. (PSUF ## 11-12.) They have engaged in advocacy of veganism at the Market on various occasions. (PSUF # 11.) In June 2016, Montoro reserved an Expressive Conduct Space for Saturday, July 23, 2016. (DSUF # 11.) On Saturday, July 2, 2016, Mahgerefteh and Montoro utilized an Expressive Conduct Space reserved by Mahgerefteh. (DSUF # 10.) On July 6, Chan emailed Montoro to inform her that her reservation of an Expressive Conduct Space for July 23 was forfeited because Montoro had already used an Expressive Conduct Space one Saturday in July. (DSUF # 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 23, Mahgerefteh attempted to utilize an Expressive Conduct Space at the market. (DSUF # 12.) Mahgerefteh did not have a reservation for an Expressive Conduct Space on this date, and she was informed by City staff that she would not be allowed to use the Expressive Conduct Area. (DSUF # 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Plaintiff objected and refused to leave. (DSUF # 14.) Chan informed Defendant Officer Rea and another City officer that Mahgerefteh was violating the Market Rules and trespassing. (DSUF # 16.) The officers advised Mahgerefteh that she was not allowed to utilize the Expressive Conduct Area on that day, but she refused to leave. (DSUF ## 17-18.) The officers then \"began to arrest\" Mahgerefteh. (DSUF # 20.) Officer High grabbed Mahgerefteh's right arm, while Officer Rea grabbed her left arm. (DSUF ## 21-23.) After a few seconds of being held, Mahgerefteh said that she would leave and the officers released her. (DSUF ## 25-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiff Mahgerefteh's cause of action for unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Defendants argue\n   that Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because Officer Rea had probable cause to arrest Plaintiff on July 23, 2016 based on a violation of the Market Rules, which constitutes a misdemeanor under the Torrance Municipal Code. \"If an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Atwater v.

This is true even when the arrest is based on a city ordinance that is later declared unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. DeFillippo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/#p37\">\n    443 U.S. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37-38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/#p37\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/#p37\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). Accordingly, the constitutionality of the Market Rules themselves is irrelevant to whether Rea's arrest of Plaintiff for violation of those rules was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that Mahgerefteh was attempting to use an Expressive Conduct User Space on July 23, 2016, despite the fact that she had not applied for and been assigned a space for that day. (DSUF # 12-13.) She was therefore in violation of the Market Rules, which require an application in order to utilize an Expressive Conduct User Space. (Market Rules \u00a7 III.4.) This constitutes a misdemeanor pursuant to the Torrance Municipal Code. (Torrance Municipal Ordinance 3791 \u00a7 412.1.2(a), Dkt. No. 37-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mahgerefteh argues that she was not in violation of the Market Rules because she had been hired by Plaintiff Montoro to attend the Market in Montoro's place and use her Expressive Conduct User Space. This argument fails for two reasons. First, Chan had cancelled Montoro's July 23 reservation because Montoro had used an Expressive Conduct User Space on July 2. (DSUF # 11.) Accordingly, neither Montoro nor Mahgerefteh had a valid reservation for July 23. Second, even if Montoro would have had a valid reservation for July 23, Mahgerefteh did not. The Market Rules do not appear to have any provision that permits an individual to utilize someone else's reservation, and Mahgerefteh has not identified one. However, even assuming that Plaintiffs' interpretation of the Market Rules is correct and an individual may delegate the use of her reservation to someone else, the Market Rules can also be reasonably interpreted as requiring a reservation by the individual who is actually utilizing the Expressive Conduct User Space. Thus, Officer Rea's interpretation of the Market Rules as prohibiting Mahgerefteh's use of the Space-even if potentially incorrect-was at least reasonable. When a seizure is based on a reasonable, albeit mistaken, interpretation of a statutory prohibition, the seizure itself is still reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes.\n   <em>\n    Heien v.

The provisions are contained in three different parts of the statute. The first part is a section defining the term \"Expressive Conduct Users\" to \"include ... fundraising and information sharing by community groups and individuals, political outreach and campaigning.\" (Market Rules \u00a7 I.5.)

(Market Rules \u00a7 II.8.) The prohibited activities are (1) \"[c]irculating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures\"; (2) \"solicitation that is unrelated to the Market, is not conducted from an authorized selling space, or both\"; and (3) \"[c]ommercial photography or videotaping.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Information sharing\" is not on the list of activities prohibited outside Expressive Conduct User Spaces.

This section includes \"Expressive Conduct Users\" as a category of admissible sellers \"allowed in a designated area of the Market.\" (Market Rules \u00a7 III.4.) It also limits the number of Expressive Conduct Users permitted to set up in that area to three or fewer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, this section sets forth procedures for reserving space in the Expressive Conduct Area and imposes limits on how frequently individuals can reserve such Expressive Conduct User Spaces. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion is largely premised on the assumption that any conduct falling within \u00a7 I.5's definition of \"Expressive Conduct\"-specifically, \"fundraising and information sharing by community groups and individuals, political outreach and campaigning\"-is permitted only within the Expressive Conduct Area. While recognizing that the Rules do not contain any express prohibition to this effect, Plaintiffs interpret the Market Rules to implicitly limit information-sharing and other expressive conduct to the Expressive Conduct Area by setting aside dedicated space for Expressive Conduct Users. Accordingly, their challenge to the Market Rules presumes that any limits on their use of Expressive Conduct User Spaces also constitute limits on their ability to engage in \"information sharing\" within the Market itself. Three principles counsel against construing the Market Rules in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the Market Rules contain an express provision prohibiting certain expressive activities outside the Expressive Conduct Area-specifically, circulating petitions and advertising brochures, unauthorized solicitation, and commercial photography/videography-and this prohibition is much more limited than the definition of \"Expressive Conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Market Rules \u00a7 II.8\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Market Rules \u00a7 I.5.) If the drafters of the Market Rules had intended to prohibit all\n   \"Expressive Conduct\" outside the Expressive Conduct Area, they could easily have included \"Expressive Conduct\" in \u00a7 II.8's list of prohibited activities, but they did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leatherman v.

Interpreting the Market Rules in this way would thus treat \u00a7 II.8's express prohibition \"essentially as surplusage-as words of no consequence.

Activities not included in \u00a7 II.8 are not prohibited by the Market Rules, irrespective of whether they fall into \u00a7 I.5's definition of \"Expressive Conduct.\" Thus, while Expressive Conduct User Spaces are available to anyone falling within the definition of \"Expressive Conduct Users,\" an individual who does not wish to engage in activities prohibited under \u00a7 II.8 is not limited to the Expressive Conduct Area when engaging in other forms of \"information sharing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, the Court interprets the provisions of \u00a7 III.4 to apply only to individuals wishing to use Expressive Conduct User Spaces, not to individuals engaging in non-prohibited expressive conduct outside the Expressive Conduct Area. Section III.4 is in the division of the Market Rules outlining the requirements to be considered an \"Admissible Seller.\" (Market Rules \u00a7 III.) Thus, \u00a7 III.4 only applies to individuals who wish to be admitted into the Market as Admissible Sellers, that is, individuals who wish to set up booths in the Expressive Conduct Area of the Market.

Plaintiffs argue that the Market is a public forum because it is held inside a park, which is a quintessential traditional public forum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union v. City of Las Vegas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113867\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/1092/#p1097\">\n    333 F.3d at 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The quintessential traditional public forums are sidewalks, streets, and parks.\"). Defendants do not contest that the park in which the Market takes place is a traditional public forum, but argue that the Market itself is at most a limited public forum because it was created for an express purpose other than providing a forum for speech. This raises an issue that does not fit neatly into the Supreme Court's forum doctrine: the ability of the government to use a traditional public forum for other purposes. The Court is unaware of any binding case law squarely addressing whether a governmental agency may temporarily reserve part of a traditional public forum for its own event, even though that event may preclude the forum's simultaneous use by other speakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under Plaintiffs' view, when an event is held on property constituting a traditional public forum, the character of the property itself-rather than the character of the event-continues to govern access to the property, and thus any restriction on access to the event as a forum for speech must be necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest or must be content-neutral and narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest. The Court is not persuaded. If Plaintiffs' position were accepted, many time-honored practices that have never been thought to raise First Amendment concerns would suddenly be constitutionally suspect. For example, it is a common practice for municipalities\n   to hold parades. For the duration of the parade, the parade route-a traditional public forum-is rendered unavailable to those who might wish to hold a parade promoting a different message. Thus, the municipality's exclusive reservation of the parade route for its own speech undoubtedly constitutes an exclusion of speakers from a traditional public forum, yet it has never been suggested that a municipality must show the parade serves a compelling or even a significant governmental interest. It is sufficient that it constitutes a legitimate use of government property and that the property remains available for use at other times on a non-discriminatory basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Similarly, a public high school lacking an adequately large venue might properly reserve a public park in which to hold its commencement ceremony. It cannot reasonably be suggested that in doing so the school obligates itself to allow members of the public at large to give commencement speeches. Although the park itself may be a traditional public forum when not reserved for another use, a high school commencement ceremony is not a public forum, and nothing in the First Amendment prohibits the school from limiting commencement speakers to those chosen by the school itself. Plaintiffs' argument is therefore too broad. \"[I]f the ability to exclude others from public property during the course of a limited, permitted use were found to be a constitutional violation, every picnic, wedding, company outing, meeting, rally, and fair held on public grounds would be subject to constitutional scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Villegas v.

General Access to the Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The first form of access sought by Plaintiffs is the ability to engage in expressive\n   conduct within the Market area generally. In other words, they seek general access to the Market. \"When speakers seek general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p801\">\n    473 U.S. at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p801\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This form of access is regulated by \u00a7 II.8 of the Market Rules, which enumerates the expressive activities prohibited within the Market. Accordingly, the constitutionality of \u00a7 II.8 is governed by the rules applicable to traditional public forums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Expressive Conduct User Spaces\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The second form of access sought by Plaintiffs is the ability to set up a booth in the Market and to use that booth as a platform for expression. Courts adopt a more tailored approach to determining the relevant forum when speakers \"seek access to a particular means of communication.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p801\">\n    473 U.S. at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p801\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike general access to the Market area, which is free and open to the public, permission to set up a booth in the Market is not granted as a matter of course to the public at large, or even to those qualified to sell at the Market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Market Rules \u00a7 III (\"Qualifying to sell at the Market does not automatically insure admission in the Market. Admissible Sellers must apply to sell at the Market and be approved by the Market Manager to do so before they are authorized to sell at the Market.\").) Except for the three Expressive Conduct User Spaces provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 I.5 and III.4 of the Market Rules, booths in the Market are authorized at the City's discretion for a non-expressive commercial purpose. These selling spaces are clearly not a designated public forum for expression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seattle Mideast Awareness Campaign v. King Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076420\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/489/#p496\">\n    781 F.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (9th Cir. 2015) (\"The defining characteristic of a designated public forum is that it's open to the same indiscriminate use and almost unfettered access that exist in a traditional public forum.\") (internal citations, quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   It is a more difficult question whether Expressive Conduct User Spaces constitute a designated public forum. Access to this particular forum is regulated by \u00a7 III.4 of the Market Rules, which govern \"Admissible Sellers.\" While these Spaces are set aside for expressive activity, they are not available for \"indiscriminate use,\" nor does the public enjoy \"unfettered access\" to them.\n   <em>\n    Seattle Mideast Awareness Campaign\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076420\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/489/#p496\">\n    781 F.3d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, an application must be submitted in order to use one. Ultimately, however, the Court need not determine whether Expressive Conduct User Spaces constitute a designated public forum or a limited public forum, because the city's regulations regarding the use of the forum survive even under the heightened scrutiny that applies to designated public forums. Accordingly, the Court assumes without deciding that Expressive Conduct User Spaces constitute a designated public forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Constitutionality of the Challenged Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs seek access to traditional and designated public forums, and so any restrictions on that access are subject to exacting scrutiny. \"For the State to enforce a content-based exclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\"\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada v.

Restrictions on Speech in the Market Area Generally\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The restrictions on expressive use of the Market area generally are contained in \u00a7 II.8,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which prohibits the following activities within the Market, except in Expressive Conduct User Spaces: (1) \"[c]irculating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures\"; (2) \"[u]nauthorized solicitation\"; and (3) \"[c]ommercial photography or videotaping.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Turning first to the prohibition on \"[c]irculating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures,\" this is a content-based restriction on speech. Petitions relating to initiatives or referendums are prohibited, but petitions relating to any other subject are not. Similarly, a patron could circulate an informational brochure, as long as it is not an advertisement. As a content-based restriction on speech, this prohibition must be supported by a showing that it is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. This is a \"demanding standard,\" and \"[i]t is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Assuming, without deciding, that this constitutes a \"compelling state interest\" for purposes of First Amendment analysis, the Court concludes that the prohibition is nonetheless invalid because it is not narrowly drawn to achieving that end. There is no evidence in the record suggesting that initiative/referendum petitions and advertising brochures pose any more threat to the City's asserted interest than other types of petitions and brochures. Thus, the City's \"regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which ... is alone enough to defeat it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the City's prohibition on \"[c]irculating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures\" is a content-based restriction on speech that is not narrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest, it is facially invalid under the First Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court grants\n   Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment insofar as it seeks a determination that the Market Rules' prohibition on \"[c]irculating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures,\" is facially invalid under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court now turns to the prohibition on \"unauthorized solicitation,\" which is defined as \"solicitation that is unrelated to the Market, is not conducted from an authorized selling space, or both.\" (Market Rules \u00a7 II.8.) Plaintiffs argue that this prohibition should be subject to the exacting scrutiny reserved for content-based regulations, because \"solicitation that is unrelated to the Market\" is prohibited, while solicitation that is related to the Market is not prohibited. (Market Rules \u00a7 II.8.) However, this argument overlooks the fact that all solicitation \"not conducted from an authorized selling space\" is banned, irrespective of its content. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the rule is content-neutral with respect to solicitation by non-sellers. It is only speech conducted from authorized selling spaces that is being regulated based on its content. Because selling spaces within the Market are not public forums,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the use of those spaces for speech are subject to reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation.

On Market days, the Market hosts over 100 vendors and nearly 3,000 patrons in a space that is less than 2 acres in area.

Additionally, the Market is surrounded on all four sides by public property-public streets, a public parking lot, and a public park (Dkt.

Although Plaintiffs seek partial summary judgment that \u00a7 II.8 is invalid in its entirety, they have not provided any argument or authority for concluding that the prohibition on commercial photography and videotaping is invalid under the First Amendment. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment insofar as it seeks a determination that the Market Rules' prohibitions on commercial photography and videotaping are invalid under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Restrictions on Access to Expressive Conduct User Spaces\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the City's rules that (1) limit the number of Expressive Conduct Users to three per Market day; (2) require speakers to reserve Expressive Conduct User Spaces in advance; (3) limit Expressive Conduct Users to one Tuesday and one Saturday per month; and (4) prevent speakers from using empty Expressive Conduct User Spaces that are reserved by someone else.

The Expressive Conduct Area itself is only 30' x 10' in size,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   so \"allow[ing] unregulated access to all comers could easily reduce rather than enlarge the [Area's] utility as a forum for speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p322\">\n    534 U.S. at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p322\">\n    122 S.Ct. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The City therefore can permissibly restrict the Area to the number of users reasonably able to use the forum simultaneously.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grayned v.

Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment insofar as it seeks a\n   determination that limiting the use of the Expressive Conduct Area to three users per Market day is an invalid restriction on access to a public forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the Market Rules' requirement that Expressive Conduct User Spaces be reserved in advance, arguing that this constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on speech. However, the Court finds the prior restraint cases cited by Plaintiffs inapposite. \"[T]he [reservation] required is not the kind of prepublication license deemed a denial of liberty since the time of John Milton but a ministerial ... routine for adjusting the rights of citizens so that the opportunity for effective freedom of speech may be preserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Poulos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372884\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/395/#p405\">\n    345 U.S. at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372884\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/395/#p405\">\n    73 S.Ct. 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reservation requirement \"does not authorize a licensor to pass judgment on the content of speech: None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with what a speaker might say.... And the object of the [reservation] system (as plainly indicated by the permissible grounds for ... denial) is not to exclude communication of a particular content, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space....\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p322\">\n    534 U.S. at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p322\">\n    122 S.Ct. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court concludes that \"the [reservation] scheme at issue here is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is denied insofar as it seeks a determination that the Market Rules' reservation requirement for Expressive Conduct User Spaces is invalid under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the Market Rules' provision \"limiting speech to only one Tuesday and one Saturday per month.\" (Dkt. No. 40 (\"Motion\") at 17.) However, the Market Rules do not actually prohibit speakers from using Expressive Conduct User Spaces more than twice per month; they only prevent them from reserving Spaces on more than two days per month. (Market Rules \u00a7 III.4.d.) If any Spaces for a given Market day remain unreserved at the end of the application period, the Market Manager informs the applicants, who may show up on that day to claim the spots on a first-come-first-served basis. (Market Rules \u00a7\u00a7 III.4.f-g.) Like the reservation system itself, this is a reasonable regulation that \"serve[s] to further the government's interest in coordinating multiple uses of limited public space.\"\n   <em>\n    Berger v. City of Seattle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660911\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/1029/#p1042\">\n    569 F.3d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1042 (9th Cir. 2009). To the extent all spaces are reserved in a given month, the regulation increases the number of users who can reach the crowds at both the Tuesday and Saturday Markets, and to the extent spaces are left unreserved at the end of the reservation period, all would-be speakers are given equal opportunity to claim those spaces on the day of the Market. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment insofar as it seeks a determination that limiting each speaker to reserving an Expressive Conduct User Space on one Tuesday and one Saturday per month is an invalid restriction on access to a public forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs challenge the absence of any rule either (a) penalizing individuals who reserve Spaces but fail to claim them, or (b) forfeiting reservations that are not claimed by a particular time so that others can use the unclaimed Spaces. According to Plaintiffs, this \"allows no-show Users to make repeated reservations, leave ... spaces vacant, and effectively suppress the number of Users at the Market.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Motion\n   at 18.) Thus, Plaintiffs essentially contend that the City has abridged their freedom to use a designated public forum by failing to impose sufficient conditions on other speakers' use of the forum. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the City could permissibly impose such conditions on the use of a designated public forum, Plaintiffs have cited no authority suggesting that an otherwise valid reservation system is rendered invalid by the absence of those conditions. Although provisions penalizing \"no-show Users\" or forfeiting reservations might have the incidental effect of making more Spaces available for Plaintiffs' use,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   they would also render the Expressive Conduct Area less accessible to speakers who might only be able to use the Area near the end of the Market day or who are not certain whether they will be able to attend the Market on a given day. Nothing in the First Amendment purports to dictate the City's choice between these two options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Having adopted a valid reservation system for Expressive Conduct User Spaces, the City can properly prohibit the use of reserved Spaces by those without reservations, in order to maintain their availability for those who reserved them. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment insofar as it seeks a determination that the First Amendment requires the City to penalize those who fail to claim their reserved Spaces by a particular time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiffs' Other Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having concluded that \u00a7 I.5, \u00a7 II.8, and \u00a7 III.4 of the Market Rules are not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, with the exception of their prohibition on \"[c]irculating an initiative or referendum petition, or circulating advertising brochures,\" the Court now turns to Plaintiffs' alternative arguments for invaliding the provisions. First, Plaintiffs argue the provisions should be invalidated under the California Constitution, because it \"provides much greater protection for speech than does the federal constitution.\" (Dkt. No. 48 (\"Reply\") at 9.) However, beyond this general assertion, the only difference in protections identified by Plaintiffs is that under California law, \"private property can constitute a public forum for free speech if it is open to the public in a manner similar to that of public streets and sidewalks.\"\n   <em>\n    Fashion Valley Mall, LLC v.

Because the property at issue in this case is indisputably public, California's extension of speech protections to private property is not applicable. None of the cases identified by Plaintiffs purport to hold that the California Constitution requires stricter scrutiny of speech regulations on public property than does the federal constitution. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' facial challenge under the California Constitution fails for the same reason as does their facial challenge under the federal constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that, even if the Market Rules are facially permissible, they have been \"applied to target Plaintiffs who had a history of frequent use of the Market for their free speech before the Ordinance\n   was enacted.\" (Motion at 17.) If a facially valid ordinance is in fact being used to target Plaintiffs on account of their viewpoint, such application would be unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Foti v.

Defendants deny that they target Plaintiffs in their enforcement of the Market Rules. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 41-1 (\"Chan Decl.\") at \u00b6 14 (\"Ever since the adoption of the Ordinance, City staff has always attempted to uniformly enforce the established Rules and Regulations relating to the reservation and use of the [Expressive Conduct] stalls.\").)
