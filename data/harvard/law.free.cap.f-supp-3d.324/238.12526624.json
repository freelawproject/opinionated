(\"Universal\"). Plaintiff John Lundgren (\"Lundgren\" or \"plaintiff\"), who filed his complaint\n  <em>\n   pro\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   se\n  </em>\n  , was diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in December, 2014. He alleges that defendants Universal, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") and individual employees thereof, improperly failed to protect his co-workers by collecting required water samples from a malfunctioning compressor at his place of employment in violation of the Occupational Health and Safety Act,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20654\">\n   29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654\n  </extracted-citation>\n  and his civil rights.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lundgren alleges that he was diagnosed with work-related Legionnaires' disease in December, 2014 after an industrial accident at Universal involving an explosion of a compressor containing dust and water vapor. He recounts that the disease was reported immediately to the Massachusetts Department of Health and Public Safety (\"MDPH\"). Lundgren submitted a claim to the Department of Industrial Accidents (\"DIA\") in January, 2015. He contends that MDPH was required to collect water samples identifying the source of the outbreak, quarantine the area, protect workers and prevent the spread of the disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lundgren complains of a deficient \"phone fax\" sent from OSHA to Universal which failed to warn Universal of a possible case of Legionnaires' disease. He suggests that the fax gave Universal a deadline to respond in default of which an on-site inspection would ensue. Lundgren claims that Universal replied (two weeks late) with a false report that no open water sources were visible and a recommendation to take water samples if an employee was diagnosed with Legionnaires'. Thereafter, OSHA closed its investigation. Lundgren asserts that all defendants failed to follow proper protocol, left workers in imminent danger and denied his \"right [ ] to critical mandated water samples\". He alleges a conspiracy and claims psychological damages stemming from \"egregious, incompetent, grossly negligent, nearly criminal (IF NOT) actions\" following his diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lundgren submits 26 exhibits to his complaint which 1) document his diagnosis and claims to the DIA, 2) attach policies of OSHA and 3) provide information about Legionnaires' disease, communications from OSHA to Universal, from plaintiff's wife, Sandra Lundgren, to OSHA and between attorneys representing Lundgren and Universal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pending Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January, 2018, defendants Universal, Jennifer MacAskill and Shawn Gill, current and former employees of Universal (\"the Universal defendants\") moved to dismiss the complaint, contending that (1) Lundgren's claims are precluded by the Workers' Compensation Act, (2) any claims were released in a settlement agreement with Travelers Indemnity Co., Universal's workers' compensation insurer and (3) Lundgren has no standing to assert claims on behalf of unidentified co-workers (Docket No. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February, 2018, defendant MDPH and its employee Elise Pechter (\"the Commonwealth defendants\") moved to dismiss\n   the complaint, asserting that (1) the Occupational Health and Safety Act does not provide for a private cuase of action (2) MDPH and Pechter, in her official capacity, are not persons \"amenable to suit\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Eleventh Amendment bars such claims and (3) the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a civil rights claim against Pechter in her individual capacity (Docket No. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March, 2018, plaintiff moved to default defendant OSHA for failure to file a responsive pleading (Docket No. 30). This Court entered a notice of default against OSHA but in April, 2018, OSHA sought to remove the subsequent default entered against it because plaintiff had not effected service on OSHA (Docket No. 38). In July, 2018, this Court, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55, vacated the subject default and extended the period for service of process on OSHA until Friday, August 17, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April, 2018, plaintiff moved to amend his complaint to include claims for pain and suffering, punitive damages based on loss of companionship, emotional distress, intentional infliction and embarrassment caused by the actions of defendant following the diagnosis and pain and suffering and punitive damages on behalf of plaintiff's two minor children (Docket No. 40). That same month and again in July, 2018, plaintiff and his wife, Sandra Lundgren, filed motions for appointment of counsel and requested hearings (Docket Nos. 36 and 46). Finally, within the past week, Attorney Amy Rice filed a notice of appearance on behalf of Lundgren and moved to extend the deadline for responding to pending motions in the case and to effect service on OSHA to October 7, 2018 (Docket No. 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motions to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Universal defendants contend that Lundgren reached a settlement with Universal's workers' compensation insurer for injuries sustained in December, 2014 while he was employed by Universal. It appears from the face of the complaint that Lundgren's claims are barred under the exclusivity provisions of the Massachusetts workers' compensation statute. He does not plead facts to suggest that his claims fall outside of the scope of the statutory scheme, for example that his injury occurred outside of the course of his employment or that he did not have an employment relationship with Universal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5684095\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/452/564/#p566\">\n    452 Mass. at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=896%20N.E.2d%20615\">\n    896 N.E.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The key to whether the act precludes a common-law right of action lies in the nature of the injury for which plaintiff makes the claim.\").

For the reasons explained above, the complaint as styled is subject to dismissal and, accordingly, the Court will deny as moot Lundgren's motion to extend time to the extent it seeks an extension to file further responses to the motions to dismiss. The Court will, however, permit Lundgren to file an amended complaint to cure the deficiencies identified and to effect service on defendants. Accordingly, the motion to extend time will be allowed, in part, and denied as moot, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the motions to dismiss of the Universal defendants (Docket No. 21) and the Commonwealth defendants (Docket No. 26) are\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   . Lundgren's motions to appoint counsel and for a hearing (Docket Nos. 36 and 46) and his motion to amend (Docket No. 40) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   . Lundgren's motion for an extension for time (Docket No. 52) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED,\n   </strong>\n   to the extent he seeks an extension to effect service on defendants, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   , to the extent he seeks additional time to respond to defendants' motions to dismiss. Lundgren shall file an amended complaint, if at all, on or before October\n   12, 2018 to cure the deficiencies in the complaint and shall effect service on defendants on or before that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
