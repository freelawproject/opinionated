Shah, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Garrett Schmoeller was a police officer in the Village of Island Lake. Schmoeller attained the rank of sergeant before he was demoted due to procedural defects in the promotion. Schmoeller was given the chance to try again, but the Village's Board of Fire and Police Commissioners passed Schmoeller over, choosing to promote another officer instead. Schmoeller contends that the promotion denial was based on his political associations. The officer who received the promotion had supported the winning candidate in the recent mayoral election, but Schmoeller did not. Schmoeller filed suit, alleging a violation of his First Amendment rights. About a year after he filed suit, the Village terminated Schmoeller's employment. In his amended complaint, Schmoeller brings claims of First Amendment violations and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage against the Village, the mayor, the commissioners, and two of his supervisors at the police department. Defendants move for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Garrett Schmoeller became a full-time police officer at the Village of Island Lake Police Department in 2004. [68] \u00b6 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, Charles Amrich was the Village's mayor, but Amrich was replaced the following year after losing the election to Debbie Herrmann. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 3, 24. Over the next several years, Schmoeller received some reprimands, mostly for repeated attendance issues. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 9. Then, in 2011, Schmoeller was promoted to \"probationary sergeant.\" [68] \u00b6 13. But it did not last.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, Amrich defeated Herrmann to take back the mayoral seat. [68] \u00b6 24. Amrich made some personnel changes, including changes to the Village's Board of Fire and Police Commissioners. The Board is responsible for hiring and promoting police officers and for terminating probationary officers. [68] \u00b6 32. The commissioners at the relevant times for this lawsuit were Arnold Epstein, Debra Jenkins, and Tom Martin. [68] \u00b6 29. Each of the commissioners had in some way supported Amrich in his mayoral campaign. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; [102] \u00b6 11. In 2014, the commissioners discovered that some of the previous administration's sergeant promotions, including Schmoeller's, were invalid due to procedural errors. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35. So Schmoeller was informed of the news and given the opportunity to re-take the sergeants' test to qualify for the promotion under the proper procedures. [68] \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the same time, Bill Dickerson was vying for promotion to sergeant. Dickerson had recently re-joined the police department after being fired during his probationary period in 2010. [68] \u00b6 61. Dickerson's termination was based on allegations that included insubordination and taking \"breaks\" at his house while on duty. [102] \u00b6 5. In the year following his termination from the Village, Dickerson pleaded guilty to a disorderly conduct charge for an altercation with his then girlfriend and had orders of protection issued against him on behalf of his ex-girlfriend and ex-wife. [102] \u00b6 6. Dickerson supported Amrich's bid for mayor in 2013 by putting up campaign signs, writing blog articles, canvassing, and donating $20. [102] \u00b6 7. After the election, the Village's board of trustees voted on whether to reinstate Dickerson to the police force. [68] \u00b6 62. The vote resulted in a tie, so Amrich cast the tie-breaking\n   vote in favor of reinstating Dickerson. [68] \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Schmoeller, Dickerson, and others took the sergeants' test in 2014, [68] \u00b6 38, though there were a few wrinkles. Dickerson was given an older version of the test-the version that was in place in 2012-in an effort to correct for Dickerson's earlier termination, which the commissioners believed was done illegally and contrary to proper procedure. [102] \u00b6 22. In contrast, Schmoeller and others got a new version of the test. [102] \u00b6 23. Dickerson also had a few months' more notice of the test to prepare. [102] \u00b6 23. Schmoeller did not hear about the date of the oral component of the exam until another candidate told him. [102] \u00b6 28. After receiving the results of the test, the commissioners noticed that the test included a 75-question section that not all of the candidates realized would be on the test. [68] \u00b6 40. To compensate, the commissioners omitted that section from all of the candidates' scores. [68] \u00b6 40. The test scores were combined with any applicable bonus points for military service as well as \"chief points\" (discretionary points awarded by the chief of police) to compile a ranking of the candidates. [68] \u00b6 41. The commissioners were legally obligated to choose from among the top three candidates on the list-those candidates were Officer Deuter, Schmoeller, and Dickerson, in that order. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 41, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The commissioners first selected Deuter (who, like Schmoeller, had previously been improperly selected for promotion under the previous administration). [68] \u00b6 45. Then the choice for the second available sergeant position came down to Schmoeller or Dickerson. The commissioners chose not to consider chief points, preferring instead to focus on the candidates' test scores. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Dickerson scored higher than Schmoeller on the test. [68] \u00b6 47. Commissioner Jenkins also told the other commissioners that she had negative experiences with Schmoeller in the past and felt as though he had stalked her. [68] \u00b6 49. The commissioners did not discuss any of the candidates' political associations. [68] \u00b6 50. The commissioners unanimously decided to select Dickerson instead of Schmoeller, and the appointment was approved. [68] \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Schmoeller filed this lawsuit in November 2015. [1]. In March 2016, Schmoeller wrote a memo to Chief Anthony Sciarrone, who Amrich had appointed just about a year earlier, to say that he had been reassigned to a patrol vehicle he believed was unsafe and that he felt as though the reassignment was retaliation for his lawsuit. [68] \u00b6 30; [102] \u00b6 39. Dickerson, now a sergeant, responded on behalf of Sciarrone, stating, among other things, that future unfounded accusations of retaliation could be viewed as insubordination. [102] \u00b6 39. In September 2016, Schmoeller was reprimanded for telling an inappropriate joke back in March of that year, and Schmoeller received a negative performance review from Dickerson (and signed by Sciarrone), which was abnormal because Dickerson had never evaluated anyone else. [102] \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also in September 2016, a video surfaced on Facebook of an arrest Schmoeller had assisted with several months before. [68] \u00b6 70. The arresting officer, Gale Holford, had told a citizen to leave a bar, and, as the citizen was walking away while filming Holford, decided to arrest him. [68-1] at 254:12-258:18; [98]. Schmoeller appeared after the arrest was already underway, to provide assistance. [68-9] at 27:6-22; [98]. The video does not provide much visual depiction of the arrest itself, but Schmoeller's voice can be heard saying, \"I'm gonna show you pain,\" in response to the arrestee's expression of discomfort. [98];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [68-12] at 25. The police\n   department investigated the allegations of misconduct, and Dickerson played a role in the investigation. [102] \u00b6 48. Ultimately, Sciarrone submitted recommendations to Amrich that both Holford and Schmoeller be fired. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 74, 76. Amrich rejected Sciarrone's recommendation as to Holford, choosing to suspend him instead, but accepted Sciarrone's recommendation to terminate Schmoeller. [68] \u00b6\u00b6 77, 80. Schmoeller was terminated in November 2016. [68] \u00b6 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Amendment Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Schmoeller alleges that defendants discriminated against him in violation of his First Amendment\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights by (1) denying him promotion based on his political affiliation and (2) terminating his employment as retaliation for filing this lawsuit. To establish a prima facie case, Schmoeller must show that \"(1) [his] speech was constitutionally protected; (2) [he] suffered a deprivation likely to deter free speech; and (3) [his] speech was at least a motivating factor in the employer's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Yahnke v. Kane Cty., Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921777\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1066/#p1070\">\n    823 F.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (7th Cir. 2016). If Schmoeller establishes that his speech was a motivating factor in defendants' actions, the burden shifts to defendants \"to show that [they] would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921777\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1066/#p1070\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921777\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1066/#p1070\">\n    at 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The burden then shifts back to Schmoeller to show that defendants' proffered reasons were pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Valentino v. Vill. of S.

Pretext is established by evidence that the protected activity was \"most likely\" the reason for the adverse action, \"the defendants' justifications have no basis in fact,\" \"the justifications were not the real reason for firing him,\" or \"the justifications were insufficient to warrant the [adverse action].\"\n   <em>\n    Vukadinovich v. Bd. of Sch. Trustees of N. Newton Sch. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399141\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/278/693/#p699\">\n    278 F.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699-700 (7th Cir. 2002). Defendants concede the first two prima facie elements for both Schmoeller's promotion and termination claims, narrowing the scope of their motion to whether Schmoeller's speech was a \"motivating factor\" in the promotion or termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A \"motivating factor\" can also be described as a \"sufficient condition,\" but it is not a \"necessary condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Kidwell v.

That is to say, Schmoeller does not need to establish that his protected speech was the only factor that caused his employer's actions (or that his speech was the but-for cause of the action) in order to meet his prima facie burden, but he does have to establish that his speech was at least one motivating factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodruff v.

Promotion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Schmoeller claims that the commissioners (Jenkins, Martin, and Epstein) denied his promotion to sergeant based on his political associations. More specifically, Schmoeller says the commissioners promoted Dickerson to sergeant instead of him because Dickerson backed Amrich in the mayoral election and Schmoeller did not. The threshold question is whether the commissioners even knew about Schmoeller's or Dickerson's political activities.\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Babb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149261\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/758/#p762\">\n    389 F.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762 (7th Cir. 2004). All of the commissioners testified that they did not know about Schmoeller's political associations (or those of Deuter, the other promoted officer). [68] \u00b6 51. Epstein and Jenkins, but not Martin, knew that Dickerson supported Amrich. [68] \u00b6 51. Schmoeller argues that \"this necessarily means that, to [the commissioners'] knowledge, Dickerson was clearly more politically supportive than Plaintiff.\" [74] at 7. But in order to weigh the relative political activity of Schmoeller and Dickerson, the commissioners would have had to know something about Schmoeller's political activities. There is no evidence that they did. At the motion to dismiss stage, I noted that since only about 800 people voted in the mayoral election, it may be reasonable to infer that politically active people were aware of each other's existence. [26] at 8 n.5. Schmoeller does not rely on this point and at the summary judgment stage, he must come forward with some evidence to support the inference he seeks. Schmoeller does have evidence that Dickerson received favorable treatment in test preparation. That evidence is not tied to Dickerson's political affiliation relative to Schmoeller's, and so does not contribute to any showing that the commissioners knew about Schmoeller's political activity (or lack thereof). Without any evidence of knowledge of Schmoeller's political affiliation, a jury could not conclude that the commissioners were politically motivated to deny him a promotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But even if a jury could infer that the commissioners knew that Dickerson was politically aligned with Amrich while Schmoeller was not, Schmoeller still does not have evidence to support an inference of political motivation. Schmoeller argues that he was much more qualified than Dickerson for the promotion. His argument that Dickerson was unqualified rests on Dickerson's domestic-related disorderly conduct conviction, previous termination as a probationary officer, and suspension at a different police department for insubordination. [74] at 7-8. Evidence of superior qualifications of the unsuccessful applicant is not, by itself, evidence of discriminatory motive, but it can be a plus factor in a plaintiff's circumstantial case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149261\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/758/#p762\">\n    389 F.3d at 763-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That makes sense, however, only if the defendants actually knew that the unsuccessful applicant was more qualified (or were aware of the information that suggests one applicant was more qualified than the other), because that knowledge sheds light on their motivations. Here, the majority of the commissioners did not know about Dickerson's disorderly conduct conviction when they made the promotion decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [68-6] at 23:13-24:17; [68-7] at 12:18-13:3, or why Dickerson had been fired during his probationary period (other than what they understood to be political reasons unrelated to Dickerson's performance),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [68-6] at\n   20:8-21:9; [68-7] at 23:7-24; [68-8] at 39:6-22, and there is no evidence that any of the commissioners knew that a different police department had once suspended Dickerson's police powers for insubordination. But the commissioners all had information about Schmoeller's disciplinary history, they knew Dickerson scored better on the test, and they were aware that Commissioner Jenkins claimed that Schmoeller stalked her. A jury could not find that the commissioners, based on the information they had in front of them, were promoting a less qualified applicant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Schmoeller contends that the commissioners' reasons for not promoting him were pretextual. The commissioners say that they decided who they would promote based on the sergeants' test scores and Jenkins's prior negative experiences with Schmoeller. It is undisputed that Dickerson scored better on the test than Schmoeller did. [68] \u00b6 47. Schmoeller points to what he views as favoritism toward Dickerson during the testing process-for example, Dickerson had more information about the sergeants' test than Schmoeller and Dickerson had more time to prepare for it-but \"although these may suggest deficiencies in the selection process, they do not suggest that the defendants made the hiring decision on the basis of politics.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149261\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/758/#p762\">\n    389 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is also true of any inaccuracies in the officers' disciplinary histories that were provided to the commissioners, particularly where there is no indication that it was the commissioners' responsibility to make sure the officers' files were accurate, and the commissioners' decision to disregard chief points (which would have boosted Schmoeller's ranking) because they thought they were biased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nor is it disputed that Jenkins told the commissioners she felt Schmoeller had stalked her. [68] \u00b6 49; [75] \u00b6 49. Schmoeller dismisses Jenkins's comments as lies, but even if Jenkins were deliberately lying about having been stalked and harassed by Schmoeller, it would not make a difference because the three-person board voted unanimously to promote Dickerson instead of Schmoeller and there is no indication that Epstein or Martin knew that Jenkins was lying.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149261\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/758/#p762\">\n    389 F.3d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (focusing on what the majority of the commissioners knew). If Epstein and Martin voted against Schmoeller's promotion because they believed Jenkins, then the denial of Schmoeller's promotion was not based on constitutionally-impermissible grounds, whether Jenkins was lying or not. The same is true of Schmoeller's allegations that Jenkins deliberately withheld pertinent information about Dickerson's disciplinary past. Schmoeller has not established\n   that the commissioners' reasons for not promoting him were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count I is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2. Termination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Schmoeller alleges that his employment was terminated in retaliation for filing this lawsuit, asserting the claim against Amrich, Sciarrone, and Dickerson. To establish retaliatory motive for the termination, Schmoeller points to the timing of events. Schmoeller suggests that the termination was triggered by the noticing of defendants' depositions in September 2016. But the protected activity here, as alleged by Schmoeller and litigated by the parties, is the filing of the lawsuit, not the noticing of depositions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schmoeller initiated this lawsuit in December 2015, [1], and he was not terminated until November 2016. [68] \u00b6 80. Suspicious timing on its own is rarely enough to raise an inference of causation, and when it does, the Seventh Circuit \"typically allow[s] no more than a few days to elapse between the protected activity and the adverse action.\"\n   <em>\n    Kidwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876378\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/957/#p965\">\n    679 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   966 ;\n   <em>\n    Shaw v. Litscher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20Fed.%20Appx.%20521\">\n    715 Fed.Appx. 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 523 (7th Cir. 2017) (\"[W]e've held in other cases that a time lag of seven months is too long to permit a reasonable inference of retaliation.\"). So the timing of Schmoeller's termination is not suspicious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Schmoeller cites a few events that occurred between his filing the lawsuit and the termination-a letter in which Dickerson told Schmoeller that unfounded accusations of retaliation would be considered insubordination; a negative performance review; and a reprimand he received for making an offensive joke. None of these events tie Schmoeller's termination to his lawsuit. The letter from Dickerson was in response to Schmoeller's memorandum complaining about being asked to change patrol cars and suggesting that the car change was ordered as retaliation for his lawsuit. Dickerson's response did not itself constitute retaliation-if anything, it was a denial of retaliation. The letter does include this statement: \"Let this serve as a warning that further unfounded accusations such as this against the command staff could be construed as insubordination and actions detrimental to the department.\" [68-1] at 224. But Dickerson's \"warning\" does not connect any dots between Schmoeller's termination and his lawsuit-Schmoeller's argument is not that he was terminated because he complained of retaliation again in defiance of Dickerson's warning. Similarly, the negative performance evaluation and reprimand for the offensive joke (which Schmoeller does not remember whether he made) do not raise a reasonable inference that Schmoeller's termination was because he filed the lawsuit. Filing a lawsuit does not insulate a public employee from reprimand unrelated to the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kidwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876378\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/957/#p965\">\n    679 F.3d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n employee's complaint ... does not immunize [him] from being subsequently disciplined or terminated for inappropriate workplace behavior.\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants say the true reason behind Schmoeller's termination was that Schmoeller \"used excessive force in an arrest of a civilian\" and that \"Sciarrone determined that [Schmoeller], unlike the other officers on the Village of Island Lake Police force, was the only officer, to date, under [ ] Sciarrone's command that was\n   found to have used excessive and unnecessary force on an arrestee already in handcuffs.\" [69] at 12-13. Schmoeller contends that these statements are false. He could be right-viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Schmoeller, his conduct toward the arrestee may have been reasonable. But the question is whether Amrich's stated reason, not Sciarrone's, was pretextual. Amrich was the ultimate decision-maker, as demonstrated by the fact that although Sciarrone recommended both Holford and Schmoeller be fired, Amrich only approved Schmoeller's termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record does not show that Amrich relied on Sciarrone's stated justification for the termination, but rather demonstrates that Amrich's stated reason was Schmoeller's inappropriate comments during the arrest-which Amrich recalled as \"I'll show you what hurt is or something to that effect\"-and the fact that Anderson was \"obviously in pain.\" [68-4] at 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no evidence to suggest that these were not the true reasons Amrich decided to terminate Schmoeller.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zerante v. DeLuca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5583224\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/582/#p586\">\n    555 F.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (7th Cir. 2009) (\"A city employee may be fired for a good reason or for no reason at all, as long as she was not fired because of her constitutionally protected activities.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That Holford was not terminated does not establish that Amrich's justifications for Schmoeller's termination were pretextual. Holford did not make the same comments that Schmoeller did, and Amrich explained that he chose not to terminate Holford because Holford had \"been an exemplary officer up to that point.\" [68-4] at 120:2-11. Though there is evidence to show that Holford in fact did not have a clean disciplinary history,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [102] \u00b6 50, there is no evidence to say that Amrich did not genuinely believe in Holford's clean past.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Holford testified that Dickerson told him he \"didn't have anything to worry about. Nobody was after [Holford's] job, that [Holford] just had to be honest,\" and that others around the department thought Holford was \"collateral damage.\" [68-9] at 47:14-48:17. None of those comments from non-decision-makers undermines Amrich's\n   proffered reasons for terminating Schmoeller or links Schmoeller's termination to the lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count II is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   Monell\n   <em>\n    Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties disagree about whether Schmoeller's complaint includes a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the Village or not, but it does not matter.

[74] at 8-9. But Schmoeller's promotion claim is against the commissioners, [46] \u00b6\u00b6 22, 38, 40, and the evidence shows that the commissioners made their decision without input from Amrich. [68] \u00b6 52. There is no evidence that the commissioners engaged in political patronage when making police personnel decisions. Even if Amrich harbored politically motivated preferences for sergeant promotions, there is no evidence from which a jury could conclude that the commissioners knew that.
