The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sentry issued Policy No. 24-48715-07, the insurance policy at issue (\"Policy\"), which was in effect on the date of the auto accident. Joint Stipulations at 3. Rudolph Mazda and Rudolph Chevrolet are named insureds. Policy Excerpt at 2, ECF No. 40-1;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joint Stipulations at 2. Their employees may also qualify as \"insured[s],\" if they meet certain conditions set forth in the Policy. Policy Excerpt at 50-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Policy provides coverage for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , commercial property coverage, commercial garage liability coverage, and commercial excess/umbrella liability coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 14, 172, ECF No. 40-1; Finn Aff. at 2, ECF No. 26-1. Only the parts of the Policy regarding the garage liability coverage and excess/umbrella liability coverage are at issue in this lawsuit. Joint Stipulations at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Commercial Garage Liability Coverage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the commercial garage liability coverage part of the Policy, Sentry assumed, subject to any applicable limitation and exclusion, the duty to \"pay all sums an 'insured' legally must pay as damages ... because of 'bodily injury' ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an 'accident' and resulting from 'garage operations' involving the ownership, maintenance or use of\" any auto. Policy Excerpt at 46, 50. \"Garage operations\" mean \"the ownership, maintenance or use of locations for garage business\" and \"include all operations necessary or incidental to a garage business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Through a broadened coverage endorsement, Sentry further assumed, subject to any applicable limitation and exclusion, the duty to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   pay all sums the \"insured\" legally must pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" ... arising out of the giving or serving of alcoholic beverages at\n   <em>\n    func\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tions\n   </em>\n   incidental to your garage business provided you are not engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing, selling or serving of alcoholic beverages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127 (emphasis added). Heretofore, this broadened coverage will be referred to as the \"Host Liquor Liability\" coverage. Sentry assumed, subject to any applicable limitation and exclusion, the \"duty to defend any 'insured' against a 'suit' asking for\n   <em>\n    such damages.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The garage liability coverage part of the Policy contains an exclusionary clause, under the heading \"Employee Indemnification and Employers Liability,\" which provides in relevant part: \"This insurance does not apply to ... 'Bodily injury' to[ ] [a]n 'employee' of the 'insured' arising out of and in the course of: (1) Employment by the 'insured'; or (2) Performing the duties related to the conduct of the \"insured's business[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. Heretofore, this exclusion will be referred to as the \"Employer's Liability\" exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Commercial Excess/Umbrella Liability Coverage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the excess liability coverage, Sentry assumed, subject to any applicable limitation and exclusion, the duty to \"pay on behalf of the insured the 'ultimate net loss' in excess of 'underlying insurance' because of[ ] ... \"Bodily injury\" ... to which this insurance applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177. \"Ultimate net loss\" is defined as \"the total sum, after reduction for recoveries ..., that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages by reason of settlement or judgments ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194. That part of the Policy provides: \"When the limits of the 'underlying insurance' have been used up in the payment of judgments or settlements, [Sentry] will have the[ ] ... duty to defend the insured against any 'suit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177. \" 'Underlying insurance' means any policies of insurance listed in the Declarations under the schedule of 'underlying insurance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198. The excess coverage does not apply to \" 'Bodily injury' ... to which 'underlying insurance' does not apply for any reason other than the exhaustion of 'underlying insurance' limits of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to the umbrella liability coverage, Sentry assumed, subject to any applicable limitation and exclusion, the duty to \"pay on behalf of the insured the 'ultimate net loss' in excess of the Retained Limit stated in the Declarations because of 'bodily injury' ... to which this insurance applies,\" but only if the \" '[underlying] insurance' does not apply,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 179; the Retained Limit as stated in the Declarations is \"none,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 172. The umbrella liability coverage section of the Policy provides: \"In the absence of 'underlying insurance', [Sentry] will have the[ ] ... duty to defend the insured against any 'suit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180. That section contains an exclusion that is identical to the \"Employer's Liability\" exclusion in the garage liability coverage part of the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Underlying Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 17, 2015, Villegas, through Andrea Juarez, brought the Underlying Lawsuit by filing her original petition, which named Ruiz as the sole defendant. State Ct. Pleadings at 1, ECF No. 40-4. Subsequently, Villegas filed multiple supplemental pleadings and joined Flores, Crawford, and the Rudolph Entities as defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to these pleadings, at the relevant time, Flores and Crawford were managers of Rudolph Mazda.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44 (\" ... Defendant RUDOLPH MAZDA managers (MARCELO FLORES and LYNN CRAWFORD ... \") );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   48 (describing Flores and Crawford as \"managers and vice principals of ... Rudolph Mazda\"). The pleadings refer to Villegas and Ruiz as the Rudolph Entities'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   sales people,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44 (\"Defendants RUDOLPH had its [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] sales people including Defendant RUIZ and IRMA VANESSA VILLEGAS ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The allegations in the Underlying Lawsuit were in part as follows: To further their business, the Rudolph Entities had their sales people, including Ruiz and Villegas, begin work at 9:00 am, provided lunch on their premises to keep them on premises and sell its inventory, and had a policy that the sales people would stay as long as needed, sometimes until 10:00 pm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. On December 27, 2013, Flores sent Ruiz to a store during working hours to buy beer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The beer was placed in the Rudolph Entities' refrigerator for consumption on their premises by sales people that night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Ruiz had consumed alcohol on Rudolph Mazda's premises with Flores and Crawford, he struck Villegas with his vehicle in the front sales/service area of Rudolph Mazda's premises at 1301 N. Lee Trevino Dr., El Paso, Texas; at the time, Villegas was a pedestrian crossing Rudolph Mazda's parking lot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 44. As a result of this collision, she sustained injuries to her head, neck, and other parts of her body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the Underlying Lawsuit, which is currently pending,\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Tr. Br. at 4, Villegas asserted several causes of action; among them were: negligence against Ruiz, negligence against Flores and Crawford, and vicarious liability against the Rudolph Entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-48. She claimed that Ruiz owed a degree of reasonable care on operation of a motor vehicle to Villegas and that the collision and Villegas's damages were proximately caused by Ruiz's negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. She averred that Flores and Crawford, Rudolph Mazda's managers, were individually negligent for purchasing and providing alcohol for their employees on business premises, knowing full well that the employees would have to drive a motor vehicle on the business premises as well as on the public streets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48. She claimed that the Rudolph Entities were vicariously liable for her damages and injuries, which were caused by the negligence of Ruiz, Flores, and Crawford.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. She also claimed that a joint venture/joint enterprise existed between Rudolph Chevrolet and Rudolph Mazda, and therefore they were jointly and severally liable for the damages sustained by her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46. She sought monetary relief over one million dollars and all other relief to which she is entitled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In October 2014, Sentry sent a reservation of right letter to the Rudolph Entities, after receiving notice of claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Renee Schude of Sentry to Soraya Hanshew, counsel for the Rudolph Entities, ECF No. 40-2. Therein, it took the position that there would be no coverage under the Policy if Villegas was in the course and scope of her employment at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

It argues that the only exclusion that may arguably exclude coverage is the Employer's\n   Liability exclusion, but the allegations in the Underlying Lawsuit show that the exclusion does not apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013321\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/517/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sentry disputes these arguments. The crux of Sentry's arguments is that the Employer's Liability exclusion excludes coverage, and therefore, it has no duty to defend or indemnity under the garage liability coverage. Pl.'s Tr. Br. at 15-21, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to the excess liability coverage, Sentry points out an exclusion in the excess liability coverage section of the Policy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Policy Excerpts at 177-78 (\"This insurance does not apply to[ ] ... 'Bodily injury' ... to which 'underlying insurance' does not apply for any reason other than the exhaustion of 'underlying insurance' limits of liability.\"), and argues that because the garage liability coverage (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the underlying insurance) would not apply to the Rudolph Entities (due to the Employer's Liability exclusion), the excess liability coverage would also not apply,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Tr.

Pl.'s Tr. Br. at 23. Consequently, it claims, for \"the same reason set forth above,\" \"no coverage would exist under the umbrella liability coverage\" of the Policy. Pl.'s Tr. Br. at 23. Defendants dispute Sentry's claims as to the excess and umbrella liability coverage, on the basis of the same argument that the Employer's Liability exclusion does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The Court addresses them in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (a) The Host Liquor Liability Coverage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The parties dispute only whether the December 27, 2013 beer consumption event at Rodolph Mazda's premises falls within the scope of the term \"function\" as used in the Host Liquor Liability coverage endorsement.

Defs.' Tr. Br. at 17-18. Sentry responds that the Host Liquor Liability provision \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   applies to company functions such as company Christmas parties, company picnics, etc.\" Pl.'s Tr. Br. at 21 (emphasis added). Characterizing the event as a gathering of \"a few employees ...
