Significantly, Defendants Carroll and Nogueras cited to\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   in their Motions to Dismiss to support their position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [113] at 9; ECF No. [114] at 9. Plaintiff, however, did not address or otherwise attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   in response to their Motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [123] at 9-10; ECF No. [125] at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Applying these principles to this case, the Court must first look to Plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations under \u00a7 1983 to determine whether they are inextricably intertwined with the state court dependency proceedings. Plaintiff asserts (1) a violation of his First Amendment right to associate with his children, (2) a violation of his Fourth Amendment right against unlawful seizure of his children, and (3) a violation of his Fifth Amendment right against the unlawful taking of his children and right to due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [60], Counts I through X. In each of the \u00a7 1983 counts, Plaintiff alleges that he had a \"constitutional right to raise and live with his children as a family\" and that he was deprived of such a right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202970522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He further states that Defendants deprived him of his constitutional right against unlawful interference with the family unit without affording him due process of law and without reasonable suspicion or conducting a credible investigation before seizing his children.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202970522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result of these violations, he seeks damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202970522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If Plaintiff is to succeed on his \u00a7 1983 claims, it would require a finding that he was unlawfully deprived of his children during the course of the dependency proceedings without due process, which would in turn require a finding that the state dependency court wrongly removed the children from his custody. Much like in\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations here \"strike at the heart\" of the dependency judge's decision to place the children in the custody of their biological mother and in foster care. Thus, the claims are indeed inextricably intertwined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court must next determine whether Plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to present his constitutional claims in the dependency court. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff states that he participated in the dependency proceedings, alleging that DCF held at least 30 hearings in an attempt to harass him and defame his character.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [60] at \u00b6 39. Such proceedings were ongoing for more than two years.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [60]. Thus, Plaintiff, as a participant in the proceedings, had a reasonable opportunity to challenge the falsity of Defendant's claims before the dependency court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9501740\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/1327/#p1332\">\n    259 F.3d at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that parties to the dependency proceeding who were present and participated had \"a reasonable opportunity to bring their constitutional challenges\" in state court);\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Further, Plaintiff successfully challenged the falsity of the claims made against him as the Amended Complaint alleges that the dependency\n   court acknowledged the compelling evidence that the children should be placed back in Plaintiff's custody and that continuing supervision should be terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims are inextricably intertwined with the state court's decision to temporarily remove the children from Plaintiff's custody during the course of the dependency proceedings and as Plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to raise his claims before that state tribunal, the Court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in Counts I through X under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Having reached this conclusion, the Court must\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   determine whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's remaining state-law claims for negligence, abuse of process, IIED, and malicious prosecution in Counts XI through XXXVI. A \"district court may act\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    Herskowitz v.
