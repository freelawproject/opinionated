The court concluded that plaintiffs' claims \"touch and concern\" the \"territory of the United States with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application\" of the ATS; however, the court was \"unable to determine\" from the record developed at that time whether plaintiffs' claims \"present nonjusticiable political questions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157784\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/516/#p527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157784\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/516/#p527\">\n    at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

[Dkt. No. 507]. After the close of discovery, CACI filed a Motion to Dismiss, in which it argued that the political question doctrine deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. [Dkt.

Under this test, such lawsuits are nonjusticiable if \"the government contractor was under the 'plenary' or 'direct' control of the military\" or if \"national defense interests were 'closely intertwined' with military decisions governing the contractor's conduct, such that a decision on the merits of the claim 'would require the judiciary to question actual, sensitive judgments made by the military.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n    658 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   411 ). After reviewing the evidence in the record, Judge Lee found that plaintiffs' claims failed under both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   test. First, he concluded that \"the military exercised 'plenary' and 'direct' control over\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   Defendants interrogated detainees at Abu Ghraib\" and that the \"military clearly chose\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to carry out tasks related to the interrogation mission, while CACI had no discretion in any operational matters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n    at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, he found that the judiciary \"is simply not equipped to make judgments as to whether the techniques approved by the military were appropriate-a judgment that would no doubt come into question during adjudication of the merits of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n    at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, he concluded that \"the national defense interests are so closely intertwined with military decisions governing Defendant's conduct\" that \"a decision on the merits of the claim would require the judiciary to question actual, sensitive judgments made by the military.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Judge Lee concluded that the court lacked judicially manageable standards for evaluating plaintiffs' claims, both because the court lacked expertise in matters of foreign law, which might govern some of plaintiffs' claims, and because there was \"ambiguity surrounding the elements\" of each ATS claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836013\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/402/#p404\">\n    at 449-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, the Fourth Circuit held that although the decisions of a contractor under actual control of the military are considered to be\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   military decisions, \"the military cannot lawfully exercise its authority by directing a contractor to engage in unlawful activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n    at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court held \"that a contractor's acts may be shielded from judicial review under the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   only to the extent that those acts (1) were committed under actual control of the military; and (2) were not unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With respect to the second\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factor, the Fourth Circuit found that the district court conducted an \"incomplete\" analysis because it \"fail[ed] to draw a distinction between unlawful conduct and discretionary acts that were not unlawful when committed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n    at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit held that \"to the extent that the plaintiffs' claims rest on allegations of unlawful conduct in violation of settled international law or criminal law then applicable to the CACI employees, those claims fall outside the protection of the political question doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, with respect to the application of the political question doctrine, the Fourth Circuit held\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   that any conduct of the CACI employees that occurred under the actual control of the military or involved sensitive military judgments, and was not unlawful when committed, constituted a protected exercise of discretion under the political question doctrine.

With respect to the application of the political question doctrine, the Fourth Circuit has held that \"any acts of the CACI employees that were unlawful when committed ... are subject to judicial review\" and, accordingly, that \"plaintiffs' claims are justiciable to the extent that the challenged conduct violated settled international law or the criminal law to which the CACI employees were subject at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n    840 F.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Over the course of six weeks, Al-Ejaili was subjected to repeated stress positions, including at least one that\n   made him vomit black liquid; sexually-related humiliation; disruptive sleeping patterns and long periods of being kept naked or without food or water; and multiple instances of being threatened with dogs. The approximately ten to twelve times he was interrogated involved systematic beatings, including to the head, and being doused with hot and cold liquids. Al-Zuba'e was subjected to sexual assault and threats of rape; being left in a cold shower until he was unable to stand; dog bites and repeated beatings, including with sticks and to the genitals; repeated stress positions, including at least one that lasted an entire day and resulted in his urinating and defecating on himself; and threats that his family would be brought to Abu Ghraib. Al Shimari was subjected to systematic beatings, including on his head and genitals, with a baton and rifle, and some where he was hit against the wall; multiple stress positions, including one where he was forced to kneel on sharp stones, causing lasting damage to his legs; being threatened with dogs; a cold shower similar to Al-Zuba'e's, being doused with water, and being kept in a dark cell and with loud music nearby; threats of being shot and having his wife brought to Abu Ghraib; electric shocks; being dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck; and having fingers inserted into his rectum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Beyond the obvious physical pain caused by this abuse, plaintiffs have also submitted evidence explaining how many of the tactics employed by interrogators were specifically designed to mentally and emotionally harm plaintiffs by breaking cultural and religious norms. According to a report authored by Dr. Mohammad Fadel, a law professor and expert on Islamic theology and law, the forced nudity, particularly in front of females, and sexual humiliation described by plaintiffs \"represent gross violations of Muslim norms of sexual propriety.\" Pl. Opp. Ex. I \u00b6 24. Islamic teaching, which is \"further reflected in ... [c]ultural taboos surrounding nudity and sex roles in many Muslim societies,\" instills \"a sense of modesty and bashfulness with respect to the human body (particularly when naked) and human sexuality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Because of Islamic teachings on the subject, a \"Muslim would ordinarily feel deep shame, if not outright humiliation, at being forced to be naked in front of other members of the same sex, to say nothing of being naked in front of members of the different sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Moreover, the interrogators' exploitation of phobias and use of solitary confinement and sleep deprivation are commonly used torture tactics that \"are equally destructive as physical torture methods\"-indeed, the suffering caused by these tactics \"is very often aggravated by the lack of acknowledgment, due to the lack of scars, which leads to [survivors'] accounts very often being brushed away as mere allegations.\" Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, UN Doc. A/HRC/13/39/Add.5 \u00b6 55 (Feb. 5, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   There is evidence in the record that this mistreatment has caused severe and lasting physical and mental damage to all three plaintiffs. Each has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder, and each has submitted an expert report detailing how these mental illnesses have caused significant problems in plaintiffs' personal and professional lives up through today. In addition, each plaintiff still suffers from physical symptoms, including pain and scarring, from the mistreatment. Accordingly, based simply on the plain meaning of the words \"severe physical or mental pain or suffering,\" it is clear that plaintiffs' mistreatment rises to the level of torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court's conclusion that plaintiffs were tortured is also well-supported by case law interpreting and applying the\n   prohibition against torture. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Al-Saher v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1949931\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/1143/#p1147\">\n    268 F.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (9th Cir. 2001), the court overturned the Board of Immigration Appeals, finding that plaintiff's description of interrogators using their hands and feet as well as electrical wires to deliver \"sustained beatings\" during plaintiff's month in Iraqi custody and, separately, his description of \"severe beatings\" and being \"burned with cigarettes over an 8 to 10 day period\" amounted to torture as defined in the Convention Against Torture.\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abebe-Jira v.

Mass. 1995) (finding \"torture\" for purposes of an ATS claim and awarding $3,000,000 in damages where plaintiff was interrogated for fourteen hours and, during that time period, beaten with interrogators' hands and guns, put inside thick plastic bags, and had a knife held to his head).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In each of these cases, the tortured plaintiffs' experiences were shorter and involved a narrower array of mistreatment than those of plaintiffs here, and, unlike plaintiffs here, there is no indication in these cases that the plaintiffs were diagnosed with severe and lasting mental illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. Moreover, plaintiffs here were, like plaintiffs in each of these cases, severely beaten, including with objects and in sensitive areas such as the head and genitals. Accordingly, there is ample case law applying the prohibition against torture that supports the Court's conclusion that the mistreatment plaintiffs suffered constitutes torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Lastly, the Court's conclusion is further reinforced by international law and domestic executive and military sources, which clearly identify the abuse experienced by plaintiffs as torture.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Headquarters, Department of the Army, FM 34-52: Intelligence Interrogation \u00a7 1-8 (including \"[e]lectric shocks\"; \"[i]nfliction of pain\" through \"bondage\"; \"[f]orcing an individual to stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; \"[f]ood deprivation\"; \"[a]ny form of beating\"; and \"[a]bnormal sleep deprivation\" as examples of torture and cautioning that these \"illegal acts are not authorized\" and \"are\n   criminal acts punishable under the\" Uniform Code of Military Justice)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Report on Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, S.

A/52/44 (1997) (concluding that methods including \"restraining in very painful conditions\"; \"hooding under special conditions\"; \"sounding of loud music\" and \"sleep deprivation\" for \"prolonged periods\"; \"threats, including death threats\"; \"violent shaking\"; and \"using cold air to chill\" constitute torture and stating that this \"conclusion is particularly evident where such methods of interrogation are used in combination\"). Again, plaintiffs were subjected to nearly all of the methods of torture identified in these documents, often repeatedly and in combination with each other, and a variety of other techniques that were designed to cause severe physical and mental pain. Accordingly, it is clear that the mistreatment of plaintiffs constitutes torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having determined that plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently describe severe physical and mental pain and suffering to constitute torture, it is clear that they have also sufficiently alleged CIDT and war crimes. In the War Crimes Act, CIDT is defined as the \"act of a person who commits, or conspires or attempts to commit, an act intended to inflict severe or serious physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions), including serious physical abuse, upon another within his custody or control.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202441\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B). Accordingly, any mistreatment that rises to the level of torture-or severe physical or mental pain or suffering-must definitionally also constitute CIDT-which only requires severe or serious physical or mental pain or suffering. Moreover, the War Crimes Act includes both torture and CIDT as war crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266291\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/595/\">\n    263 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   605 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202441\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because plaintiffs' allegations have sufficiently alleged facts supporting their claims of being subjected to torture and CIDT, they have also sufficiently alleged the commission of war crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Therefore, plaintiffs' allegations-and the evidence they have produced in support of those allegations-describe sufficiently serious misconduct to constitute torture, CIDT, and war crimes, all of which violated settled international law at the time-and still do. Accordingly, plaintiffs have appropriately stated a claim under the ATS and the political question doctrine is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IV. DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Direct Liability Claims (Counts 1, 4, and 7)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   CACI argues that plaintiffs' direct liability claims-Counts 1, 4, and 7-should be dismissed because the \"TAC does not allege that a CACI PT employee directly injured\" plaintiffs. Def. Mem. 26. Plaintiffs respond to this argument in a footnote, conceding that \"the gravamen of Plaintiffs' complaint is conspiracy and aiding and abetting\" but arguing that \"the TAC does include allegations of direct contact between CACI and Plaintiffs.\" Pl. Opp. 31 n.30 (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 124, 133, 141-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although plaintiffs' claim that the TAC alleges some direct contact between CACI personnel and plaintiffs is correct, the few connections described in the TAC are insufficient to state a plausible claim for relief. One of the contacts alleged by the TAC is that Stefanowicz conducted one interrogation of Al-Ejaili before being told to stop by a military intelligence interrogator who was responsible for Al-Ejaili's interrogation program and that Stefanowicz may have violated the Interrogation Rules of Engagement during that interrogation. TAC \u00b6 124. This allegation is not sufficient to plausibly establish Stefanowicz's direct liability because there are no allegations about the specific conduct in which Stefanowicz engaged during this lone interrogation. The second contact alleged by the TAC is that in an interrogation report on Al Shimari, \"an unknown individual from CACI PT was listed as having the 'Lead' interrogation role under the heading 'Related Interrogators.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202441\">\n    \u00b6 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This allegation is again insufficient to establish CACI's direct liability because there are no allegations about what conduct the lead interrogator him or herself actually engaged in-rather than directing military police or other subordinates to engage in. The final direct contact alleged by the TAC is that a naked Al-Ejaili once asked Johnson for some information about his case but Johnson \"just smiled and went away\" and that Johnson was among the people who ordered \"Al-Ejaili to face the wall and then proceed[ed] to talk about 'what to do with' him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202441\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This allegation is also insufficient to establish CACI's direct liability because there is no explanation of conduct engaged in by Johnson personally that could rise to the level of torture, CIDT, or war crimes-instead, this allegation seems to place Johnson in a supervisory role, conspiring with and directing subordinates who themselves actually engaged in the torture of Al-Ejaili. Therefore, plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient plausibly to establish CACI's direct liability.

CACI argues that plaintiffs' conspiracy claims must be dismissed for failure to state a claim because the facts alleged do not support a conspiratorial agreement rather than mere parallel conduct. CACI also argues that plaintiffs have not alleged a plausible motive for CACI to enter into the conspiracies, that only a person with authority or with influence on a decisionmaker with authority can enter into a conspiracy on behalf of the corporation, and that a corporation may not be held liable for the acts of its employee's co-conspirators under a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory. CACI's arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs' TAC contains substantial factual allegations to support an inference that CACI employees entered into an agreement with other personnel at the Hard Site to subject the detainees at the site, including plaintiffs, to torture, CIDT, and war crimes. The TAC alleges that, in the small and confined universe of the Hard Site, CACI interrogators explicitly instructed MPs to \"soften up\" detainees to prepare them for interrogation and that CACI interrogators, including some who are identified by name, ordered various military personnel to \"set the conditions\" for detainees and \"actually ordered\" the most severe forms of abuse. These instructions evince an agreement among both CACI interrogators and military personnel at the Hard Site to abuse detainees in an attempt to make them more amenable to interrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the TAC alleges that CACI interrogations and military personnel used and understood various code words, such as \"doggie dance,\" which is further evidence of a widespread agreement at the Hard Site to engage in this misconduct. In addition, the TAC's allegation that CACI employees and military personnel worked together at the Hard Site to hide evidence of this abuse, such as by concealing detainees from Red Cross inspectors, further supports plaintiffs' claim that CACI employees had entered into the alleged conspiracies. Lastly, based on the TAC's allegations of plaintiffs' public and sustained mistreatment, as well as the admissions that the conduct that occurred at Abu Ghraib represented serious criminal activity, the very willingness of CACI interrogators and military personnel to engage in this conduct indicates an agreement among the personnel at the site because it is natural to expect that, in the absence of such an agreement, the personnel would have found it necessary to conceal such misconduct from each other. These factual allegations establish that it is more than plausible that CACI employees and military personnel entered into an agreement to torture detainees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Moreover, the TAC contains substantial factual allegations that reach beyond\n   CACI's on-site employees and plausibly demonstrate CACI management's participation in the conspiracies. The TAC alleges that CACI refused to act on specific reports of misconduct perpetrated by its employees, instead covering up the misconduct and furthering the conspiracies. Specifically, the TAC alleges multiple instances where CACI employees or military personnel reported to \"upper management\" that CACI interrogators and military personnel were engaging in detainee abuse and that CACI managers failed to report this abuse to the military-or even ensure that CACI's own employees stopped the abuse. Indeed, the TAC alleges that CACI management sought to fire at least one individual for reporting misconduct directly to the military. Moreover, CACI's intent to promote these conspiracies is evidenced by CACI's promotion of Stefanowicz to CACI's site lead at Abu Ghraib even after the military recommended disciplining him for his role in the abuse, as well as CACI's refusal to remove employees from the site despite credible reports of misconduct and, in at least one case, an explicit request from military officials to remove the CACI employee from the contract. Moreover, the TAC alleges that various CACI managers were either stationed at the Hard Site or regularly visited Abu Ghraib and that CACI's executive team regularly reviewed reports from these individuals. As such, the TAC plausibly alleges that CACI's senior management were aware of the ongoing abuse at the Hard Site, and CACI's decisions not to report this abuse and, in fact, to continue employing and even promoting the individuals involved constitute plausible evidence of an intent from the highest levels of the company to enter into the conspiracies that had developed among CACI's employees and military personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The TAC also alleges sufficient facts to overcome CACI's argument that only individuals who are in authority, or who influence those with authority, may validly enter into a conspiracy on behalf of a corporation. In support of this argument, CACI cites to two Fourth Circuit decisions examining employer liability, but neither case is helpful because each is limited to employment discrimination lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. 28 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

As these decisions make clear, their analysis is limited to the employment discrimination context, where Congress has \"evince[d] an intent to place some limits on the acts of employees for which employers ... are to be held responsible.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294800\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/277/#p289\">\n    354 F.3d at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). CACI has pointed to no evidence or case law to support the idea that Congress has expressed a similar intent in the ATS context. Moreover, a closer examination of\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   actually undercuts CACI's position. According to\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , limiting an employer's employment discrimination liability to actions taken by supervisors is reasonable because the \"supervisor has been empowered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294800\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/277/#p289\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burlington Indus., Inc. v.

In other words,\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   explains that Congress made a decision to limit employer liability in the discrimination context to those actions taken by individuals whose job involves employment-related decisions such as hiring, firing, and promotion. In this case, the alleged conspiracies involved mistreatment of detainees in an attempt to soften them up for interrogation. The CACI interrogators' jobs unquestionably included making the decisions-about how to treat detainees in preparation for interrogation-that\n   were involved in entering into and advancing these conspiracies. Accordingly, the interrogators in this case are situated similarly to supervisors in an employment discrimination case, as the employees whose jobs involve making the decisions relevant to the misconduct alleged, and, even under the logic of\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , CACI should be held responsible for the interrogators' decision to enter into the conspiracies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, even if an employee without authority to bind CACI may not appropriately enter into a conspiracy on CACI's behalf, CACI may be held liable for its employees' participation in the conspiracies-including for tortious acts committed by its employees' co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracies. In arguing otherwise, CACI primarily relies on\n   <em>\n    Oki Semiconductor Co. v. Wells Fargo Bank. National Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451733\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/768/#p776\">\n    298 F.3d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776-77 (9th Cir. 2002), which held that the employer was \"not vicariously liable for [its employee's] conduct\" because the employee \"did not conspire to violate [the statute] within the course and scope of her employment.\" This holding is distinguishable because unlike the employee in\n   <em>\n    Oki Semiconductor\n   </em>\n   , the CACI interrogators' actions were undeniably related to and within the scope of their employment. The entire purpose of their employment was to direct the interrogation of detainees at the Hard Site-and the goal of the conspiracies was to design and implement a program of abuse to facilitate successful interrogations. Additionally, there are sufficient allegations in the TAC that interrogators entered into the conspiracies within the scope of their employment to deny dismissing the conspiracy counts under CACI's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   argument.\n   <em>\n    Respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability \"balances the benefits an employer receives from an employee against the liabilities an employer incurs as a result of its employee's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451733\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/768/#p776\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451733\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/768/#p776\">\n    at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the alleged conspiracies were directly related to the interrogators' employment, CACI had an ability to monitor the interrogators to ensure that they did not enter into the conspiracies-and, as the TAC alleges, to appropriately screen and train interrogators before sending them to Abu Ghraib and to discipline interrogators who committed transgressions. Moreover, CACI stood to benefit directly from its interrogators' actions because the facilitation of successful interrogations would please its most important client, the United States military, and perhaps position it to gain future contracts with the military. When balancing benefits and liabilities, it is clear that CACI had an ability to head off the entry into these conspiracies and that CACI itself benefitted from its employees' participation in the conspiracies. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability is appropriate. In addition to being compelled by the logic of the\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   doctrine, this conclusion is supported by case law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Alcolac, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836875\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/388/#p401\">\n    658 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401 (4th Cir. 2011). In arguing that plaintiffs have failed to allege such facts, CACI relies on the same argument that it made with respect to the conspiracy claims: that plaintiffs \"rely on parallel conduct allegations\" that \"do not support an inference that [CACI] somehow provided substantial assistance to whomever might have injured\" them or that CACI had the purpose of facilitating those injuries. Def. Mem. 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply 18 (\"Plaintiffs' aiding and abetting claims are essentially duplicative of their conspiracy claims.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the same reason that CACI's arguments in support of dismissing the conspiracy claims fail, their argument in support of dismissing the aiding and abetting claims fails. Plaintiffs have appropriately alleged, as described above, that CACI personnel substantially aided the military personnel responsible for directly carrying out the abuses, including directing them on how to set the conditions of confinement, ordering them to employ various abusive tactics, and helping them conceal the abuses. Moreover, upper-level management at CACI substantially aided these continued abuses by refusing to inform the military of reports that CACI and military personnel were abusing detainees and by continuing to employ-and even promote-interrogators engaging in the abuses. In addition, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that CACI's and its employees' actions to aid the abuses were undertaken with the necessary purpose of facilitating the abusive conduct because the goal of the abusive regime was to \"soften up\" the detainees to convince them to cooperate with CACI's interrogators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   This conclusion is further supported by a closer examination of\n   <em>\n    Aziz\n   </em>\n   , the primary case on which CACI relies. In\n   <em>\n    Aziz\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant chemical manufacturing company had sold thiodiglycol (\"TDG\"), a chemical with \"many lawful commercial applications,\" including \"dyeing textiles and producing inks,\" to a shell corporation in Brooklyn, New York and that the TDG shipments it sent to the company in Brooklyn eventually made their way-apparently through a different Swiss company-to Iraq, where Saddam Hussein used the TDG to manufacture mustard gas that he employed in chemical attacks against Kurdish enclaves in northern Iraq.\n   <em>\n    Aziz\n   </em>\n   , 658 F.3d at 389-91. The plaintiffs attempted to sue the defendant under the ATS for aiding and abetting the Iraqi regime's use of the chemical weapons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' ATS claims because the \"sole reference to [the defendant's] intentional conduct in the Amended Complaint [wa]s an allegation that [the defendant] placed [the TDG] 'into the stream of international commerce with the purpose of facilitating the use of said chemicals in the manufacture of chemical weapons to be used, among other things, against the Kurdish population in northern Iraq.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401 (quoting Am. Compl. \u00b6 53). The Fourth Circuit found that this \"cursory allegation\" in the plaintiffs' Amended Complaint was \"untethered to any supporting facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, as described above, plaintiffs' TAC in this civil action contains a wealth of factual allegations explaining who committed or directed particular forms of abuse, what the abuse involved, who was aware of the abuse and concealed it, and the motivation for committing the abuses. Accordingly, plaintiffs' TAC alleges exactly the supporting facts for which the\n   <em>\n    Aziz\n   </em>\n   court was searching, and these facts render plausible the ultimate inference that CACI and its employees purposefully aided the violations of international law in order to facilitate the interrogations of plaintiffs. For these reasons, Counts 3, 6, and 9 will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   V. PREEMPTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Lastly, CACI argues that various doctrines of preemption bar plaintiffs' claims. Specifically, CACI argues that the Constitutional allocation of war powers and the combatant activities exception to the FTCA preempt incorporation of the law of nations through the ATS. CACI also argues that CPA Order 17 limits plaintiffs to an administrative claim and that Congress's enactment of the TVPA displaces the power of federal courts to recognize a cause of action for torture under the ATS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Constitutional Preemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   CACI first argues that the \"Constitution's allocation of war powers precludes ATS claims arising out of the United States' conduct of war\" because the \"Constitution expressly commits this Nation's foreign policy and war powers to the federal government.\" Def. Mem. 36 (formatting and capitalization altered). Therefore, CACI argues that the \"Constitution does not allow international law, or the law of any foreign sovereign, to govern the prosecution of war by the United States ... [n]or does the Constitution contemplate a judicial role in this area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of an ATS claim. Although norms of international law are incorporated by the ATS-and, of course, the judiciary must often interpret and apply the ATS-the ATS is itself a federal statute. As such, the ATS embodies Congress's considered determination that there should be a cause of action in federal district court for violations of the law of nations. Accordingly, CACI's argument that the Constitution allocates war powers to Congress and the President only serves to illustrate why plaintiffs' claims are not preempted: because applying the ATS in this context represents the constitutional exercise of Congress's inherent powers to regulate the conduct of war. The incorporation of international law into the ATS and the judicial role in interpreting and applying the statute do not change the fundamental nature of the statute as an exercise of congressional power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In support of its argument, CACI primarily relies on the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n    580 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the court held that the plaintiffs' state law tort claims were preempted by federal law and that the plaintiffs' claims of abuse were not actionable under the ATS. Although the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   decision is admittedly not entirely clear, it appears to hold only that \"torture committed by a state is recognized as a violation of a settled international norm\" but that the same \"cannot be said of private actors\" and, accordingly, that the plaintiffs could not maintain a claim for torture against a private contractor under the ATS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n    at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's discussion of the \"foreign policy prerogatives of our legislative and executive branches,\" which CACI apparently reads as support for an independent argument that the Constitution preempts the ATS, actually appears to be merely a reminder of one of the reasons that\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   requires that any norm supporting an ATS claim be \"specific, universal, and obligatory.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the Court has already determined that the international norms prohibiting torture, CIDT, and war crimes were sufficiently specific, universal, and obligatory at the time of the alleged\n   abuse to allow plaintiffs to maintain their ATS claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266291\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/595/\">\n    263 F.Supp.3d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   's discussion of the allocation of foreign policy authority in the Constitution is irrelevant to the question currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Therefore, although the Constitution provides the legislative and executive branches with primary authority in the conduct of war, nothing in the Constitution can be read to \"preempt\" the application of the ATS to plaintiffs' claims. Indeed, the ATS represents Congress's determination, in accordance with its war powers, that victims of violations of international law should have a remedy in federal district courts. Thus, the Constitution does not preempt plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     FTCA Preemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   CACI also argues that the combatant activities exception to the FTCA preempts plaintiffs' ATS claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) (excepting any \"claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war\" from the provisions of the FTCA). In support of this argument, CACI again relies primarily on the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the court recognized that a \"significant conflict between federal interests and state law\" must exist for the federal law to preempt the state law and observed that \"the reason[ ] for the combat activities exception\" is that \"such activities by their very nature should be free from the hindrance of a possible damage suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n    580 F.3d at 5-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the court identified various potential conflicts between state tort law and the federal interest embodied by the combatant activities exception, all centered on the idea of \"battle-field preemption,\" or the concept that \"the federal government occupies the field when it comes to warfare, and its interest in combat\n   is always precisely contrary to the imposition of a non-federal tort duty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057490,3546735\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1/\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

In\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   , the court was concerned with the conflict between federal policy-as embodied in the FTCA-and state tort law; however, in the present civil action, plaintiffs' claims are exclusively brought pursuant to federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, respecting federal interests requires enforcing the federal law upon which plaintiffs rely, and Congress's decisions to pass both the FTCA and the ATS require the Court to harmonize the two statutes rather than find that one preempts the other. In this case, the harmonization is clear: although Congress has decided that the federal government is not itself amenable to suit for activities arising out of combatant activities, it has not extended that immunity to private contractors operating alongside military forces. Instead, it has determined that such contractors, like any other defendant, should be liable in federal district court when they commit violations of the law of nations.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Shimari IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173136\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/147/\">\n    840 F.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that Congress has \"established criminal penalties for commission of acts constituting torture and war crimes,\" which is indicative of the federal interest in eliminating such behavior). Moreover, the dictates of the ATS are far less intrusive than the state tort law preempted in\n   <em>\n    Saleh\n   </em>\n   , both because the ATS represents a single regime of liability, rather than fifty-one separate regimes, and because the ATS, unlike traditional tort law, only recognizes a small number of particularly egregious intentional torts-those committed in violation of the law of nations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the FTCA does not preempt plaintiffs' ATS claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     CPA Order 17 Preemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   CACI further argues that the ATS claims are preempted by Section 6 of CPA Order 17, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Third party claims including those for property loss or damage and for personal injury, illness or death or in respect of any other matter arising from or attributed to Coalition personnel or any persons employed by them, whether normally resident in Iraq or not and that do not arise in connection with military combat operations, shall be submitted and dealt with by the Parent State\n   whose Coalition personnel, property, activities or other assets are alleged to have caused the claimed damage, in a manner consistent with the national laws of the Parent State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   CPA Order 17, \u00a7 6(1). CACI argues that CPA Order 17 \"establishes that if a claimant's injury arises out of noncombat operations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   under Section 6, the claimant shall submit a[n administrative] claim to the Parent State (here, the United States) where it will be dealt with under national law (here, the Foreign Claims Act).\" Def. Mem. 41-42. According to CACI, \"CPA Order 17 thus prohibits tort claims by Iraqis alleging injury at the hands of Coalition personnel, and instead requires submission of an administrative claim to the Parent State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   CACI's argument is not supported by the text of CPA Order 17. According to the Order, assuming plaintiffs' claims are covered, they must be dealt with by the United States \"in a manner consistent with the national laws.\" CPA Order 17, \u00a7 6. The ATS is, of course, just as much a \"national law\" of the United States as is the Foreign Claims Act, and allowing plaintiffs to pursue their claims under the ATS is, based on the plain language of the Order, treating the claims in a manner consistent with American law. Moreover, and even more fundamentally, CPA Order 17 was promulgated to ensure that Coalition forces were not subject to Iraqi law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Preamble (\"Recalling that under international law occupying powers, including their forces, personnel, property and equipment, funds and assets, are not subject to the laws or jurisdiction of the occupied territory\"). Accordingly, based on the intent behind CPA Order 17, all it directs is that injured parties may not bring their claims in Iraqi courts; however, it does not make any pronouncements about how various Coalition states' domestic laws should treat these claims.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGee v.

Lastly, CACI provides no authority for the fundamental premise of this argument: that an Order promulgated by the head of the CPA-and not approved by Congress-can somehow preempt federal domestic law. Accordingly, CPA Order 17 does not bar plaintiffs' ATS claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Legislative Preemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Lastly, CACI argues that Congress's enactment of the ATA and the TVPA preempt the creation of a cause of action for torture under the ATS. The ATA, a federal criminal statute with extraterritorial application, criminalizes acts of torture, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340A, but provides that the statute should not \"be construed as creating any substantive or procedural right enforceable by law by any party in any civil proceeding,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873461\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/539/#p544\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2340B. The TVPA creates a private cause of action against individuals who commit acts of torture under authority or color of law of a foreign nation, but it does not reach corporate entities or American officials.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (note).

The cause of action in that case was not authorized by Congress or otherwise established by statute. Instead, the plaintiffs sought to vindicate a purely common law right. The Supreme Court held that in such circumstances, \"congressional legislation excludes the declaration of federal common law\" when the legislation \"speak[s] directly to [the] question at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 424,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920054,12450494\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2527/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).

First, as discussed above, although recognition of causes of action under the ATS requires judicial interpretation of the statute and analysis of international law norms, the ATS is itself a congressional enactment that reflects Congress's decision to provide a cause of action for victims of violations of the law of nations. Accordingly, plaintiffs' ATS claims are grounded in federal statute, not merely in federal common law like the claims in\n   <em>\n    AEP\n   </em>\n   . As such, the claims cannot be so easily displaced by other federal statutes, which are entitled to no more respect than the ATS. Second, the\n   <em>\n    AEP\n   </em>\n   Court relied on the Clean Air Act's containing a means for plaintiffs to seek the same relief that they sought in their federal civil action. In this case, CACI agrees that the ATA and the TVPA do not provide an avenue for plaintiffs to pursue their claims against CACI. As such, allowing plaintiffs' claims to proceed is not an example of the judiciary using federal common law to invent a \"parallel track\" to a process designed by Congress. Therefore, other legislation does not displace the ATS and plaintiffs' claims will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   VI.

Furthermore, CACI does not dispute that it is unlawful to conspire to commit unlawful activity or to aid and abet the commission of unlawful activity. Accordingly, the Court's focus at this juncture is on whether the allegations of abuse rise to the level of unlawful torture, CIDT, or war crimes, because if so, the allegations support a finding that CACI's activity was illegal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Although CACI has focused on each alleged type of abuse individually because it \"found it analytically useful to evaluate allegations of mistreatment by type,\" Def.

The parties have not briefed this issue, but the Court observes that CACI itself repeatedly argues that the Constitution confers war-related powers on both the President and on Congress.
