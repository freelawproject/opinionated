Plaintiff Jenny Cintron, who is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed this suit\n   against defendant JetBlue Airways Corporation. Cintron has hearing and vision impairments due a brain tumor and subsequent surgery. She was removed from a JetBlue flight after she did not hear the flight attendant's safety instructions and then touched his back to get his attention. According to Cintron, without listening to her explanation, the flight attendant complained to the captain, and she was removed from the aircraft. She was rebooked on a JetBlue flight at no extra cost the next day, but she alleges that she was humiliated and suffered emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The amended complaint does not identify specific legal claims, but appears to assert a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   JetBlue has moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the following reasons, the motion to dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because Cintron is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court will construe her pleadings liberally. The following facts are taken from her complaint, her amended complaint, and her memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jenny Cintron is a 57-year-old woman who lives in Lynn, Massachusetts. She is originally from Puerto Rico and is a native Spanish speaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2014, she developed a brain tumor that was surgically removed. The tumor and the surgery caused her to become partially disabled. (Am. Compl. at 1). She suffers from a total loss of hearing in her right ear and a 40% loss in her left ear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She also suffers a vision impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following her illness, Cintron went into early retirement and left her position as a Director of Action for Boston Community Development, Inc., where she had been working for almost 29 years. (Pl. Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 5). In the aftermath of her illness and recovery, she \"had to learn[ ] how to do everything all over again as [she] was a baby,\" and depended on her family for help. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6). She suffered from depression due to her sudden disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). She alleges that she had difficulty recovering from the loss of her career and struggled to find her identity and purpose again after her illness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She underwent months of psychotherapy sessions and medical treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   JetBlue Airways Corporation is a commercial air carrier. On December 28, 2016, Cintron boarded a JetBlue flight from Boston to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she was going to visit some relatives for the first time following her illness. (Am. Compl. at 1). Cintron and her family were seated in the aircraft emergency exit row. (Pl. Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 1). After boarding, she sat down in the middle seat, settled in for the flight, fastened her seatbelt, and started looking at her phone. (Am. Compl. at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because of her hearing impairment and the noise on the aircraft, Cintron did not notice when the flight attendant started talking to her and her family about safety regulations for sitting in an exit row. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Her uncle, who was sitting next to her on the aisle side, touched her to get her attention, and realizing that the flight attendant was talking to her, she stood up and turned her head to listen with her left ear. (Compl. at 1; Am. Compl. at 2). At that moment, the flight attendant told her, allegedly in a rude voice, \"Pay attention, I am talking with you, are you deaf?\" He walked away before she could answer. (Am. Compl. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cintron immediately got up to explain the situation to the flight attendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As he was walking away, she touched his back to get his attention because she did not know his name, and asked him why he had spoken to her in that manner. (Compl. at 1-2; Am. Compl. at 2). However, the flight attendant kept walking without giving her a chance to say more, so she went back to her seat and started crying. (Am. Compl. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cintron's family helped her calm down, and she had composed herself when a second flight attendant came over and asked her to come to the front of the aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Two police officers were waiting with the captain to escort her off the plane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4). She tried to explain that there was a misunderstanding due to her disability, and offered to apologize to the flight attendant, but the captain said that the flight attendant did not like that she had touched him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). After the two police officers escorted her off the aircraft with her husband, she spoke with an airline supervisor, who appeared more sympathetic to her situation, but explained that she did not have the authority to go against the captain's decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Cintron was rebooked at no extra cost for a flight the next day, and was offered a taxi voucher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That night, according to Cintron, she had a nervous breakdown caused by the humiliation of being escorted off the plane combined with the distress that she had been experiencing during her recovery from the brain tumor. (Am. Compl. at 4; Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 7). She overmedicated herself with sleeping pills, and was sick and bedridden for the following three days after landing in Puerto Rico. (Am. Compl. at 4-5; Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 4, 2017, Cintron received an e-mail from JetBlue apologizing for what they called a lapse in customer service. (Pl. Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the incident, Cintron had to increase her therapy sessions and her medications again due to the emotional distress she experienced, and she still has nightmares about the event. (Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 26, 2017, Cintron filed a complaint against JetBlue in the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, claiming egregious conduct, physical and mental harm, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and emotional trauma. (Compl. at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She initially served JetBlue at the wrong address, and on January 24, 2018, she filed a request to extend the deadline to complete service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Ct. Rec. Dkt. No. 6). The same day, she filed an amended complaint. (Am. Compl. 1-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 24, 2018, JetBlue removed the proceeding to federal court, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
