Thus, Consolidated Plaintiffs argue that further consolidation will promote judicial economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Defendant and the Defendant-Intervenor argue that there are no common questions of law or fact, the actions involve different administrative records, there is no complete identity of parties amongst all the cases for which consolidation is sought, and consolidating the cases would cause unnecessary burden and delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp.

Pls.' Br. at 3-7, here, there are no common questions of law. Accordingly, there is no danger of inconsistent decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the court must review each challenge on its own record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B), and therefore it is unclear why the single consideration of some common facts between the CVD and ADD final determinations would promote judicial efficiency. Finally, it is unclear what harm will result from allowing the challenges to the\n   <em>\n    Biodiesel ADD Final Determination\n   </em>\n   , i.e., Court Nos. 18-00111 and 18-00119, to proceed independently from the challenges to the\n   <em>\n    Biodiesel CVD Final Determination\n   </em>\n   , i.e., Consol. Court No. 18-00009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Consolidation would impose significant burdens. The challenged CVD and ADD determinations are based on separate administrative records, both containing business proprietary information, and there is not a complete identity of parties amongst all the cases for which consolidation is sought. As a result, not only is there a danger that the parties may inadvertently conflate portions of the record, constant care would have to be taken to protect business proprietary information. Further, consolidation would likely necessitate a piecemeal briefing schedule involving multiple parties, and still be subject to the normal delays of litigation which would be exacerbated given the number of parties involved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although concerns regarding the distinct administrative records and lack of complete identity of parties may not be prohibitive in all cases seeking consolidation, they counsel against consolidation, unless there is a significant benefit and economy to be had from consolidation. The court sees little, if any, possible benefit to consolidation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the reasons discussed, the Consolidated Plaintiffs' motion to further consolidate Consol.
