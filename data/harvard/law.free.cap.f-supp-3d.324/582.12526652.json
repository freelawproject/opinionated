Blanca Kling filed suit against her employer, Montgomery County (the \"County\"), claiming that it violated the EPA by paying her less than a male employee, Luis Martinez, earned for performing substantially equal work. Compl., ECF No. 1; Am. Compl., ECF No. 13. The County has moved for summary judgment, arguing that Mr. Martinez's work is not substantially equal.

Pl.'s Opp'n 1, 10-11, ECF No. 47. An employee should be able to serve as the comparator based on his work and salary during an earlier time period, even when that employee was not the plaintiff's predecessor, provided that his work was substantially equal. On the record before me, however, a reasonable factfinder could not find that the work Mr. Martinez actually performed previously, while earning a higher salary than Ms. Kling later earned, was substantially equal to the work Ms. Kling now performs. Moreover, the County has identified undisputed evidence from which the only conclusion a rational jury could reach is that the County's reasoning for paying Mr. Martinez more for his work during the time period in question-not because of his sex, but because of his educational background, professional experience as a teacher and professor, and the nature of the tasks he was required to perform-indeed does explain why Ms. Kling was paid less. Accordingly, I will grant the County's Motion, enter judgment in the County's favor, and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Blanca Kling, a Montgomery County employee since 1980, began serving as the \"Hispanic Liaison\" for the Montgomery County Police Department (\"Police Department\") in August 2005.

And, as noted, both Ms. Kling's and Mr. Martinez's positions encompass translations in some capacity. Also, it is undisputed that Mr. Martinez did not begin contract monitoring until 2008. Martinez Dep. 206, JE 305.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, given the scope and extent of Mr. Martinez's role in developing and providing LEP training, and the skills required for that aspect of his position, a rational factfinder can reach only one conclusion about Mr. Martinez's work, even considering his work prior to 2009: His responsibilities and required skills were not substantially similar to Ms. Kling's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Although Mr. Martinez was not hired to develop or provide LEP training, he devoted\n   considerable time to this aspect of his position beginning when he first was hired. Lam Dep. 19, JE 6. His supervisor, Betty Lam, testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   I joined the County in July of 2004. I hired him in November of 2004.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Our primary goal at that time was language access.

And-as well as his-his other job, which was outreach and education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   It started to change around 2008 because I have-I have been given more responsibility, so naturally, he would be given more responsibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Lam Dep. 19-20, JE 6. And, while Mr. Martinez characterized his initial responsibilities as \"maybe 50 percent working on outreach and another 50 percent doing miscellaneous and other administrative things,\" Martinez Dep. 31, JE 261, he also testified that \"one of the first requirements of [his] job\" was attending an LEP training that the State of Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene offered,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 129, JE 286.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [He] came to work for the Department of Health and Human Services as the outreach coordinator in November of 2004 and in December of 2004, one month later, [he] was sent by [his] supervisors to receive the LEP training that was provided by the state so [he] was familiar with LEP issues and all that that [he] was not familiar with previously.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129, JE 286.

He recalled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [T]he LEP implementation plan was written in 2004 and it was adopted by the senior leadership team in February of 2005 and because the plan required training to all of our employees, all of the employees were trained in June of 2005, and I'm talking about all of the 1600 employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   After that, the next year when we started needing to provide LEP training, I think that it was Betty Lam and myself who are providing the training, and that was in the year 2006, maybe '07.

He noted that initially he was providing training \"on the wing of [his] supervisor,\" and in fiscal year 2009 or 2010 he \"was given a little bit more of the responsibility to do that kind of by [him]self.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204, JE 304.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    The Comparison\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The undisputed evidence demonstrates that Ms. Kling's current position and Mr. Martinez's position prior to 2008 share a \" 'common core' of tasks,\" as the main differentiating factor-Mr. Martinez's role in LEP training-consumed only approximately 15% of his time.\n   <em>\n    Hassman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409559\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/790/564/#p567\">\n    790 F.Supp. at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Martinez's initial, additional tasks involved \"a lot of research\" to ensure \"compliance with Federal regulation on limited English proficiency.\" Lam Dep. 19-20, JE 6. Conducting such research certainly requires experience and training or education. His three bachelor's degrees (in elementary education, high school education, and philosophy) as well as his master's degree (in gerontology), Martinez Resume, JE 252, would have helped him meet these performance requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hassman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409559\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/790/564/#p567\">\n    790 F.Supp. at 567-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, his \"[a]dministrative experience to include planning programs, coordination, supervision\"; his \"Program Planning and Development for Educational Purposes\"; his \"Development of Curriculum appropriate to different age levels\" and his \"Planning and Coordinating Conferences and Workshops\" also would have contributed to his skills and ability to perform the assigned work. Martinez Resume, JE 251. And, when his additional tasks evolved to include providing the actual LEP training, another performance requirement that necessitates training and experience, the training he received in December 2004, as well as his experience as a teacher of English, Spanish, philosophy from 1974 to 1990, and in elementary school from 1972 to 1973, would have helped him serve as a trainer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409559\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/790/564/#p567\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , JE 250-51. In contrast, Ms. Kling \"obtained an AA in Mental Health from\n   Montgomery College\" and \"attended numerous ... trainings and courses provided by Montgomery County,\" but did not identify any training or experience that she had in conducting research, developing educational programs, or teaching.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kling Answers to Interrogs., JE 137-38. Thus, Mr. Martinez's position required skills that Mr. Martinez had and Ms. Kling did not.

But, she has not identified any training, education or experience that helped her meet these performance requirements. And, in terms of accountability, Ms. Kling testified that she does not draft press releases and she has \"specific instructions as far as how much [she] can say to the media,\" so as \"not [to] jeopardize the [police] investigation.\" Kling Dep. 97-98, JE 48. Further, to \"know how to respond to interview questions,\" she relies on press releases and also \"speak[s] with Captain Starks or with Sergeant Innocenti.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409559\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/790/564/#p567\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, as the terms are defined for EPA purposes, Mr. Martinez's additional tasks involve more skill and a greater degree of responsibility than Ms. Kling's.\n   <em>\n    Hassman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409559\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/790/564/#p567\">\n    790 F.Supp. at 567-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
