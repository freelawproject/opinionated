(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Royal Park filed a motion for class certification. (\"Certification Motion,\" Dkt. No. 150.) In that connection, U.S. Bank filed a motion to exclude the expert testimony of W. Scott Dalrymple (\"Dalrymple\") (\"Dalrymple Exclusion Motion,\" Dkt. No. 176), and Royal Park similarly sought to exclude the expert testimony of Christopher James (\"James\") (\"James Exclusion Motion,\" Dkt. No. 207.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 10, 2018, the Court, keeping with the decisions of other courts in this district denying certification of substantially similar class actions, denied the Certification Motion. (Dkt. No. 392.) The Court now states its findings, reasoning, and conclusions as to the Certification Motion, and for the additional reasons set forth below, the Court denies both the Dalrymple Exclusion Motion and the James Exclusion Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case is one of several brought by Royal Park against trustees, such as U.S. Bank, of various RMBS trusts for alleged failures to perform their duties during the subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007-2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court delineates the pertinent facts below, further noting that numerous orders issued in these cases, including one in the instant action by Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   aptly describe the mechanics of the RMBS market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The dispositive issues in this case are best understood in the context of the RMBS market structure and operation. RMBS securitization allows the pooling of thousands of residential mortgages into bond-like instruments which can then be traded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 31.) In order to create these instruments, \"transferors\" group numerous mortgage loans into pools, which are then sold to \"depositors.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) Next, depositors transfer these pools to a trustee (such as U.S Bank), and the pools become property of a trust. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) In return, the depositor receives certificates issued by the trust in various tranches reflecting different levels of risk. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 38.) The depositor will then sell the certificates to securities underwriters that can market and sell them to other investors (such as Royal Park). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) These investors, who become beneficial owners of the certificates, are then entitled to the cash flows generated by the pools of mortgage loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beneficial owners, however, usually do not directly hold the certificates. Instead, the certificates are held by the Depository Trust Company in \"book-entry\" form on behalf of its \"participants.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Dalrymple Report,\" Dkt. No. 152, Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) These participants, however, are also not the beneficial owners, and typically consist of securities brokers and other entities\n   that maintain a custodial relationship with the underlying beneficial owner - a relationship the Depository Trust Company has no insight into. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) The Depository Trust Company also has no insight into any trades made by beneficial owners in the secondary market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Park Investments SA/NV v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-4394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201750595\">\n    2018 WL 1750595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 11, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For trusts like the twenty-one specific trusts at issue in this case (the \"Covered Trusts\"), the above-described relationships between the trustee, transferors, and depositors are defined by certain contractual agreements (the \"Governing Agreements\"). First, under the Governing Agreements, U.S. Bank, as trustee, has the right, on behalf and for the benefit of investors, to enforce the transferors' representations and warranties about the credit quality and characteristics of the underlying loans, and accuracy of the data conveyed about the loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 44.) Second, U.S. Bank can force the transferor to cure, substitute, or repurchase non-conforming loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Finally, under certain contractually-defined circumstances, such as an \"Event of Default,\" U.S. Bank is required to protect the trust assets by such means \"as a reasonably prudent investor\" would take regarding its own investments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Royal Park, which acquired the certificates and their litigation rights in 2009 from the initial purchasers, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28), alleges that U.S. Bank failed to perform its duties under the Governing Agreements and that these failures led to \"unprecedented numbers of defaults, delinquencies, foreclosures, liquidations and losses\" resulting in billions of dollars of losses for investors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 24.) Thus, Royal Park now seeks to certify the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   All persons and entities who held [c]ertificates in the Covered Trusts and were damaged as a result of [U.S. Bank's] conduct alleged in the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Certification Motion at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Royal Park initiated this suit by filing its initial complaint on April 11, 2014. Following a stipulation of dismissal entered into by the parties on July 29, 2015, Royal Park's Trust Indenture Act and derivative claims, and claims relating to four trusts have been dismissed. Accordingly, only the claims for breach of contract and breach of trust relating to the twenty-one Covered Trusts remain. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 274 at 3 n.2.) These claims were further altered when this Court granted Royal Park leave to supplement its pleadings with additional breach of contract and breach of trust claims. The amended claims involve alleged events that took place after Royal Park's filing of the Complaint and relate to findings on U.S. Bank's claims in the bankruptcy against the estate of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following a stay of proceedings while Magistrate Judge Francis resolved U.S. Bank's motion for sanctions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 101), in December 2016, Royal Park filed its motion for class certification, and appointment of Royal Park as class representative, appointment of Robins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP as class counsel. In support of the Certification Motion, Royal Park provided the expert testimony of W. Scott Dalrymple (\"Dalrymple\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In opposition to the Certification Motion (\"Opp. Memo.,\" Dkt. No. 182), U.S. Bank\n   provided the declaration of Tera M. Heintz (Dkt. No. 183), which included James's expert testimony. Separately, U.S. Bank filed a motion to exclude Dalrymple's expert testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dalrymple Exclusion Motion.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its reply in support of class certification (\"Rep. Memo.,\" Dkt. No. 205), Royal Park also offered, for the first time, the expert testimony of Peter Crudo (\"Crudo\") (\"Crudo Report,\" Dkt. No. 209, Ex. 6.) Additionally, Royal Park sought to exclude James's expert testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   James Exclusion Motion)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the close of briefing on these motions, the parties submitted several letters to the Court to: (1) apprise it of supplemental authority in similar class action proceedings and the decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/\">\n    862 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2017) ; and (2) argue about the propriety of raising certain arguments on reply. In this latter category, U.S. Bank wrote to request that the Court exclude Crudo's expert testimony as improperly raised for the first time on reply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 244.) U.S. Bank also wrote to argue that Royal Park improperly raised new arguments in its reply memorandum supporting the James Exclusion Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 272.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    MOTIONS TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY UNDER DAUBERT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   U.S. Bank and Royal Park move, under the test promulgated in\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

Because both parties assume the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   test applies, and because the Court need not address any of the conflicts between the two expert reports to resolve the Certification Motion, the Court will apply\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   without deciding how searching the examination should be at the class certification stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the first step of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   inquiry, courts are instructed to consider the expert's qualifications.

(Dalrymple Report \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   U.S. Banks's arguments in support of the Dalrymple Exclusion Motion focus on the report's conclusions about damages. For example, U.S. Bank argues that the report's proposed damages calculation methodology is unreliable because it does not address whether the alleged breaches caused any losses. (Dkt. No. 177 at 8-9.) U.S. Bank similarly argues that the report's methodology is irrelevant because it aggregates damages on a certificate, rather than class member, basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As discussed further below, because the Court finds that other individualized issues predominate over common questions pursuant to Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"( Rule 23(b)\"), the Court makes no findings about U.S. Bank's arguments on damages and causation. As such, the Court did not rely on those aspects of the Dalrymple Report and need not determine their admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As for the rest of the report, U.S. Bank never challenges Dalrymple's qualifications, or otherwise questions the other opinions or aspects of the report that describe the market and the Covered Trusts.

Even identifying all of the current and past owners would be problematic. First, the certificates lack a \"unique identifier\" that could easily tie them to beneficial owners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201750595\">\n    2018 WL 1750595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Second, beneficial ownership of the certificates is indirect and dual-layered. The Depository Trust Company holds certificates in the name of investing institutions, but oftentimes those institutions themselves hold the certificates in the name of the actual beneficial owner. (Dalrymple Report \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.) In an illiquid market, these issues might be manageable, but these certificates trade in an active secondary market with no central clearinghouse tracking ownership. Thus, the Court would need to overcome these hurdles to identification for each transfer when tracing beneficial ownership to the owner at the time of the alleged breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Courts have repeatedly recognized the difficulty in attributing ownership in situations such as these.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brecher v.

Indeed, in a typical securities suit, identifying the beneficial owners at the time of the breach would likely be sufficient to resolve standing for nearly every class member, because under uniform federal law litigation claims are not automatically assigned with the transfer of the security.\n   <em>\n    Bluebird Partners, L.P. v.

Thus, those owners would likely retain their litigation rights when transferring certificates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the certificates at issue here, however, there is no uniform law controlling the assignment of the accompanying litigation rights when the certificates are transferred. The majority rule is that there is no automatic assignment of an accompanying litigation right or claim when transferring property.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 324. On the other hand, New York adopts the minority rule that \"[u]nless expressly reserved in writing, a transfer of any bond shall vest in the transferee all claims or demands of the transferrer, whether or not such claims or demands are known to exist ... for damages against the trustee or depository under any indenture under which such bond was issued.\" N.Y.G.O.L. \u00a7 13-107(1). Thus, for putative class members (defined in part as former holders of the certificates), standing will necessarily depend on the nature and terms of any assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thus, because of these differing assignment regimes across jurisdictions, the Court would be required to engage in a fact-intensive choice of law analysis to determine which law applied to every assignment when tracing the beneficial ownership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201750595\">\n    2018 WL 1750595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16. Then, the Court would have to apply the resulting test to determine if litigation claims were assigned with the certificates. Ultimately, there is no way to resolve this issue without examining \"every class member's [transaction] documents to determine who did and who did not have a valid claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Mazzei v.

(Dkt. No. 183, Ex. 7 at 5-7.) Even if Royal Park's situation proves to be the exception rather than the rule, because of the impossibility of determining standing with class-wide proof, the Court would still need to undertake a similar inquiry for each class member in order to ensure each member has standing.

(\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p233\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 5\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Park Investments SA/NV v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-4394, Dkt. No. 45 at 10.) The Court is not persuaded that these claims accrue to any entity besides the beneficial owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Royal Park also attempts to differentiate between the statute of limitations defense raised here versus situations involving individualized issues of class members' knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rep. Memo. at 6 n.7.) Royal Park argues that here, only U.S. Bank's knowledge determines when the statute of limitations starts to run, and that inquiry could be resolved with class-wide proof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As an initial matter, because the jurisdictions of the class members' are not all known and the defense has not been tested, it is premature to determine whether there will be an inquiry into individualized class members' knowledge. Second, although individualized inquiries of class members' knowledge also weigh against a finding of predominance, that issue is separate from the individualized inquiry still required here to determine class members' residency and their jurisdictions' statute of limitations. The latter inquiry can be substantial, as demonstrated by the nearly twenty-page analysis that U.S. Bank points to in one decision\n   resolving the inquiry for a single plaintiff where there was a full chain of custody for the securities at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commerzbank AG v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268332\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/462/\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2017). In sum, the Court finds that determining the applicable statute of limitations for each class member also predominates over common issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   iii. Superiority\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A court's finding that individual issues predominate over common issues often necessitates a finding that a class action is not a superior vehicle for resolving claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201750595\">\n    2018 WL 1750595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20. However, beyond the reasons Royal Park fails to meet the Predominance Requirement, there are additional reasons that a class action would be superior to individual actions or other alternative methods of dispute resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As one example, as the Honorable Alison Nathan of this Court noted, the proposal for bellwether cases, as indicated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072481\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/128/#p138\">\n    780 F.3d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , may be a more appropriate avenue moving forward.\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201750595\">\n    2018 WL 1750595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20. Royal Park alleges losses of over $6.7 billion \"due to U.S. Bank's failure to act.\" (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 19, 294.) Those losses would average out to nearly $2.75 million per putative class member. Of course, this calculation ignores many defenses, variables, and differences among individual class members. But the point stands that the sums of money here are vast, and the class contains sophisticated investors who are both incentivized and capable of bringing individual suits, and indeed, have done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Countrywide Fin.
