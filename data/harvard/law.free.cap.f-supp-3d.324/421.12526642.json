The Policy was originally negotiated between Marsh USA's New York office and Starr's New York office. Factor Decl \u00b6 8 (\"[I]t was Marsh's New York office that handled the solicitation and negotiation of the Policy on behalf of Brightstar by corresponding with the Starr Companies' office in New York.\"). By the time of the March 2013 annual adjustment - during which the warehouse coverage at issue was added in Endorsement 40 - Miami-based AJG, not New York-based Marsh, was defendants' broker. However, the Policy as originally issued in 2011 provided that it was \"continuous and cover[ed] all shipments of goods and/or merchandise and/or property made on/or and after 12:00 A.M. March 26, 2011 and on all goods and/or merchandise and/or property at locations on and after said time and date.\" Policy at 6. Moreover, Endorsement 40 itself notes that it is \"ATTACHED TO AND FORMING PART OF\" the Policy and the endorsement contains no language changing the location at which the Policy was executed, issued or delivered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsement 40 at *135-38.

However, there is no evidence that Endorsement 40 constituted a separate insurance policy from the Policy, such that its execution and negotiation should be considered in determining the locus of operative facts, in lieu of the Policy's location of execution and negotiation - nor do defendants even so contend. In any event, Endorsement 40 was executed by only Factor, who worked from Starr's New York office,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Endorsement 40 at *138; Factor Decl \u00b6 3, thus suggesting that even this Endorsement was executed and issued in New York. Moreover, although Factor and Scrobe met with AJG representatives in Miami at some point, it is not clear whether they did so for the purpose of negotiating Endorsement 40 and the March 2013 adjustment with AJG.

Factor was \"one of the underwriters responsible for the day-to-day handing of the Brightstar cargo account,\" was \"responsible for negotiating and binding the terms and conditions of\" the March 26, 2013 adjustment in which warehouse coverage was added to the Policy, assisted in making Starr's determination that the warehouse at which the loss occurred was unnamed/unscheduled under the Policy, and corresponded with AJG after defendants claimed the loss in an effort to resolve that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Factor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11-19. He thus has substantial personal knowledge pertaining to this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants assert that Charles Capozzoli is not a material witness on the ground that \"[h]e has no personal knowledge of any material fact to offer at trial.\" Defs. Reply at 8. However, Capozzoli submitted a declaration in conjunction with this motion, in which he stated that he was the \"Executive Vice President of Starr Marine Agency, Inc.,\" Capozzoli Decl \u00b6 1, that he \"came to believe by December 3, 2013 that Starr Indemnity had sufficient information to move forward with a declaratory judgment action\" based on the belief that the warehouse at which the loss occurred was an \"unnamed/unscheduled location,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, and that he accordingly authorized the filing of the declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of New York on December 3, 2013,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Because the filing of the instant action was effectively Starr's formal denial of coverage, Capozzoli was thus the individual who made the decision to deny coverage. Moreover, the issue of whether the location at which the loss occurred was named/scheduled or unnamed/unscheduled appears to be the central issue in this case. As a result, we conclude that Capozzoli is a material witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants also argue that Starr \"lists various other people in its claim department who[ ] had nothing to do with Brightstar's claim.\" Defs. Reply at 8. By this, defendants apparently refer to Thomas\n   Connelly, who was Starr's vice president for claims in its New York office and handled defendants' claim in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Connelly Dep. at 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Email from Thomas Connelly to Lisa Rodriguez and Attached Reservation of Rights Letter, dated Dec. 2, 2013 (annexed as Ex. 7 to Durbin Decl.), at 1, 10-11.

On this question, Factor seems to be one of the key witnesses, and the Southern District of New York would be a more convenient forum for him.

This case was initiated more than four years ago. Since that time, discovery has completed, including expert witness discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from John A.V. Nicoletti, filed Mar. 22, 2018 (Docket # 109); Memo Endorsement of Letter from Mark L. Durbin, filed May 8, 2018 (Docket # 124). The Court has adjudicated a number of discovery disputes and held multiple conferences. In other words, this Court has gained familiarity with this action that would be lost upon transfer to the Southern District of Florida, thereby resulting in greater inefficiency in resolving both dispositive motions and trial issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Additionally, the parties' motions for summary judgment, which are now fully briefed, assume that New York is the forum state and thus have applied New York choice of law provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed May 25, 2018 (Docket # 130), at 17; Brightstar Corp. &amp; Brightstar Germany GmbH's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed May 25, 2018 (Docket # 133), at 9 &amp; n.7. These motions would need to be partially redrafted if this case were transferred to the Southern District of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendants argue that this case will proceed more efficiently in the Southern District of Florida because that court has fewer cases per judge and generally completes more trials per judge over the course of a year compared with the Southern District of New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

Defendants also contend that the Southern District of Florida \"ranks fifth in the nation for shortest time from filing to trial, while the Southern District of New York ranks thirty-eighth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. While these statistics suggest that a case may proceed more quickly to trial if it is initiated in the Southern District of Florida in the first instance, we cannot find that these statistics outweigh the other indicia pertinent to the trial efficiency factor - in particular this case's advanced stage and the Court's familiarity with it.
