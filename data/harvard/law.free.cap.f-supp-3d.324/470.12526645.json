R. Evid. 702. The Third Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that the witness possess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that \"a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\" Secondly, the testimony must be reliable; it \"must be based on the 'methods\n   and procedures of science' rather than on 'subjective belief or unsupported speculation'; the expert must have 'good grounds' for his o[r] her belief. In sum,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   holds that an inquiry into the reliability of scientific evidence under Rule 702 requires a determination as to its scientific validity.\" Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert testimony must fit the issues in the case. In other words, the expert's testimony must be relevant for the purposes of the case and must assist the trier of fact. The Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   that \" Rule 702's 'helpfulness' standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   By means of a so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing,\" the district court acts as a gatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the requirements of qualification, reliability and fit from reaching the jury.\n   <em>\n    See Daubert\n   </em>\n   (\"Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a) [of the Federal Rules of Evidence] whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Schneider ex rel.

Kegel and ActiveNet References\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Kegel and ActiveNet references do not invalidate the asserted claims of the '497 patent, because, \"Defendants failed to come forward with any evidence that either reference was available as prior art before the priority date of the Asserted Claims of the '497 Patent.\" (D.I. 448 at 14). A prior art reference may be shown to be a \"printed publication\" if it was: (1) publicly accessible, or (2) distributed to those of skill in the art.\n   <em>\n    In re NTP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824754\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1279/#p1296\">\n    654 F.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The critical date of the '497 patent is July 31, 1999. (D.I. 448 at 15; D.I. 474 at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Kegel reference is an article that \"discusses Network Address Translation technology.\" (D.I. 448 at 14). Plaintiff argues that the reference was not publicly accessible to an interested POSITA \"until at least 2001.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Defendants, however, argue that the Kegel reference was posted to a website, and was shared \"on a public web forum in a discussion on cable modem networking\" on July 20, 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 474 at 31). Defendants also represent that Mr. Kegel, the author of the reference, will testify that he last updated his website on July 17, 1999. (Tr. 16:6-8; D.I. 453-1, Exh. 19). I find that Defendants have shown at least a genuine dispute of material fact as to the public availability of the Kegel reference. Therefore, I will deny Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, as to that reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"ActiveNet is a multiplayer game system developed by Activision.\" (D.I. 448 at 16). Defendants argue, \"ActiveNet was used in two games that are relevant to this case: Heavy Gear II and Heavy Gear II Demo.\" (D.I. 474 at 32). Defendants assert\n   that these games were available before the critical date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, Plaintiff argues that Defendants cannot show that these games used ActiveNet. (D.I. 448 at 16-17). Defendants respond that Dr. Kegel will testify as to the release dates of Heavy Gear II and Heavy Gear II Demo, and technical expert Dr. Karger will testify that the ActiveNet source code was comparable to the code in Heavy Gear II Demo before the critical date. (Tr. 21:17-24:6). I find that Defendants have shown at least a genuine dispute of material fact as to the public availability of the ActiveNet reference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, I will deny Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, as to that reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Validity of the Asserted Claims of the '634 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants argue that the asserted claims of the '634 patent are indefinite and therefore invalid. (D.I. 442 at 32). The Court found claim 19 of the '634 patent indefinite. (D.I. 423 at 14). The only other asserted claim of the '634 patent, claim 22, depends from claim 19. (D.I. 444-1, Exh. D-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's only argument that the two claims are not invalid for indefiniteness is that claim 19 of the '634 patent should be corrected. (D.I. 475 at 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff argues that claim 19 \"contains an obvious error\" that the Court should correct. (D.I. 438 at 1). Claim 19 covers, \"A\n   <em>\n    non-routing tabled based\n   </em>\n   computer readable medium containing instructions for controlling communications of a participant of a broadcast channel within a network, by a method comprising\" several steps. (D.I. 117-2, Exh. A-4, claim 19) (emphasis added). During claim construction, I held that \"non-routing table based\" modifies \"computer readable medium,\" and found that \"non-routing table based computer readable medium\" is \"nonsensical.\" (D.I. 423 at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff urges that claim 19 should read: \"A computer readable medium containing instructions for controlling communications of a participant of a broadcast channel within a network, by a\n   <em>\n    non-routing tabled based\n   </em>\n   method comprising\" several steps. (D.I. 438 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A \"district court may correct an obvious error in a patent claim ...

Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although I found claim 19 \"nonsensical,\" it is not clear that the claim contains an \"obvious error.\" Plaintiff mentioned no \"obvious\" error in its Markman briefing or at any Markman hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   D.I. 366; D.I. 391).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if it were obvious that claim 19 contains an error,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the correction is \"subject\n   to a reasonable debate.\" At a Markman hearing, Plaintiff argued that \"non-routing table based\" modifies the entire preamble. (D.I. 363 at 91:1-92:25). In its Markman briefing, Plaintiff argued that \"non-routing table based\" modifies the \"network.\" (D.I. 366 at 33). Now, Plaintiff argues that \"non-routing table based\" modifies the \"method.\" (D.I. 438 at 2). Each of these corrections results in a different claim scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magnetar Techs. Corp. v. Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166283\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/61/437/#p442\">\n    61 F.Supp.3d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442-43 (D. Del. 2014) (refusing to exercise discretion to rewrite a claim because different corrections left the \"scope of the claim subject to reasonable debate\"). If the claim is re-written so that the \"network\" is non-routing table based, then the claim would be limited to a network that does not employ routing tables. However, if the claim is rewritten so that the \"method\" is \"non-routing table based,\" then the claim would encompass a network that includes routing tables, so long as the method itself does not employ routing tables. Accordingly, Plaintiff's arguments demonstrate that the correction is itself subject to a reasonable debate.\n   <em>\n    CBT Flint Partners\n   </em>\n   , 654 F.3d at 1358. This precludes me from correcting claim 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I will therefore deny Plaintiff's Motion to Correct Claim 19 of the '634 patent. (D.I. 438).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As a result, asserted claims 19 and 22 of the '634 patent are invalid as indefinite. I will grant Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the validity of those claims. (D.I. 440).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Tr. 116-17). In its summary judgment briefing, Plaintiff argues that the\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   defendant's \"customers maintained and controlled the 'front-end' portion of the claimed system,\" but stated that \"is not the case here as Activision owns and controls the software participating in the network.\" (D.I. 475 at 2-3). Plaintiff argues that Activision's customers have \"zero input\" over the claimed system. (Tr. 115:23-116:3). Activision notes, however, that Plaintiff's experts agree that Activision's customers can play the accused games in ways that do not infringe. (D.I. 565 at 6 (citing D.I. 443, Exh. A-l at \u00b6 2, 81; D.I. 443, Exh. A-2 at \u00b6 2) ). Plaintiff responds that even though \"Activision suggests that it has infringing and non-infringing game modes from which a user may select,\" \"Destiny has no off-line mode,\" \"Destiny must connect to the infringing network before it can be used,\" and \"the multiplayer version of [CoD] always infringes.\" (D.I. 570 at 17, n.4 (citing D.I. 454, Exh. 28 at \u00b6 73; D.I. 454-55, Exh. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 69, 81-82, 84, 123) ). Plaintiff's response, even if true, does not distinguish\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   . As Activision notes, Plaintiff \"nowhere disputes that a customer, even once in online mode, has several non-accused game modes available, and must choose a multiplayer game with six or more players to form an accused network.\" (D.I. 572 at 3). Accordingly, Activision's customers have a degree of control comparable to that of the\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   customers, who requested reports \"a single time, ... caus[ing] the back-end processing to perform its function on a monthly basis.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085538\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1279/#p1288\">\n    631 F.3d at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues, \"The configured 'participants' are Activision's software.\" (D.I. 475 at 3; D.I. 565 at 6-7).

(D.I. 570 at 3, 8-9). The parties stipulated that \"participant\" means \"a computer and/or computer process that participates in a network.\" (D.I. 320 at 2). Accordingly, the claimed network \"participants\" need not each be a computer. But even if a \"participant\" can be a \"computer process,\" Plaintiff's experts agree that \"participants\" are ultimately \"application programs that are executing on the client computers.\" (D.I. 572 at 4 (citing\n   D.I. 443, Exh. A-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 74; D.I. 443, Exh. A-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 76) ). This agreement is consistent with the parties' construction for \"participants.\" Even if each \"participant\" need not be a \"computer,\" each \"participant\" still requires a user computer and some action taken by the user.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As Activision argues, \"the customer must install Activision's software\" on a computer, \"execute it, and choose an online, multiplayer game mode with more than 5 other participants to make and use the accused networks.\" (D.I. 572 at 3; D.I. 565 at 4). Plaintiff does not meaningfully respond to this argument or dispute that Activision's customers take the action that leads to the \"back-end processing.\" (D.I. 570). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit explained, \"It makes no difference that the back-end processing is physically possessed by [the defendant],\" because \"if the user did not make the request, then the back-end processing would not be put into service.\"\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085538\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1279/#p1288\">\n    631 F.3d at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as \"user\" action was required by the final claim element in\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   , action by multiple customers is required here for the claimed \"participants\" to be in place and to send data in the network. Therefore, Plaintiff's effort to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Centillion\n   </em>\n   on the basis that the claims there more explicitly required customers' use of a computer falls short.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff proffers two other theories as to why Plaintiff \"makes\" the infringing network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, Plaintiff argues that Activision's \"license agreements, which players accept when downloading the software, explicitly state that Activision maintains complete ownership of the software, confirming that Activision is the party building the network.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (D.I. 570 at 7 (citing D.I. 482, Exh. 74 at AB-AB-009835) ). However, as Activision notes, \"Whether Activision owns the software is irrelevant because owning is not an infringing act, i.e., making, using, selling, or offering to sell, and [Plaintiff] cites no case in support of its theory of infringement-by-owning.\" (D.I. 572 at 6). Furthermore, Plaintiff does not explain how owning software necessarily entails making a network. (D.I. 570 at 7). Therefore, Plaintiffs argument falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that Activision \"infringes by making the infringing networks,\" because \"Activision is vicariously liable for the actions of its customers.\" (D.I. 570 at 9).

Some game modes, like CoD's \"Single player\" mode, are not accused of infringement. (D.I. 443, Exh. A-1 at \u00b6 81). Second, Plaintiff's testing allegations are not platform-specific. Plaintiff cannot rely on allegations of testing that occurred on Sony\n   platforms, because those products were dismissed from the case. (D.I. 268 at 7). As a result, Plaintiff's allegations do not specify whether testing was performed on a platform that is actually in the case. Third, Plaintiff cannot rely on testing that occurred before its earliest infringement allegations, which date to the filing of an earlier complaint in March 2015. (D.I. 62 at 2).

In fact, Plaintiff did not even argue that Activision \"makes\" the '497 claims in its summary judgment briefing. (D.I. 565 at 8; D.I. 475 at 5). Now, Plaintiff argues, \"During the entire development process from writing source code through compiling the code into the games, Activision\n   makes Destiny and [CoD] using computers which contain processors.\" (D.I. 570 at 18).

In other words, Activision does not use its customers' processors \"for locating a call-in port of a portal computer.\" Plaintiff does not contest Activision's assertion. (D.I. 570 at 18).

But the Federal Circuit never found that those claims were directed to patent-ineligible material like carrier waves.

Lawton. (D.I. 439).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiff makes arguments to exclude several different pieces of Ms. Lawton's opinion. First, Plaintiff argues that Ms. Lawton's reasonable royalty opinion \"necessarily rests on speculation.\" (D.I. 448 at 32). More specifically, Plaintiff argues that Ms. Lawton (1) assumes the comparability of a past license between Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. and Boeing Management Company to the license the parties would have reached, and arbitrarily reduces that past license fee by 50%; (2) reduces the license fee \"by another 47% based on her unfounded comparison of the term\" of the past license and the hypothetical license; (3) \"arbitrarily assum[es] that there are thirteen games that would have been licensed under the\" past license to come up with a per-game royalty, and (4) \"arbitrarily opines that $300,000 is the high-end of the reasonable royalty range.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-36). Second, Plaintiff argues that Ms. Lawton assumes the comparability of the Boeing/Sony license to the hypothetical license \"without any analysis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-43). Third, Plaintiff argues that Ms. Lawton's opinion as to the hypothetical negotiation date \"is completely unsupported and arbitrary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-46). Activision responds to each of these arguments by pointing to evidence supporting Ms. Lawton's opinions. (D.I. 474 at 34-45). Accordingly, Plaintiff's arguments amount to failure of proof arguments. I will not exclude Ms. Lawton's testimony, as to these opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff separately argues that Ms. Lawton should be precluded from offering technical opinions regarding non-infringing alternatives, because she is not qualified. (D.I. 448 at 46-48). In response,\n   Activision notes that Ms. Lawton relies on certain technologies as non-infringing alternatives, because Boeing and the inventors identified them as such. (D.I. 474 at 46). Ms. Lawton may testify about non-infringing alternatives, to the extent that her testimony represents evidence she relied upon in forming her opinion about damages.\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co. v.

Ms. Lawton may testify about secondary considerations, but she may not provide an opinion about technical issues outside her expertise or summarize technical facts using a slide deck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment of Infringement and Validity and Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Catharine M. Lawton (D.I. 388) is denied, as to the testimony of Ms. Lawton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Activision's\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Activision first seeks to exclude Dr. Nenad Medvidovic and Dr. Michael Mitzenmacher's opinions that the accused products \"use various rules and constants\" to converge on m-regular and create a broadcast channel. (D.I. 442 at 38). Activision argues that Dr. Medvidovic and Dr. Mitzenmacher make these assertions in conclusory fashion, and \"cite well over 1,500 pages of code without identifying or explaining the source code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In response, Plaintiff points to numerous locations in their experts' reports, which Plaintiff avers \"provide a detailed explanation of their infringement opinions,\" including the opinions singled out by Activision. (D.I. 475 at 33-35). Thus, Activision's arguments are not well-taken. Activision does not make a serious case to exclude expert testimony on the basis of \"qualification, reliability, and fit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider ex rel.

Accordingly, I will deny Activision's motion, as to the opinions of Dr. Medvidovic and Dr. Mitzenmacher. (D.I. 441).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Activision next seeks to exclude the testimony of damages expert Dr. Christine Meyer and technical experts Dr. Harry Bims and Dr. Ricardo Valerdi, who combine to provide Plaintiff's reasonable royalty calculation. (D.I. 442 at 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To reach her ultimate reasonable royalty opinion, Dr. Meyer chooses a hypothetical negotiation date, and recalculates the jury verdict from\n   <em>\n    Uniloc USA, Inc. v. EA\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:13-cv-00259-RWA (E.D. Tex. Dec. 15, 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 475 at 36). To recalculate the verdict, Dr. Meyer takes Dr. Bims' opinion that the Asserted Patents are 6-15 times more valuable than the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   patent (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C490%2C216\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,490,216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and multiplies the midpoint of this range (10.5) by the 20 cents per unit rate from\n   <em>\n    Uniloc.\n   </em>\n   (D.I. 475 at 43-45). This provides a royalty of $2.10 for all six Asserted Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Meyer then multiplies this rate by a royalty base, which she determines by apportioning the value of the Asserted Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, Activision argues that Dr. Meyer wrongly assumes a hypothetical negotiation date of the filing of the complaint. (D.I. 442 at 40). I addressed this\n   argument in an Oral Order on April 13, 2018. (D.I. 521). \"[T]he date of the hypothetical negotiation is the date that infringement began,\" not the date of the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    LaserDynamics, Inc. v. Quanta Computer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523807\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/51/#p75\">\n    694 F.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Thus, I will exclude Dr. Meyer's damages testimony, insofar as it uses the date of the filing of the complaint as the date of the hypothetical negotiation. Plaintiff supplemented Dr. Meyer's reports with an analysis using an arguably correct hypothetical negotiation date on April 18, 2018. (D.I. 534-1). The supplementation fixes the hypothetical negotiation date problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second, Activision argues that Dr. Meyer cannot use the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   jury verdict to establish a royalty, and in any event cannot support her opinion regarding the comparability between the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   patent and the Asserted Patents. (D.I. 442 at 41-43). Jury-determined damages are not evidence of arm's-length negotiations between parties, and will not help the trier of fact determine a royalty. Plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that expert damages opinions may rely on prior jury verdicts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the only evidence Plaintiff cites for that proposition is a statement from Activision's damages expert indicating agreement that \"a litigation verdict [can] be a reliable data point in a hypothetical reasonable royalty negotiation for a patent case\" if \"the verdict is based on economically and technically comparable facts.\" (D.I. 475 at 41; D.I. 482-1, Exh. 97 at 20:10-21:1). This citation is insufficient. Dr. Meyer cannot use the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   jury verdict to calculate a reasonable royalty, because it is not sufficiently comparable to the circumstances of the hypothetical negotiation here. Activision admits that it holds a license to the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   patent and that said license is relevant to the reasonable royalty, but that does not render the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   jury verdict comparable to the hypothetical negotiation here. (D.I. 475 at 41; D.I. 482-1, Exh. 93 at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   A jury verdict does not represent evidence from which a hypothetical negotiation can be reliably determined. A jury verdict represents the considered judgment of twelve (or maybe fewer) random non-experts as to what a hypothetical negotiation would have resulted in for the patent(s) at issue. It is, at best, an informed lay opinion. No economist would consider a jury verdict as to a hypothetical negotiation about one patent as a reliable basis for determining what the results of an actual arm's-length negotiation about a second patent would be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlas IP, LLC v.

(D.I. 475 at 42). I will exclude Dr.\n   Meyer's royalty opinion insofar as it relies on the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Third, Activision argues, \"Dr. Meyer should be precluded from offering her opinion that the [Boeing/Sony] License is not comparable because Boeing did not intend for the license to say what it says.\" (D.I. 442 at 41 n.19). Activision takes particular issue with Dr. Meyer's opinion that \"when the parties entered into the [Boeing/Sony License,] Boeing did not consider that PlayStation gaming systems would be covered.\" (D.I. 505 at 22-23). Plaintiff responds that Dr. Meyer presents evidence supporting her opinion that \"the Boeing/Sony License is not comparable to the hypothetical negotiation in this case.\" (D.I. 475 at 41; D.I. 441-1, Exh. C-1 at \u00b6 63-64). The Boeing/Sony License expressly says it covers the accused products. (D.I. 268). Therefore, I will not allow Dr. Meyer to testify that the Boeing/Sony License does not cover the accused products. However, I will not exclude Dr. Meyer's opinions that the Boeing/Sony License was undervalued. Activision can cross-examine her on those opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   My exclusion of Dr. Meyer's use of the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   jury verdict moots at least two arguments raised in Activision's Motion. For example, Activision argues that Dr. Bims' opinion that the relative value of Asserted Patents is 6-15 times more valuable than the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   patent is arbitrary, and should be excluded. (D.I. 442 at 43-45). Because Dr. Meyer may not testify about the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   jury verdict, any comparison to the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   patent is irrelevant. Neither she nor Dr. Bims may testify about the value of the Asserted Patents, as compared to the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Fourth, Activision argues that Dr. Meyer's opinion on the royalty base violates court orders and legal principles by including future products. Dr. Meyer \"calculate[s] reasonable royalty damages on sales of the infringing products from the date of the hypothetical negotiation through the date of the last patent expiry.\" (D.I. 441-1, Exh. C-3 at \u00b6 177). Plaintiff asserts that Dr. Meyer calculates a lump sum royalty through the life of the patents. (D.I. 475 at 47-48). A lump sum royalty is proper.\n   <em>\n    Allergan Sales, LLC v.

However, Activision asserts that Dr. Meyer does not propose a lump sum royalty, but rather a \"running royalty discounted to the net present value.\" (D.I. 505 at 25). Thus, argues Activision, her testimony is improper. (D.I. 442 at 46 (citing\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208222619\">\n    2016 WL 8222619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (noting that \"post-trial infringement\" is \"typically dealt with\" using procedures set forth in\n   <em>\n    Paice LLC v.

The\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   court rejected an \"approach in which the jury determines past and future damages all at once,\" and found, \"Any opinion on a future royalty that may accrue from infringement that has not yet occurred (as opposed to a lump-sum royalty) is properly excluded under Rule 702(a).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208222619\">\n    2016 WL 8222619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2-3.

(D.I. 475 at 48). No case explicitly\n   discusses a \"running royalty discounted to the net present value.\" In another case, Judge Payne opined, \"[A] lump sum royalty includes compensation for projected future infringement .... The lump sum may be based on developments that have occurred after the date of the hypothetical negotiations, including realistic projections of future sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Ericsson Inc. v.

Tex. Mar. 7, 2018). Dr. Meyer may calculate and testify about a lump sum royalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Separately, Activision argues that Dr. Meyer's testimony should be excluded because she fails to apportion the value of the Asserted Patents versus the value from non-patented features of the accused products. (D.I. 442 at 46-48). Dr. Meyer uses the accused games' \"multiplayer\" feature to apportion the Asserted Patents' contribution to all three accused games. (D.I. 475 at 46; D.I. 441-1, Exh. C-3 at \u00b6 169-76). Plaintiff also notes that Dr. Meyer uses an \"already apportioned ... unit rate from\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   .\" (D.I. 475 at 37). I am excluding Dr. Meyer's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, Activision's apportionment argument is moot. However, I note that Dr. Meyer must properly apportion any other royalty base she uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Fifth, Activision argues that Dr. Valerdi's testimony that redesigning a broadcast channel technique would cost $7 billion should be excluded. (D.I. 442 at 48). Activision takes issue specifically with the computer program that Dr. Valerdi uses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49). This is a failure of proof argument. Activision can cross-examine Dr. Valerdi about the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
