Azar II, sued here in his official capacity as head of the Department of Health and Human Services (and referred to as \"HHS\"), oversees Medicare, a government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. The Outpatient Prospective Payment System (\"OPPS\") is a component of Medicare that deals with payments to hospitals for outpatient treatment services. This agency-review case concerns a statutory amendment to OPPS made in 2010 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"), Pub. L. No. 111-148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%20119\">\n    124 Stat. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Under the amendment, HHS was required to study certain costs incurred by a small group of hospitals that focus on cancer research and treatment (commonly referred to as the \"cancer hospitals\"). If HHS determined that the cancer hospitals' costs were higher than other hospitals', it was required to make an \"appropriate adjustment\" to payments to the cancer hospitals \"effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2011.\" HHS ultimately did\n   find that the cancer hospitals' costs were higher and warranted an increase in OPPS payments to them. But HHS did not issue a final regulation containing the cancer-hospital adjustment until well into 2011, and made the adjustment effective only as of January 1, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute Hospital, Inc. (\"Moffitt\") is a cancer hospital. It has challenged HHS's failure to make higher OPPS payments to cancer hospitals for 2011, claiming HHS thereby violated its statutory mandate. HHS defends its actions as reasonable, and also argues that the adjustment it made is not subject to judicial review. Each party has moved for summary judgment. ECF No. 13; ECF No. 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13-1 (\"Pl.'s Br.\"); ECF No. 16-1 (\"Def.'s Br.\"); ECF No. 19 (\"Pl.'s Reply\"); ECF No. 21 (\"Def.'s Reply\"). As explained below, the Court agrees with Moffitt that HHS failed to comply with the statute's directive to make an adjustment effective for services furnished during the 2011 calendar year. Therefore, the Court will enter summary judgment for Moffitt and remand the case to HHS so that it can consider and make an \"appropriate adjustment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Section 3138 of the ACA, codified in \u00a7 (t)(18), required HHS (1) to study the cancer hospitals' costs, and (2) if the study revealed higher costs, to make an \"appropriate adjustment\" pursuant to \u00a7 (t)(2)(E) effective for the 2011 calendar year. ACA \u00a7 3138, 124 Stat. at 439. Moffitt alleges that HHS erred by refusing to comply with the second mandate: having found that the cancer hospitals had higher costs, HHS was required to make \"\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   appropriate adjustment\" effective for the 2011 calendar year, but instead it denied the cancer hospitals' request for such an adjustment.

And the adjustment did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Neither party disputes that HHS had authority to make a cancer-hospital adjustment for the 2012 calendar year, so it did not exceed its authority merely by making the adjustment. In fact, independently of Section 3138 of the ACA, HHS could have made such an adjustment under \u00a7 (t)(2)(E) alone. Instead, Moffitt effectively argues that HHS exceeded its authority by failing to act in a way it was legally required to-in this case, by declining to make the adjustment for 2012 apply retroactively to 2011 as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 41(a)-(c). Doing so would have provided Moffitt the same adjustment for both 2011 and 2012. But HHS was not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to apply the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   adjustment in both calendar years, such that it exceeded its authority by not doing so. To the contrary, the OPPS statute envisions that adjustments under \u00a7 (t)(2)(E) could vary from year to year: it requires HHS to \"review not less often than annually and revise the ... other adjustments described in paragraph [ (t) ](2) to take into account\" several considerations, including \"new cost data\" and any \"other relevant information and factors.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t)(9)(A). Moreover, as Moffitt and the other cancer hospitals argued in their rulemaking comments, HHS's statutory authority to craft an appropriate and equitable adjustment is \"exceedingly broad.\" JA at 59, 153. Thus, HHS cannot be said to have exceeded its authority merely by declining to make the 2012 adjustment apply retroactively to 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Therefore, the Court has jurisdiction to hear Moffitt's case to the extent it challenges HHS's decision not to apply\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   adjustment for the 2011 calendar year, but not to the extent Moffitt challenges the effective date of the adjustment that was in fact promulgated for the 2012 calendar year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether HHS Failed to Comply with Section 3138 of the ACA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court agrees with Moffitt that HHS improperly refused to make a cancer-hospital adjustment for the 2011 calendar year as required by Section 3138 of the ACA. While the parties dispute exactly when HHS completed its study determining that the cancer hospitals had higher costs, they agree that HHS made such a determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 18-19; Pl.'s Reply at 22-27. In fact, HHS's study used cost data from 2009 to model the cancer hospitals' costs for 2011, concluding that those costs would be higher\n   <em>\n    in 2011. See\n   </em>\n   76 Fed. Reg. at 74,200 -01. Thus, HHS was required to \"provide for an appropriate adjustment under paragraph (2)(E) to reflect those higher costs effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2011.\" ACA \u00a7 3138, 124 Stat. at 439. HHS declined to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   76 Fed. Reg. at 74,205. Instead, HHS did something slightly different: it made an adjustment effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2012, without any adjustment for the 2011 calendar year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the statute plainly requires an adjustment for the 2011 calendar year as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   HHS offers an alternative reading of the statute. It argues that Congress included the effective date on the implicit assumption that HHS would make the adjustment by January 1, 2011, and was silent about what would happen if HHS failed to act by that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 13; Def.'s Reply at 5-6. Therefore, HHS argues, it is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference regarding what the effective date of the adjustment should be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 21-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court finds this interpretation untenable. It has no basis whatsoever in the text of Section 3138, which plainly commands that HHS make an adjustment \"effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2011.\" Nothing in the text suggests that the effective date of the adjustment was subject to a condition precedent about the timing of HHS's action. In addition, the relatively close timing between the date of the ACA's enactment and this effective date undercuts HHS's interpretation. In March 2010, Congress unambiguously required HHS to implement an adjustment effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2011. It could hardly have been inconceivable to Congress that HHS might not both complete the required study and make an appropriate adjustment in the nine months that remained in 2010. Finally, this interpretation runs\n   afoul of the principle that, when Congress uses the word \"shall,\" its language is usually more than precatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Monzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555931,4206123\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/528/\">\n    641 F.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531-32 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Under HHS's proffered interpretation, the effective date in the statute has little practical meaning: the agency has to abide by the effective date, unless it chooses to wriggle out of the effective date by its own delay-at which point it gets to choose another effective date. Not so. Here, Congress spoke \"in plain terms\" in order \"to circumscribe,\" not \"to enlarge, agency discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p296\">\n    569 U.S. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p296\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p296\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Congress was not, when it wrote a mandatory effective date into the statute, really authorizing HHS to pick its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   HHS's \"silence\" argument might hold water if the statute actually contained a deadline that required HHS to act in advance of the effective date. In that case, the text of the statute would both raise and fail to answer an obvious question: what should the effective date be if HHS failed to act in a timely manner? HHS occasionally flirts with the idea that the effective date could in fact be interpreted as a deadline for agency action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 13, 33-35. However, it ultimately spurns this reading, which Moffitt rejects as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13; Pl.'s Reply at 9; Def.'s Reply at 5. And for good reason: Congress knows how to write rulemaking deadlines, and nothing in the text of Section 3138 even remotely resembles one. The effective date in Section 3138 contrasts with a deadline Congress included in an otherwise similar provision that required HHS to make an adjustment for rural hospitals \"by January 1, 2006.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t)(13)(B). Moffitt's brief catalogues an even greater variety of language in the ACA regarding deadlines, effective dates, and the interrelationship between them, demonstrating that Congress was more than capable of expressing itself clearly on these topics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 18-22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But because the statute does not contain a deadline for agency action, the only \"silence\" in this case is one that HHS has manufactured to justify its deviation from Congress's command. Indeed, a statute is not \" 'silent' in the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   sense\" if the \"most traditional tool\" of statutory construction-reading the text -\"clearly requires a particular outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Engine Mfrs.

Cir. 1996). In this case, reading the text does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Put differently, a statute is not \"silent\" simply because it fails to separately address every conceivable set of circumstances to which it might apply. As Judge Henderson has explained: \" 'Thou shall not kill' is a mandate neither silent nor ambiguous about whether murder is permissible if committed after 5.00 p.m.-or, for that matter, if committed in the billiard room with the candlestick ....\"\n   <em>\n    AFL-CIO v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109328,3701914\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/168/\">\n    333 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (Henderson, J., concurring in the judgment). Similarly, if Congress tells an agency \"Do\n   <em>\n    X\n   </em>\n   ,\" and the agency does not, it is no defense to say that Congress really meant \"Do\n   <em>\n    X\n   </em>\n   , but only if\n   <em>\n    Y\n   </em>\n   \"-where\n   <em>\n    Y\n   </em>\n   appears nowhere in the statute. Otherwise agencies would have unlimited discretion to avoid their statutory duties whenever they felt circumstances warranted it. In this case, HHS hangs its hat on the fact that Congress did not expressly address\n   what should happen if HHS failed to make an adjustment by January 1, 2011. But that does not mean Congress remained silent or was ambiguous as to the effective date of the adjustment. Congress plainly imposed an effective date of January 1, 2011, without any qualification with respect to the timing of HHS's action. That resolves this case, notwithstanding HHS's delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   HHS offers several additional arguments in support of its interpretation, but none is convincing. In fairness to HHS, it has advanced many of these arguments on the assumption that the statute's supposed \"silence\" would take it to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's \"step two,\" the reasonableness of its interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 23-28. And at step two, these arguments might well carry the day. But because HHS's case stalls at \"step one,\" its arguments must instead carry the heavy burden of showing that the statute is silent or ambiguous, notwithstanding its plain text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Engine Mfrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694841,9049644\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1075/\">\n    88 F.3d at 1088-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They cannot do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Budget Neutrality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, HHS appeals to budget neutrality. All adjustments under \u00a7 (t)(2)(E), including the one required by Section 3138 of the ACA, must be \"budget neutral.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t)(2)(E). As a result, whenever HHS makes upward adjustments to payment rates under \u00a7 (t)(2)(E), it must make offsetting decreases elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722607,9056335\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/103/\">\n    357 F.3d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in its OPPS rulemaking for the 2012 calendar year, HHS decreased all payments by 0.22% to reflect that the cancer-hospital adjustment would cost approximately $71 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   76 Fed. Reg. at 74,190. HHS never made a similar offset to accommodate a downward adjustment for the 2011 calendar year. Thus, it argues, interpreting Section 3138 to require a retroactive adjustment would be incompatible with budget neutrality. Def.'s Br. at 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   But HHS has not demonstrated that the budget-neutrality requirement in \u00a7 (t)(2)(E) gives rise to silence or ambiguity regarding how to apply the effective date Congress mandated here. In the November 2011 rulemaking, HHS noted that, \"insofar as the cancer adjustment is budget neutral,\" the interpretation proffered by the cancer hospitals would require payments for 2011 that had not been offset by contemporaneous reductions. 76 Fed. Reg. at 74,205. HHS did not explain, however, why a January 2011 effective date would\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   run afoul of budget neutrality. As all parties (including the cancer hospitals themselves) emphasized during the rulemaking process, HHS has \"exceedingly broad\" equitable authority to fashion adjustments under \u00a7 (t)(2)(E). JA at 59. While the most logical way to carry out the statute's budget-neutrality mandate is to decrease rates prospectively for the upcoming year, nothing says that is the only way. That seems particularly true here, where HHS has elected to make the cancer-hospital adjustment at cost report settlement well after the services are rendered, not by adjusting prospectively-set rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   76 Fed. Reg. at 74,204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In fact, as Moffitt points out, not long ago HHS made a \"retroactive payment adjustment\" under \u00a7 (t)(2)(E) for certain services rendered by rural hospitals in 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 13-15 (quoting Medicare Program,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C960\">\n    71 Fed.

And HHS's attempts to distinguish away the 2006 adjustment are unconvincing: it explains that it had made the rural-hospital adjustment prospectively the previous year, and that the retroactive adjustment applied to only a small sub-class of rural hospitals that were mistakenly excluded from the prospective adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 12-14. But\n   if HHS can correct its own administrative error by means of a retroactive adjustment, surely it can comply with a congressionally-mandated effective date by means of a retroactive adjustment. Certainly, HHS has not explained why a retroactive adjustment for rural hospitals was compatible with budget neutrality, while one for cancer hospitals would not be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    Prospective Nature of OPPS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Similarly, HHS argues that the nature of OPPS as a system of payments based on prospectively-set rates counsels against retroactive application of the adjustment. Def.'s Reply at 8. The Court finds this no more persuasive than HHS's argument about budget neutrality because it does not demonstrate silence or ambiguity that calls into question the effective date set forth in the statute. Prospective rates are the main feature, but not the only feature, of OPPS. For example, the TOPS payments that the cancer hospitals receive are not set prospectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.D. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750476,3766550\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/685/\">\n    650 F.3d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689 (D.C. Cir. 2011). And neither is the particular adjustment at issue in this case: it is finalized on an aggregate basis at cost report settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   76 Fed. Reg. at 74,204. Given that retroactive payments are a well-known component of OPPS, the generally prospective nature of the system provides no reason to doubt that Congress meant what it said in Section 3138: the adjustment must be effective for services furnished in the 2011 calendar year, without qualification about the timing of the adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For that reason, HHS misses the mark when it refers to the D.C. Circuit's warnings against judicial meddling in Medicare generally-and prospective payment systems in particular-where retroactive payments threaten to wreak \"havoc\" on HHS's ability to administer the program.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Br. at 24-25 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722607,9056335\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/103/\">\n    357 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   112 ). The Court takes these concerns to heart. But in this case it is Congress, not the Court, that is doing the meddling: Congress required HHS to make a specific adjustment with a set effective date, and HHS may fairly be held to that duty. And for the reasons explained above, Moffitt's challenge is fit for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, the fact that this case concerns only a single retroactive adjustment distinguishes it from three prior district-court cases on which HHS relies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sw.

Each of these cases concerned HHS's initial implementation of prospective payment systems Congress mandated for Medicare. OPPS-the prospective payment system for outpatient services that is at issue in this case-is one such system. In each case, Congress required the existing payment system to end, and the prospective payment system to begin, for services rendered starting on a fixed date. And in each case, HHS failed to promulgate the prospective payment system on time. In that context, it may well have been plausible to conclude that Congress did not intend the new payment systems-which necessarily included prospective components-to apply retroactively\n   <em>\n    in their entirety\n   </em>\n   , and as such, it may have been reasonable for HHS to fill the gap between the expiration of the old system and the implementation of the new system. This case, by contrast, concerns a single adjustment that HHS itself has decided to calculate and apply at cost report settlement, not by adjustments to the prospective payment rates. HHS has not shown that such a retroactive adjustment would be incompatible with the generally prospective nature of OPPS, such that it\n   would call into question Congress's clear command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Presumption Against Retroactivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   HHS also appeals to the presumption against retroactivity, which provides that \"the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Petrochem. &amp; Refiners Ass'n v.
