Specifically, Gateway and Good Times claim that Plaintiff reaches different conclusions as to when ownership of the goods transferred to Good Times, where \"both statements are based on Complaints that mirror the same language.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203804\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1288/#p1296\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (contrasting conclusions drawn by Plaintiff in its response in Maverick, Court No. 17-00174,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp.

Gateway and Good Times' argument provides a false comparison. Although there is similarity in parties and issues between the present action and Maverick, Court No. 17-00174, they are separate cases. The arguments made by the plaintiff in Maverick, Court No. 17-00174 stand on their own and do not influence the court's opinion in the present action. Further, Plaintiff's argument in the present action that Good Times maintained an ownership interest in the subject merchandise is broader than Gateway and Good Times represent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. at 7-12. Plaintiff claims that Gateway and Good Times, through their Agreement, set up a scheme to underpay FET on the subject merchandise, and present the example Gateway and Good Times quote as representative of how the scheme operated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. at 7-8;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 12-21.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Gateway and Good Times also argue that the paperwork associated with the importation of the subject merchandise into the United States does not refer to Good Times as the consignee, or in some cases, at all.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Joint Reply at 12-15;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Attachments [to Pl.'s Resp.]: # 1 Exhibit A-sample entry documents at Exs. 1-5, Jan. 19, 2018, ECF No. 32-1. Arguments focusing on whose name was printed on the paperwork are unpersuasive on a motion to dismiss when Plaintiff's claim is that Gateway and Good Times constructed a scheme to import subject merchandise into the United States by which the FET was underreported. To support its allegation of a scheme, Plaintiff looks at the transactions as a whole, and provides examples of how the Agreement between Gateway and Good Times put Good Times in a position where it controlled the disposition of the subject merchandise prior to importation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 12-21, 23-24;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. at 7-11, 14-15. Therefore, items such as entry paperwork were all created in furtherance of the scheme and culminated in Gateway and Good Times making false representations to CBP when the subject merchandise was entered.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. at 7-11. Another variation of Gateway and Good Times' paperwork argument is that Plaintiff has not identified any specific documents that demonstrate that either Gateway or Good Times made materially false statement(s) or omission(s) to CBP.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gateway Mot. Dismiss at 8, 9-10; Good Times Mot. Dismiss at 9-11.

However, in its complaint, Plaintiff alleges that \"Gateway acted as a pass-through entity for Good Times's purchases of [the subject merchandise] from Rolida[,]\" Compl. at \u00b6 16, that \"the business relationship between Gateway and Good Times was not that of a buyer and seller in an arm's length transaction[,]\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 17, and that Good Times financed all transactions relating to the importation of the subject merchandise.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Therefore, Plaintiff's allegations in its complaint sufficiently support a theory that the relationship between Gateway and Good Times was that of agent and principal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In the joint reply, Gateway and Good Times also argue that this case should be dismissed with prejudice as to Good Times because Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts demonstrating that FET liability transferred from Gateway to Good Times.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Joint Reply at 5-6. Gateway and Good Times argue that transfer of FET liability occurs only pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205703\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205703\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
