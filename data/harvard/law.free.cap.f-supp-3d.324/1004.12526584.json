The underlying dispute arises out a the 2004 sale of a boat hoist by Defendant Marine Travel Lift (MTI) to Plaintiff Societe dAmenagement et de Gestion de lAbri Nautique (Sagan) at its facility in Saint-Marie-La-Mere, France. Sagan filed suit in a French court and ultimately obtained a judgment against MTI. While MTI seeks to re-litigate the dispute in this court, Sagan has filed a motion for summary judgment seeking recognition of the judgment it has already obtained.

The French Judgment Is Final\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There is no dispute that this matter was fully litigated in France, and Sagan obtained a final judgment in its favor against MTI from the Court of Appeal of Versailles. Although MTI suggests that a factual dispute exists as to \"whether the French decision constitutes a judgment that can be enforced in this Court,\" MTI Br. in Opp'n, ECF No. 28 at 15, MTI does not dispute that the Versailles Court of Appeals issued a decision finding MTI liable and awarding Sagan damages, attorneys' fees and costs. MTI Resp. to PPFOF, ECF No. 29, \u00b6\u00b6 24-28. Nor does MTI dispute that it did not appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals to the French Supreme Court. It thus follows that the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeals is a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   MTI also suggests that it would be irregular for an appellate decision to be considered a judgment within the United States. While it may be unusual for an appellate court in the United States to issue a judgment, the decision in question was not issued by a United States appellate court; instead, it was issued by an appellate court in France. MTI offers no evidence or argument that it is irregular for appellate courts in France to issue judgments. The appellate courts in France routinely reexamine the entire case and partake in fact-finding. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer,\n   <em>\n    France,\n   </em>\n   ENCYCLOPEDIA OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION \u00a7 A1.43 (2015). It is not irregular for a court that engages in fact-finding to issue a judgment. Mere differences in legal systems are not sufficient, standing alone, to support a refusal to recognize a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under French law, a judgment by the trial court, like the Chartres Court, becomes definitive and enforceable if no appeal is lodged; if an appeal is lodged, the judgment is stayed pending the appellate court decision. Deringer,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A11.2. In the case of an appellate court decision, an appeal to the supreme court does not stay the judgment: \"As soon as an arr\u00eat\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of a cour d'appel [court of appeals] is rendered and notified, it must be executed by the losing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A11.3. Additionally, the language of the Versailles Judgment indicates that it is not only a decision explaining the Versailles Court's rationale, but it is also \"a decision that is final and non-appealable\" and orders damages that MTI must pay Sagan. Court of Appeals of Versailles Op. (English translation), ECF No. 24-4 at 10-11. MTI did not appeal this decision, and even if it had, MTI was required to execute the judgment upon its issuance. I therefore conclude that the Versailles Judgment is a final and enforceable judgment under French law, and turn to the central question of whether it is entitled to recognition under Wisconsin law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Recognition of Foreign Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal and state court judgments within the United States are enforced state-to-state pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution, art. 4, \u00a7 1, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).

When no such treaty exists, however, as is the situation between France and the United States, the courts turn to \"the comity of nations,\" which the Court described as \"the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/\">\n    at 163-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/\">\n    16 S.Ct. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For this reason, and because both parties agree that Wisconsin courts would turn to the Restatement for guidance, MTI Br. in Opp'n at 18, I turn to it as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 482 of the Restatement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) A court in the United States may not recognize a judgment of the court of a foreign state if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (a) the judgment was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with due process of law; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b) the court that rendered the judgment did not have jurisdiction over the defendant in accordance with the law of the rendering state ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   RESTATEMENT (THIRD) ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 482. MTI argues the Versailles Judgment should not be recognized because the legal system is not comparable, as there is no jury, no similar discovery process and no live testimony. These differences, however, do not mean that France's legal system does not provide impartial tribunals or is incompatible with due process of law.\n   <em>\n    Hilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/\">\n    159 U.S. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699846\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/113/\">\n    16 S.Ct. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e are not prepared to hold that the fact that the procedure in these respects differed from that of our own courts is, of itself, a sufficient ground for impeaching the foreign judgment.\"). Furthermore, MTI does not challenge the Chartes Court's or the Versailles Court's jurisdiction over it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the records from both courts indicate that MTI appeared and was represented by counsel in both proceedings. As a result,\n   neither condition requiring non-recognition under the Restatement applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even if denial of recognition is not mandatory, the Restatement provides that a court nevertheless need not recognize a foreign judgment under certain circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) A court in the United States need not recognize a judgment of the court of a foreign state if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a) the court that rendered the judgment did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) the defendant did not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time for him to defend;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (c) the judgment was obtained by fraud;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (d) the cause of action on which the judgment was based, or the judgment itself, is repugnant to the public policy of the United States or the State where recognition is sought;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (e) the judgment conflicts with another final judgment that is entitled to recognition; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (f) the proceeding in the foreign court was contrary to an agreement between the parties to submit the controversy on which the judgment is based to another forum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   RESTATEMENT (THIRD) ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\u00a7 482.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   MTI contends that the Versailles Judgment need not be recognized under subsection (d) because it violates the public policy of Wisconsin. Its argument in support of this contention, however, is essentially over the merits of the decision rendered and not the policies underlying the law it applied. MTI argues that the decision of the Versailles Court of Appeals is contrary to Wisconsin's public policy because it requires MTI to pay Sagan an amount nearly equal to the price it paid MTI for the hoist when Sagan purchased it from CEI in 2004, even though Sagan is still using the hoist. MTI Br. in Opp'n at 15. In other words, MTI contends that the French court erred in its determination that the hoist was defective and in calculating the damages Sagan sustained. But whether the French court erred is not the issue before this court; the issue is whether the French court's judgment, erroneous or not, is entitled to recognition under Wisconsin law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   MTI argues that the Versailles Judgment should not be recognized because it contravenes Wisconsin public policy, but it fails to state what public policy the judgment contravenes. MTI does not allege that France's policy of awarding the purchaser of equipment, which is shown to have had a latent defect, damages in the amount of money needed to repair the defect is against the public policy of Wisconsin. Nor does MTI argue it was prevented from offering evidence in its own defense against Sagan's allegations that its equipment was defective or in support of its limited warranty defense. Its argument is that the French court should have ruled in its favor. That is not a public policy argument. It is instead an effort to relitigate its dispute with Sagan in this court. This is precisely what the recognition of foreign judgments is intended to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   MTI also cites\n   <em>\n    In re Steffke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    65 Wis. 2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    222 N.W.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), to support its argument that the Versailles Judgment is against Wisconsin public policy. In\n   <em>\n    Steffke\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether a Mexican divorce decree issued to a Wisconsin married couple was valid so as to render the wife's subsequent marriage invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    222 N.W.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without discussing any of the other factors generally considered by courts in determining whether a foreign judgment should be recognized, the Wisconsin Supreme Court simply noted that the Mexican divorce decree was contrary to two Wisconsin statutes, including a statute that declared that a Wisconsin resident\n   may not go into another state, territory or country for the purposes of obtaining a divorce he or she would be unable to obtain in Wisconsin.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    222 N.W.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then noted the facts clearly indicated the parties went to Mexico to circumvent Wisconsin law and obtain a divorce, which contradicted explicit Wisconsin law and public policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    222 N.W.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under these circumstances, the court held that the Mexican decree would not be recognized.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668940\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/65/199/\">\n    222 N.W.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Steffke\n   </em>\n   has no applicability here. Wisconsin does not have any statutes prohibiting its residents from selling products in other countries. MTI did not violate Wisconsin law in selling a boat hoist to Sagan, nor did Sagan violate any Wisconsin law in purchasing it. Of course, Wisconsin has a strong interest in seeing that its citizens are treated fairly, but again, MTI does not argue that the claims asserted against it were based upon laws that were contrary to the public policy of Wisconsin. The public policy exception is directed to \"claims perceived to be contrary to fundamental notions of decency and justice.\" RESTATEMENT (THIRD) ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 482, cmt. f. According to the Restatement, \"few judgments fall in the category of judgments that need not be recognized because they violate the public policy of the forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 482, reporter's note 1. Sagan's claims against MTI do not fit the public policy exception for recognizing foreign judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   MTI also argues that even if the judgment against it is not entirely against Wisconsin's public policy, the award of attorneys' fees and interest is. While the French court's practice of awarding attorneys' fees may be different than the rule in Wisconsin and the United States in general, it is not an unreasonable rule to adopt and clearly does not violate fundamental rules of decency and justice. Likewise, the awarding of interest from the date of loss, as opposed to the date the damages are liquidated, is different than the rule in this state. But that does not make it against Wisconsin public policy. These differences with French law are not grounds for refusing recognition of a French judgment lawfully issued to resolve a dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Lastly, MTI suggests that the Versailles Judgment should not be recognized because of Sagan's misconduct and even fraud. MTI Br. in Opp'n at 27-29. MTI contends that Sagan \"made questionable representations during the French proceedings that could not be challenged there,\" and that its representations \"may have been fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. MTI also questions Sagan's refusal to accept its settlement offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"The defense of fraud in securing a foreign judgment as a basis for denying recognition to that judgment traditionally was limited in the United States to 'extrinsic fraud,'\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , fraudulent action by the prevailing party that deprived the losing party of adequate opportunity to present its case to the court.\" RESTATEMENT (THIRD) ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 482, cmt. e. Allegations of intrinsic fraud, on the other hand, such as that the judgment was based on perjured testimony or falsified documents, will not normally defeat recognition since they can be challenged in the proceeding that results in the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MTI's vague allegations suggest at most intrinsic fraud and, thus, are not sufficient to avoid recognition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, regardless of the nature of the allegations, fraud has not been pled by MTI. In a companion case to\n   <em>\n    Hilton,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court explained: \"To warrant the impeaching of a foreign judgment because [it was] procured by fraud, fraud must be distinctly alleged and charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Ritchie v. McMullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5700721\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/235/#p242\">\n    159 U.S. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5700721\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/235/#p242\">\n    16 S.Ct. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5700721\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/159/235/#p242\">\n    40 L.Ed. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1895). MTI did not plead fraud as a defense in this proceeding in either its original answer or its answer\n   to the amended complaint. ECF No. 6, 12. Because MTI failed to assert fraud as an affirmative defense, it is barred from doing so now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c). Moreover, even if it had pled fraud, its allegations must meet the heightened pleading requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).
